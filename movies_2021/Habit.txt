He helped form Bush in 1992; on the band's separation in 2002, he became the lead singer and guitarist forInstituteand later began a solo career. He resumed his role in Bush when the band reunited in 2010. In 2013, he received the British Academy'sIvor Novello Awardfor International Achievement.[3]
Rossdale was born inMarylebone, London, England, the son of Barbara Stephan (néeBowie) and Douglas Rossdale, a doctor. His mother was born in Scotland, whereas his father was ofRussian Jewishdescent, the family's surname originally being Rosenthal.[4][5]Rossdale was unable to speak until the age of four,[6]and his parents divorced when he was 11 years old.[7]At around this time, Rossdale became interested in the then-current 1970s Britishpunk rockphenomenon through his elder sister, Lorraine; Rossdale said in 1999: "everything I learned was from trying to hang out with [Lorraine's] friends. I was 12 when [punk] happened. At the top of our road was this record shop and I was always going in and getting one single at a time. That's why I've gotX-Ray Spexand theBuzzcocks, practically the first edition of everything."[8]TheSex Pistolswere also an influence on Rossdale at the time, with Rossdale tellingAmerican Songwriterin 2021 that they "changed his life" and that he "fell in love" with them "when I was 11 or 12 years old", having seen them "swearing atBill Grundyon the TV."[9]
Beginning in 1979, Rossdale was educated at the independentWestminster School. Rossdale disliked his time at the school, as he was the target ofbullying.[10]
During the 1980s,[11]Rossdale formed apopband called Midnight with Sacha Puttnam.[11][12]Despite touring as far afield as Ireland and enjoying support slots for artists includingBig CountryandCyndi Lauper,[8]his band saw little success after releasing two singles.[11][12]
Rossdale later became a member of the group The Little Dukes.[8]According to Alex Tate, the Little Dukes' music was contrary to Rossdale's musical preferences at the time.[8]After travelling to Los Angeles and New York City with the hope of being signed to a record label,[8]and crossing paths with a future Bush manager,[8]the band broke up in autumn 1991.[8]
In 1992, Rossdale established thegrungeband Bush,[8]initially known as Future Primitive,[8]as its vocalist and rhythm guitarist after first befriending lead guitaristNigel Pulsfordin November 1991.[1][8]Their debut album,Sixteen Stone(1994), was a huge commercial success.[13]
Bush's follow-up albums includeRazorblade Suitcase,Deconstructed,The Science of Things, andGolden State. Each had commercial success, making Bush one of the best-selling rock groups of the 1990s.[14]Although the band reached superstar status in the US, they failed to have much impact in the UK.[15]The main exception to this was the UK chart success of the albumRazorblade Suitcase(number 4) and its single "Swallowed" (number 7). A change in record labels and management did not bode well for the band, who disbanded in 2002.[16]
On 21 June 2010, it was announced that Bush would return and planned to release a new album.The Sea of Memorieswas released on 13 September 2011.[16]Bush have since released four more albums:Man on the Runin 2014,Black and White Rainbowsin 2017,The Kingdomin 2020, andThe Art of Survivalin 2022.

In an interview published in November 2008, Rossdale noted that the Institute record was, "for all intents and purposes, a solo record. It was just a bad marketing decision to call it something else".[18]Institute broke up in 2006, after one album.[citation needed]
Rossdale's single, "Can't Stop the World", was the introduction theme toFox's programme,Drive.[citation needed]In 2007, he covered John Lennon's "Mind Games" for the albumInstant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur.[citation needed]Rossdale's first solo record, entitledWanderlust, was released 3 June 2008.[19]Gwen Stefani, Rossdale's then-wife, sang background vocals on the track "Can't Stop The World", with other vocalists on the album includingShirley Manson,Katy PerryandDave Stewart.[20]Bush and Institute guitaristChris Traynoralso played on the album.

Rossdale mounted a full-scale solo tour in Spring 2009.[21]Of the album's title, Rossdale said, "I just liked it because it's kind of sexy enough, it's powerful, it's one word.
