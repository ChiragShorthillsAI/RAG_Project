By January 2016, Aibel and Berger had been hired to write the film, and by April 2018, Hill was onboard as director. It is the first film in the franchise to be fully animated in stylizedcomputer-generated imagery(as opposed to being entirelyanimated in 2Dlike the first film, or mixing 2D and CGI animation together like in the second film).Hans Zimmercomposed the film's musical score.
The film was produced byParamount Animation,Nickelodeon Movies, andUnited Plankton Pictures, with animation provided byMikros Image. Originally slated for a worldwide theatrical release byParamount Pictures, plans were changed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic. The film was released theatrically in Canada on August 14, 2020, and digitally onNetflixin other territories on November 5, 2020.

InBikini Bottom,Planktonworks on a new plan to steal theKrabby Pattyformula whileKarenargues thatSpongeBobis actually responsible for all his previous failures and notMr. Krabs. Meanwhile, inAtlantic City, selfish ruler KingPoseidonuses up all theslimefrom his latest sea snail, which is necessary to maintain his appearance. Poseidon decrees the obtaining of a new snail, and Plankton kidnaps SpongeBob's pet snailGaryso that SpongeBob will no longer interfere with his plans. The next morning, SpongeBob learns fromPatrickthat Gary was taken to Atlantic City. As part of his plan, Plankton offers Otto, a robot built bySandy, to take them to the city with the hopes that they never return. Without SpongeBob cooking Krabby Patties, the Krusty Krab's enraged customers trash the restaurant despite Mr. Krabs andSquidward's efforts to stop them.
Otto drives SpongeBob and Patrick to an oldWesterntown where they meet a tumbleweed spirit named Sage. He reveals to SpongeBob and Patrick that they are dreaming, and must overcome a special mission to continue their search, giving them a "Challenge Coin" that will grant them bravery. They enter a tavern haunted by ghostly zombie pirates and decide to free their souls from the evil spirit "El Diablo". Diablo traps the duo, but is accidentally disintegrated by them, freeing the pirates' souls as SpongeBob and Patrick are woken up by Otto.
Now accompanied by Sage, SpongeBob discovers that as soon as Gary's slime runs out, Poseidon will have him enslaved with the rest of his previous snails. Arriving at Atlantic City, Sage warns the pair not to be distracted by the city's attractions, but they ignore his warnings. After a fun-filled night, SpongeBob and Patrick discover that they have lost the "Challenge Coin" that allowed them to be brave, but they nonetheless enter Poseidon's palace. When they try to take Gary, both are arrested and imprisoned in the dungeon.
Back in Bikini Bottom, Plankton arrives at the Krusty Krab, in which Mr. Krabs willingly gives him the formula, feeling depressed without SpongeBob, causing Plankton to feel unsatisfied. Later, upon hearing the news that SpongeBob and Patrick will be executed in a luxury show in Poseidon's Palace, Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Sandy, and a repentant Plankton decide to save them.
In prison, Sage reveals to SpongeBob and Patrick that the "Challenge Coin" never had powers and that the bravery came from themselves. Before SpongeBob and Patrick can be executed, Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Plankton, and Sandy burst into the show to testify in favor of SpongeBob. Along with Patrick, each recounts an experience they had with SpongeBobat a summer camp, earning the audience's gratitude. Afterwards, the group perform a musical number to distract Poseidon and take Gary. Poseidon realizes the distraction and orders his guards to capture the group. SpongeBob and his friends manage to escape the guards and head towards the exit, but are once again cornered when Otto leaves them behind.
Poseidon offers to drop charges against the group on the condition that SpongeBob leaves Gary with him. SpongeBob refuses, arguing that his friends decided to rescue him even if they risked death. When Poseidon finds out that he has no friends and reveals that he needs the slime for his appearance, SpongeBob offers to be his friend. Poseidon removes all his arrangements and returns to his true appearance; everyone accepts his look, and Poseidon allows SpongeBob to take Gary back home. He also releases all his enslaved snails to accompany them, and Bikini Bottom is converted into a "sea snail refuge".

Initially, Paramount Animation did not have its own opening logo. Its first six features (and new features starting withTransformers One) just used the standard Paramount logo. On September 19, 2019, Paramount Animation introduced a new animated logo featuring a character nicknamed "Star Skipper".[64]When Mireille Soria came to Paramount Animation, one of the first goals set by Jim Gianopulos was to make a logo for the division. The crew wanted to put a female character in the logo because the studio's team is mostly female, and according to Soria, it captures "the magic" of the division. The logo and the character of Star Skipper were designed byCaptain Underpants: The First Epic Movielead visual development artist and art director Christopher Zibach and animated by ATK PLN andReel FX Creative Studios.[64]This logo debuted in front ofThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Runin 2020.

Pictures Animation,Illumination, andSony Pictures Animation, Paramount Animation outsources its animation production to other animation studios such as Mikros Image, Reel FX,[65]andIndustrial Light & Magic(Transformers One).Rumblewas developed outside of Paramount Animation by Reel FX, but the studio acquired the rights to the film and co-produced it.[66][67]
Like20th Century Animationwith animated films under20th Century Studios, the studio also acts as somewhat of a distribution label for animated films that are made under or acquired byParamount Pictures. The earliest case of this would be the aborted deal with Locksmith Animation.[25]Additionally,Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank, originally expected to be distributed byOpen Road FilmsandSTX Entertainment, was acquired by Paramount to be distributed under Paramount Animation, later being distributed  under Nickelodeon Movies.[5]
Paramount Animation does not have an in-house animation style. According to Mireille Soria, each film has their own unique style created by the filmmakers, which would be helped by outsourcing animation to different vendors.[68]
When Ramsey Ann Naito took charge of Paramount Animation in September 2021, she brought over the culture of theNickelodeon Animation Studio, which she describes as "artist-driven" and "creative". Both companies are now united under one team, in a move different from Disney and Universal's animation studios (Walt Disney Animation StudiosandPixarpost-Lasseterfor the former andIlluminationandDreamWorksfor the latter).[69]
All films listed are distributed byParamount Picturesunless noted otherwise.

Nickelodeon Movies Inc.[1]is an Americanfilm productioncompany based inLos Angeles, Californiaand owned byParamount Global. Originally founded in 1995, it serves as both the film production arm of the American children's networkNickelodeonand the family film distribution label ofParamount Pictures.
The division has earned numerous accolades including twoAcademy Awards, aGolden Globe Award, over 13Saturn Awardsnominations, aPeople's Choice Awardand four in-house honors via theNickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. Since its launch, over 40 feature films have been produced for theatrical release and starting in October 2021, the studio has been producing films for streaming onParamount+andNetflix.
In 1993, Nickelodeon agreed to a two-year contract with20th Century Foxto make feature films. The joint venture would mostly produce new material, though a Nickelodeon executive did not rule out the possibility of making films based onThe Ren & Stimpy Show,RugratsandDoug.[2]None of the movies were produced due to the 1994 acquisition of Paramount Pictures by Nickelodeon's parent company,Viacom, and they would distribute the movies instead. With the creative differences withJohn Kricfalusi, the creator ofRen & Stimpyand an inability to market that property in a family-friendly manner instead of a "cynical and gross humor" scuttled the film.[3][4]However, Paramount and Viacom would go forward and start development onThe Rugrats Moviea year after the acquisition.
The Nickelodeon version of theDougfilm was not made due to the acquisition of the show's production studio,Jumbo Pictures, byThe Walt Disney Companyin 1996. With this, the show moved to Disney'sABCnetwork and new seasons aired as a part of its programming blockDisney's One Saturday MorningasDisney's Doug. In 1999,Walt Disney Picturesreleased a film finale to the series,Doug's 1st Movie.

One of authorDaniel Handler's, Lemony Snicket's real name, favorite candidates wasGuy Maddin. In June 2002,Barry Sonnenfeldwas hired to direct. He was chosen because he had previously collaborated with Rudin and because of hisblack comedydirecting style as seen in his filmsThe Addams Family,Addams Family ValuesandGet Shorty.[15]Sonnenfeld referred to theUnfortunate Eventsbooks as his favorite children's stories.[16]The director hired Handler to write the script[17]with the intention of makingLemony Snicketas a musical, and castJim Carreyas Count Olaf in September 2002.[17]Sonnenfeld eventually left over budget concerns in January 2003 and director Brad Silberling took over.This filmwas released on December 17, 2004, a month afterThe SpongeBob SquarePants Moviewas released, and received positive reviews despite not making back its budget.

Danny Trejo was born on May 16, 1944, inMaywood, California.[4][5][6]He was raised onTemple Streetin theEcho Parkneighborhood of Los Angeles, California, the son ofMexican-Americanparents.[7][8][9]He is the son of Delores Rivera King[10]and Dionisio "Dan" Trejo (1922–1981),[11]a construction worker. Trejo was the result of an extramarital affair; Delores's husband was away fighting inWorld War II.[12]His parents met at a dance hall in Highland Park, Los Angeles in 1943.[13]He had a maternal half-sister, Dyhan, but saw neither her nor Delores from 1949 until 1965; his father banned his mother from seeing him after Trejo sprained his arm in her care.[12]
Trejo was oftenabusedby his father. Shortly after his birth, Trejo and his family briefly lived inSan Antonio, Texas; they fled Los Angeles because Dionisio was wanted by police for stabbing another man. After a year, they returned to Los Angeles and Trejo's father turned himself in.[13]By 1949, Trejo shared a room with his cousins at their grandmother's house.[14]His stepmother was Alice Mendias, "his only source of comfort" when he lived with his father.[15][16][17]
Trejo was usingmarijuana,heroin, andcocaineby ages 8, 12, and 18, respectively.[18][19][20]Trejo's uncle Gilbert introduced him to all three and was responsible for Trejo overdosing on his first heroin fix.[13]When he was 13, he moved to the majority Hispanic neighborhood ofPacoima, Los Angeles, where he said he did not experience racism growing up. Years later, he purchased his childhood home and often lived in it.[21]
At age seven, Trejo participated in his first drug deal.[22]He was first arrested at the age of 10,[23]but experienced his first incarceration at Eastlake Juvenile Hall in 1956.[23]
Throughout the 1960s, Trejo's life consisted predominantly of intermittent jail stints in theCalifornia prison system.[23][24]The accounts of his prison chronology, though, are notably conflicting; by one account, his final term in custody is said to have ended in 1972.[9]However, Trejo did time in various juvenile offenders' camps,[25]including three years at Camp Glenn Rockey,San Dimas, for maiming a sailor (stabbing him in the face with broken glass),[26][27]followed by numerous California prisons between 1959 and 1969; "I was in San Quentin, Folsom, Soledad, Vacaville, Susanville, Sierra".[18]
While doing a stint inLos Angeles Countyjail in 1961, he metCharles Manson, whom he described as a "dirty, greasy, scrawny white boy" who was allegedly a talentedhypnotist.[28]
Trejo arrived atSan Quentin State Prisonin 1966, and his heroin use was exacerbated shortly thereafter.[29]He was a debt collector and drug dealer, often participating in or witnessing acts of serious violence, including murder.[30][31]Simultaneously while  imprisoned, Trejo focused on boxing[29]and became a champion in San Quentin'slightweightandwelterweightdivisions.[9]
Regarding himself, Trejo has suggested his physical appearance contributed to his constantly getting into trouble.[18][32]In 1968, a prison riot broke out duringCinco De Mayoat Soledad. From that fracas, Trejo ended up in solitary confinement, facing capital charges and, potentially, the death penalty, after hitting a guard with a rock.  While in solitary, Trejo found faith[33][11]and became a member of a12-step program, having first attended one "by accident" aged 15.  He successfully overcame his drug addictions, recalling in 2011 that he had been sober for the previous 42 years. Also while incarcerated, he earned his high-school diploma.[34][18]
In July 1969, Trejo was released from custody and returned to Pacoima, Los Angeles, having served five years of a 10-year prison sentence.[35][11]
Prior to his film career, Trejo worked as a labor foreman for developer Saul Pick, and contributed toward the construction of theCinerama Dome.[36]He was also a gardener, salesperson, part owner of a lawn care company, and became a substance abuse counselor since 1973.[37][38][39]
Trejo worked with Western Pacific Med Corp in the 1980s, assisting them with the establishing and operating of sober living houses within theSan Fernando Valley.[41]He met a "good looking tattooed kid" during a meeting in one such house, who explained that he worked as a film extra and was paid $50 per day to stand there. Intrigued, Trejo considered becoming a film extra, initially due to the easy money and publicity it could afford his work with Western Pacific Med Corp. Trejo signed with an agent and would hand out his details while working on film sets, in the hopes of finding more opportunities to help those in need. Late one night, Trejo received a call from a teenaged patient, asking for his assistance in dealing with cocaine problems on the set ofRunaway Train(1985).[42][9][43]
While there, Trejo was offered a job as an extra in the film's prison scenes.Edward Bunker, a former convict turned published crime author who was writing the screenplay for the film, recognized Trejo from their time together at San Quentin.[9][43]Remembering Trejo's boxing skills, Bunker played a pivotal role in securing Trejo asEric Roberts' personal trainer and boxing advisor. Trejo was paid between $320 and $350 per day. Trejo recalled: "When I got my first paycheck, I thought they made a mistake!"[44][45]Bunker also convinced directorAndrei Konchalovskyto offer Trejo a small acting role, asserting that Trejo's personal experiences of incarceration would provide authenticity to the prison drama.[46]Following his acting debut, Trejo was oblivious to being typecast as a prisoner in similar roles for years to follow; "I [did not] know I was being stereotyped. I just knew I was working."[47]
Penitentiary IIIwas his first billed role. While filming he met Anthony Gambino of theGambino crime family; Gambino allegedly had financial interests invested and was there to meet the leading man,Leon Isaac Kennedy. Trejo was paid $120 cash each day, but the project often went into overtime; "We were stacked with cash."[48]On a good month, Trejo was taking home as much as $700 by 1989 from being an extra alone; yet, people often assumed he was far wealthier after a few appearances on television. Trejo says this worked to his advantage as a drug counselor, though, because clients would recognize him as an actor, therefore appreciating his presence and the humility of his work all the more.[49]
Trejo had made a dozen films by 1990, includingDeath Wish 4: The Crackdown, andMarked for Death. He enjoyed the making ofGuns,[50]yet allegesErik Estradatook issue with the cast and crew being more familiar with Trejo than himself. Trejo says Estrada's ego got the better of him; he believes Estrada arranged for Trejo and a number of others to fly coach instead of first class on the way to Hawaii for filming.[51]
In 1991,Edward James Olmosoriginally offered him the role of Pedro Santana inAmerican Me.[52]Trejo was unimpressed by the script and his initial meeting with Olmos. Trejo claims rumors began circulating within theMexican Mafiathat the script was taking narrative liberties. Before Trejo had the chance to attend a second meeting with Olmos, he received a call fromJoe "Pegleg" Morgan, the then-don of the Mexican Mafia; Morgan approved of his choosing a role inBlood In, Blood Outinstead ofAmerican Me.[53]In 2021, Trejo stated that he believes Olmos has yet to accept him as a serious actor.[47]
Of his experiences ofBlood In, Blood Out, Trejo recalls feeling uncomfortable around many of the other actors during rehearsals, as they were more established.[54]During production at San Quentin, Trejo often had flashbacks to his time there; filming scenes in C550, his former cell, merely exacerbated such feelings.[55]Though his previous works brought him opportunities, Trejo creditsBlood In, Blood Outas having brought him "legitimate, worldwide fame."[56]
Trejo found a new talent agent with the help ofRaymond Cruz. He was first cast in an episode ofBaywatch, followed by a part in 1993'sLast Light,Kiefer Sutherland's directorial debut.[57]
Heatwent through two script revisions while Trejo read for the part. He ultimately secured the role, which reunited him withMichael Mann, who had directed him in the television miniseriesDrug Wars: The Camarena Storya few years prior. Mann initially mistook Trejo for his uncle Gilbert; he found the resemblance uncanny, having met Gilbert while shootingThe Jericho Mileat Folsom in the late 1970s; production required the co-operation of the inmates, and Gilbert happened to be one of the shot-callers. Trejo's character in the film was initially called 'Vince' but renamed 'Trejo' in honor of Gilbert.  Filming could be upward of 17 hours per day, but Trejo said he was grateful for how much he learned; "watchingDe Niro,Kilmer, andVoight, I learned a lot about how they saved [their performances] for when it mattered." He recalls being mentored by Robert De Niro, who was a patient and instructive scene partner. Trejo and De Niro improvised the former's death scene.[58]
In 1996, Trejo was cast in the French productionLe Jaguar(which was French for The Jaguar) and reunited with Voight forAnaconda, both of which were filmed in Manaus, Brazil. When production forAnacondamoved to Venezuela, Trejo would go out socializing on his days off. The producers were worried given a possible coup d'état had made parts of the country unsafe to travel; a group of teenagers brandished AK47's on one occasion, demanding Trejo's combat boots. Because of this, Trejo says he negotiated a higher salary to remain within the confines of his hotel.[59]
Trejo described 1997'sCon Airas a "macho fest from the start" and the cast were often pulling pranks on one another. He remembersNicolas Cageas being "cool as hell" andJohn Cusackas a "kickboxing badass". Trejo met many of his longtime friends on set, including:John Malkovich,Ving Rhames,Steve Buscemi, andDave Chappelle.[60]
After concludingAnimal Factoryin 1999, he contractedHepatitis Cand "had to drag [his] ass" from Canada to Austin, Texas, to begin filming ofSpy Kidsin 2000.Spy Kidsmarked Trejo's debut as the fictional characterIsador "Machete" Cortez. Having already madeDesperadoandFrom Dusk till Dawntogether, the opportunity to collaborate withRobert Rodriguez,Antonio Banderas, andCheech Marinonce again "felt like [a] family reunion."[61]Spy Kidsprovided Trejo with worldwide recognition and for the first time he was "instantly recognizable" among children around the globe.[62]
By the time ofBubble Boyin 2001, his illness had progressed to the point that much of the cast had noticed his weight loss; Trejo states that his past drug use had caught up with him. He described himself as having been pale and weak throughout production, and pre-occupied with keeping his diagnosis a secret within Hollywood for fear of reprisal. Trejo was "out of it" and struggling to remember his lines due to prescription medication. By the timeSpy Kidspremiered in September 2002, Trejo had fully recovered.[61][62]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
