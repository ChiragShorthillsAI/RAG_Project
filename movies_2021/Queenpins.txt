Queenpinswas released in a limited theatrical release viaCinemarkin the United States on September 10, 2021, bySTXfilmsand in the United States onParamount+on September 30, 2021. The film received mixed reviews from critics.
The film is based on the story of Robin Ramirez, Amiko (Amy) Fountain, and Marilyn Johnson who were arrested by the Phoenix Police in 2012. The police found more than $25 million of fake coupons in Ramirez's house and seized more than $2 million worth of assets including 22 firearms, 21 vehicles, and a 40-foot boat.[2]
Dejected and frustrated suburban housewife Connie Kaminski, a three-time gold medal-winning formerOlympicracewalker, has followed the conventional life path set for her by society ever since she was young. Her sacrifices have never been appreciated and she has been overlooked by her husband Rick, anIRSsenior audit specialist, her loved ones, and the rest of society.
Alienated by her uninspiring existence being unemployed and having suffered a miscarriage after a few attempts to conceive a child viain vitro fertilization, Connie commiserates with her best friend Joanna "JoJo" Johnson, who has been unable to secure proper employment since having her identity stolen and thus lives with her mother Josephine. JoJo attempts to generate revenue by making YouTube videos while being amorously pursued by the local mailman, Earl.
After a particularly frustrating day, Connie writes a complaint letter to General Mills about the Wheaties she ate being stale. Soon, she receives acouponfor a free box of cereal. Greg Garcia, a cashier at her local A&G Family Marts store, explains to her that companies habitually respond to complaint letters by sending coupons for free items.
Connie and JoJo then learn that the coupons originate from an Advanced Solutions factory inChihuahua,Mexico. They decide to travel there and collect the coupons to redistribute to other mothers and wives. They enlist married employees Alejandro and Rosa Diaz, who agree to send them the unused coupons.
Afterward, the duo began their own website and small business "Savvy Super Saver," which helps them sell numerous coupons and generate profit. However, Ken Miller, a haplessloss preventionofficer for the A&G Family Marts stores in theSouthwestern United States, learns about the coupons and the losses several companies are taking. Unsuccessfully pressuring his superiors to act, he ultimately decides to handle the case himself.
The duo's account is frozen due to suspicious activity, so Connie realizes they need to prove their business is legitimate. They contact the hacker who stole JoJo's identity, Tempe Tina, and at her secret location, she instructs them to secure their money, suggesting they use JoJo's cosmetics brand Back 2 Black to disguise their operation.
After six months, they figure their money is safe to use, but soon realize they should spend and clean it as a backup plan. Tina then contacts them and criticizes their overspending, explaining their money was already clean, so their purchases are merely causing increasing suspicions; she further instructs them to deposit money back into the bank in small increments and to sell off all their big purchases.
Meanwhile, Ken is partnered withU.S. postal inspectorSimon Kilmurry. The duo bond on their mission, with Simon empathizing with Ken's unwavering devotion to loss prevention. They interview people from grocery stores that the ladies frequent, almost all of whom recognize Connie due to her constantly irritating coupon usage, even successfully linking her to the "Savvy Super Saver" website as she uses its slogan while shopping. The duo then interviews a group of postal workers, who remember JoJo, especially because Earl is always watching her videos.
After gathering sufficient evidence, Simon and Ken finally get federal agents to arrest the pair, sending a S.W.A.T. team to invade their homes in the middle of the night. Earl bails JoJo out of jail, but Rick visits Connie solely to admonish her, having been informed by Simon that she and JoJo have defrauded over 240 companies of tens of millions of dollars. Weary of his lack of support, she declares she wants a divorce.
Despite the pair facing forty years to life, the companies that they victimized clandestinely press the courts for leniency to avoid bad press. This results in ten days suspended imprisonment plus one year of probation for JoJo and eleven months incarceration (parole eligible in eight) for Connie.
Even though most of their fraudulent earnings have been confiscated, the pair have hundreds of thousands of dollars stashed away. JoJo starts a relationship with Earl and relocates toMontenegro, where the pair can immediately restart the scam upon Connie's release since the country does notextraditesuspects. It is also revealed that Connie has finally become pregnant.
In addition, the scenes involving the gun sale include short appearances by co-director and co-writer Aron Gaudet's brother Nick as a barista, as well as actor and directorNick Cassavetesas Captain Pain, the leader of the group buying the guns.

The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014 (the "S" standing for Simonds, the company's founder; the "T" standing forTPG Growth, whose managing partner McGlashan helped launch the company; and the "X" standing for "secret project"),[2]with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[3][4]Investors in the company includedHony Capital,Tencent,PCCW, TPG Growth,RTL GroupandLiberty Global. Individual investors includeGigi Pritzker,Beau Wrigley, andDominic Ng.[5][6][7]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
