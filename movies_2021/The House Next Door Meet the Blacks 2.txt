Danny Trejo(/ˈtreɪhoʊ/,Spanish:[ˈtɾexo]; born May 16, 1944) is an American actor. A native of Los Angeles, Trejo's film career began in 1985, when he landed a role inRunaway Train(1985). The first film in which he was given a proper credited role was as Art Sanella inDeath Wish 4: The Crackdown(1987).[1]He went on to star in a multitude of other films, many of which were small parts as inmates, gangsters, or other criminals,[2]appearing inDesperado,Heat(both 1995),From Dusk till Dawn(1996),Con Air(1997),The Replacement Killers(1998),Reindeer Games(2000), andOnce Upon a Time in Mexico(2003), among others.
From 2001 to 2003, Trejo appeared in theRobert Rodriguez-directedSpy KidsfranchiseasIsador "Machete" Cortez. Subsequently, in 2010, Trejo reprised his role as Machete in the spin-off exploitation action filmMacheteas theprotagonist. With the success ofMachete(2010), Trejo once again reprised his role in a direct sequel,Machete Kills(2013).
His voice acting work includes the characters Umberto Robina for the video gamesGrand Theft Auto: Vice CityandGrand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, himself inDef Jam: Fight for NY(2004), Raul Tejada inFallout: New Vegas, Trainer Duke inThe Fight: Lights Out, himself inCall of Duty: Black OpsandCall of The DeadandCall of Duty Black Ops 4: Blackoutand also himself inFar Cry 6: Danny and Dani vs. Everybody, andSCUM, among others.[3]
Danny Trejo was born on May 16, 1944, inMaywood, California.[4][5][6]He was raised onTemple Streetin theEcho Parkneighborhood of Los Angeles, California, the son ofMexican-Americanparents.[7][8][9]He is the son of Delores Rivera King[10]and Dionisio "Dan" Trejo (1922–1981),[11]a construction worker. Trejo was the result of an extramarital affair; Delores's husband was away fighting inWorld War II.[12]His parents met at a dance hall in Highland Park, Los Angeles in 1943.[13]He had a maternal half-sister, Dyhan, but saw neither her nor Delores from 1949 until 1965; his father banned his mother from seeing him after Trejo sprained his arm in her care.[12]
Trejo was oftenabusedby his father. Shortly after his birth, Trejo and his family briefly lived inSan Antonio, Texas; they fled Los Angeles because Dionisio was wanted by police for stabbing another man. After a year, they returned to Los Angeles and Trejo's father turned himself in.[13]By 1949, Trejo shared a room with his cousins at their grandmother's house.[14]His stepmother was Alice Mendias, "his only source of comfort" when he lived with his father.[15][16][17]
Trejo was usingmarijuana,heroin, andcocaineby ages 8, 12, and 18, respectively.[18][19][20]Trejo's uncle Gilbert introduced him to all three and was responsible for Trejo overdosing on his first heroin fix.[13]When he was 13, he moved to the majority Hispanic neighborhood ofPacoima, Los Angeles, where he said he did not experience racism growing up. Years later, he purchased his childhood home and often lived in it.[21]
At age seven, Trejo participated in his first drug deal.[22]He was first arrested at the age of 10,[23]but experienced his first incarceration at Eastlake Juvenile Hall in 1956.[23]
Throughout the 1960s, Trejo's life consisted predominantly of intermittent jail stints in theCalifornia prison system.[23][24]The accounts of his prison chronology, though, are notably conflicting; by one account, his final term in custody is said to have ended in 1972.[9]However, Trejo did time in various juvenile offenders' camps,[25]including three years at Camp Glenn Rockey,San Dimas, for maiming a sailor (stabbing him in the face with broken glass),[26][27]followed by numerous California prisons between 1959 and 1969; "I was in San Quentin, Folsom, Soledad, Vacaville, Susanville, Sierra".[18]
While doing a stint inLos Angeles Countyjail in 1961, he metCharles Manson, whom he described as a "dirty, greasy, scrawny white boy" who was allegedly a talentedhypnotist.[28]
Trejo arrived atSan Quentin State Prisonin 1966, and his heroin use was exacerbated shortly thereafter.[29]He was a debt collector and drug dealer, often participating in or witnessing acts of serious violence, including murder.[30][31]Simultaneously while  imprisoned, Trejo focused on boxing[29]and became a champion in San Quentin'slightweightandwelterweightdivisions.[9]
Regarding himself, Trejo has suggested his physical appearance contributed to his constantly getting into trouble.[18][32]In 1968, a prison riot broke out duringCinco De Mayoat Soledad. From that fracas, Trejo ended up in solitary confinement, facing capital charges and, potentially, the death penalty, after hitting a guard with a rock.  While in solitary, Trejo found faith[33][11]and became a member of a12-step program, having first attended one "by accident" aged 15.  He successfully overcame his drug addictions, recalling in 2011 that he had been sober for the previous 42 years. Also while incarcerated, he earned his high-school diploma.[34][18]
In July 1969, Trejo was released from custody and returned to Pacoima, Los Angeles, having served five years of a 10-year prison sentence.[35][11]
Prior to his film career, Trejo worked as a labor foreman for developer Saul Pick, and contributed toward the construction of theCinerama Dome.[36]He was also a gardener, salesperson, part owner of a lawn care company, and became a substance abuse counselor since 1973.[37][38][39]
Trejo worked with Western Pacific Med Corp in the 1980s, assisting them with the establishing and operating of sober living houses within theSan Fernando Valley.[41]He met a "good looking tattooed kid" during a meeting in one such house, who explained that he worked as a film extra and was paid $50 per day to stand there. Intrigued, Trejo considered becoming a film extra, initially due to the easy money and publicity it could afford his work with Western Pacific Med Corp. Trejo signed with an agent and would hand out his details while working on film sets, in the hopes of finding more opportunities to help those in need. Late one night, Trejo received a call from a teenaged patient, asking for his assistance in dealing with cocaine problems on the set ofRunaway Train(1985).[42][9][43]
While there, Trejo was offered a job as an extra in the film's prison scenes.Edward Bunker, a former convict turned published crime author who was writing the screenplay for the film, recognized Trejo from their time together at San Quentin.[9][43]Remembering Trejo's boxing skills, Bunker played a pivotal role in securing Trejo asEric Roberts' personal trainer and boxing advisor. Trejo was paid between $320 and $350 per day. Trejo recalled: "When I got my first paycheck, I thought they made a mistake!"[44][45]Bunker also convinced directorAndrei Konchalovskyto offer Trejo a small acting role, asserting that Trejo's personal experiences of incarceration would provide authenticity to the prison drama.[46]Following his acting debut, Trejo was oblivious to being typecast as a prisoner in similar roles for years to follow; "I [did not] know I was being stereotyped. I just knew I was working."[47]
Penitentiary IIIwas his first billed role. While filming he met Anthony Gambino of theGambino crime family; Gambino allegedly had financial interests invested and was there to meet the leading man,Leon Isaac Kennedy. Trejo was paid $120 cash each day, but the project often went into overtime; "We were stacked with cash."[48]On a good month, Trejo was taking home as much as $700 by 1989 from being an extra alone; yet, people often assumed he was far wealthier after a few appearances on television. Trejo says this worked to his advantage as a drug counselor, though, because clients would recognize him as an actor, therefore appreciating his presence and the humility of his work all the more.[49]
Trejo had made a dozen films by 1990, includingDeath Wish 4: The Crackdown, andMarked for Death. He enjoyed the making ofGuns,[50]yet allegesErik Estradatook issue with the cast and crew being more familiar with Trejo than himself. Trejo says Estrada's ego got the better of him; he believes Estrada arranged for Trejo and a number of others to fly coach instead of first class on the way to Hawaii for filming.[51]
In 1991,Edward James Olmosoriginally offered him the role of Pedro Santana inAmerican Me.[52]Trejo was unimpressed by the script and his initial meeting with Olmos. Trejo claims rumors began circulating within theMexican Mafiathat the script was taking narrative liberties. Before Trejo had the chance to attend a second meeting with Olmos, he received a call fromJoe "Pegleg" Morgan, the then-don of the Mexican Mafia; Morgan approved of his choosing a role inBlood In, Blood Outinstead ofAmerican Me.[53]In 2021, Trejo stated that he believes Olmos has yet to accept him as a serious actor.[47]
Of his experiences ofBlood In, Blood Out, Trejo recalls feeling uncomfortable around many of the other actors during rehearsals, as they were more established.[54]During production at San Quentin, Trejo often had flashbacks to his time there; filming scenes in C550, his former cell, merely exacerbated such feelings.[55]Though his previous works brought him opportunities, Trejo creditsBlood In, Blood Outas having brought him "legitimate, worldwide fame."[56]
Trejo found a new talent agent with the help ofRaymond Cruz. He was first cast in an episode ofBaywatch, followed by a part in 1993'sLast Light,Kiefer Sutherland's directorial debut.[57]
Heatwent through two script revisions while Trejo read for the part. He ultimately secured the role, which reunited him withMichael Mann, who had directed him in the television miniseriesDrug Wars: The Camarena Storya few years prior. Mann initially mistook Trejo for his uncle Gilbert; he found the resemblance uncanny, having met Gilbert while shootingThe Jericho Mileat Folsom in the late 1970s; production required the co-operation of the inmates, and Gilbert happened to be one of the shot-callers. Trejo's character in the film was initially called 'Vince' but renamed 'Trejo' in honor of Gilbert.  Filming could be upward of 17 hours per day, but Trejo said he was grateful for how much he learned; "watchingDe Niro,Kilmer, andVoight, I learned a lot about how they saved [their performances] for when it mattered." He recalls being mentored by Robert De Niro, who was a patient and instructive scene partner. Trejo and De Niro improvised the former's death scene.[58]
In 1996, Trejo was cast in the French productionLe Jaguar(which was French for The Jaguar) and reunited with Voight forAnaconda, both of which were filmed in Manaus, Brazil. When production forAnacondamoved to Venezuela, Trejo would go out socializing on his days off. The producers were worried given a possible coup d'état had made parts of the country unsafe to travel; a group of teenagers brandished AK47's on one occasion, demanding Trejo's combat boots. Because of this, Trejo says he negotiated a higher salary to remain within the confines of his hotel.[59]
Trejo described 1997'sCon Airas a "macho fest from the start" and the cast were often pulling pranks on one another. He remembersNicolas Cageas being "cool as hell" andJohn Cusackas a "kickboxing badass". Trejo met many of his longtime friends on set, including:John Malkovich,Ving Rhames,Steve Buscemi, andDave Chappelle.[60]
After concludingAnimal Factoryin 1999, he contractedHepatitis Cand "had to drag [his] ass" from Canada to Austin, Texas, to begin filming ofSpy Kidsin 2000.Spy Kidsmarked Trejo's debut as the fictional characterIsador "Machete" Cortez. Having already madeDesperadoandFrom Dusk till Dawntogether, the opportunity to collaborate withRobert Rodriguez,Antonio Banderas, andCheech Marinonce again "felt like [a] family reunion."[61]Spy Kidsprovided Trejo with worldwide recognition and for the first time he was "instantly recognizable" among children around the globe.[62]
By the time ofBubble Boyin 2001, his illness had progressed to the point that much of the cast had noticed his weight loss; Trejo states that his past drug use had caught up with him. He described himself as having been pale and weak throughout production, and pre-occupied with keeping his diagnosis a secret within Hollywood for fear of reprisal. Trejo was "out of it" and struggling to remember his lines due to prescription medication. By the timeSpy Kidspremiered in September 2002, Trejo had fully recovered.[61][62]
Throughout the 2000s, Trejo appeared in productions including:XXX;Once Upon a Time in Mexico;Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy;The Devil's Rejects;Snoop Dogg's Hood of Horror;Delta Farce;Grindhouse;Rob Zombie's Halloween;Urban Justice(alongsideSteven Seagal); andValley of Angels. He also made a number of television appearances, including:Monk,Desperate Housewives,Stargate: Atlantis, andBreaking Bad. Trejo also voiced the characters Enrique and Octavio onKing of the Hill. His life is documented in the independent biographical film,Champion, featuring some of Trejo's close friends:Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Steve Buscemi, and Robert Rodriguez.[63]Trejo also shared his tumultuous journey from convict to film star withKTTVin Los Angeles, 2013, in a segment filmed in Trejo's home.[64]
Regarding his continued growth as a professional actor, Trejo has remarked, "I'm so blessed. I'm still scared that somebody's going to wake me up and say, 'Hey, we're still in prison. Let's go to chow’".[65]Trejo also played 'Machete' in a trailer made for Rodriguez's film collaboration withQuentin Tarantino,Grindhouse.
