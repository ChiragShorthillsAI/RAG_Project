The United States vs. Billie Holidayis a 2021 Americanbiographicaldrama filmabout singerBillie Holiday, based on the bookChasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on DrugsbyJohann Hari. Directed byLee Daniels, the film starsAndra Dayin the title role, along withTrevante Rhodes,Garrett Hedlund,Leslie Jordan(in his final film appearance),Miss Lawrence,Adriane Lenox,Natasha Lyonne,Rob Morgan,Da'Vine Joy Randolph,Evan Ross, andTyler James Williams.
Initially set to be released theatrically in the United States byParamount Pictures, the film was sold toHuluin December 2020 and digitally released in the United States on February 26, 2021.The United States vs. Billie Holidayreceived mixed reviews from critics; while Day's performance was praised, the direction and screenplay were criticized as unfocused. For her performance, Day was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Actressand won theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama. The film was also nominated for theGolden Globe Award for Best Original Song("Tigress and Tweed") and the soundtrack won theGrammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media, forAndra Day,Salaam Remi, and Lynn Fainchtein.
In 1957, Billie Holiday meets with a radio journalist, Reginald Lord Devine, for an interview. He asks her what it is like to be a "colored woman" and about the trouble she keeps getting into because of her hit song "Strange Fruit". Billie states that the lyrics are about human rights, something the government often forgets.
In 1947, Billie's husband Monroe and her manager,Joe Glaser, try to get Billie to cut "Strange Fruit" from her set list, fearing legal problems if they continue to perform something so controversial.Lester Young, Billie's sax player and longtime confidant, supports her in playing it.
In the 1940s,FBNchiefHarry J. Anslingerdeclares Billie to be the top priority for his agents, as she is considered to be politically threatening due to the nature of her songs. Unable to arrest her for singing, they decide to go after her on drug charges. After Billie's next show, Agent Jimmy Fletcher, disguised as a soldier, witnesses her doing drugs. The FBI arrest Billie and her loverJoe Guyfor drug use and possession. The judge sentences Billie to a year in jail after Guy, bribed by Anslinger, testifies against her.
Anslinger assigns Jimmy to visit Billie in prison, confident that he can get her to incriminate herself on further charges that will lead to a longer sentence. Instead, Jimmy (who has become convinced that Billie is being wrongfully persecuted) tells her to not trust anyone and keep her nose clean, lest the government find another way to destroy her.
After Billie is released from prison, she does aCarnegie Hallshow, where she regretfully declines an audience member's request to sing "Strange Fruit". She is then introduced to promoter John Levy, who says he can pay off certain people to ensure she can keep performing. They begin a relationship, but when Levy is threatened with prosecution for allowing drug deals in his clubs, he betrays Billie by planting drugs on her person just as Anslinger's men burst in. In court, Fletcher admits under cross-examination that Billie was possibly framed, and she is freed. Anslinger again orders Fletcher to follow Billie on tour, pretending that he is leaving the Bureau.
In 1949, Jimmy comes to see Billie after a successful tour stop and reveals his deception. Suspicious, the whole crew has Jimmy doherointo show he can be trusted. Over the course of the tour, Jimmy and Billie fall in love. One day, after the bus breaks down, Billie breaks up with Jimmy and sends him away, feeling that he deserves a nice girl, which she can never be. Jimmy then learns that Anslinger has fired him for using drugs on duty.
Billie marries Louis McKay, but eventually leaves him for Jimmy. In 1959, a now middle-aged Billie is dying in a hospital room from liver failure after decades of alcohol abuse. Anslinger visits her one last time, offering to erase her criminal record if she furnishes the names of other drug-using acquaintances. Billie mockingly replies that his grandkids will be singing "Strange Fruit" one day.
Development on a newBillie Holidaybiopic was announced in September 2019, withLee Danielsdirecting.Andra Daywas set to play the title role, withTrevante Rhodes,Garrett HedlundandNatasha Lyonnealso cast.[1]Evan Ross,Dana GourrierandErik LaRay Harveywere also added later that month.[2]Additional casting was announced in October.[3]Daniels was hesitant to cast Day, owing to her limited acting experience, but became convinced after her acting coach sent him a clip of her performing.[4]
Filming began on October 6, 2019, inMontreal.[5]
Andra Daystated that she went through intensive preparation for her role; in addition to shedding over 40 pounds to match Billie's physique, she also had to smoke cigarettes and drink to develop a similar vocal tone and to get in the mindset of someone gripped by a lifetime of addiction.[6]
The film was released on February 26, 2021.[7]In July 2020,Paramount Picturesreportedly acquired distribution rights to the film in a bidding war at theMarché du Filmwhich also includedFocus Features,Sony Picturesand 101 Studios.[8]It was originally scheduled to be released on February 12, 2021,[9][10]but in November 2020, it was moved two weeks to February 26.[11]Ultimately, in December 2020,Huluacquired North American distribution rights to the film from New Slate Ventures; Paramount's deal for rights to the film apparently never closed despite the studio preparing advertisements and overseeing reshoots for it.[12]
Hulu reported the film was the most-watched title over its first three days of release, withSamba TVestimating that 287,000 U.S. households watched the film.[13]
Review aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoesreported that 55% of 185 critic reviews were positive, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "AlthoughThe United States vs. Billie Holidayoften falls shy of its subject's transcendence, Andra Day's performance offers brilliant compensation."[14]OnMetacriticthe film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[15]
David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote, "Day mesmerizes even when Lee Daniels' unwieldy bio-drama careens all over the map with stylistic inconsistency and narrative dysfunction, settling for episodic electricity in the absence of a robust connective thread. It's a mess, albeit an absorbing one, driven by a raw central performance of blistering indignation, both tough and vulnerable."[16]Reviewing forVariety,Owen Gleibermanpraised Day's performance and said, "In this sprawling, lacerating, but at times emotionally wayward biopic set during the last decade of Holiday's life, Day gives Billie a voice of pearly splendor that, over time, turns raspy and hard, and we see the same thing happening to Billie inside."[17]
ForDeadline Hollywood, Pete Hammond wrote, "You simply cannot say enough about what Day achieves in this role, particularly being a first-time actor. She gets beneath the skin of Holiday, giving a raw and honest portrait of an artist under duress but determined in her belief that she can use that art and talent to make the world a more just place."[18]Peter Bradshaw ofThe Guardiangave the film 2 out of 5 stars, detailing, "Day's rendition is heartfelt. But the direction and storytelling are laborious, without the panache and incorrectness of earlier Daniels movies such asPrecious(2009) andThe Paperboy(2012). A cloud of solemnity and reverence hangs over it, briefly dispelled by the music itself."[19]DiscussingFilmalso praised Day in their 3/5 review, saying that her work is the only memorable aspect in an otherwise forgettable, muddled film.[20]
Several jazz critics and musicians have had negative reactions to the film for its rewriting of history. Writing inJazzTimes, historian and musicianLewis Portercritiqued the ahistorical premise of the film:
In Lee Daniels’ filmThe United States vs. Billie Holiday, the words “Earle Theater, Philadelphia, May 27, 1947” flash onscreen, and one sees a row of policemen, with Holiday’s manager Joe Glaser standing at the center of them. Billie comes onstage and sings the first words of “Strange Fruit,” solo. Immediately, Glaser orders the police, “Get her off that stage!” and they storm forward.
But wait! Holiday was not at the Earle Theater on that date. She never sang “Strange Fruit” as the first number in a set, and never sang that or anything else a cappella . . . Most significant, never in her entire career was Billie stopped while performing “Strange Fruit.” Yes, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics pursued Holiday for her drug use. But there was no federal objection to the song “Strange Fruit,” nor was there any campaign to suppress it.
If you believed this film—and so far as I can tell, almost everyone did, even the many critics who rightly panned it—you have been the victim of one of the worst instances of rewriting history in the annals of Hollywood. Even the usual spate of articles about “what's true in this based-on-fact movie” missed the boat. TheLos Angeles Timesstated that “[a]lthough some details of the relationships have been fictionalized ..., the ... conspiracies are well documented.” Documented where exactly?In the movie, and nowhere else.[21]
In theirJazz Unitedpodcast onWBGO, critic Nate Chinen and musician and radio host Greg Bryant, too, objected to the film's false premises, but also its let down to the jazz community for its inauthenticity and "exploitative nature", saying, for example "its the attempt to co-opt the name to sell films, what we have again what we have is theimageof jazz, of black American music, whatever you call it, being used to promote certain stereotypes not only about the music, but the players, the people, who gave their lives to embody it."[22]

It was launched on October 29, 2007, initially as ajoint venturebetweenNews Corporation(later21st Century Fox) andNBC Universal, which was laterbought byComcast. Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initiallybrandedas "Hulu Plus," which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and un-delayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—anover-the-topstreaming television service offering access tobroadcast televisionchannels.
In 2011, Hulu launchedits services in Japan, marking its first and only international expansion. Three years later in 2014, Hulu Japan was acquired byNippon TVand spun off from its American counterpart.[2]Since February 2021, Hulu's original content has since been distributed outside of the U.S. viaDisney+under theStarbrand. In 2019, Disney acquired a majority stake in Hulu as part of itsacquisition of 21st Century Fox, and subsequently acquired the remaining stakes held by AT&T and Comcast in 2019 and 2023, respectively, giving it full ownership. After the acquisition, Disneysoft launchedan integration of Hulu into Disney+ as a content hub in December 2023, allowing subscribers of both services to access Hulu content from within the Disney+ app. Hulu is one of the three streaming services in the Disney Bundle, alongside Disney+ andESPN+.
On January 6, 2025, Disney began its acquisition of a 70% stake inFuboTV, with the latter merging with Hulu's Live TV service. The combined company will remain publicly traded on theNew York Stock Exchange, but will be controlled by Disney executives. As part of the deal, Fubo settled a lawsuit againstESPN Inc.(majority-owned by Disney),Fox Corporation(21CF's successor), andWarner Bros. Discovery(WarnerMedia's successor after its merger withDiscovery, Inc.) over a joint venture known asVenu Sports, with Fubo being granted a preliminary injection to stop its launch in August 2024. The merger will take 12 to 18 months according to Disney and Fubo. Venu Sports was discontinued a few days later.
The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

It invited users to leave their email addresses for the upcomingbeta test.[13]In October 2007, Hulu began the private beta testing by invitation, and later allowed users to invite friends.[14]Hulu launched for public access in the United States on March 12, 2008.[15]
Hulu began an advertising campaign during NBC's broadcast ofSuper Bowl XLIIIwith an initial ad starringAlec Baldwintitled "Alec in Huluwood."[16]Advertisements have since aired featuringEliza Dushku,Seth MacFarlane,Denis Leary, andWill Arnett.[citation needed]
In July 2007,Providence Equity, the owner ofNewport Television, became one of the earliest "outside" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 millionequity investment,[17]before the company was known as "Hulu."[18]With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an "independent voice on the board."[18]In April 2009,the Walt Disney Companyjoined the Hulu consortium as a stakeholder, with plans to offer content fromABC,ESPNandDisney Channel.[19][20][21][22]
Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

Comcast, the only other shareholder, announced on May 14, 2019, that it had agreed to cede its control to Disney, and reached an agreement for Disney to purchase its 33% stake in the company as early as 2024.[38]
On May 14, 2019, Comcast relinquished its control in Hulu to Disney effective immediately. As a result, the streaming service became a division ofWalt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International(DTCI) with Comcast effectively becoming asilent partner. Under the agreement, Comcast's 33% stake can be sold to Disney atfair market valueas early as 2024. The fair market value will be determined at that time, but Disney guaranteed a minimum valuation of the entire company at $27.5 billion (valuing the Comcast stake as worth at least $9.075 billion).[39]Randy Freer would report to Disney executiveKevin Mayer.[39]

However, Comcast had not offered reasonable terms for an early buyout[54]and had instead expressed interest in buying Hulu themselves if it were for sale.[53]
On May 18, it was announced that Disney+ and Hulu would remove nearly 60 original films and series on May 26 in order to "cut costs." The news sparked some backlash, mostly towards the initial decision to removeHoward, the documentary on the life of lyricistHoward Ashman, on the eve ofPride Monthand the release of thelive-action adaptationofThe Little Mermaid.

In partnership with comScore, Hulu is the first digital company to receive multi-platform measurement at an individual level that includes co-viewing for living room devices.[citation needed]
The reliability of these metrics has been drawn into question, partly due to widely divergent estimates. For example, between May and June 2010, ComScore updated its scoring methodology and its estimates for Hulu. Hulu's viewers would go from 43.5 million to 24 million in one month.[150]In a comScore digital trends report in 2010, comScore's Digital Year in Review report found that Hulu was watched twice as much as viewers who watched on the websites of the five major TV networks combined.[151]

Suzan-Lori Parks(born May 10, 1963) is an Americanplaywright,screenwriter, andnovelist. Her playTopdog/Underdogwon thePulitzer Prize for Dramain 2002; Parks was the first African-American woman to receive the award for drama.[1]She was named one of the100 most influential people in the worldbyTimemagazine in 2023.[2]
Parks was born inFort Knox, Kentucky. She grew up with two siblings in a military family. Parks enjoyed writing poems and songs and created a newspaper with her brother, called the "Daily Daily."[3]Parks was raisedCatholicand attended high school inWest Germany, where her father, a career officer in theUnited States Army, was stationed.[3][4]The experience showed her "what it feels like to be neither white nor black, but simply foreign".[3][5]After returning to the U.S., her family relocated frequently and Parks went to school in Kentucky,Texas,California,North Carolina,Maryland, andVermont.[3]She graduated high school fromThe John Carroll Schoolin 1981, while her father was stationed inAberdeen Proving Ground.[6][7]
In high school, Parks was discouraged from studying literature by at least one teacher, but upon readingVirginia Woolf'sTo the Lighthouse, Parks found herself veering away from her interest in chemistry, gravitating towards writing.[8]Parks attendedMount Holyoke Collegeand became a member ofPhi Beta Kappa. She graduated in 1985 with a B.A. degree in English and German literature. She studied underJames Baldwin, who encouraged her to become a playwright; Parks was initially resistant to writing for theater, believing it was elitist and cliquey.[8]Parks, at his behest, began to write plays.[9]Baldwin considered her talent as amazing.[7]Parks then studied acting for a year atDrama Studio London.[10][11][12]
Parks was inspired byWendy Wasserstein, who won the Pulitzer in 1989 for her playThe Heidi Chronicles,[13]and by her Mount Holyoke professor,Leah Blatt Glasser.[14]
Parks has written three screenplays and numerous stage plays. Her first screenplay was forSpike Lee's 1996 filmGirl 6.[15]She later worked withOprah Winfrey'sHarpo Productionson screenplays forTheir Eyes Were Watching God(2005) andThe Great Debaters(2007).[16][17]
Parks became the first female African American to receive thePulitzer Prize for Drama, which was awarded in 2002 for her playTopdog/Underdog.[a]She has also received a number of grants including theMacArthur Foundation "Genius" Grantin 2001.[7]She is a winner of the 2017 Poets, Essayists and Novelists (PEN) America Literary Awards in the category Master American Dramatist.[19]She received the 2018 Steinberg Distinguished Playwright Award. This biennial award is given to "established playwrights whose body of work has made significant contributions to the American theatre."[20]
AlthoughBetting on the Dust Commanderwas not the first play Parks wrote, it was the first of her plays to be produced. Her first playThe Sinner's Place, which she wrote for her senior project at Mount Holyoke, was rejected for production by her college's drama department as they considered it too experimental since she wanted to have dirt on the stage during the performance.[21]When her second play,Betting on the Dust Commander,first premiered, it ran for three nights in a bar in Manhattan's Lower East Side calledGas Station.[22]It is a short, one-act play set in Kentucky, centering around the lives of a couple, Mare and Lucius, who have been married for 110 years. The play's title comes from the horse that won the Kentucky Derby in 1970,Dust Commander. As the play goes on, we discover that Dust Commander's Derby is responsible for bringing Mare and Lucius together, and through the couple's discussion of him they think back over their many years of memories together. Poet Philip Kolin argues that Parks's incorporation of non-linear time and a repetitive style is reminiscent of African rituals and the way that their retelling of stories often incorporate the past in a literal manner.[23][24]
One of her best-known works isTopdog/Underdog. This play marked a departure from the heightened language she usually wrote.[citation needed]Parks is an admirer ofAbraham Lincolnand believed he left a legacy for descendants of slaves.[25]It tells the story of two African-American brothers: Lincoln and Booth. Lincoln works at a boardwalk arcade, dressing up like Abraham Lincoln and letting the tourists shoot him with plastic guns. He got this job because he could be paid less than the white man who had the job before. Author Joshua Wolf Shenk argues that Parks does not judge Lincoln in this play, but rather enjoys bringing him into the other characters' lives and seeing how they are affected.[25]In an interview, Parks said, "Lincoln is the closest thing we have to a mythic figure. In days of Greek drama, they hadApolloandMedeaandOedipus– these larger than life figures that walked the earth and spoke – and they turned them into plays. Shakespeare had kings and queens that he fashioned into his stories. Lincoln, to me, is one of those."[25]
After her bookGetting Mother's Bodywas published,[citation needed]Parks gave herself the task of writing 365 plays in 365 days, ultimately produced as365 Plays/365 Days.[26]
The plays were presented by 725 performing arts groups, taking turns until the entire cycle was performed.[26]The performances started in 2006 atThe Public Theaterin New York City, and included venues such as the Denver Center Theatre Company, colleges in England and Australia and the Steel City Theatre Company inPueblo, Colorado.[26][27]Other venues were theSteppenwolf Theatre Companyand theGoodman Theatrein Chicago, and the Center Theater Group in Los Angeles.[26]

Directed byJo Bonney, the cast featuredSterling K. Brown,Louis Cancelmi, Peter Jay Fernandez, Russell G. Jones, andJacob Ming-Trent.[28]Jacob Ming-Trent won the 2015Lucille Lortel Awardfor Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play[29]and Parks won the 2015Obie Awardfor playwriting presented by theAmerican Theater Wing.[30]The play, which takes place during theAmerican Civil War, is presented in three parts: Part 1, A Measure of a Man; Part 2, The Battle in the Wilderness; and Part 3, The Union of My Confederate Parts.[31]From September 15 to October 22, 2016, the play had its London premiere at theRoyal Courtin a transfer of the Public Theatre production directed by Jo Bonney. The cast featuredSteve Toussaint, Nadine Marshall,Leo Wringer, Sibusiso Mamba,Tom Bateman, andJimmy Akingbola.[32]
The play was a finalist for the 2015Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The Pulitzer committee wrote: "A distinctive and lyrical epic about a slave during the Civil War that deftly takes on questions of identity, power and freedom with a blend of humor and dignity."[33]
The Red Letter Plays refers toFucking AandIn the Blood, two plays incorporating themes fromThe Scarlet Letter.[34]Both plays have a mother named Hester struggling in a society where they put her in the role of outcast.[34]The first play,In the Blood, premiered in 1999 and follows the story of Hester, a penniless mother of five who is condemned by the men who once loved her.In the Bloodwas a finalist for the 2000Pulitzer Prize for Drama.Fucking Apremiered in 2000 and tells the story of Hester, an "abortionist" trying to free her son from prison.[21][35]
In 2017,Signature Theatre Companyproduced these two plays in the same season.[34]Parks said: "They were conceived from the same idea but until now have lived very separate lives. I can't wait to participate in the dialogue that will come from witnessing these two works in concert."[36]
In October 2022,Sally & Tom, a play aboutThomas JeffersonandSally Hemings, began performances at theGuthrie TheaterinMinneapolis.[37]
Plays for the Plague Year, an anthology of plays and songs, described byThe New York Timesas "Parks's diaristic musings on the first year of theCovid-19 pandemicand a coincident string of deaths, including those of Black Americans killed by police officers", was scheduled for a November 2022 premiere atJoe's Pub, with Parks onstage singing and starring.[37][38]
The Harder They Come, Parks's musical adaptation of the1972 Jamaican reggae filmwas staged at thePublic Theaterin 2023.[37]
In 2001, Parks married blues musicianPaul Oscher; they divorced in 2010.[47]By 2017, she married Christian Konopka, with whom she has a child.[48]
Parks noted in an interview that her name is spelled with a "Z" as the result of a misprint early in her career:
When I was doing one of my first plays inthe East Village, we had fliers printed up and they spelled my name wrong. I was devastated. But the director said, 'Just keep it, honey, and it will be fine.' And it was.[49]
She teaches playwriting atTisch School of the Artsin the Rita & Burton Goldberg Department of Dramatic Writing.

Lyonne was born inNew York City,[2]the daughter ofOrthodox Jewishparents Ivette Buchinger[2]and Aaron Braunstein, a boxing promoter, race car driver, and radio host.[6][7][8]Her mother was born inParis,[9]toHungarian-Jewishparents.[10][11][12][13][14][excessive citations]
Lyonne has joked that her family consists of "my father's side,Flatbush, and my mother's side,Auschwitz".[2]Her grandmother, Ella,[15]came from a large family, but only she and her two sisters and two brothers survived, which Lyonne has attributed to their blond hair and blue eyes.[2]Lyonne's grandfather, Morris Buchinger, operated a watch company in Los Angeles. During the war, he hid in Budapest as a non-Jew working in a leather factory.[2]Lyonne lived the first eight years of her life inGreat Neck, New York.[10][16]She and her family emigrated to Israel, where she spent a year and a half. While in Israel, Lyonne participated in the 1989 Israeli children's filmApril Fool(Hebrew:אחד באפריל), which began her interest in acting.[7][17]Her parents divorced, and Lyonne and her older brother, Adam, returned to the United States with their mother.[10]After moving back to New York City, Lyonne attended theRamaz School, a private Jewish school,[18]where Lyonne was a scholarship student who tookTalmudclasses and readAramaic.[19]She was expelled in her sophomore year for selling marijuana to classmates.[19]Lyonne grew up on theUpper East Side, where she felt she was an outsider.[2]Her mother moved the family toMiamiand Lyonne briefly attendedMiami Country Day School.[20][21]She did not graduate from high school, leaving before her senior year to attend a film program atNew York University'sTisch School of the Arts, which she attended for a short time, studying film and philosophy.[16]Her high school graduation depended on completing her first year at Tisch, but she left the program because she could not pay the tuition.[8][22]
Lyonne was estranged from her father, who was a Democratic candidate forNew York City Councilfor the sixth District of Manhattan in 2013,[6][23]and lived on theUpper West Sideuntil his death in October 2014.[24]She has said she was not close to her mother, who died in 2013, and has essentially lived independently of her family since age 16.[7]

Of her time working as a child actor, Lyonne later said, "I had to become coherent and a businesswoman at six. By 10, I was a jaded professional … I don't think [my parents] knew better.

This led to a headline role in the independent coming-of-age comedySlums of Beverly Hills(1998), for which she received positive notices for her portrayal of Vivian Abromowitz.[26]Writing forThe Washington Post, Michael O'Sullivan said, "Lyonne is marvelous in conveying Vivian's combination of confusion, curiosity, disgust and desire at what body and psyche are going through. After playing a string of people's daughters [in other films], Lyonne really comes into her own here as an actress, registering as a person and not merely someone's little girl".[27]
In 1999, Lyonne starred as Megan Bloomfield, a sexually confused teenager, in the satirical romantic comedyBut I'm a Cheerleader. Despite a mixed critical reception upon release,[28]the film was instrumental in raising awareness of the harms ofconversion therapy,[29]and has since developed acult following.[30]In the same year, Lyonne played the small but crucial part of Jessica—a role she reprised in two of the film'ssequels—inAmerican Pie(1999),[31]which grossed over US$230 million at the box office.[32]Other film appearances in 1999 included Christine inDetroit Rock Cityand a headline role inFreeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby. The latter, a follow-up to the1996 original, was poorly received due to its violence and vulgarity,[33]but Lyonne's portrayal of teenage prostitute Crystal Van Meuther was praised for its "earthy, hard-boiled" nature.[34]

Club, "The actor has experienced a remarkable resurgence in the past few years … Here, she channels her storied past to play Lou... drug-addled... plays to Lyonne's strengths—a bluntly outsized personality, brash but likable, with a self-destructive streak bigger than the podunk town in which the story unfolds".[46]Other film credits of hers includeSleeping with Other People,Hello, My Name Is Doris,Addicted to Fresno,Hashtag Horror(all 2015);Yoga Hosers,The Intervention(both 2016);Handsome(2017),Show Dogs(2018),Honey Boy(2019), andJames Gray's science fiction thrillerAd Astra(2019).

After battles with addiction and other health scares [in] the early-2000s, [Lyonne] has managed to revive her career … a personal narrative arc that clearly informs Nadia's constant brushes with her own mortality … Lyonne is such an idiosyncratic screen presence — not to mention so distinctly New York/Jewish/aggro — that most of the roles she's played, particularly as an adult, have barely bothered to delve beneath the surface of that persona … Nadia, on the other hand, is unmistakably Lyonne … It goes deeper and wider than anything she's gotten to play [since] her teenage days in indie films likeSlums of Beverly HillsandBut I'm a Cheerleader.[49]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
