Philip Ettinger(born September 8, 1985) is an American actor. He first gained attention for his supporting role as the troubled environmental activist, Michael, inPaul Schrader'sFirst Reformed(2017). Other significant roles have been as Garrett Drimmer in theCBS All AccessseriesOne Dollar(2018), as the young-adult version ofMark Ruffalo's twin characters, Dominick and Thomas Birdsey, inHBO'sI Know This Much Is Truein 2020, and in the lead role of Cole Freeman inBraden King's cinematic adaptation of the Carter Sickels' novelThe Evening Hour(2020).
Philip Ettinger was born September 8, 1985[1]to aJewishfamily in Fair Lawn, New Jersey.[2][3]He attended Fair Lawn High School, where he was a member of the Masques drama club. He began studying film directing atEmerson CollegeinBoston,Massachusetts.[2]After unexpectedly winning the lead role in a play his freshman year, however, he enrolled in a summer acting program atWilliam Esper StudioinNew York City, where a teacher encouraged Ettinger to transfer to theMason Gross School of the ArtsatRutgers UniversityinNew Brunswick,New Jersey.[2][4]This course included spending a year inEnglandstudying at theGlobe TheatreinLondon.[2]He graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.[4]
Ettinger's professional career began in 2008 in an episode ofLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit.
In 2014, Ettinger was nominated for aLucille Lortel Awardfor Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play, for his work inJoshua Harmon'sBad Jews. (The awards are to recognize excellence in New York Off-Broadway Theatre).[5]Ettinger starred alongsideEthan HawkeandAmanda Seyfriedin the supporting role of Michael, the troubled husband of Seyfried's character, Mary, inPaul Schrader's filmFirst Reformed,which was premiered at the2017 Toronto Film Festival.[4]The performance was a breakthrough for the actor; so much so, that theLos Angeles Timesfilm critic,Justin Changstated in an article regarding his personal choices for what should land on the 2018 Oscar nomination ballot, "When lead performances sneak into the wrong categories, it makes it all the harder for an organization to recognize a genuinely supporting turn — like, for example, Ettinger's galvanizing work inFirst Reformed, which lasts all of one scene and continues to stay with me.."[6]Ettinger continued to make strides in 2018, starring as Garrett Drimmer, a young steel mill worker raising a toddler on his own, in theCBS All Accessensemble seriesOne Dollar, and appearing in theSebastián Silva-directed filmTyrel, which premiered at the2018 Sundance Film Festival.[4]
In 2020, Ettinger landed the role of playing the 17–19-year-old versions ofMark Ruffalo's twin characters, Dominick Birdsey and his paranoid schizophrenic twin, Thomas, inHBO'sI Know This Much Is True.This brought him considerable critical notice, with Dan Seddon ofNMEnoting, "Actor Philip Ettinger (among the series' supporting players)makes a case for himself too, whose stint as the college-aged twins during flashbacks is a raw and fascinating portrayal of the Birdseys complicated youth."[7]Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson examined Ettinger and star Ruffalo's collaboration on the twins with favor, "The relationship between Dom and Thomas is drawn with aching clarity, one brother trying to be good to the other while resentments build up around them. Crucially, neither Ruffalo nor Ettinger overplay Thomas's condition. Though he is volatile, and frustrating, and wounded, there is nothing childlike about him, really—at least not in the style of so many misbegotten depictions of mental illness on screen... In the other role, Ruffalo and Ettinger both keenly express Dom's agony over his assumed responsibilities and all they deny him in his own life. It's particularly heartbreaking to watch Ettinger's youthful appetite for escape dissipate as he realizes just how serious his brother's situation is, how much time and attention and patience it will require.I Know This Much Is Trueis wise enough to both regret and accept that onus, gradually allowing Dom to find the ragged purpose in a life he feels has been robbed of that very thing. Ruffalo communicates that hopeful resignation quite well, building on Ettinger's more wide-eyed performance to craft a man in full."Haaretz's Adrian Hennigan pointed out Ettinger's success in portraying both twins, "The actors (including Donnie and Rocco Masihi) playing the younger versions of the twins are also outstanding: Philip Ettinger subtly delineates how these identical twins are very different characters..."[3][8][9]
Earlier that year Ettinger attended both the2020 Sundance Film Festivaland theInternational Film Festival Rotterdamin the Netherlands to promote his first lead role as Cole Freeman inBraden King's cinematic adaptation of the Carter Sickels novelThe Evening Hour.[10][11][12]In it, Ettinger depicts a young nursing home aide struggling to support himself, and his grandparents, in economically depressedAppalachia, by buying excess pain meds from members of hisWest Virginiancommunity, and reselling them to others in that same area. The film was released in 2021.[13]Other projects include Ian Barling's 2021 short filmSafe,[14][better source needed]which premiered atLa Semaine de la Critiqueat Cannes in July 2021,Hold Upin 2022[15][better source needed]by writer-director Alex Rollins Berg, andLittle Brother,[16]an indie film written and directed by Sheridan O'Donnell. Ettinger also stars alongside Emmy-winnerMartha PlimptoninSardinia, a 2024 short film written and directed byPaul Kowalskiand Executive Produced byPatton Oswalt.[17][better source needed]The film is about a serious man trying to avoid catching a deadly laughing plague in a growingly polarized and dystopian society, and was named a 2025 Oscar contender for Best Live Action Short by Deadline.[18]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
