House of Gucciis a 2021 Americanbiographicalcrime dramafilm directed byRidley Scott, based on the 2001 bookThe House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greedby Sara Gay Forden. The film followsPatrizia Reggiani(Lady Gaga) andMaurizio Gucci(Adam Driver) as their romance transforms into a fight for control of the Italian fashion brandGucci.Jared Leto,Jeremy Irons,Jack Huston,Salma HayekandAl Pacinoalso star.
Scott wanted to make a film about the Gucci dynasty after acquiring rights to Forden's book in the early 2000s. The project languished for several years, with several directors and actors rumored to be considered before Scott and Gaga became officially attached in November 2019. Much of the remaining cast joined the following summer, and filming began in Italy, lasting from February through May 2021.
The world premiere ofHouse of Gucciwas held at theOdeon Luxe Leicester Squarein London on November 9, 2021. It was theatrically released in the United States on November 24, 2021. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast's performances but criticized the inconsistent tone and editing. Gaga and Leto were nominated for theScreen Actors Guild Award,Critics' Choice Award, andSatellite Awardfor Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor, respectively, while Gaga also received nominations for theGolden Globe AwardandBAFTA Award. The film also earned a nomination at the94th Academy AwardsforBest Makeup and Hairstyling. It grossed more than $153 million against a $75 million budget.
In Italy in 1978,Patrizia Reggianiis the office manager of her father's small trucking firm. At a party, she meetsMaurizio Gucci, a law student and heir to a 50% interest in theGuccifashion house through his fatherRodolfo. Patrizia aggressively pursues the awkward Maurizio, charming him into a romantic relationship.
Rodolfo warns Maurizio that Patrizia is after only his wealth, and tells him that he willdisinherithim if he marries Patrizia. Maurizio chooses Patrizia over his connection to Gucci, leaving the family. Patrizia and Maurizio marry, and he is hired by the trucking company.
When Patrizia becomes pregnant, she considers her child to be an avenue for familial reconciliation, and lets that information slip to Maurizio's uncleAldo, who is delighted and takes the couple under his wing.
Aldo introduces Patrizia to his eccentric sonPaolo, who aspires to be a designer within Gucci despite his apparent lack of talent. Aldo helps Maurizio and a terminally ill Rodolfo reconcile shortly before the latter's death. Rodolfo returns Maurizio to his will, but, before he dies, fails to sign the document bequeathing to him the 50% interest in Guccishares, so Patrizia forges Rodolfo's signature on Rodolfo's updated testament.
Patrizia devises a plot to obtain a controlling interest in Gucci by acquiring some of Aldo's and Paolo's shares (the other 50%). She clashes with Aldo over the firm's clandestine sale of cheap "fake" Gucci products on theblack market, and consults Giuseppina "Pina", apsychic, for guidance on how to manipulate Maurizio, who has little interest in Gucci, into taking a more active role within the company.
Paolo acquires proof that Aldo has been evading taxes in the United States. He gives the info to Patrizia in exchange for her promise that he be allowed to design his own product line. Aldo is arrested by theIRSand sentenced toa year and a dayin prison.
Patrizia lies to the Italian police and tells them that Paolo is not authorized to use the Guccitrademark, so they stop his fashion show by force. Patrizia and Maurizio ask Paolo to sell his shares to them, but he rebuffs and cuts ties with them.
Italian police search Maurizio's, attempting to arrest him for forging Rodolfo's signature. His family flees to Switzerland, where Maurizio meets his old friendPaola Franchi. After an argument between Maurizio and Patrizia, he decides that he is tired of his wife's influence on him and the company. He orders his wife and daughter to return to Italy, and begins an affair with Paola, which Pina senses.
When Maurizio's business plans harm the company, he seeks assistance from equity companyInvestcorp, through which he hatches a scheme to acquire shares of the company from a now-impoverished Paolo. Aldo returns from prison and immediately realizes what Paolo has done. When Investcorp offers to buy out Aldo, he refuses until Maurizio reveals himself to be the deal's instigator. Dejected, Aldo sells the shares and cuts contact with Maurizio.
Patrizia attempts a reconciliation with Maurizio, but he flatly ignores her. He soon asks her for a divorce through his longtime assistantDomenico De Sole, a request that she refuses. Maurizio recruits up-and-coming designerTom Fordto revitalize the company's image through a new line. His products are successful, but Maurizio has so thoroughly mismanaged the company that, by 1995, Investcorp's leaders feel compelled to buy him out, replacing him with Tom and Domenico.
Patrizia eventually grows so furious with Maurizio that she asks Pina to help her assassinate him, so Pina puts her in contact with two hitmen. A few days later, they shoot Maurizio to death in broad daylight outside his office.
Patrizia takes her husband's last name while announcing herself in court, indicating that she still considers herself to be a Gucci, even if the law does not.
Patrizia, Pina and the hitmen are sentenced to long prison terms following their arrests for murder. Aldo dies ofprostate cancerin 1990, and Paolo dies in poverty shortly following the sale of their shares to Maurizio. Gucci is fully acquired by Investcorp, and continues to be successfully managed. No Gucci family members remain at the company.

Gaga explained that she took into account how her longtime friend Tony Bennett "feels about Italians being represented in film in terms of crime", and aspired to "make a real person out of Patrizia, not a caricature".[11]To achieve that, she studied Reggiani's vocal cadence and attitude. She explained, "I felt the best way to honor Maurizio and Italians was for my performance to be authentic, from the perspective of a woman. Not anItalian-Americanwoman, but an Italian woman."[11]She stayed in character for 18 months, speaking with an accent for nine months during that period. She also ad-libbed many of her lines, including the film's iconic quote, "Father, son and House of Gucci", which wentviralafter the release of the film's first trailer.[12][13]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 62% of 370 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's consensus reads: "House of Guccivacillates between inspired camp and dour drama too often to pull off a confident runway strut, but Lady Gaga's note-perfect performance has a timeless style all its own."[62]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100 based on 59 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[63]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on a scale of A+ to F, while those atPostTrakgave it an 82% positive score, with 60% saying that they would recommend it.
Deadline Hollywoodnoted a strong divide between critics and audiences, and said, "It appears moviegoers are overpowering."[38]
Screen Rantcommented that although the film received mixed reviews from critics, the performances of the cast were highly praised, with particular emphasis on Lady Gaga, Al Pacino, and Jared Leto.[64]
Alissa Wilkinson ofVoxgave the film a mixed review, praising the performances but criticizing the screenplay and writing. "The movie the trailer is selling is actually a little more dishy and wild than the realHouse of Gucci, which would be a pointless and somewhat perfunctory dud if it weren't for the brilliance, or madness, of the performances."[65]
Reviewing the film forThe Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney wrote, "Ridley Scott's film is a trashtacular watch that I wouldn't have missed for the world. But it fails to settle on a consistent tone — overlong and undisciplined as it careens between high drama andopera buffa."[66]
Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, "Adam Driver (who has now played a French squire and an Italian fashion heir in consecutive Ridley Scott movies) and Lady Gaga have legit chemistry together, and it's still a kick to see Al Pacino roaring like a lion in winter. But Hayek and Irons are playing cardboard-thin characters, Leto flounders about as if he's in a movie all his own, andHouse of Guccifeels coldly calculating when it should have been flush and warm with scandaloussensationalism."[67]
Writing forThe New York Times,A. O. Scottfound the film to be a missed opportunity that could have been crafted more in line with better cinematic standards, stating that it lacks "the necessary vision or inspiration".[68]
Gaga'sItalian accentwas met with criticism by Italian actress anddialect coachFrancesca De Martini, who worked on the set as a dialogue coach for Hayek, and claimed that Gaga's "accent is not exactly an Italian accent, it sounds moreRussian".[69]
BBCstated that Leto's portrayal of Paolo Gucci inspired "both ridicule and irritation".[70]Film criticMark Kermodedescribed his performance as "parodic", writing that "while others adopt faintly ridiculous Italian inflections, Leto delivers his lines in a string of high-pitched whoops that suggest he is attempting to communicate with whales".[71]
David Ehrlich ofIndieWiredescribed Leto as "brilliantly over-the-top".[72]
Responding to negative reviews characterizing the cast's performances as "high-flown and jarringly incongruous", Michael Shindler ofThe American Conservativewrote that such comments overlook those performances' relation to the film's "dramatic substance", "a conflict of high-flown and jarringly incongruous personalities vying to remake Gucci in their own image", arguing that the film, like Scott'sAll the Money in the World, is ahistorical dramaabout the emergence of "a new man whose very character is adapted to the demands of contemporary commerce", comparingJ. Paul Getty's role in the latter to that of Tom Ford.[73]
In January 2021, during an interview with Italian magazineNovella 2000, Patrizia Reggiani approved that Gaga would portray her and commented that she "immensely" likes her, saying, "she's a genius".[74]However, in March, Reggiani gave an interview to theAgenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata(ANSA), in which she stated that she was "annoyed" that Gaga had not contacted her to meet her, and claimed that "it is not an economic question. I won't get a cent from the film. It is a question of good sense and respect."[75]
Later that month, it was confirmed that the producers did not want Gaga to meet her, and that they were "aware of not wanting to endorse or support the awful crime" that she committed, saying that Gaga had watched much footage and many documentaries, and read books about her life.[76]Gaga also stated that she has no interest in "colluding" with Reggiani, but that her heart goes "out to her daughters... I do care deeply that this must be very painful for them".[77]
Patrizia Gucci, who is Paolo Gucci's daughter and Maurizio Gucci's first cousin once removed, told theAssociated Press, in the name of the Gucci family, that they were "truly disappointed" by the film. "They are stealing the identity of a family to make a profit, to increase the income of the Hollywood system." She added, "Our family has an identity, privacy. We can talk about everything, but there is a borderline that cannot be crossed."
According to Gucci, the three central concerns of the family are inaccuracies in the film, the lack of contact with Ridley Scott, and the casting of high-profile actors to play people who were not connected with the murder. She also said that the Gucci family will decide what their next course of action will be after watching the completed film.[78]Scott rejected her claims, saying, "You have to remember that one Gucci was murdered and another went to jail for tax evasion so you can't be talking to me about making a profit. As soon as you do that you become part of the public domain."[79]
Tom Ford, in an article forAir Mail, stated that he "felt as though [he] had lived through a hurricane when [he] left the theater", saying that, despite laughing on a few occasions, he found it "hard for [him] to see the humor and camp in something that was so bloody. In real life, none of it was camp. It was at times absurd, but ultimately it was tragic."
Ford praised most of the cast, although he did criticize Pacino's and Leto's performances, comparing them toSaturday Night Liveperformers, and adding on the latter, "Leto's brilliance as an actor is literally buried under latex prosthetics. Paolo, whom I met on several occasions, was indeed eccentric and did some wacky things, but his overall demeanor was certainly not like the crazed and seemingly mentally challenged character of Leto's performance." While not directly commenting on his role in the film nor Reeve Carney's portrayal of him, Ford noted that the moment of Maurizio's toasting of him was inaccurate, as he had already been bought out by the company before Ford became Gucci's creative director.[80][81]

My mum brought three boys up: my dad was in the army and so he was frequently away. Duringthe warand post-war, we tended to travel following him around so my mum was the boss. She laid down the law and the law was God. We just said, "Yup, okay" – we didn't argue. I think that's where the respect has come from, because she was tough.
Scott was born on 30 November 1937 inSouth Shields, to Francis ("Frank") Percy Scott, a partner in a commercial shipping business based in Newcastle who would serve as aColonelin theRoyal Engineersduring theSecond World War, and Elizabeth, née Williams, a miner's daughter.[12][13]His grand-uncle Dixon Scott was a pioneer of the cinema chain and opened many cinemas aroundTyneside. One of his cinemas,Tyneside Cinema, is still operating inNewcastleand is the last remainingnewsreelcinema in the UK.[14]
Born two years before theSecond World Warbegan, Scott was brought up in a military family. His father, as a senior officer in the Royal Engineers, was absent for most of his early life. His elder brother, Frank, joined theMerchant Navywhen he was still young and the pair had little contact.[15]During this time the family moved around; they lived inCumberlandas well as other areas in England, in addition toWalesand Germany, where Colonel Scott was part of the post-warAllied Control Council.[12]After the war, the Scott family moved back toCounty Durhamand eventually settled onTeesside.[citation needed]
His interest in science fiction began by reading the novels ofH. G. Wellsas a child.[16]He was also influenced by science-fiction films such asIt! The Terror from Beyond Space,The Day the Earth Stood Still, andThem!He said these films "kind of got [him] going a little" but his attention was not fully caught until he sawStanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odyssey, about which he said, "Once I saw that, I knew what I could do."[16]He went toGrangefield Grammar SchoolinStockton on Teesand obtained a diploma in design atWest Hartlepool College of Art.[17]The industrial landscape in West Hartlepool would later inspire visuals inBlade Runner, with Scott stating, "There were steelworks adjacent to West Hartlepool, so every day I'd be going through them, and thinking they're kind of magnificent, beautiful, winter or summer, and the darker and more ominous it got, the more interesting it got."[18]
I use everything I learned every day at art school. It's all about white sheets of paper, pens and drawing.
Scott went on to study at theRoyal College of Artin London, contributing to the college magazineARKand helping to establish the college film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film,Boy and Bicycle, starring both his younger brother and his father (the film was later released on the "Extras" section ofThe DuellistsDVD). In February 1963, Scott was named in the title credits as "Designer" for the BBC television programmeTonight.
After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police seriesZ-Carsand science fiction seriesOut of the Unknown. He was originally assigned to design the secondDoctor Whoserial,The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the serial'seponymous alien creatures. Shortly before he was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant he was replaced byRaymond Cusick.[20]In 1965, he began directing episodes of television series for the BBC, only one of which, an episode ofAdam Adamant Lives!, is available commercially.[21]
In 1968, Ridley and his younger brotherTony Scott– who would also go on to become a film director[22]– founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.[23]Working alongsideAlan Parker,Hugh Hudsonand cinematographerHugh Johnson, Ridley Scott made many commercials at RSA during the 1970s, including a 1973Hovisbread advertisement, "Bike Round" (underscored by the slow movement ofDvořák's "New World" symphonyrearranged for brass), filmed inGold Hill, Shaftesbury, Dorset.[1][24]A nostalgia themed television advert that captured the public imagination, it was voted the UK's favourite commercial in a 2006 poll.[25][26]In the 1970s theChanel No. 5brand needed revitalisation having run the risk of being labelled as mass market and passé.[27]Directed by Scott in the 1970s and 1980s, Chanel television commercials were inventive mini-films with production values of surreal fantasy and seduction, which "played on the same visual imagery, with the same silhouette of the bottle."[27]
Five members of the Scott family are directors, and all have worked for RSA.[28]His brother Tony was a successful film director whose career spanned more than two decades; his sonsJakeandLukeare both acclaimed directors of commercials, as is his daughter,Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles; Luke is based in London. In 1995,Shepperton Studioswas purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds.[29]
The Duellists(1977) marked Ridley Scott's first feature film as director. Shot in continental Europe, it was nominated for the main prize at theCannes Film Festival, and won an award for Best Debut Film.The Duellistshad limited commercial impact internationally. Based onJoseph Conrad's short story "The Duel" and set during theNapoleonic Wars, it follows two FrenchHussarofficers, D'Hubert and Feraud (Keith CarradineandHarvey Keitel) whose quarrel over an initially minor incident turns into a bitter extended feud spanning fifteen years, interwoven with the larger conflict that provides its backdrop. The film has been acclaimed for providing a historically authentic portrayal of Napoleonic uniforms and military conduct.[30][31]The 2013 release of the film on Blu-ray coincided with the publication of an essay on the film in a collection of scholarly essays on Scott.[32]
Scott had originally planned next to adapt a version ofTristan and Iseult, but after seeingStar Wars, he became convinced of the potential of large scale, effects-driven films. He accepted the job of directingAlien, the 1979 horror/science-fiction film that would win him international success. Scott made the decision to switchEllen Ripleyfrom the standard male action hero to aheroine.[33]Ripley (played bySigourney Weaver), who appeared in the first fourAlienfilms, would become a cinematic icon.[33]The final scene ofJohn Hurt's character has been named by a number of publications as one of the most memorable in cinematic history.[34]Filmed atShepperton Studiosin England,Alienwas thesixth highest-grossing film of 1979, earning over $104 million worldwide.[35]Scott was involved in the 2003 restoration and re-release of the original film. In promotional interviews at the time, Scott indicated he had been in discussions to make a fifth film in theAlienfranchise. However, in a 2006 interview, Scott remarked that he had been unhappy aboutAlien: The Director's Cut, feeling that the original was "pretty flawless" and that the additions were merely a marketing tool.[36]Scott later returned toAlien-related projects when he directedPrometheusandAlien: Covenantthree decades after the original film's release.[37]
OutsideStar Wars, no sci-fi universe has been etched into cinematic consciousness more thoroughly thanBlade Runner. Ridley Scott's definitive 1982 neo-noir offered an immersive dystopia of rain-soaked windows and shadowy buildings adorned with animated neon billboards, where flying cars hum through the endless night.
After a year working on the film adaptation ofDune, and following the sudden death of his brother Frank, Scott signed to direct the film version ofPhilip K. Dick's novelDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?Re-titledBlade Runnerand starringHarrison Ford, the film was a commercial disappointment in cinemas in 1982, and was criticised by Pauline Kael in theNew Yorkerwho wrote "...Scott doesn't seem to have a grasp of how to use words as part of the way a movie moves. "Blade Runner" is a suspenseless thriller; it appears to be a victim of its own imaginative use of hardware and miniatures and mattes. At some point, Scott and the others must have decided that the story was unimportant; maybe the booming, lewd and sultry score by Chariots-for-Hire Vangelis that seems to come out of the smoke convinced them that the audience would be moved even if vital parts of the story were trimmed."[39]
In response to the review, Scott said: "...It was four pages of destruction. I never met her. I was so offended. I framed those pages and they've been in my office for 30 years to remind me there's only one critic that counts and that's you. I haven't read critiques ever since. Because if it's a good one, you can get a swollen head and forget yourself. And if it's a bad one, you're so depressed that it's debilitating."[40]The movie is now widely regarded as a classic.[41][42]In 1991, Scott's notes were used byWarner Bros.to create a rusheddirector's cutwhich removed the main character's voiceover and made a number of other small changes, including to the ending. Later Scott personally supervised a digital restoration ofBlade Runnerand approved what was calledThe Final Cut. This version was released in Los Angeles, New York City andTorontocinemas on 5 October 2007, and as an elaborate DVD release in December 2007.[43]
Today,Blade Runneris ranked by many critics as one of the most important and influential science fiction films ever made,[44]partly thanks to its much imitated portraits of a future cityscape.[45]It is often discussed along withWilliam Gibson's novelNeuromanceras initiating thecyberpunkgenre. Stephen Minger, stem cell biologist at King's College London, states, "It was so far ahead of its time and the whole premise of the story – what is it to be human and who are we, where we come from? It's the age-old questions."[46]Scott has describedBlade Runneras his "most complete and personal film".[47]
In 1985, Scott directedLegend, a fantasy film produced byArnon Milchan. Scott decided to create a "once upon a time" tale set in a world of princesses, unicorns and goblins, filming almost entirely inside the studio. Scott castTom Cruiseas the film's hero, Jack;Mia Saraas Princess Lili; andTim Curryas theSatan-horned Lord of Darkness.[48]Scott had a forest set built on the007 StageatPinewood Studiosin Buckinghamshire, with trees 60 feet high and trunks 30 feet in diameter.[49]In the final stages of filming, the forest set was destroyed by fire;Jerry Goldsmith's original score was used for European release, but replaced in North America with a score byTangerine Dream. Rob Bottin provided the film's Academy Award-nominated make-up effects, most notably Curry's red-coloured Satan figure. Despite a major commercial failure on release, the film has gone on to become acult classic. The 2002 Director's Cut restored Goldsmith's original score.[50]
Scott madeSomeone to Watch Over Me, a romantic thriller starringTom BerengerandMimi Rogersin 1987, andBlack Rain(1989), a police drama starringMichael DouglasandAndy García, shot partially in Japan. The latter was very well received at the box office.Black Rainwas the first of Scott's six collaborations with the composerHans Zimmer.[51][52]
In 1984, Scott directed a big-budget ($900,000) television commercial, "1984", to launchApple Computer'sMacintoshcomputer.[53]Scott filmed the advertisement in England for about $370,000;[54]which was given a showcase airing in the US on 22 January 1984, duringSuper Bowl XVIII, alongside screenings in cinemas.[55]Some consider this advertisement a "watershed event" in advertising[56]and a "masterpiece".[57]Advertising Ageplaced it top of its list of the 50 greatest commercials.[58]
Set in a dystopian future modelled afterGeorge Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Four, Scott's advertisement used its hero (portrayed by English athleteAnya Major) to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by her whitetank topadorned with a picture of the Apple Macintosh computer) as a means of saving humanity from "conformity" (Big Brother), an allusion toIBM, at that time the dominant force in computing.[59]
The road filmThelma & Louise(1991) starringGeena Davisas Thelma,Susan Sarandonas Louise, in addition to the breakthrough role forBrad Pittas J.D, proved to be one of Scott's biggest critical successes, helping revive the director's reputation and receiving his first nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Director.[60][61]His next project, independently funded historical epic1492: Conquest of Paradise, was a box office failure. The film recounts the expeditions to the Americas byChristopher Columbus(French starGérard Depardieu). Scott did not release another film for four years.
In 1995, Ridley and his brother Tony formed a production company,Scott Free Productions, in Los Angeles. All Ridley's subsequent feature films, starting withWhite Squall(starringJeff Bridges) andG.I. Jane(starringDemi Moore), have been produced under theScott Freebanner. In 1995 the two brothers purchased a controlling interest in the British film studioShepperton Studios. In 2001, Shepperton merged withPinewood Studiosto becomeThe Pinewood Studios Group, which is headquartered in Buckinghamshire, England.[62]
Scott's historical dramaGladiator(2000) proved to be one of his biggest critical and commercial successes. It won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for the film's starRussell Crowe, and saw Scott nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Director.[2]Scott worked with British visual effects companyThe Millfor the film's computer-generated imagery, and the film was dedicated toOliver Reedwho died during filming – The Mill created a digital body double for Reed's remaining scenes.[63][64]Some have creditedGladiatorwith reviving the nearly defunct "sword and sandal" historical genre. The film was named the fifth best action film of all time in theABCspecialBest in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time.[65]
Scott directedHannibal(2001) starringAnthony Hopkinsas Hannibal Lecter. The film was commercially successful despite receiving mixed reviews. Scott's next film,Black Hawk Down(2001), featuringTom Hardyin his film debut, was based on a group of stranded US soldiers fighting for their lives inSomalia; Scott was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director.[2]In 2003, Scott directed a smaller scale project,Matchstick Men, adapted from the novel byEric Garciaand starringNicolas Cage,Sam RockwellandAlison Lohman. It received mostly positive reviews but performed moderately at the box office.
In 2005, he made the modestly successfulKingdom of Heaven, a film about theCrusades. The film starredOrlando Bloom, and marked Scott's first collaboration with the composerHarry Gregson-Williams.[66]The Moroccan government sent the Moroccan cavalry as extras for some battle scenes.[67]Unhappy with the theatrical version ofKingdom of Heaven(which he blamed on paying too much attention to the opinions of preview audiences in addition to relenting when Fox wanted 45 minutes shaved off), Scott supervised a director's cut of the film, the true version of what he wanted, which was released on DVD in 2006.[68]The director's cut ofKingdom of Heavenhas been met with critical acclaim, withEmpiremagazine calling the film an "epic", adding: "The added 45 minutes in the director's cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle."[69]"This is the one that should have gone out" reflected Scott.[69]Asked if he was against previewing in general in 2006, Scott stated: "It depends who's in the driving seat. If you've got a lunatic doing my job, then you need to preview. But a good director should be experienced enough to judge what he thinks is the correct version to go out into the cinema."[70]
Scott teamed up again withGladiatorstarRussell CroweforA Good Year, based on the best-selling book byPeter Mayleabout an investment banker who finds a new life inProvence. The film was released on 10 November 2006. A few days laterRupert Murdoch, chairman of studio20th Century Fox(who backed the film) dismissedA Good Yearas "a flop" at a shareholders' meeting.[71]
Scott's next film wasAmerican Gangster, based on the story of real-life drug kingpinFrank Lucas. Scott took over the project in early 2006 and had screenwriterSteven Zaillianrewrite his script to focus on the dynamic between Frank Lucas andRichie Roberts.Denzel Washingtonsigned on to the project as Lucas, with Russell Crowe co-starring as Roberts. The film premiered in November 2007 to positive reviews and box office success, and Scott was nominated for aGolden Globe for Best Director.[2]
In late 2008, Scott's espionage thrillerBody of Lies, starringLeonardo DiCaprioand Russell Crowe, opened to lukewarm ticket-sales and mixed reviews. Scott directed a revisionist adaptation ofRobin Hood, which starred Russell Crowe asRobin HoodandCate BlanchettasMaid Marian. It was released in May 2010 to mixed reviews, but a respectable box-office.
On 31 July 2009, news surfaced of a two-part prequel toAlienwith Scott attached to direct.[37][72]The project, ultimately reduced to a single film calledPrometheus, which Scott described as sharing "strands ofAlien's DNA" while not being a direct prequel, was released in June 2012. The film starredCharlize TheronandMichael Fassbender, withNoomi Rapaceplaying the leading role of the scientist named Elizabeth Shaw. The film received mostly positive reviews and grossed $403 million at the box office.[73][74]

The film featured fan footage from throughout the world on what musicianBruce Springsteenmeant to them and how he impacted their lives.[79]The film was released for one day only in 50 countries and on over 2000 film screens on 22 July 2013.[79]
Scott directedThe Counselor(2013), with a screenplay by authorCormac McCarthy.[80][81]On 25 October 2013,Indiewirereported that "Before McCarthy sold his first spec script for Scott's (The Counselor) film, the director was heavily involved in developing an adaptation of the author's 1985 novelBlood Meridianwith screenwriterBill Monahan(The Departed). But as Scott said in aTime Outinterview, '[Studios] didn't want to make it. The book is so uncompromising, which is what's great about it.' Described as an 'anti-western'..."[82]Scott directed thebiblically inspiredepic filmExodus: Gods and Kings, released in December 2014 which received negative reviews from critics (particularly for the casting of white actors asMiddle Easterncharacters) and grossed $268 million worldwide on a $140 million budget, making it afinancial disappointment.

In May 2014, Scott began negotiations to directThe Martian, starringMatt Damonas Mark Watney.[84]Like many of Scott's previous works,The Martianfeatures a heroine in the form ofJessica Chastain's character who is the mission commander.[85]The film was originally scheduled for release on 25 November 2015, but Fox later switched its release date with that ofVictor Frankenstein, and thusThe Martianwas released on 2 October 2015.[86][87]The Martianwas a critical and commercial success, grossed over $630 million worldwide, becoming Scott's highest-grossing film to date.[88][89][90]
A sequel toPrometheus,Alien: Covenant, started filming in 2016, premiered in London on 4 May 2017, and received general release on 19 May 2017.[91]The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praisingMichael Fassbender's dual performance and calling the film a return to form for both director Ridley Scott and the franchise.[92][93]
In August 2011, information leaked about production of asequeltoBlade RunnerbyAlcon Entertainment, with Alcon partnersBroderick JohnsonandAndrew Kosove.[94]Scott informed theVarietypublication in November 2014 that he was no longer the director for the film and would only fulfill a producer's role. Scott also revealed that filming would begin sometime within 2015, and thatHarrison Fordhas signed on to reprise his role from the original film but his character should only appear in "the third act" of the sequel.[95]On 26 February 2015, the sequel was officially confirmed, withDenis Villeneuvehired to direct the film, and Scott being an executive producer.[96]The sequel,Blade Runner 2049, was released on 6 October 2017 to universal acclaim.[97]
From May to August 2017, Scott filmedAll the Money in the World, a drama about thekidnapping of John Paul Getty III, starringMark WahlbergandMichelle Williams.[98][99]Kevin Spaceyoriginally portrayed Getty Sr. However, after multiple sexual assault allegations against the actor, Scott decided to replace him withChristopher Plummer, saying "You can't condone that kind of behaviour in any shape or form. We cannot let one person's action affect the good work of all these other people. It's that simple."[100]Scott began re-shooting Spacey's scenes with Plummer on 20 November, which included filming atElveden Hallin west Suffolk, England.[100]With a release date of 25 December 2017, the film studio had its doubts that Scott would manage it, saying: "They were like, 'You'll never do it. God be with you.'"[100][101]

In 2013, Scott stated that he is anatheist.[143]Although when asked by theBBCin a September 2014 interview if he believes in God, Scott replied:
I'm not sure. I think there's all kinds of questions raised... that's such an exotic question. If we looked at the whole thing practically speaking, the Big Bang occurred and then we go through this evolution of millions, billions of years where, by coincidence, all the right biological accidents came out the right way. To an extent, that doesn't make sense unless there was a controlling decider or mediator in all of that. So who was that? Or what was that? Are we one big grand experiment in the basic overall blink of the universe, or the galaxy? In which case, who is behind it?[144]
Scott's frequent collaboratorRussell Crowecommented, "I like being on Ridley's set because actors can perform [...] and the focus is on the performers."[145]Paul M. Sammon, in his bookFuture Noir: The Making ofBlade Runner, commented in an interview with Brmovie.com that Scott's relationship with his actors has improved considerably over the years.[146]More recently during the filming of Scott's 2012 film,Prometheus,Charlize Theronpraised the director's willingness to listen to suggestions from the cast for improvements in the way their characters are portrayed on screen. Theron worked alongside the writers and Scott to give more depth to her character during filming.[147]When working on epics, Scott states, "there's always the danger that the characters can get swamped" on a large canvas, before adding, "My model isDavid Lean, whose characters never got lost in the proscenium."[148]
Scott's work is identified for its striking visuals, withheroinesalso a common theme.[2][11][149][150]Los Angeles Timesfilm editor Joshua Rothkopf wrote "Scott may be the movies' most consistent stealth feminist".[109]His visual style, incorporating a detailed approach to production design and innovative, atmospheric lighting, has been influential on a subsequent generation of filmmakers.[2][3]James Cameroncommented, "I love Ridley's films and I love his filmmaking, I love the beauty of the photography, I love the visceral sense that you're there, that you're present."[151]Scott commonly uses slow pacing until the action sequences. Examples includeAlienandBlade Runner; theLos Angeles Timescritic Sheila Benson, for example, would call the latter "Blade Crawler" "because it's so damn slow". Scott claims to have aneidetic memory, which he says aids him in visualising and storyboarding the scenes in his films.[152]
Scott has developed a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: "I like working, always, with a minimum of three cameras. [...] So those 50 set-ups [a day] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up. So you're finished. I mean, if you take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and – whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up – then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on."[145]
Artificial intelligenceis a theme that appears in several of Scott's films, includingBlade Runner,Alien, andPrometheus.[153]The 2013 bookThe Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scottidentifies pioneering computer scientistAlan Turingand the philosopherJohn Searleas presenting relevant models of testing artificial intelligence known as theTuring testand theChinese RoomThought Experiment, respectively, in the chapter titled "What's Wrong with Building Replicants", which has been a recurring theme for many of Scott's films.[154]The chapter titled "Artificial Intelligence inBlade Runner,Alien, andPrometheus," concludes by citing the writings ofJohn Stuart Millin the context of Scott's Nexus-6 Replicants inBlade Runner(Rutger Hauer), the androidAsh(Ian Holm) inAlien, and the androidDavid 8(Michael Fassbender) inPrometheus, where Mill is applied to assert that measures and tests of intelligence must also assess actions and moral behaviour in androids to effectively address the themes which Scott explores in these films.[155]
Scott providesaudio commentariesand interviews for all his films where possible. In the July 2006 issue ofTotal Filmmagazine, he stated: "After all the work we go through, to have it run in the cinema and then disappear forever is a great pity. To give the film added life is really cool for both those who missed it and those who really loved it."[70]
The positive reaction to theBlade RunnerDirector's Cutencouraged Scott to re-cut several movies that were a disappointment at the time of their release (includingLegendandKingdom of Heaven), which have been met with acclaim.[69]Today the practice of alternative cuts is more commonplace, though often as a way to make a film stand out in the DVD marketplace by adding new material.
Scott wasknightedin the2003 New Year Honoursfor services to the British film industry.[156]He received his accolade fromQueen Elizabeth IIat an investiture ceremony atBuckingham Palaceon 8 July 2003.[5]Scott admitted feeling "stunned and truly humbled" after the ceremony, saying, "As a boy growing up inSouth Shields, I could never have imagined that I would receive such a special recognition. I am truly humbled to receive this treasured award and believe it also further recognises the excellence of the British film industry."[157]He was appointed aKnight Grand CrossbyKing Charles IIIin 2024.[158]
He has been nominated for threeAcademy Awards for Directing—Thelma & Louise,GladiatorandBlack Hawk Down—as well as threeBritish Academy Film Awardsfor Best Director, fourGolden Globe Awardsfor Best Director, and twoPrimetime Emmy Awards. In 1995, Ridley and his brotherTonyreceived theBAFTAforOutstanding British Contribution To Cinema.[7]In 2018 he received the highest accolade from BAFTA, theBAFTA Fellowship, for lifetime achievement.[4][7]
Scott was inducted into theScience Fiction Hall of Famein 2007.[159]In 2017 the German newspaperFAZcompared Scott's influence on the science fiction film genre to SirAlfred Hitchcock's onthrillersandJohn Ford's onWesterns.[160]In 2011, he received astaron theHollywood Walk of Fame.[161]
Scott has received threeHugo Awardsin the category ofBest Dramatic PresentationforAlien,Blade RunnerandThe Martian.[162][163]In 2012, Scott was among the British cultural icons selected by artist SirPeter Blaketo appear in a new version of his most famous artwork, theBeatles'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Bandalbum cover, to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires to mark his 80th birthday.[164]On 3 July 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by theRoyal College of Artin a ceremony at theRoyal Albert Hallin London at which he described how he still keeps on his office wall his school report placing him 31st out of 31 in his class, and how his teacher encouraged him to pursue what became his passion at art school.[165][166]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
