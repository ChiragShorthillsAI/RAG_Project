Eon Productions Limitedis a Britishfilm productioncompany that primarily produces theJames Bondfilm series. The company is based in London'sPiccadillyand also operates fromPinewood Studiosin the UK.
Eon was started by film producersAlbert R. "Cubby" BroccoliandHarry Saltzmanin July 1961, at the same time they became partners and sought financing forDr. No. The year before they formedDanjaq, which for legal reasons became Eon's holding company, from which it licenses the rights to produce theBondfilms.
Broccoli had been interested in theBondnovel rights for several years but was dissuaded from pursuing the project by his former partner. When they dissolved their relationship he was free to pursue the property, for which Saltzman, a novice to film production, had taken a gamble to acquire. The two were introduced by aNew Yorkwriter who was acquainted with both, and formed a partnership within a week of meeting. The enterprise was and is still a family business, including both wives of the principal partners, as well as several of their progeny, the latter group now carrying on their parents' work. Albert almost immediately includedDana Broccoli's college-aged sonMichael G. Wilsonin the early films, doing various production jobs.
In 1975, after nine films, Harry Saltzman sold his shares of Danjaq toUnited Artists(UA). Although Albert R. Broccoli died in 1996, Eon Productions is still owned by the Broccoli family, specifically Albert R. Broccoli's daughter,Barbara Broccoli, and his stepson and her half-brother by actress Dana Wilson Broccoli, Michael G. Wilson, who are the current producers of the films.
In February 2025,Amazon MGM Studiosand Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced the formation of a joint venture that would manage the franchise rights to James Bond, giving Amazon MGM full creative control from the Broccoli family.[2]
Albert R. Broccoli's name has appeared in the opening "presents" credit of every Eon-producedJames Bondfilm, and as the first name in the credits fromThe Spy Who Loved Meonwards. FromDr. NothroughThe Man with the Golden Gun, the credit was "Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli present"; for some films Broccoli came first. After Saltzman left, the opening credit was "Albert R. Broccoli presents" through toGoldenEye, which was the last film produced before Broccoli's death, even after Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson replaced him as producers. On all films since Broccoli's death, the opening credit is "Albert R. Broccoli's Eon Productions presents", with "Ltd." usually added after "Productions" in the film proper.[3]
The 1965 filmThunderballdiffers from the others in how it credits Saltzman and Broccoli; due to a legal agreement withKevin McCloryrelated to the rights to Ian Fleming's original novel, McClory received producer credit on the film, with Saltzman and Broccoli credited as executive producers. This agreement also gave McClory the rights to remakeThunderballin the future, resulting in the 1983 non-Eon production,Never Say Never Again. McClory would attempt to remake the story a second time in the 1990s, but was prevented from doing so. In 1999, Eon picked up the rights to theCasino Royalenovel after a lawsuit betweenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) andSony Picturesended as part of a trade deal that saw Sony acquiring MGM's interest in theSpider-Manfilm rights.[4]
The copyrights and trademarks for the film properties which began withDr. No, are held by Danjaq and United Artists Corporation; United Artists was bought by MGM in 1981, but as an MGM subsidiary its name still appears in Bond copyright and trademark disclaimers.Casino Royale(2006),Quantum of Solace(2008),Skyfall(2012) andSpectre(2015) were co-distributed withSony Pictures Releasingthrough itsColumbia Pictureslabel.[5]With the revival of United Artists – formed as a joint venture between MGM andAnnapurna Picturesunder the labelUnited Artists Releasing– as well as the expiration of Columbia Pictures' deal with the Bond franchise, the distribution ofNo Time to Die(2021) is shared between United Artists Releasing (domestically) andUniversal Pictures(internationally), while Danjaq retains the essential rights to the film.
The distribution rights for all of Eon's films are owned byMGM Home Entertainment, and were controlled by MGM's distributorWarner Bros. Home Entertainment(previously20th Century Fox Home Entertainment).[3][6]Sony Pictures Home Entertainmentinitially assumed the home video rights toCasino Royale, but the 2012 home video editions of this film were issued by MGM and 20th Century Fox.[3]Since 2020, WBHE took over the home entertainment distribution rights to the Bond films after MGM ended their home media agreement with Fox in June 2020, excluding the home media release ofNo Time to Die(which is handled byUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment, although both companies own a joint venture called Studio Distribution Services).[7][8]
TheBondfilms produced by Eon Productions are:
Other production companies were responsible for theBondproductionsCasino Royale(1954),Casino Royale(1967) andNever Say Never Again(1983); the first is a one-hour TV film produced for an anthology series and the others are feature films produced for the cinema.Never Say Never Againis a remake ofThunderball.
Since its first film,Dr. Noin 1962, Eon has made eight non-Bondfilms. Saltzman and Broccoli produced other films separately: Broccoli produced the filmChitty Chitty Bang Bang, based on a book byIan Fleming; Saltzman produced several non-Bondfilms during this time includingThe Ipcress FileandBattle of Britain.
Other non-Bondprojects from either 1963 or 1964 –The Marriage Gamewritten byTerry Southernand to have been directed byPeter Yates[9][10]andThe Pass Beyond Kashmirbased on the novel byBerkely Mather– did not go into production.[11]
In 2008, Eon signed a deal with Columbia Pictures to develop fifteen thrillers and family films outside theBondfranchise, with budgets of up to $80 million (£40 million). The company hopes the move will allow more British writers to establish themselves in the United States.[12]
Eon Productions produced the adaptation of Mark Burnell's first book in theStephanie Patrickseries, titledThe Rhythm Section. StarringBlake Livelyand directed byReed Morano, and distributed byParamount Pictures.[13][14]The film was released on 31 January 2020.[15]

Eon has made several theatre productions,[17]includingChitty Chitty Bang Bang, based on a book byIan Fleming, andOthello, starringDaniel Craig.

Neal Purvis(born 9 September 1961) andRobert Wade(born 1962) are British screenwriters who co-wrote sevenJames Bond films, from 1999'sThe World Is Not Enoughto 2021'sNo Time to Die,[1][2]as well as other works.
Purvis's father was a photographer, and as a teenager, Purvis was in a film club that focused on 1940s cinema.[3]
Wade was born inPenarthand lived there until he was 11.[4]His mother was an artist, and from an early age he wanted to be a writer and began making home-made films as a teenager.[3]
They met each other while attending theUniversity of Kent, when they were assigned as roommates.[3]They began playing in a band together, which they continued to do for at least 20 years.[3]Purvis left Kent and completed a BA in Film and Photo Arts.[3]Wade graduated from Kent and moved to London where he was later joined by Purvis.[3]They spent six years writing scripts together as well asghost writingfor music videos.[3]
Wade and Purvis' screenplay forLet Him Have It(1991) (based on the true story ofDerek Bentley, a young man who gets caught up in street gangs in post war London and is later controversially hanged), displayed the writers' "outrage toward a system hell-bent on vengeance"[5]and was called "first rate, no non-sense".[6]
Barbara Broccoli, producer of theJames Bond films, hired Wade and Purvis to write their first Bond script because she had seen their filmPlunkett & Macleane(1999) and liked that it was "dark, witty, sexy and inventive".[7]Purvis described their approach when they joined the Bond franchise as to "come in with ideas, things we've found in science magazines, on the internet, interesting weapons and what's happening in technology. Then we find a journey for Bond to go through."[8]In their Bond collaborations, Wade generally does "all the verbiage at the beginning of the script."[9]They created a novelisation of their Bond script forThe World Is Not Enoughin collaboration withRaymond Benson.[10]Wade and Purvis also wrote a script for a Bond spin-off featuring theDie Another DaycharacterJinx(Halle Berry), which was attached to directorStephen Frears, but cancelled by MGM because of budget concerns and "creative differences".[11]
Their 2003 Bond parody,Johnny English, received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, receiving a 33% "rotten" rating at the review siteRotten Tomatoes.[12]However, the film earned $160.5 million in its global box office receipts.[13]A sequel,Johnny English Reborn, based upon their characters but written byHamish McColl, was released in 2011.[13][14]
Purvis and Wade wrote[15]and produced[16]Return to Sender(also known asConvicted), which was described as a "gripping tale" of a man "fighting to prevent a miscarriage of justice".[15]They had originally written the script while doing research for their first film 14 years earlier.[17]
In 2005, they co-authored the bio-picStoned(also known asThe Wild and Wycked World of Brian Jones) about the last days of the life ofThe Rolling Stonesco-founder,Brian Jones, which they based on an account from a builder on the farm where Jones died, claiming that Jones's death was not accidental as recorded by the coroner.[18]The film was criticised for "fail[ing] to convey what mattered about Jones artistically, what he contributed to music, why we should feel more than pity."[18]
WhenDaniel Craigwas signed on as the new Bond, Wade described their approach to screenwriting thus: "When you have an actor you play to his strengths ... He's got this great toughness to him but not an unthinking toughness. I think that's where the films will need to go."[19]Their first work for Craig as Bond,Casino Royale, was nominated for aBAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay,[20]and received a 4/4 review from Roger Ebert, who stated that the film "has the answers to all my complaints about the forty-five-year-old James Bond series, and some I hadn't even thought of."[21]However, their followupQuantum of Solace, which was not based on anyIan Flemingwork, was criticized because while having "the right ingredients: plenty of car, plane or boat chases ... spooks, vendettas, and turncoats", it lacked the "magic, and a decent plot."[22]
Their screenplay forSkyfall, which they co-wrote withJohn Logan, was described by Frank DiGiacomo ofMovielineas being "very wily" for having Bond experience amid-life crisis.[23]In 2012, it was announced that "after a tremendous run" with the Bond franchise, Wade and Purvis would not be involved in the 24th Bond film, which would be solo written by Logan.[1]However, on 27 June 2014, it was announced that they were being brought on to polish the screenplay for the next film.[24]In November 2014,  it was announced that the BBC has commissioned Wade and Purvis to adaptLen Deighton's 1978 novelSS-GB.It was broadcast on BBC One in five one-hour episodes from 19 February 2017 and 19 March 2017.
On 10 March 2017 it was reported that they were approached to write the script forNo Time to Die.[25]In July 2017, it was initially reported they would write the script,[26]but in May 2018, EON announced that directorDanny Boylewas instead working with his regular collaboratorJohn Hodgeon a new script.[27]In September 2018, following Boyle's departure from the project, Purvis and Wade were re-hired to write a new script.[28]
Wade and his wife live in West Sussex and have four children.[4]

Léa Seydoux was born on 1 July 1985,[9][10]the daughter of businessman Henri Seydoux and philanthropist Valérie Schlumberger. She was born inPassy, in the16th arrondissementof Paris, and grew up inSaint-Germain-des-Présin the6th arrondissement.[11]She had a strictProtestantupbringing,[12]but she is not religious.[13]Seydoux is one of seven children. She has three older half-siblings (Marine Bramly, Noé Saglio and Ondine Saglio) from her mother's first marriage to Christian Saglio, an older sister, stylistCamille Seydouxfrom her parents' marriage, and a further two paternal half-brothers, Ismaël Seydoux and Omer Seydoux, from her father's marriage to modelFarida Khelfa.[14]
Seydoux's parents are both partly ofAlsatiandescent. Her father is a great-grandson of businessman and inventorMarcel Schlumberger, while her mother is a granddaughter of Marcel's brother, Maurice Schlumberger.[15][16]The family name came to exist in 1902,[17]when Seydoux's great-great-grandfather Charles-Louis-Auguste-Jacques Seydoux (1870–1929) married Mathilde, daughter of Languedoc aristocrat François Fornier de Clausonne de Lédenon, whose family held thetitlesof Baron de Lédenon andseigneurde Clausonne, de Laugnac et de la Bastide d'Albe.[17][18][19][20][21]The Seydoux family is widely known in France and influential in the movie industry. Her grandfather,Jérôme Seydoux, is the chairman ofPathé;[22]her granduncle, Nicolas Seydoux, is the chairman ofGaumont;[22]her other granduncle,Michel Seydoux, also a cinema producer, is the chairman of theLille-based football clubLille OSC; and her father is the founder and CEO of the French wireless companyParrot.[23]She has stated that her family initially took no interest in her film career and did not help her, and that she and her influential grandfather were not close.[23][24][25]As a child, she had no desire to act. She instead wanted to be an opera singer,[13][26]studying music at theConservatoire de Paris.[27]Seydoux said: "I had a beautiful voice, but I lost it. I was too shy. I went to theConservatoire de Paris, and I tried to learn how to properly sing. It was too difficult. You have to do all the breathing exercises. You have to have a very strict regimen".[28]
Seydoux's parents divorced when she was three years old and they were often away,[24]her mother in Africa and her father on business, which, combined with her large family, meant that she "felt lost in the crowd... I was very lonely as a kid. Really, I always had the feeling I was an orphan".[23]Through her family involvement in media and entertainment, Seydoux grew up acquainted with prominent artists such as photographerNan Goldin, musiciansLou ReedandMick Jaggerand footwear designerChristian Louboutin, who is her godfather.[23]For six years, Seydoux went tosummer campinMaryland, at the behest of her father, who wanted her to learn to speak English.[29][30]
"My grandfather Jérôme has never felt the slightest interest in my career. [My family] have never lifted a finger to help me. Nor have I asked for anything, ever."
Her mother Valérie Schlumberger is a former actress-turned-philanthropist and the founder of the boutiqueCompagnie d'Afrique du Sénégal et de l'Afrique de l'ouest(CSAO), which promotes the work of African artists. Seydoux once worked as a model for their jewellery lineJokko. Schlumberger, who lived inSenegalas a teenager, is also the founder of the charitable organisationsAssociation pour le Sénégal et l'Afrique de l'Ouest(ASAO) andEmpire des enfants, a centre for homeless children inDakar, of which Seydoux is the "godmother".[13][23]
Seydoux describes her youthful self as short-haired, slightly dishevelled, and widely viewed as a bit strange: "People liked me, but I always felt like a misfit".[12]Still concerned for her shyness in adulthood, Seydoux has admitted to having had an anxiety crisis during the2009 Cannes Film Festival,[32]saying: 'I'll never beSophie Marceau, I'm too weird'. Later, she stated: "In the middle of the Cannes hysteria, I felt fragile and vulnerable. I made this comparison because I'll never be France's "petite fiancée".Sophie Marceaurepresents anything, while I don't have a definite place. But it's not a problem, it's an observation".[33]
Seydoux has stated that as a child she wanted to become anoperasinger, studying music at theConservatoire de Paris, but eventually her shyness compelled her to drop the idea.[34][35]It was not until the age of eighteen that she decided to become an actress.[36]One of her close friends was an actor, and Seydoux has said: "I found his life wonderful, I thought, 'Oh my God, you can travel, you're free, you can do what you want, you're the boss.'"[29][37]She fell in love with an actor and decided to become an actress to impress him.[29]Years later, Seydoux revealed that this actor was her longtime friend,Louis Garrel.[38]She took acting classes at French drama schoolLes Enfants Terribles,[22]having Jean-Bernard Feitussi as her close friend and mentor,[39]and in 2007 she took further training atNew York'sActors Studiowith Corinne Blue.

In 2009, she had a major part inJessica Hausner'sLourdes,[34]and a small role in her first Hollywood film,Quentin Tarantino'sInglourious Basterds. In 2010, she starred alongsideRussell CroweinRidley Scott'sRobin Hood, playingIsabella of Angoulême. That same year, she appeared inLouis Garrel's short-filmPetit Tailleur,[43]Rebecca Zlotowski'sBelle Épine,[44]which earned her a secondCésar Awardnomination forMost Promising Actress, andRaúl Ruiz'sMysteries of Lisbon.[45]Seydoux auditioned and was one of the four finalists,[46][47]to playLisbeth SalanderinThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, but the part ultimately went to actressRooney Mara.[35]Seydoux recalled in an interview: "I got upset, but I don't think I'd be able to do anything to get that part. It was totally against my nature. I worked hard, but Lisbeth was almost anorexic. I wasn't like that".[12][22]
In 2011, she played Gabrielle in the romantic comedyMidnight in Paris.[48]Later, Seydoux participated in another Hollywood production,Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, in which she played the assassin Sabine Moreau alongside starsTom CruiseandJeremy Renner.

More generally, Léa Seydoux's career accelerated from 2012 and allowed the actress to choose her projects from the requests she received, without necessarily having to go through screen tests.[50]According to the specialist press, the young woman then appeared as one of the "essential French actresses in Hollywood",[51]and even as "the most sought-after actress of her generation", who at only 26 years-old, "has always made the right choices and has tackled almost all genres".[52]In the process, she became the image of the perfumeCandyfor the Italian luxury groupPrada.[53]
In 2012, she starred inFarewell, My Queen. The film opened the62nd Berlin International Film Festival, where it was met with critical acclaim.[54][55]Critics praised directorBenoît Jacquot's decision to cast Seydoux in the key-role of Sidonie, stating "her luminous but watchful eyes suggest a soul wise beyond her years."[56]Kenneth Turan of theLos Angeles Timeswrote that Seydoux was an excellent choice for the part, calling her a remarkably versatile young actress and pointed to the stark difference in her characters from her previous roles inMidnight in ParisandMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.[57]That same year, she appeared in the Swiss drama film,Sister. The film competed in competition at the62nd Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Special Award, theSilver Bear, and was selected as the Swiss entry for theBest Foreign Language Oscarat the85th Academy Awards.[58][59][60]Critics again praised Seydoux for bringing a strong array of emotions to a highly unsympathetic part and called her performance intensely moving.[61][62]That year, Seydoux was attached to star inMichael Gondry'sMood Indigo, but had to drop out before filming due to scheduling conflicts withBlue Is the Warmest Colour, being replaced byCharlotte Le Bon. By the end of 2012, she had filmedBlue Is the Warmest ColourbyAbdellatif Kechiche, andGrand CentralbyRebecca Zlotowski, both exhibited at the66th Cannes Film Festival.
"It's true that I'm in high demand and I've learned to say no to higher-paying films so that I can work on projects that are close to my heart, like Sister. And then I had to give up Michel Gondry's Mood Indigo to finish Kechiche's film. In general, I try not to put too much pressure on myself. I know that I'm very lucky. And also that there will be times in my career when I'll have fewer offers."
In 2013, Seydoux was nominated forBest Actressat the38th César Awardsfor her role as Sidonie Laborde inBenoît Jacquot'sFarewell, My Queen. Later that year at the66th Cannes Film Festival,Blue Is the Warmest Colourwon thePalme d'Orand the jury, headed bySteven Spielberg, took the unusual move of awarding the prize not just to the directorAbdellatif Kechiche, but also to the film's two stars, Seydoux andAdèle Exarchopoulos.[36][64]Seydoux stated: "Winning that honor was such a thing. It's engraved in me". Also remarking that "attending theCannes Film Festivalwill always remind me of that big moment of my life".[65]

What holds you, as much as the actor's natural magnetism, is her ability to hold things back, her talent for emotional reserve".[93]Hansen-Løvedeclared herself to be a huge admirer of Seydoux as an actor, as well as her choices throughout her vast filmography, saying: "A lot of [her] characters are very sophisticated, very glamorous. In the past, it felt she was seen by male directors as a bit of a fantasy. I wanted her to be more down-to-earth, closer to us, closer to me. And I had the feeling there was a rawness about her that my film could maybe emphasize". In addition, Seydoux stated that "it's the first time that I really played a normal woman, the girl next door".[94]

In January 2024, Seydoux revealed in an interview withTéléramathat she had recently completed two weeks of filming for an unannounced new film byQuentin Dupieux, then titledÀ notre beau métier(To Our Beautiful Profession), which would also starLouis Garrel,Raphaël QuenardandVincent Lindon. Seydoux read the script in one sitting and quickly accepted the role out of admiration forDupieux, who she described as an "extraordinary filmmaker" whose style of humour "hides an increasingly social depth, through imperfect and clumsy characters". She described the film as amise en abymeabout "actors who play in a lousy film" and confront their characters and lines, and appraised it as "crazy" and "very, very funny".[112]Production for the film was kept fully secret from beginning to end.[113]The Second Actwas selected to be the opening film at the77th Cannes Film Festival, where it had its world premiere out-of-competition on 14 May 2024.

Seydoux has modelled for numerous magazines and brands, but sees herself "always as an actress",[27]not as a model.[26][124]In 2007, she participated in theLevi'stelevision advert "DangerousLiaison" alongsideRaphael Personaz, and has been seen in several photo editorials, including forVogue Paris,American Vogue,Numéro,L'Officiel,CRASH,Another MagazineandW magazine. She fronted the 2013 campaign for South Korean-based but French-inspired jewellery lineDidier Dubotand appeared inRag & Bone's Fall 2013 campaign withMichael Pitt.[125][126]
She also appeared in a nude pictorial for French men's magazineLui.[24]In addition, Seydoux and herBlue Is the Warmest Colourco-starAdèle Exarchopouloswere featured inMiu Miu's 2014 resort ad campaign.[127]Seydoux advertised forPrada's 2012Resortline; and is the face of its 2013 campaign for the fragrancesPrada Candy(shot byJean-Paul Goude),Prada Candy L'Eau(directed byWes AndersonandRoman Coppola),[22][128][129]and the 2014 campaign forPrada Candy Floraleperfume (shot bySteven Meisel).[130]
For most of the 2010s, the actress was dressed for her red carpet appearances by her own sister, fashion designerCamille Seydoux, whose career took off when she dressed Seydoux for theCésar Awardsceremony in 2011. The duo then appeared several times in the rankings of the best dressed actresses in France and abroad.[131]
Since 2016, Seydoux has been a brand ambassador forLouis Vuitton.[7][8]
Regularly present on the big screen in the 2010s and 2020s with nearly four films shot per year,[132]Léa Seydoux has earned a reputation for excelling in ambiguous and minimalist acting, in restraint, inviting the viewer to invest themselves in trying to unravel the mystery of her characters. Directors, screenwriters and on-screen partners see in her an actress who does a lot with little, and who makes her scenes richer than they appear through her presence and vulnerability.[133][134][135]At the beginning of her career, the actress oscillated between two types of characters in particular, "inconsolable melancholic" or "poisonous solar". The precision of her diction, despite the "machine-gun flow" she can adopt is noted, as is her indifference to having to sometimes undress in front of the camera, which she attributes to the fact of having been raised by a mother "with a loving gaze".[136]Her characters are regularly objects of desire, filmed from the point of view of a male fantasy;[137]since the filming ofBlue Is the Warmest Colour, however, she has been more attentive to the shots of these nude scenes and checks the shots on the monitor.[138]
According to her directors, the actress has a timeless physique that would allow her to project all kinds of narrative issues and social origins onto her characters,[139]and would particularly facilitate her casting in period films, whether she is a maid to Marie Antoinette or a chambermaid.[140]The variety in her choice of films and roles leadsThe New York Timesto recognize that it is difficult to place her in a single register, even if she is always identified with her "presence at once seductive and discreet".[141]
Seydoux is seen as a "director's actress", whose performance closely follows the direction adopted by the film's director to adapt to the chosen style.[142]This approach explains the fact that a large part of her filmography is made up of collaborations with the same people:Wes Anderson(four),Bertrand Bonello(three),Rebecca Zlotowski(two),Ildikó Enyedi(two),Benoît Jacquot(two),Arnaud Desplechin(two). Several directors design or write their films with Seydoux in mind, such asAnderson,DesplechinorMia Hansen-Løve.[143]She compares her philosophy to a statement byIsabelle Huppert, in which the actress said that she made her own film within each film she made,[144]and considers the actor as co-author of the film in the same way as the director.[145][146]The actress does not rely entirely on her instinct, as she continually searches for the character of her character,[147]demanding additional takes to move from one mood to another,[148]and is completely invested in satisfying the director's vision.[149][150]Ursula Meier, who won the Silver Bear in Berlin as a director inSister, said that "she has a grace, something unique. You can project whatever you want onto her, as a spectator or as a director. That's why she is so desired".[151]
Acting style
Seydoux is praised by her versatility and her bold choices as an actor. Yasmin Omar fromCurzonwrote in 2024: "You never know what you're going to get when you sit down to watch a Léa Seydoux film. She could be a tattoo-sleeved pothead, a sexually reawakened widow or a gun-toting assassin. She could be a misbehaving nun, a mentally unstable news anchor or a disfigured performance artist".[152]
"When I act, I enter a trance state. I don't know if it's a state of absolute self-forgetfulness or total self-awareness. It's very violent, sometimes it overwhelms me. I'm excessive in the way I feel the world."
The New York Timesplaces Seydoux in a line of actresses that includesJeanne MoreauandPaulette Goddard.[154]For the Swiss dailyLe Temps,the actress, "at ease in blockbusters and art films, with her undeniably feline beauty, a little lunar, even stubborn, and the veil of melancholy tempering the disapproval of her gaze, is as beautiful as a prey as a predator, as common as an aristocrat".[155]The Village Voicesees her as "always captivating", hiding layer after layer of vulnerability.[156]Physically,Libérationdetects in her "pale similarities toAnna Karina";[157]forTélérama, her complexion and her blondness evoke the young women in the paintings ofRenoirorBotticelli.[158]Her easily recognizable smile, with a space between the two central incisors, also reminded several newspapers of the appearance and presence ofBrigitte Bardot.[159][160][161]
Thierry Frémaux, general delegate of theCannes Film Festival, where Seydoux was one of the most frequent guests in the 2010s, states that she "owes nothing to a recognized lineage, she came out of nowhere and remains unpredictable, inventing herself, according to her wishes, the multiple requests of which she is the subject: from pure French auteur cinema to American blockbusters. Léa isBrigitte Bardot, plusJuliette Binoche, plusKate Moss, and sometimes all three at the same time".[162]
Seydoux says she is a big admirer ofCatherine Deneuve, whose acting she considers "full of instinctive intelligence and self-mockery",[163]andIsabelle Huppert, for the same intelligence, culture and sensitivity.[164]In return,Deneuvesent her congratulations in 2022 for her role inThe Story of My Wife.[165]In interviews, Seydoux says she watches few films, and generally films that are not from contemporary cinema,[166]such as her favourite film,A Place in the SunbyGeorge Stevens.[167]She mentionsStanley Kubrick,Ingmar Bergman,Robert Bresson,Éric RohmerandPedro Almodóvaras her favourite directors.[168]
In the media
The most sought-after French actress of her generation, Léa Seydoux is often compared toMarion Cotillard, ten years her senior, with whom she shares a similar international career and critical success.[169]Téléramaalso unites them by acclaiming them in 2021 as the "two best [French] exports".[170]In the French cinema landscape, the actress emerges as a discreet star, absent from the tabloid press[171]and social media, and uncomfortable in interviews.[172][173]When campaigning for her films, the actress can be disarming with her spontaneity and her tendency to go beyond promotional conventions, for example by talking about a film other than the one she is supposed to discuss with a journalist or expressing surprise at the marketing resources made available to promote a film.[174][175]
During the 2010s, the actress's career became almost inseparable from the prestigiousCannes Film Festival: the business magazinesLe Figaro,The Hollywood ReporterandDeadlinenoted that she had become one of its biggest regulars, presenting at least one film in competition almost every year, which often won one of the prizes at stake,[176]when she herself was not a member of the jury; appearing in four films selected for the festival in 2021 would also constitute a record of 18.[177]In 2021,Deadlinenoted that since Seydoux's first invitation to the festival, she had achieved the status of "one of France's most beloved exports".[178]The international news agencyAssociated Pressechoes many media in summarizing in 2022 that Léa Seydoux, who has become one of the most famous faces of European cinema and a notable actress in each of her forays into Hollywood, "reigns at Cannes".[179]
Seydoux's godfather is footwear designer,Christian Louboutin.[180]
Seydoux lives in Paris.[181]She has been in a relationship with André Meyer since 2013.[182]In September 2016, Seydoux announced that she and Meyer were expecting their first child.[183][184]On 18 January 2017, she gave birth to a son, George.[185]
In the wake of theHarvey Weinstein sexual abuse casesand theMeToo movementin 2017, she accusedHarvey Weinsteinofsexual assault.[186]
Seydoux defines herself as an extremely sensitive person.[187]Seydoux has expressed a preference for defining herself by the term "actor" rather than "actress", saying: "I really don't feel like an actress, I feel like an actor".[188]
In 2019,Reader's Digestnamed her in their list of "Amazing French actresses in film history".[189]In 2020, Seydoux was included onVogue's list of "The most beautiful French actresses of all time".[190]In 2022, she was made aChevalier(Knight) of the Legion of Honourby the French government.[191][192]
In July 2021, Seydoux tested positive for COVID despite being fully vaccinated and asymptomatic, which caused her to miss the74th Cannes Film Festival, where she had four films at that year's selection.[193]
Seydoux has repeatedly expressed her contentment in being an international actress, and also finding it easier to be a woman on screen in Europe,[194]saying: "My strength is that I’m able to travel and adapt. I have more freedom because I'm a European actress, which suits me. I'm not trying to be popular, I'm just trying to enjoy myself."[195]She added: "I would be sad to be only a French actress, only doing films in France. And I would've been sad to be an actress in Hollywood. I think that the system in America is really difficult because you have to be desirable all the time. You're not allowed to age, which is something that is quite scary. You have to stay young forever. It's like an injunction. And it's just a lie. In France, they have more indulgence with women. I'm not thinking, 'Fuck, this is going to stop'. I want to age in front of the camera".[196][197]
In September 2023, Seydoux was absent from the premiere ofThe Beastat the80th Venice International Film Festival, in support of the2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[198]
In June 2024, Seydoux signed a petition addressed to French PresidentEmmanuel Macrondemanding that France officially recognise theState of Palestine.[199]
In December 2024, Seydoux was included onThe Independent's list of "The 60 best actors of the 21st-century".[200]
In 2016, Seydoux was honoured with theChevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters.[210]In 2018, Seydoux was invited to join theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[211]

De Armas was born inHavana, Cuba,[1]and raised inSanta Cruz del Norte.[2]Her maternal grandparents wereSpanish migrants to Cubafrom the regions ofLeónandPalencia, both in the north of Spain.[3][4]Her father Ramón had various jobs, including a bank manager, teacher, school principal and deputy mayor of a town.[5]He previously studied philosophy at a Soviet university.[5][6]Her mother Ana worked in the human resources section of the Ministry of Education.[7][8][9]De Armas has one older brother, Javier, a US–based photographer[5][10]who, in 2020, was questioned by Cuban police due to his critical stance onDecree 349and his links to artists under government surveillance.[11]While de Armas grew up withfood rationing, fuel shortages and electricity blackouts during Cuba'sSpecial Period,[5][12]she has described her early life as happy.[7]
During her childhood and adolescence, de Armas had no Internet access and had limited knowledge of popular culture beyond Cuba.[13]She was allowed to watch "20 minutes of cartoons on Saturday and the Sunday movie matinee."[14]Her family did not own a video or DVD player, and she watched Hollywood movies in her neighbor's apartment.[15]She memorized and practiced monologues in front of a mirror,[16][17]and decided to become an actress when she was 12.[18]In 2002, aged 14, she successfully auditioned to join Havana'sNational Theatre of Cuba.[7][19]She sometimes hitchhiked to attend the "rigorous" course.[20][21]While a student, she filmed three movies.[5][8]She left the four-year drama course shortly before presenting her final thesis because Cuban graduates are forbidden from leaving the country without first completing three years of mandatory service to the community.[8][22]At age 18, with Spanish citizenship through her maternal grandparents,[3][12]she moved toMadridto pursue an acting career.[8]
In her native Cuba, de Armas had a starring role oppositeÁlex GonzálezinManuel Gutiérrez Aragón's romantic dramaUna rosa de Francia(2006).[12]Cuban actorJorge Perugorríasuggested that the director consider de Armas for the role, after meeting her while attending a birthday party with his daughters.[23][24]The director visited de Armas's drama school and interrupted the sixteen-year-old during her audition to inform her that the role was hers.[23][25]She travelled to Spain as part of a promotional tour for the film and was introduced to Juan Lanja, who would later become her Spanish agent.[23]She then starred in the movieEl edén perdido(2007) and had a supporting role inFernando Pérez'sMadrigal(2007), filmed at night without the permission of her drama school tutors.[8]
At age 18, de Armas moved to Madrid. Within two weeks of arriving, she met with casting director Luis San Narciso, who had seen her inUna rosa de Francia.[13]Two months later,[26]he cast her as Carolina in the dramaEl Internado,[8]in which she starred for six seasons from 2007 to 2010. The television show, set in a boarding school, became popular with viewers and made de Armas a celebrity figure in Spain.[8]In a break from filming, she starred in the successful coming-of-age comedyMentiras y Gordas(2009).[27]Despite the popularity ofEl Internado, de Armas felt typecast and was mainly offered roles as youngsters.[13]She asked to be written out of the show in its second to last season.[28]
After spending a few months living in New York City to learn English,[22]de Armas was persuaded to return to Spain to star in seventeen episodes of the historical dramaHispania(2010–2011).[2]She then starred inAntonio Trashorras's horror filmsEl callejón(2011) andAnabel(2015),[29]and in the dramaPor un puñado de besos(2014).[30]During a long period without acting work,[20]de Armas participated in workshops atTomaz Pandur's Madrid theatre company[5]and felt "very anxious" about the lack of momentum in her career.[14]
With encouragement from her newly hired Hollywood agent, she decided to move to Los Angeles.[13]When de Armas first arrived in Los Angeles in 2014,[31]she had to start her career again "from scratch."[15]She spoke very little English and, during early auditions, she often "didn't even know what [she] was saying."[6]She spent four months in full-time education to learn English,[32][28]not wanting to be confined to playing characters written specifically for Latina actresses.[8]She starred oppositeKeanu Reevesin her first Hollywood release—Eli Roth's erotic thrillerKnock Knock(2015)—and learned her lines phonetically.[33]Despite giving a positive review of the film, Randy Cordova of theArizona Republicfound de Armas to be "unconvincing" in her role.[34]Reeves then telephoned de Armas to invite her to star in a Spanish-language role in the thrillerDaughter of Godwhich he acted in and produced.[35]Producer Mark Downie hoped the film would be a star vehicle for de Armas, but due to executive meddling,Daughter of Godwas severely edited with de Armas' former starring role reduced. The film was ultimately released asExposedin 2016.[36][37]Frank ScheckofThe Hollywood Reporternoted that while she was "appealing" in her part, de Armas was unable to demonstrate her "character's intense emotional demands."[38]
De Armas had a supporting role inTodd Phillips'sWar Dogs(2016), acting oppositeMiles Telleras the wife of an arms dealer, and again learned her lines phonetically.[39]David Ehrlich of IndieWire found her to be "memorable in a thankless role".[40]She starred oppositeÉdgar Ramírezin the biopicHands of Stone(2016) as the wife of Panamanian boxerRoberto Durán. Despite its delayed release,Hands of Stonewas the first Hollywood film de Armas had filmed. She was contacted by directorJonathan Jakubowiczwhile still living in Madrid after watching her inEl Internado[28]and asked her to travel to Los Angeles to audition for the Spanish-language part.[12]In reviewing the film, Christy Lemire ofRogerEbert.comdescribed de Armas as "a hugely charismatic presence. But except for a couple of showy moments, she gets little to do besides function as the dutiful wife."[41]
InDenis Villeneuve's futuristic thrillerBlade Runner 2049(2017), de Armas had a supporting role as Joi, theholographicAIgirlfriend ofRyan Gosling's character, a blade runner. Mark Kermode ofThe Guardiansaid she "brings three-dimensional warmth to a character who is essentially a digital projection."[42]Anthony Lane ofThe New Yorkerfound her to be "wondrous": "Whenever Joi appears, the movie's imaginative heart begins to race."[43]While the performance was initially discussed as a breakthrough role,[44][31]the film underperformed commercially, and de Armas spent much of the following year in her native Cuba, where she purchased a house.[33]For her performance, she earned a nomination for theSaturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. Also in 2017, she had a supporting role in the action thrillerOverdriveas the love interest toScott Eastwood's character.[45]Stephen Dalton ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote that she "radiates more kick-ass charisma than her thankless sidekick role might suggest."[46]

She played a Dominican woman withcongestive heart failurein the short film, funded byMontefiore Medical Centerto raise awareness of organ donation.[47]While de Armas's scenes oppositeHimesh Patelin the 2019 romantic comedyYesterdaywere included in the film's trailer, they were cut from the final product. The directorDanny Boylesaid that, while de Armas was "really radiant" in her scenes, the introduction of a love triangle subplot did not test well with audiences.[48]
De Armas's role as an immigrant nurse in the ensemble murder mystery filmKnives Out(2019), written and directed byRian Johnson, was widely praised and marked a breakthrough for the actress.[49]When first approached about the project, she was unenthusiastic about the idea of playing a stereotypical "Latina caretaker" but soon realized that her character was "so much more than that."[50]Tom Shone ofThe Timesremarked, "The film's standout performance comes from its least well-known member, the Cuban de Armas, who manages the difficult task of making goodness interesting."[51]Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiansaid her "striking" performance left a "lasting impression."[52]The film was a major box office success.[53]De Armas was nominated for theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical[54]with her also winning theSaturn Award for Best Supporting Actressand theNational Board of Review Award for Best Castwith the cast.[55]

Waltz had a passion for opera as a youth, having seen his first opera (TurandotwithBirgit Nilssonin the title role) at around the age of ten. As a teenager, Waltz would visit the opera twice a week.[13]He was uninterested in theatre[6]and wished to become an opera singer.[11]After graduating from Vienna'sTheresianum,[6]Waltz went to study acting at the renownedMax Reinhardt Seminar.[15]At the same time, he also studied singing and opera at theUniversity of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, but eventually decided that his voice was not good enough for an opera career.[8][16]In the late 1970s, Waltz spent some time in New York City where he trained withLee StrasbergandStella Adler.

InQuentin Tarantino's 2009 filmInglourious Basterds, Waltz portrayedSS-StandartenführerHans Landa, also known as "The Jew Hunter". Clever, courteous, multilingual—but also self-serving, implacable and murderous—the character of Landa was such that Tarantino feared he "might have written a part that was un-playable".[21]Waltz received theBest Actor Awardfor the performance at the2009 Cannes Film Festivaland received acclaim from critics and the public. In 2009, he began sweeping critics' awards circuits, receiving awards for Best Supporting Actor from theNew York Film Critics Circle, theBoston Society of Film Critics,[22]Los Angeles Film Critics Association,[22]as well as Best Supporting Actor awards at theGolden Globesand theScreen Actors Guild Awards.
The following month, he won theBAFTA for Best Supporting Actor,[23]and won theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[24][25]Tarantino acknowledged the importance of Waltz to his film by stating: "I think that Landa is one of the best characters I've ever written and ever will write, and Christoph played it to a tee. It's true that if I couldn't have found someone as good as Christoph I might not have madeInglourious Basterds".[26]
Waltz played gangster Benjamin Chudnofsky inThe Green Hornet(2011); that same year, he starred inWater for ElephantsandRoman Polanski'sCarnage. He played German bounty hunter King Schultz in Quentin Tarantino'sDjango Unchained(2012), a role Tarantino wrote specifically for Waltz.[27]During a training accident prior to filming, Waltz injured his pelvis, though it did not impact his role in the film.[28]His role garnered him acclaim once again, with Waltz winning the Golden Globe, the BAFTA, and ultimately the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Waltz was born in Vienna to an Austrian mother and German father. Upon his birth his German father only requested a citizenship certificate of Germany. Being born to an Austrian mother, Waltz was Austrian by birthright, and formally requested his Austrian citizenship certificate in 2010, thus holding citizenships of both Austria and Germany, but considers the fact that he also has a German passport a "legal, citizenship law banality".[3]Asked whether he felt Viennese, he responded: "I was born in Vienna, grew up in Vienna, went to school in Vienna, graduated in Vienna, studied in Vienna, started acting in Vienna — and there would be a few further Viennese links. How much more Austrian do you want it?"[42]He received American citizenship by naturalization in 2020 noting that he strongly believed "in this old dictum of no taxation without representation" as he was living in Los Angeles since 2010.[43]
Waltz has three children with his former wife, Jacqueline (néeRauch), a dance therapist originally from New York.[44]The two lived in London and their marriage lasted 17 years.[7][8]Waltz married his second wife, German costume designer Judith Holste, with whom he has a daughter.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
