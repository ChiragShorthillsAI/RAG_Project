Without Remorse(also known asTom Clancy's Without Remorse) is a 2021 Americanaction thriller filmdirected byStefano Sollimaand written byTaylor SheridanandWill Staples. It is based on the1993 novel of the same namebyTom Clancy. The film starsMichael B. Jordan,Jamie Bell,Jodie Turner-Smith,Luke Mitchell,Jack Kesy,Brett Gelman,Lauren London,Colman DomingoandGuy Pearce. In the film,John Kelly, aU.S. Navy SEAL, seeking revenge after his wife and unit members are killed by Russian hitmen.
The film had been in development since the novel was published in 1993, with various actors, includingKeanu ReevesandTom Hardy, approached for the role of John Kelly. After over 20 years indevelopment hell, Jordan was announced as the lead role in September 2018, and Sheridan was hired to rewrite a script originally written in the 1990s. Filming began inBerlinin October 2019 and completed production in October 2020.
Without Remorsewas originally produced and set for a theatrical release byParamount Pictures, but was delayed and then acquired byAmazon Studios, who digitally released onPrime Videoon April 30, 2021. The film received mixed reviews from critics with praise for Jordan's performance, action sequences and technical aspects, but called the film generic.
InAleppo, Syria, a team ofUS Navy SEALs, includingSenior Chief Petty OfficerJohn Kelly, rescue aCIAoperative taken hostage by a suspected pro-Assadpara-military group. The situation escalates as the SEALs discover that the captors are actuallyRussian military. Three months later, in apparent retaliation for their role in the mission, several members of the team are covertly killed by RussianFSBoperatives. Kelly's pregnant wife Pam is murdered when the Russians break into their house. Kelly kills all, except one of the attackers, before being rushed to the hospital with near-fatal wounds.
InWashington, D.C., Lt. Commander Karen Greer, Kelly's SEAL team leader and friend, meets with Ritter andSecretary of DefenseThomas Clay to discuss how the FSB discovered the SEALs' identities and review their response options. Leaked news of Russia's unprecedented attack on American soil has caused the already-strained relationship between the two nations to sour further, possibly causing anew cold war. The CIA refuses to conduct an investigation into the murders, motivating Greer to pass confidential information to Kelly. Healed from his injuries, Kelly tracks down the corrupt Russian diplomat, who issued the passports to the FSB operatives, and forces him to give the name of the surviving assassin before killing him. Incarcerated for murder, Kelly bargains his way out by revealing the escaped operative is Victor Rykov, an ex-Spetznazofficer, who is hiding inMurmansk, Russia.
Despite Greer's objections, Clay allows Kelly to participate in Rykov's capture on the condition that Kelly serves his sentence after the mission. Kelly flies to Murmansk with Greer and a CIA black ops team, planning toHALO jumpinto Russia. Intercepted and attacked by a Russian fighter, their plane crashes into theBarents Sea. Kelly dives into the wreckage to recover essential equipment, including azodiacboat. The team arrives in Murmansk and finds Ritter, whom Kelly suspects is to blame for the intelligence leaks. Ritter swears that he is not responsible and leads the team to Rykov. Kelly goes off mission to confront Rykov, finding him wearing asuicide vestand learns that he is a deep cover CIA asset. Rykov detonates his vest, killing himself as the team becomes pinned down by sniper fire. As police arrive, the team realizes that the mission was a set-up to have American soldiers killed on Russian soil to start a war.
Kelly volunteers to cover the team's escape so that his death could beplausibly deniedas he is a convict. Kelly buys the team time to reach safety, but is badly injured. Kelly uses an explosion as cover to steal a Russian military police uniform and hijacks an ambulance to escape. Kelly and the surviving team members leave the country by boat. Ritter officially reports Kelly as dead, allowing Kelly to hunt for the traitor.
Back in D.C., Kelly confronts Clay and forces him into his car. After Kelly threatens Clay's family, Clay confesses to being behind the intelligence leaks and orchestrating the conflict between the U.S. and Russia, intending to start a war with Russia to boost the economy and unite the American people against a common enemy. Kelly drives the car over a bridge and lets it sink to the bottom of thePotomac River, drowning Clay. Kelly escapes with a recording of the confession, with the help of Greer, who was waiting in the river with diving gear. AtWashington Union Station, Greer gives Kelly a new identity provided by Ritter, where Kelly leaves to begin his new life as "John Clark".
A year later, Clark meets with Ritter, newly promoted to director, and proposes to create a multinational counter-terrorism team:Rainbow.[a]

OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has a 45% approval rating based on 191 reviews, with an average score of 5.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Despite a commanding performance from Michael B. Jordan,Without Remorsefails to escape its outdated patriotic tropes and forced franchise place settings."[30]Metacriticassigned the film a weighted average score of 41 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[31]
The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called the film "pacey and punchy, buoyed by its magnetic lead" and wrote: "The result is a solid entry in the Clancy screen canon — gritty, briskly paced, laced with vigorously choreographed fight scenes, explosive weapons action and twisty political intrigue that seems prescient as it taps into the most strained period in U.S.-Russian relations since the Cold War."[32]
Randy Meyers ofThe Mercury Newswrote, "Without Remorseimproves on its source material and delivers a satisfyingly sleek and ultra-violent spy thriller."[33]Owen GleibermanofVarietycalled the film "...a lively formulaic action-hero origin story, dunked in combat grunge, that demonstrates how a resourceful lead actor can bend and heighten the meaning of a commercial thriller."[34]
Barry Hertz ofThe Globe and Mailwrote, "Without Remorseis a half-hearted attempt to exfiltrate an espionage brand that just won't come in from the cold. If you like your shootouts generic, your characters disposable, and your plot twists as predictable as airport newsstand merchandise, then have I got the far-from-impossible mission for you."[35]David Ehrlich ofIndieWiregave the film a grade of C− and said: "Without Remorsedoesn't understand the role it's meant to serve as the foundation of a potential franchise. It's a movie locked in a tedious custody battle between legacy and potential, too safe to whet appetites for what's to come while also too sequel-oriented to stand on its own two legs."[36]
Anupama Chopraof Film Companion wrote, "The action is fierce and relentless. The body count is high. But it isn't seductive."[37]
In September 2018, Jordan's selection to play Kelly was reported to serve as an origin story for the character before he would appear in a sequel, based on Clancy'sRainbow Sixnovel.[11]

The low-budget horror filmVileis credited as Sheridan's first film, but he does not consider the film his directorial debut, stating in a 2017Rotten Tomatoesinterview:
I would say this [Wind River] is my feature debut. A friend of mine raised – I don't know what he raised – 20 grand or something, and cast his buddies, and wrote this bad horror movie, that I told him not to direct. He was going to direct it and produce it, and he started and freaked out, and called and said, "Can you help me?" I said, "Yeah, I'll try."
I kind of kept the ship pointed straight, and they went off and edited, and did what they did. I think it's generous to call me the director. I think he was try  [sic] to say thank you, in some way. It was an excellent opportunity to point a camera and learn some lessons that actually benefited me onWind River.[21]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
