Raised Catholic, Ferrara started describing himself as Buddhist in 2007.[46]When asked if he had converted, Ferrara responded,
It’s not a conversion, you’re not a card-carrying Catholic, you’re brought up Italian, so you’re brought up with those images. All the great art is financed by the Church so they have a monopoly on the paintings, and they’re powerful images, the whole nine yards of it. But Jesus was a living man, and so were Buddha and Muhammad. These three guys changed the fucking world, with their passion and love of other human beings. All these guys had was their word, and they came from fucking nowhere. I’m not saying Nazareth is nowhere – I’m sure Jesus came from a very cool neighbourhood.
Ferrara said in 2020 that Buddhism "is a practice for me, not a religion".[48]In 2022, he stated he consideredPadre Piohis "spirituality model".[49]
