Rushed(also known as "A Mother's Fury" or "The Frat Haze" in the United Kingdom) is a 2021 American mystery thriller drama film directed by Vibeke Muasya and starringSiobhan Fallon Hogan(who also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film) andRobert Patrick.
Jimmy O'Brien is a quiet college freshman experiencing regular fraternity hazing, unbeknownst to his overbearing Irish-Catholic mother, Barbara. One night after being forced to drink excessive amounts of alcohol, Jimmy ends up in a coma and, eventually, his family make the difficult decision to take him off life support.
Shortly after, they receive a letter from the college who advise they will not accept any liability for Jimmy's death. Directionless and depressed, Barbara initially spends her days at home in New York chain-smoking and writing angry e-mails to the college principal, causing distance between herself and her three other children.
One day after reading other mothers' stories online about their sons dying following hazing incidents, Barbara decides to begin travelling around the country to interview them, hoping to bring awareness to the matter with the possibility of getting help from her husband Jim's friend Bob Daley, a senator from Washington DC.
After weeks of not hearing back from Bob, Barbara attends one of his fundraisers uninvited. Much to her shock, she witnesses his speech, during which talks about the "brotherhood" of college fraternities and downplays the recent hazing incidents. When she interrupts, Bob tries to quickly dismiss the importance of Jimmy's death, and Barbara walks out. Losing faith, she calls Jimmy's cell phone and leaves him a voicemail, apologising for not being able to change the legislation.
Jim calls Barbara while she is driving home and tells her he has received a photograph of Jimmy from the night of his death, showing that he was tied up and urinated on while being made to drink. Barbara turns her car around and stops at a gas station to buy alcohol before heading to an armory. She also books a stay at a secluded cottage for the night.
The next morning, Barbara calls Steven Croission, the main instigator of Jimmy's hazing, and tells him she would like to meet him to gift the fraternity a cheque in Jimmy's honour, which he agrees to. She lures him into her car and pulls a gun on him before driving him back to the cottage. She ties him up and begins taunting him like he did to Jimmy, while he begs for his life. She then forces him to call his mom and tell her he killed Jimmy. The line then goes quiet before a gunshot is heard.
Barbara attempts to return to normal life but later hands herself into the local police. At her trial, it is revealed that she did not shoot Steven; she tells the prosecutor she just wanted to mess with him. She says she could never do that to another mother, because to know your son is dead is unbearable.
Fallon Hogan was inspired to write the film and give herself a lead role after initially thinking about doing another one-woman show.[1]Scenes were shot in Hogan's home inNew Jersey.[2]The last two days of filming occurred inCentral New York.[3]Ellen Cleghornefilmed scenes as the school principal, but they were cut.[4]
It was announced thatVertical Entertainmentacquired North American distribution rights to the film in June 2021.[5]The film was released in select theaters on August 27, 2021.[3][6][7]
The film has an 90% rating onRotten Tomatoesbased on 10 reviews.[8]
Andrew Stover ofFilm Threatgave the film a seven out of 10 and wrote, "All in all, this is a well-acted thriller that is surprising and sensible."[9]
Valerie Kalfrin of theAlliance of Women Film Journalistswrote, "Hogan infuses Barbara with such lived-in certainty that her performance is the strongest reason to watch Rushed. Unfortunately, she and co-star Robert Patrick, as Barbara’s husband, Jim, are mired in a story that feels too familiar, if not dated."[10]
Peter Gray ofThe AU Reviewwrote: "Rushedis a tender, yet furious drama about the hazing ritual culture of American fraternities."[11]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
