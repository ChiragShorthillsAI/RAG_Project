William Tell is a gambler who taught himself how tocount cardsduring an eight-year stint inmilitary prison. Seeking to avoid attention—either from fame or from casino bouncers—Tell's gambling philosophy is to bet small and win modestly. Despite gambling nearly every day, he avoids scrutiny by never staying in a casino hotel. He lives out of two small suitcases and exclusively stays in motels, where he removes any decor and covers the furniture in plain sheets secured with twine. At a casino, Tell encounters La Linda, an acquaintance from the gambling world. She runs a stable, a group of gamblers who are backed by investors for a portion of their winnings. She offers to stake Tell but he refuses, unwilling to be burdened by the responsibility.
InAtlantic City, a security-industry convention is being held in the same building as the casino. Tell slips into a seminar held by retired Major John Gordo, but decides to leave almost immediately. On the way out, he is recognized and confronted by a young man, Cirk Baufort, who slips him his name and number. After a nightmare about torture in a prison camp, Tell calls Cirk and agrees to meet.
Cirk knows Tell's true identity:PFCWilliam Tillich, a soldier who was tried and convicted for his role in theprisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib. Cirk explains that his father, Roger, was also at Abu Ghraib; like Tell, he was dishonorably discharged and served time, but the experience led him to drug addiction and made him violently abusive. Cirk's mother left the family, and Roger eventually killed himself. Gordo trained Tillich and the elder Baufort in "enhanced interrogation techniques" but as he was involved as a "civilian consultant" avoided charges or culpability. Blaming Gordo for what happened to his family, Cirk is planning to capture, torture and kill him for revenge and seeks Tell's help. Tell refuses but offers to take Cirk along as he gambles in an attempt to help the young man avoid a violent life.
At their next stop, Tell informs La Linda that he is interested in making an arrangement. He expresses a desire to go on theWorld Series of Poker(WSOP) tour in order to win enough money to help Cirk cover his debts and start a new life, after which Tell will retire. After early WSOP matches, Tell makes money but loses to Mr. USA, an obnoxious Ukrainian player who has taken on ajingoisticAmerican persona. He bonds with Cirk and feels a growing attraction to La Linda but avoids getting too close as he continues making money gambling.
At a qualifying round inPanama City, Cirk discloses that he still plans to kill Gordo. Tell takes Cirk back to his motel, confronting the younger man with a harsh interrogator persona. He presents Cirk with $150,000 from his gambling winnings, enough for Cirk to pay off his and his mother's debts and return to college. He insists Cirk return to his mother and forget about Gordo, threatening violence if he does not comply; Cirk leaves with the money. Tell, who has begun a relationship with La Linda, advances to the final table of the WSOP. While on a break he receives a message from Cirk, revealing that rather than returning home he went to Gordo's house to kill him. Tell is unsettled during the resumed match and abruptly walks off the casino floor. A news report shows that Gordo has killed an armed home intruder, presumably Cirk.
Tell drives through the night to reach Gordo's house, where he covers the furniture as he does in his motel rooms. Gordo returns home and Tell holds him at gunpoint, revealing who he is and why he is there. Rather than shooting him, Tell takes Gordo into another room for a "dramatic reenactment" of their time in Abu Ghraib. Both men are heard screaming in agony and eventually Tell emerges from the room severely wounded and covered in blood. He calls the police to report a homicide. Tell is incarcerated in the same military prison as before, accepting the routine and ascetic setting as he feels it is what he deserves. La Linda arrives for a visit and the two reach out to each other, each placing a single finger on the glass separating them.

Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]

As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Paul Joseph Schrader(/ˈʃreɪdər/; born July 22, 1946) is an American screenwriter, film director, and film critic. He first became known for writing the screenplay ofMartin Scorsese'sTaxi Driver(1976). He later continued his collaboration with Scorsese, writing or co-writingRaging Bull(1980),The Last Temptation of Christ(1988), andBringing Out the Dead(1999). Schrader has also worked extensively as a director: his 23 films includeBlue Collar(1978),Hardcore(1979),American Gigolo(1980),Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters(1985),Light Sleeper(1992),Affliction(1997), andFirst Reformed(2017), with the last of these earning him his firstAcademy Awardnomination. Schrader's work frequently depicts "man in a room" stories which feature isolated, troubled men confronting anexistential crisis.[1][2]
Raised in a strictCalvinistfamily, Schrader attendedCalvin Collegebefore pursuingfilm studiesatUCLAon the encouragement of film criticPauline Kael. He then worked as a film scholar and critic, publishing the bookTranscendental Style in Film: Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer(1972) before transitioning to screenwriting in 1974. The success ofTaxi Driverin 1976 brought greater attention to his work, and Schrader began directing his own films, beginning withBlue Collar(co-written with his brother,Leonard Schrader). Schrader has described three of his recent films as a loose trilogy:First Reformed(2017),The Card Counter(2021), andMaster Gardener(2022).
Schrader was born inGrand Rapids, Michigan, the son of Joan (néeFisher) and Charles A. Schrader, an executive.[citation needed]Schrader's family attended theCalvinistChristian Reformed Church.[3][4]Schrader's mother was of Dutch descent, the daughter of emigrants fromFriesland, while Schrader's paternal grandfather was from a German family that had come to the U.S. through Canada.[5][6]
His early life was based upon the religion's strict principles and parental education. He did not see a film until he was seventeen years old when he was able to sneak away from home. In an interview, he stated thatThe Absent-Minded Professorwas the first film he saw. In his own words, he was "very unimpressed" by it, whileWild in the Country, which he saw sometime later, had quite some effect on him.[7]Schrader attributes his intellectual rather than emotional approach towards movies and movie-making to his having no adolescent movie memories.[8]
Schrader earned his B.A. in philosophy with a minor in theology fromCalvin Collegebut decided against becoming a minister.[9]He then earned anM.A.infilm studiesat theUCLA Film Schoolupon the recommendation ofPauline Kael, who encouraged him to be a film critic.[10]
Schrader first became afilm critic, writing for theLos Angeles Free Pressand later forCinemamagazine. His bookTranscendental Style in Film: Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer, which examines the similarities betweenRobert Bresson,Yasujirō Ozu, andCarl Theodor Dreyer, was published in 1972. Other film-makers who made a lasting impression on Schrader areJohn Ford,Jean Renoir,Roberto Rossellini,Alfred Hitchcock, andSam Peckinpah. Renoir'sThe Rules of the Gamehe called the "quintessential movie" which represents "all of the cinema".[8]
In 1974, Schrader and his brotherLeonardco-wroteThe Yakuza, a film set in the Japanese crime world. The script became the subject of a bidding war, eventually selling for $325,000. The film was directed bySydney Pollackand starredRobert Mitchum.Robert Towne, best known forChinatown, also received a credit for his rewrite. AlthoughThe Yakuzafailed commercially, it brought Schrader to the attention of thenew generationofHollywooddirectors. In 1975, he wrote the script forObsessionforBrian De Palma. Schrader wrote an early draft ofSteven Spielberg'sClose Encounters of the Third Kind(1977), but Spielberg disliked the script, calling it "terribly guilt-ridden", and opted for something lighter.[11]He also wrote an early draft ofRolling Thunder(1977), which the film's producers had reworked without his participation. He disapproved of the final film.[8]Schrader's script about an obsessed New York City taxi driver became Martin Scorsese's filmTaxi Driver, which was nominated for theOscarforBest Pictureand won thePalme d'Orat theCannes Film Festival. BesidesTaxi Driver(1976), Scorsese also drew on scripts by Schrader forRaging Bull(1980), co-credited toMardik Martin;The Last Temptation of Christ(1988); andBringing Out the Dead(1999).
Thanks partly to critical acclaim forTaxi Driver, Schrader was able to direct his first feature,Blue Collar(1978), co-written with his brother Leonard.Blue CollarfeaturesRichard Pryor,Harvey Keitel, andYaphet Kottoas car factory workers attempting to escape their socio-economic rut through theft andblackmail. He has described the film as challenging to make, because of the artistic and personal tensions between him and the cast. During principal photography, he suffered an on-set mental collapse, which led him to reconsider his career seriously.John Miliusacted as executive producer on the following year'sHardcore,again written by Schrader, a film with many autobiographical parallels in his depiction of the Calvinist milieu of Grand Rapids, and in the character ofGeorge C. Scott, which was based on Schrader's father.[8]Among Paul Schrader's films in the 1980s wereAmerican GigolostarringRichard Gere(1980), hisCat People(1982) a remake of the 1942 filmCat People, andMishima: A Life in Four Chapters(1985).

Schrader also directedPatty Hearst(1988), about the kidnapping and transformation of theHearst Corporation heiress. In 1987, he was a member of the jury at the37th Berlin International Film Festival.[12]
His 1990s work included the travelers-in-Venice taleThe Comfort of Strangers(1990), adapted byHarold Pinterfrom theIan McEwannovel, andLight Sleeper(1992), a sympathetic study of a drug dealer vying for a normal life. In 2005, Schrader describedLight Sleeperas his "most personal" film.[13]In 1997, he madeTouch(1997), based on anElmore Leonardnovel about a young man seemingly able to cure the sick by the laying on of hands. In 1998, Schrader won critical acclaim for the dramaAffliction. The film tells the story of a troubled small-town policeman (Nick Nolte) who becomes obsessed with solving the mystery behind a fatal hunting accident. Schrader's script was based on the novel byRussell Banks. The film was nominated for multiple awards, including two Academy Awards for acting (for Nolte andJames Coburn). Schrader received theAustin Film Festival'sDistinguished Screenwriter Award the same year. In 1999, Schrader received theLaurel Award for Screenwriting Achievementfrom theWriters Guild of America.
In 2002, he directed the well receivedbiopicAuto Focus, based on the life and murder ofHogan's HeroesactorBob Crane. In 2003, Schrader made entertainment headlines after being fired fromThe Exorcist: Dominion, a prequel film to the horror classicThe Exorcistfrom 1973. The film's production companiesMorgan Creek ProductionsandWarner Bros. Picturesintensely disliked the film Schrader had made. DirectorRenny Harlinwas hired to re-shoot nearly the entire movie, which was released asExorcist: The Beginningon August 20, 2004, to disastrously negative reviews and embarrassing box office receipts. Warner Bros. and Morgan Creek put over $80 million into the endeavor, and Harlin's film only made back $41 million domestically. Schrader's version of the film eventually premiered at theBrussels International Festival of Fantastic Filmon March 18, 2005, asExorcist: The Original Prequel. Due to extreme interest in Schrader's version from critics and cinephiles alike, Warner Bros. agreed to give the film a limited theatrical release later that year under the titleDominion: Prequel to the Exorcist. The film was only shown on 110 screens around the United States and made just $251,000. The critics liked Schrader's version much better than Harlin's. However, Schrader's film ultimately met with a generally negative reaction.
After that, Schrader filmedThe Walker(2007), starringWoody Harrelsonas a male escort caught up in a political murder enquiry, and the Israel-setAdam Resurrected(2008), which starsJeff GoldblumandWillem Dafoe. Schrader headed the International Jury of the 2007 Berlin International Film Festival and in 2011 became a jury member for the ongoingFilmakashort film contest.[14]On July 2, 2009, Schrader was awarded the inaugural Lifetime Achievement in Screenwriting award at the ScreenLit Festival inNottingham,England. Several of his films were shown at the festival, includingMishima: A Life in Four Chapters, which followed the presentation of the award by directorShane Meadows.
After five years of trying and failing to find funding to make feature films, Schrader returned withThe Canyons(2013), an erotic dramatic thriller written byBret Easton Ellisand starringLindsay Lohanand adult-film starJames Deen. The film was one of the first films to use the websiteKickstarterto crowd-source its funding. Schrader also used the website Let It Cast to have unknown actors submit their audition tapes over the internet.American Apparelprovided some wardrobe for the film. The film was ultimately made for just $250,000 and had a limited theatrical release fromIFC Filmson August 2, 2013. The film was poorly received by general critics and audiences. The film only made $56,000 in theaters but found later success when released on variousVideo on Demandplatforms.
In 2014, Schrader directedThe Dying of the Light, an espionage thriller starringNicolas Cageas a government agent suffering from a deadly disease,Anton YelchinandIrène Jacob. In post-production Schrader was denied final cut by the film's producers.[15]The film was negatively received by many film critics and was abox-office bomb. Schrader later recutDying of the Lightinto the separate, more experimental workDark, which received more positive reviews. Schrader's dramatic thrillerFirst Reformed, starringEthan Hawke, premiered at the 2017Venice Film Festivaland received critical acclaim. Schrader received his firstAcademy Awardnomination for the film in the categoryBest Original Screenplay. In 2021, he directed the crime drama filmThe Card Counter, starringOscar IsaacandTiffany Haddish. The film also premiered at the 2021 Venice Film Festival and was widely lauded by critics. Schrader grouped these two films into a loose trilogy with another thriller,Master Gardener, starringJoel EdgertonandSigourney Weaver. Like the rest of the trilogy, it premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2022, where Schrader was awarded theGolden Lion Honorary Award.
In 2023, it was confirmed Schrader would write and directOh, Canada, an adaptation of his friendRussell Banks' novel,Foregone, starringRichard GereandJacob Elordi.[16]
Additionally, Schrader has written a western calledThree Guns at Dawn,forAntoine Fuquato direct; a drama about a trauma nurse calledR.NforElisabeth Mossto star in and direct; and an untitled script about a sex addict.[17][18]
Schrader has written two stage plays,BerlinaleandCleopatra Club. The latter saw its premiere at thePowerhouse TheaterinPoughkeepsie,New York, in 1995 and its foreign language debut inViennain 2011.[8][19][20]
A recurring theme in Schrader's films is the protagonist on a self-destructive path, or undertaking actions which work against himself, deliberately or subconsciously. The finale often bears an element of redemption, preceded by a painful sacrifice or cathartic act of violence.[citation needed]
Schrader has repeatedly referred toTaxi Driver,American Gigolo,Light Sleeper,The Canyons,The Walker,First Reformed, andThe Card Counteras "a man in a room" stories. The protagonist in each film changes from an angry, then narcissistic, later anxious character, to a person who hides behind a mask of superficiality.[8][21][22]
Although many of his films or scripts are based on real-life biographies(Raging Bull,Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters,Patty Hearst,Auto Focus), Schrader confessed having problems with biographical films due to their altering of actual events, which he tried to prevent by imposing structures and stylization.[8]
Schrader battled a cocaine addiction, which contributed to his divorce from his first wife, art directorJeannine Oppewall. He then moved from Los Angeles to Japan in hopes of getting his life on track, finally quitting drugs around 1990.  His second marriage is to actressMary Beth Hurt, who has appeared in smaller roles in a variety of his films.[23]Together they have two children, a daughter and a son.[24]
In September 2022, Schrader was hospitalized for "breathing problems".[25]
In January 2023, he and his wife moved from New York's suburbanPutnam Countyto a luxuryassisted-living facilityin Manhattan'sHudson Yardsarea, where Hurt receives treatment for her worseningAlzheimer's.[26]
Schrader is aChristian. RaisedCalvinist, Schrader abandoned religion in his young adulthood, before returning to Christianity later in life. He became anEpiscopalianafter the birth of his children. As of 2018, he attends aPresbyterianchurch.[27]His films frequently feature religious themes.[28]However, Schrader has now emphasized that he considers himself to be just a Christian.[29]
In December 2016, Schrader referred to the then-upcomingTrump presidencyas "a call to violence" and said "we should be willing to take arms. Like OldJohn Brown." He quickly deleted the post, but was visited by theNew York City Police Department Counterterrorism Bureaufor threatening violence. Schrader expressed some regret for his post (blaming it on him drinking alcohol and taking anAmbien), apologizing for his post's violent rhetoric, but not for his comments critical of Trump.[30]
In 2021, Schrader attackedcancel culture, describing it as "infectious...like theDelta virus".[31]In 2022, Schrader criticized that year'sSight and SoundGreatest Films poll, describing it as a "politically correct rejiggering", with its selection ofJeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxellesas the greatest film of all time being the product of "distorted woke reappraisal".[32]In 2023, he also criticized the politicization of the95th Academy Awards, writing that the Oscars' "scramble to be woke" have made their ceremony "mean less each year".[33]
In 2012, Schrader participated in theSight & Soundfilm polls of that year. Held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, contemporary directors were asked to select ten films of their choice. Schrader gave the following ten in alphabetical order.[34]
In 2022, Schrader updated his list, including:[32]

"I really made a conscious effort to mix it up, not because in itself it's not the job of an actor to do all different things, but for me that's what I'm interested in. You've got to be careful because you've got to work with what you have, not just for vanity's sake, but I think the best part of being an actor sometimes is the opportunity to transform yourself superficially, and deeply."
In 1997, Dafoe returned to playing a villainous role in the action thrillerSpeed 2: Cruise Control, expressing the necessity of appearing in both independent andblockbusterfilms.[55]The film starredSandra BullockandJason Patricas a couple vacationing on a luxury cruise that has been hijacked by Dafoe's character, Geiger, a hacker that has programmed the ship to crash into an oil tanker.Speed 2was met with negative reviews from critics,[56]with Dafoe himself receiving aRazzie Awardnomination forWorst Supporting Actor.[57]For his next film,Affliction(1997), Dafoe worked with Paul Schrader for a second time, playing the brother ofNick Nolte's character and served as the film's narrator.[58]Also in 1997, Dafoe took on a voice acting role in an episode of the animated sitcomThe Simpsonstitled "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", voicing the commandant of a military academy thatBartandLisa Simpsonare attending.[59]Following a villainous supporting role in the romantic mystery dramaLulu on the Bridge,[60]Dafoe starred alongsideChristopher WalkenandAsia ArgentoinAbel Ferrara'scyberpunkdramaNew Rose Hotelin 1998.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
