He has appeared in a number of movies inLatin AmericaandSpain, starring in both feature films, short films, andNarcos: Mexico, credited asTenoch Huerta. He is featured in Mónica Maristain's book,30 Actors Made in Mexico. He playsNamorin theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU), starting with the filmBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever(2022), in which he is credited asTenoch Huerta Mejía.[2][3]
Huerta was born inEcatepec de Morelos,State of Mexico,[4][failed verification]on 29 January 1981. His father, a film buff, enrolled him in an acting course withMaría Elena Saldaña, and Huerta's later studies were alongsideCarlos Torres TorrijaandLuis Felipe Tovar.[1]
Huerta is of Indigenous descent, with aNahuamaternal great-grandmother and aPurépechapaternal great-great-grandmother.[5]He does notself-identifyasIndigenous;[6]however, he encourages people to learn more about their Indigenous heritage within and outside the community.[7]
Huerta made his acting career debut as a minor character in the filmAsi del precipicio(2006). In 2009, he appeared inCary Joji Fukunaga's filmSin nombrein the role of Li'l Mago, leader of the Tapachula faction of the notoriousMara Salvatruchagang.
In 2015, he appeared as Carlos Mamani in the biographical disaster survival filmThe 33, Alejo inCamino. In 2018, he began portrayingRafael Caro QuinteroinNetflix'sNarcos: Mexico.
In 2021, he appeared as Juan inThe Forever Purge, the fifth film ofThe Purgefranchise, alongside his fellowNarcos: MexicocostarAlejandro Edda.[8]
In 2022, during aSan Diego Comic-Conpresentation for theMarvel StudiosfilmBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever, Huerta was revealed to have joined the cast to portrayNamor.[9]In Mexico, most reactions were positive, with a minority of negative reactions characterized as expressions ofracismandmalinchismo.[10]Huerta himself spoke against racism in the film industry and stated that he was excited to play the character.[11][12]
In 2023, Tenoch Huerta was cast asJuan Preciadoin the film adaptation ofPedro Páramo, directed byRodrigo Prieto. Based onJuan Rulfo's novel, the film premiered worldwide at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 14, 2024.[13]It was released on Netflix on November 6, 2024.[needs update]
Tenoch Huerta, recognized for his distinguished acting career, also holds an acclaimed role as an anti-racism activist, spurred by his personal encounters with racial prejudice and systemic discrimination.
Huerta formerly collaborated with Poder Prieto, a Mexican collective striving to alter societal perceptions of Brown individuals. His contributions were largely focused on advocating for the accurate and favorable representation of Brown people in various mediums. Furthermore, the collective aimed to redefine the term "Prieto," traditionally a racial slur, by infusing it with a positive context.
Huerta has persistently emphasized the significance of diverse and accurate representation of people of color in film and television, asserting that varied storytelling contributes to authentic cultural narratives.
In 2022, Huerta expanded his activism reach by authoring the book Orgullo Prieto (Black Pride).[14]The book delves into the racist constructs in Mexico and integrates personal narratives to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue.
The same year, Huerta addressedUNESCO's Global Forum against Racism and Discrimination, amplifying his insights on activism and media representation on a global platform.[15]His engagement with UNESCO extended to 2023, where he connected with over 2000 students, underscoring the imperative of recognizing privilege, challenging prevailing systems, and the potential of collective action to effect change.[16]
Huerta was also a participant in a dialogue convened by theUnited Nations' Antiracism Working Group,[17]a discussion held to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. His involvement epitomizes his commitment to confronting racism, an issue now addressed with increased urgency by institutions like the United Nations, largely due to the global resonance of movements like Black Lives Matter.[18]
In June 2023, Huerta was accused of abuse by musician and activist Maria Elena Ríos. Ríos accused him of being a sexual predator and that the Mexico-based activist organization Poder Prieto was deliberately protecting him.[19][20]Huerta has denied the allegations and cited them as the reason for leaving an upcoming Netflix project.[21][22]In 2024, almost a year after the accusations, no judicial complaints have been made.
In August 2024, the actor publicly addressed the allegations against him. Huerta expressed his pain and dismay over the claims, emphasizing that they had significantly impacted his mental health while maintaining his innocence.[23][24]
Following the allegations against him, the actor has received threats of extortion that he has legally reported.[25]
Huerta won Best Actor at the Short Short Film Festival in Mexico City for his performance inAlonso Ruizpalacios'Café paraíso.[26]He has also received five nominations for theAriel Award, winningBest Actorfor his role inDías de Graciain 2012.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
