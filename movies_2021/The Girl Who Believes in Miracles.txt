The Greatest Showmanis a 2017 Americanbiographicalmusicaldrama filmdirected byMichael Graceyfrom a screenplay byJenny BicksandBill Condon, based on an original story by Bicks. The film starsHugh Jackman,Zac Efron,Michelle Williams,Rebecca Ferguson, andZendaya. Featuring nine original songs written byBenj Pasek and Justin Paul, and an originalmusical orchestral scorecomposed byJohn DebneyandJoseph Trapanese, the film is a heavily fictionalized depiction of the life ofP. T. Barnum, a showman and entertainer who created theBarnum & Bailey Circus, and its star attractions.
The Greatest Showmanpremiered on December 8, 2017, aboard theRMSQueen Mary 2in New York City and was released in the United States on December 20, by20th Century Fox. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances, music, visuals, and production values, but criticised itsartistic licenseand overdramatic story.[4][5][6][7][8]It still was a box-office success, grossing $459million worldwide against a $84 million budget. The film received nominations forBest Motion Picture – Musical or ComedyandBest Actor – Musical or Comedyfor Jackman at the75th Golden Globe Awards.The Greatest Showmanwon theGolden Globe Award for Best Original Songfor "This Is Me", which was also nominated forBest Original Songat the90th Academy Awards,[9]and wonBest Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Mediaat the61st Annual Grammy Awards.[10]Astage musicaladaptation is in development from theDisney Theatrical Groupfollowing theirparent company'sacquisitionof the film and the Fox assets in 2019, which will open inBristolin spring 2026.
In the19th century, youngP. T. Barnumand his tailor father Philo work for the Hallett family. Barnum falls for their daughter, Charity.
When Charity attendsfinishing school, she and Barnum write to each other until reuniting as adults ("A Million Dreams"). They eventually marry and raise two daughters, Caroline and Helen, inNew York City. They live a humble life, and though Charity is happy, Barnum craves more ("A Million Dreams (Reprise)").
Barnum loses his shipping clerk job when the company goes bankrupt, due to a typhoon that sank all the firm's cargo vessels. He later secures a bank loan, deceptively using his former employer's lost ships as "collateral". He opensBarnum's American Museumin downtownManhattanwhich features various wax figures.
Ticket sales are slow, so Caroline and Helen suggest showcasing something "alive". Barnum adds "freak" performers, such asbearded ladyLettie Lutz anddwarfmanCharles Stratton("Come Alive"). This garners higher attendance, but also protests and poor reviews from well-known criticJames Gordon Bennett.
Barnum renames his venture "Barnum's Circus" and recruits playwright Phillip Carlyle to help generate publicity ("The Other Side"). Phillip is mesmerized by the African American trapeze artist, Anne Wheeler, but he hides his feelings. Phillip arranges for Barnum and his troupe to meetQueen Victoria.
Barnum persuades famed Swedish singerJenny Lindto tour America, with him as her manager. Lind's American debut is a success ("Never Enough"). During her song, Phillip's parents see him and Anne holding hands and he quickly lets go. As Barnum gains favor with aristocratic patrons, he distances himself from his troupe, advising them to work without him. Dejected, they decide to stand against their harassers ("This Is Me").
When Phillip and Anne attend the theater together, they run into Phillip's parents. They chastise him for "parading around with the help." Phillip tries to convince Anne that they can be together, but she disagrees, saying they will never be accepted socially ("Rewrite the Stars").
As Barnum takes Lind on a U.S. tour, Charity, who stays home with the girls, feels isolated from her husband ("Tightrope"). While on tour, Lind becomes romantically attracted to Barnum. When he rejects her advances, she threatens to quit and later retaliates with a kiss at the end of her last show ("Never Enough (Reprise)"), which is photographed by the press.
Barnum returns home to find his circus on fire, caused by a fight between protesters and the troupe. Phillip runs into the burning building to save Anne, not knowing that she has already escaped. He suffers serious injuries before Barnum rescues him.
Bennett tells Barnum that the culprits have been caught and that Lind has cancelled her tour after Barnum's "scandal". Barnum's mansion isforeclosed, and Charity (having found out about the kiss) berates Barnum for his obsessions. She takes their daughters to her parents' home.
Devastated, Barnum retreats to a local bar. His troupe finds him there and say that despite their disappointments, they still consider themselves a family. Inspired, he resolves to build a new show and not let ambition blind him ("From Now On"). Phillip awakens in a hospital with Anne by his side, while Barnum and Charity reconcile.
A recovering Phillip offers his share of the profits to help Barnum rebuild the circus in exchange for becoming a full partner, which Barnum readily accepts. To economize, Barnum transforms the enterprise into an open-air tent circus.
The revamped circus is a huge success ("The Greatest Show"). Barnum has Phillip take his place as theringmasterso Barnum can spend more time with his family. Barnum leaves the circus early on anAfrican bush elephantto attend Caroline and Helen's ballet recital.
During rehearsals for the81st Academy Awardsin 2009, producersLaurence MarkandBill Condoncompared host Jackman to Barnum. After Jackman expressed interest in a Barnum project, Mark and Condon approachedJenny Bicks, a writer for the ceremony. She and Condon wroteThe Greatest Showman.[13]The project was first announced in 2009, with Jackman already set for the title role.[14]In August 2011,Michael Graceywas chosen to direct.[15]In 2013, Fox hired songwriting team ofBenj Pasek and Justin Paulto write the songs.[16]
In early 2016, the cast performed a read-through in front of producers togreen-lightthe film. Pasek and Paul approachedJeremy Jordanto sing the part of Carlyle, since Jordan recordeddemosfor the film in 2015.[17]The day before the read-through, Jackman underwentnasal surgeryand was ordered by his doctor not to sing. Pasek and Paul asked Jordan to also sing the part of Barnum while Jackman acted out the scenes, to which Jordan agreed.[17]While the cast performed "From Now On", Jackman disobeyed orders and began singing along with Jordan. This brought the read-through to an emotional end, which resulted in the film being greenlit.[18]
On June 15, 2016,Zac Efronbegan negotiations to star in the film,[19]and in July 2016,Michelle Williamswas cast.[20]The film was choreographed byAshley Wallen.[21]
The film took seven years to produce, and Jackman had ten weeks of preparation before filming started.[22]Rehearsals on the film began in October 2016 inNew York City, andprincipal photographybegan on November 22, 2016.[23]
In December 2017, it was reported thatJames Mangold, who had worked with Jackman on several projects (including 2017'sLogan), had been brought in to serve as an executive producer during the film's post-production. In an interview, director Michael Gracey noted, "There were eight producers on this film, and it was amazing having one of them be a filmmaker."[24]
Benj Pasek and Justin Paulwrote all the songs appearing in the film.[25]
The soundtrack album is produced byJustin Paul,Benj Pasek,Greg Wells,Kevin WeaverandPete Ganbarg, featuring the eleven tracks performed by the cast. In the United Kingdom, on March 23, 2018, it became only the second album in 30 years to achieve 11 consecutive weeks at number 1, equalling the record set byAdele's21.[26][27]As of January 25, 2019[update], the album has spent the sixth most time at number one at 28 non-consecutive weeks, matching the Beatles'Sgt.

The film received mixed reviews upon release.[53][54][55]As reported byEntertainment Weekly, critics feltThe Greatest Showmanembraces the spectacle and showmanship of Barnum using vibrant musical numbers and lavish visuals, but its superficial approach to character development and historical nuance makes it more an extravagant diversion than a substantive biographical portrait.[56]Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, 57% of 265 reviews are positive, and the average rating is 6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The Greatest Showmantries hard to dazzle the audience with a Barnum-style sense of wonder—but at the expense of its complex subject's far more intriguing real-life story."[57]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on reviews from 43 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[58]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it 4.5 out of 5 stars and a 70% "definite recommend".[44]
Owen GleibermanofVarietygave the film a positive review, writing, "The Greatest Showmanis a concoction, the kind of film where all the pieces click into place, yet at an hour and 45 minutes it flies by, and the link it draws between P.T. Barnum and the spirit of today is more than hype."[59]Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying, "With all that corn and cheese and old-timey sentiment,The Greatest Showmanends up scoring some very timely social arguments. P.T. Barnum himself would have approved the dramatic sleight of hand."[60]Steve Persall ofTampa Bay Timesgave the film an 'A', and said, "The Greatest Showmanis the feel-good movie the holiday season needs,"[61]while William Bibbiani ofIGNgaveThe Greatest Showmana score of 7.9 out of 10, and called the film, "wildly entertaining".[62]
Britton Peele ofThe Dallas Morning Newssaid, "The story is interesting and the beats are well acted, but it's the musical numbers that makeThe Greatest Showman."[63]Jackie K. CooperofHuffPostgave the film a score of 10/10 and wrote, "You will be overwhelmed by the music and magic that explode on the screen. The film has a message that should resonate with today's world concerning acceptance and courage."[64]Hugh Armitage ofDigital Spysaid, "The Greatest Showmanis a broad and solid crowd-pleaser. An undemanding spectacle for all the family."[65]Alan Jones of theRadio Timescalled it "A joyously uplifting potpourri of visual resplendence, stylish choreography and solid gold magic, one engineered to approximate the lavish spectacle the movie musical once offered."[66]
Sheila O'Malley ofRogerEbert.comgave it 3.5 out of 4, stating "The Greatest Showmanis an unabashed piece of pure entertainment punctuated by memorable songs."[67]James Berardinelliof ReelViews gave the film 3 out of 4, and said, "The film has show-stopping well-choreographed numbers with catchy tunes,"[68]and Calvin Wilson of theSt. Louis Post-Dispatchcalled the film "highly enjoyable."[69]
Carl Kozlowski ofPasadena Weeklygave the film an 'A', calling it "Groundbreaking & grandly innovative."[70]Sean P. Means ofThe Salt Lake TribunegaveThe Greatest Showman3.5 out of 4, stating, "A strong cast give emotional power to this romanticized, tune-filled biography."[71]Manuela Lazic ofLittle White Liesgave it 4 out of 5, saying, "The Greatest Showmandeserves to become a Christmas classic. The film's severe romanticism and ridiculous but affecting enthusiasm make it irresistibly life-affirming."[72]Pete Hammond ofDeadline Hollywoodgave the film 4 out of 5 stars and called it, "A fantasia of song and dance, a joyous exercise in pure entertainment that is made for the holiday crowd."[73]
Conversely,Mick LaSalleof theSan Francisco Chroniclegave the film a negative review, criticizing the songs and characters and saying "There's idiotic, and there's magnificent, butThe Greatest Showmanis that special thing that happens sometimes. It's magnificently idiotic. It's an awful mess, but it's flashy. The temptation is to cover your face and watch it through your fingers, because it's so earnest and embarrassing and misguided—and yet it's well made."[74]In a negative review forThe Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney wrote "This ersatz portrait of American big-top tent impresario P.T. Barnum is all smoke and mirrors, no substance. It hammers pedestrian themes of family, friendship and inclusivity while neglecting the fundaments of character and story."[75]
Writing forRolling Stone,Peter Traversgave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, saying, "How do you cast a virtuoso Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum, spare no expense in production values, add a score by Oscar and Tony winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and still end up with the shrill blast of nothing that isThe Greatest Showman? Ask first-time director Michael Gracey, who cut his teeth on commercials and music videos without ever mastering the crucial knack of building snippets of musical comedy and drama into a satisfying whole."[76]Justin Chang of theLos Angeles Timeswrote that the film's failures "are rooted in something deeper: a dispiriting lack of faith in the audience's intelligence, and a dawning awareness of its own aesthetic hypocrisy. You've rarely seen a more straight-laced musical about the joys of letting your freak flag fly."[77]
The Greatest Showmanincluded many historical inaccuracies and omissions. Vanity Fair called it "a highly fictionalized musical biopic".[78]The New Yorker said that "there's a sort of poetic injustice in the fact that 'The Greatest Showman,' the new musical... based on the life of P. T. Barnum, the long-famed 'Prince of Humbug,' should be largely fabricated out of synthetic cloth".[79]The Smithsonian magazine wrote that "P.T. Barnum isn't the hero the 'Greatest Showman' wants you to think", highlighting that "his path to fame and notoriety began by exploiting an enslaved woman, in life and in death, as entertainment for the masses".[80]The Smithsonian refers to Barnum's first theatrical foray in 1835, where he exhibited an African American slave woman namedJoice Hethand claimed she was one hundred and sixty-one years old, while she was actually in her seventies. At the time it was illegal to own slaves in New York but Barnum got around this by "renting" Ms. Heth. Barnum also falsely claimed that she had raised George Washington. After Heth died in 1836, Barnum arranged a public autopsy, which he charged admission for. In her bookMedical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present, Harriet Washington included this as an example of the way African Americans were treated as subhuman in terms of medical procedures and testing.[81]Another Barnum hoax was theFiji Mermaidwhich in reality was the body of a monkey and the tail of a fish.[82]Barnum's shows were also notorious for the cruelty inflicted on the animals, which resulted in the death of at least two whales.[83][84]Rhoda Roberts, arts director of theSydney Opera House, criticized the film for failing to address that Barnum coerced and kidnapped native peoples to perform inhuman zoosas a form of entertainment.[85]
In addition to leaving out many aspects of Barnum's career, the people and events depicted in the movie were heavily fictionalized. Two of the lead characters, Phillip Carlyle and Anne Wheeler, were completely fictional. The character of Jenny Lind is portrayed as a glamorous woman who becomes infatuated with Barnum and, when he doesn't respond to her overtures, quits the show. In her final performance, she lures Barnum out to the stage for a public kiss in an attempt to flame rumors about their romance. In reality, Lind dressed plainly and was known for her charitable donations both in her home country and to various charities in the United States. Neither Lind nor Barnum displayed any romantic interest in each other. Lind found Barnum to be crude and Barnum was more interested in money than romance. Lind broke off her successful tour with Barnum early because she was unhappy with Barnum's marketing.[86]

Coyote was one of the founders of theDiggers, ananarchistimprov groupactive inHaight-Ashburyduring the mid 1960s, including theSummer of Love.[4][5]
Coyote was born Robert Peter Cohon on October 10, 1941,[1][6]inNew York City, the son of Ruth (néeFidler) and Morris Cohon, an investment banker.[7]His father was ofSephardic Jewishdescent and his mother came from a working-classAshkenazi Jewishfamily. Her father, trained as arabbiin Russia, escaped being drafted into theImperial Russian Army, and eventually ran a small candy store inthe Bronx.[8]Coyote "was raised in a highly intellectual, cultural but unreligious family",[8]involved in left-wing politics.[9]He grew up inEnglewood, New Jersey,[10]and graduated fromDwight Morrow High Schoolthere in 1960. Coyote later said that he was "half black and half white inside" due to the strong influence of Susie Nelson, his family'sAfrican-Americanhousekeeper.[11]Coyote is the maternal uncle of librarianJessamyn West.[12]
While a student atGrinnell College, Iowa, in 1961, Coyote was one of the organizers of a group of twelve students who traveled to Washington, D.C. during theCuban Missile Crisissupporting PresidentJohn F. Kennedy's "peace race". Kennedy invited the group into theWhite House, the first time protesters had ever been so recognized, and they met for several hours withMcGeorge Bundy. The group received wide press coverage. Theymimeographedthe resulting headlines and sent them to every college in the United States.[6]He was also in a band called the Kittatinny Mountain Boys.[13]
Upon graduation from Grinnell with aBachelor of ArtsinEnglish literaturein 1964,[6]he moved to theWest Coast, despite having been accepted at theIowa Writers' Workshop,[6]and commenced working toward a master's degree increative writingatSan Francisco State University.[6]
While still at Grinnell, Coyote ingestedpeyoteand had a profound experience with something he recognized as an animal spirit. At the next dawn he came to in a cornfield dotted with paw-prints.

After meetingRolling Thunder(John Pope), a purported Paiute-Shoshoneshaman, who informed him that there were two ways to regard what he had experienced. "You could consider it a hallucination", he said, "and you'll just remain a white man and be ok. Or, you could consider that the Universe opened itself to you, and if you consider it deeply enough, you might become a human being." Peter considered what he had been saying for several months, and then changed his last name to Coyote, the first step toward understanding its significance. The immediate, unanticipated consequence, was that no one, not even Peter knew who Peter Coyote was, and he was liberated from his personal history. From that point on, he never knew "where the rabbit would break from the brush".[14]
After a short apprenticeship at the San FranciscoActor's Workshop, he joined theSan Francisco Mime Troupe, a radical political street theater whose members were arrested for performing in parks without permits.

They fed nearly 600 people a day for "free", asking only that people pass through a six-foot by six-foot square known as The Free Frame of Reference. They ran a Free Store,[17][18](where not only the goods, but the management roles were free), a Free Medical Clinic, and even a short-lived Free Bank.[16]The Diggers evolved into a group known as the Free Family, which established chains of communes around thePacific NorthwestandSouthwest.
