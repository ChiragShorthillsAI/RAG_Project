Rooted inEast Coast hip-hop, he is regarded asone of the greatest rappers of all time.[2][3][4]The son of jazz musicianOlu Dara, Nas began his musical career in 1989 under the moniker "Nasty Nas", and recorded demos under the wing of fellow East Coast rapperLarge Professor. Nas made his recording debut on Professor's group,Main Source's 1991 song "Live at the Barbeque".
Nas signed withColumbia Recordsin 1992, and released his debut studio album,Illmatic(1994), two years later. An inductee of theLibrary of Congress'sNational Recording Registry, it has been regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time.[5][6][7]His second album,It Was Written(1996), debuted atop theBillboard200and sold over a quarter-million units in its first week; the album, along with its lead single "If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)" (featuringLauryn Hill), propelled Nas into mainstream success.[8]Both released in 1999, Nas' third and fourth albumsI AmandNastradamuswere criticized as inconsistent and too commercially oriented, with critics and audiences fearing a decline in the quality of his output.
From 2001 to 2005, Nas was involved in a highly publicized feud with fellow New York rapperJay-Z, popularized by the former'sdiss track"Ether". The feud, along with Nas' subsequent releasesStillmatic(2001),God's Son(2002), and the double albumStreet's Disciple(2004) helped him restore his critical standing. Nas then reconciled with Jay-Z prior to signing with his then-spearheaded label,Def Jam Recordingsin 2006; he adopted a more provocative, politicized direction with the albumsHip Hop Is Dead(2006) and hisuntitled ninth studio album(2008). In 2010, Nas releasedDistant Relatives, a collaborative album withDamian Marleythat donated its royalties to active African charities. His tenth studio album,Life Is Good(2012), was nominated forBest Rap Albumat the55th Annual Grammy Awards. After thirteen nominations, his thirteenth studio album,King's Disease(2020) won his first Grammy for Best Rap Album at the63rd Annual Grammy Awards. His five subsequent albums—King's Disease II,Magic(2021),King's Disease III(2022),Magic 2, andMagic 3(2023)—were each produced entirely byHit-Boyand met with critical praise.
Nas has been second ranked byThe Sourceon their "Top 50 Lyricists of All Time" list in 2012, fourth onMTV's Annual Hottest MCs in the Gamelist in 2013, and was named the "Greatest MC of All Time" byAbout.comin 2014. The following year, Nas was featured on the "10 Best Rappers of All Time" list byBillboard. Outside of recording, he serves asassociate publisherofMass Appealmagazine, and co-founded its spin-off divisionMass Appeal Records, a record label that has signed artists includingDave East,N.O.R.E.,Run the Jewels, andSwizz Beatz, among others.[9]Nas has released seventeen studio albums since 1994, ten of which are certifiedgold, platinum or multi-platinum in the U.S.[10]
Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones[11]was born in theBrooklynborough ofNew York Cityon September 14, 1973, to African American parents.[12][13]His father,Olu Dara(born Charles Jones III), is a jazz and blues musician fromMississippi. His mother, Fannie Ann (née Little; 1941–2002) was aU.S. Postal Serviceworker fromNorth Carolina.[14][15][16]He has a brother, Jabari Fret, who raps under the name Jungle and is a member ofhip-hopgroupBravehearts. His father adopted the name "Olu Dara" from theYoruba people.[17]"Nasir" is anArabicname meaning "helper and protector", while "bin" means "son of" in Arabic.[18]He is a cousin of actorsYara ShahidiandSayeed Shahidi.[19]
As a young child, Nas and his family relocated to theQueensbridge housing projectof theLong Island Citycommunity area in the borough ofQueens. His neighbor, Willie "Ill Will" Graham, influenced his interest in hip-hop by playing him records.[20]His parents divorced in 1985,[20]and he dropped out of school after the eighth grade.[13]He educated himself aboutAfrican culturethrough theFive-Percent Nation(a splinter group of theNation of Islam)[21]and theNuwaubian Nation. In his early years, he played the trumpet and began writing his own rhymes.[22]
As a teenager, Nas enlisted his best friend and upstairs neighbor Willie "Ill Will" Graham as his DJ. Nas initially went by the nickname"Kid Wave"before adopting his more commonly known alias of "Nasty Nas".[23]In 1989, then-16-year-old Nas met up with producerLarge Professor[24]and went to the studio whereRakimandKool G Rapwere recording their albums. When they were not in the recording studio, Nas would go into the booth and record his own material. However, none of it was ever released.[25][26]
In 1991, Nas performed onMain Source's "Live at the Barbeque", also produced by Large Professor. In mid-1992, Nas was approached byMC Serchof3rd Bass, who became his manager and secured Nas a record deal withColumbia Recordsduring the same year. Nas made his solo debut under the name of "Nasty Nas" on the single "Halftime" from MC Serch's soundtrack for the filmZebrahead.[13]Called the newRakim,[27]his rhyming skills attracted a significant amount of attention within the hip-hop community.
In 1994, Nas's debut album,Illmatic, was released. It featured production fromLarge Professor,Pete Rock,Q-Tip,LESandDJ Premier, as well as guest appearances from Nas's friendAZand his father Olu Dara. The album spawned several singles, including "The World Is Yours", "It Ain't Hard to Tell", and "One Love". Shaheem Reid ofMTV NewscalledIllmatic"the first classicLP" of 1994.[28]In 1994, Nas also recorded the song "One on One" for the soundtrack to the filmStreet Fighter.[29]In his bookTo the Break of Dawn: A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic,William Jelani Cobbwrites of Nas's impact at the time:
Nas, the poetic sage of the Queensbridge projects, was hailed as the second coming ofRakim—as if the first had reached his expiration date. [...] Nas never became 'the next Rakim,' nor did he really have to.Illmaticstood on its own terms. The sublime lyricism of the CD, combined with the fact that it was delivered into the crucible of the boilingEast-Westconflict, quickly solidified [his] reputation as the premier writer of his time.[30]
Illmaticwas awarded best album of 1994 byThe Source.[31]Steve Huey ofAllMusicdescribed Nas's lyrics onIllmaticas "highly literate" and his raps "superbly fluid regardless of the size of his vocabulary", adding that Nas is "able to evoke the bleak reality of ghetto life without losing hope or forgetting the good times".[32]About.com rankedIllmaticas the greatest hip-hop album of all time,[5]andPrefixmagazine praised it as "the best hip hop record ever made".[6]
In 1995, Nas did guest performances on the albumsDoe or DiebyAZ,The InfamousbyMobb Deep,Only Built 4 Cuban LinxbyRaekwonand4,5,6byKool G Rap. Nas also parted ways with managerMC Serch, enlistedSteve Stoute, and began preparation for his second album,It Was Written. The album was chiefly produced by Tone and Poke of theTrackmasters, as Nas consciously worked towards a crossover-oriented sound.Columbia Recordshad begun to pressure Nas to work towards more commercial topics, such as that ofThe Notorious B.I.G.and had become successful by releasing street singles that still retained radio-friendly appeal. The album also expanded on Nas's Escobar persona, who lived aScarface/Casino-esque lifestyle. On the other hand, references toScarfaceprotagonistTony Montananotwithstanding,Illmaticwas more about his early life growing up in the projects.[13]
It Was Writtenwas released in mid-1996. Two singles, "If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)" (featuringLauryn HillofThe Fugees) and"Street Dreams"(including a remix withR. Kelly), were instant hits.[33]These songs were promoted by big-budget music videos directed byHype Williams, making Nas a common name among mainstreamhip-hop. ReviewingIt Was Written, Leo Stanley of Allmusic believed the album's rhymes were not as complex as those ofIllmatic, but still thought Nas had "deepened his talents, creating a complex series of rhymes that not only flow, but manage to tell coherent stories as well."[34]It Was Writtenfeatured the debut ofthe Firm, a supergroup consisting of Nas,AZ,Foxy Brown, andCormega.[35]
Signed toDr. Dre'sAftermath Entertainmentlabel, the Firm began working on their debut album. Halfway through the production of the album,Cormegawas fired from the group bySteve Stoute, who had unsuccessfully attempted to force Cormega to sign a deal with his management company. Cormega subsequently became one of Nas's most vocal opponents and released a number ofunderground hip-hopsinglesdissingNas, Stoute, andNature, who replaced Cormega as the fourth member of the Firm.[36]Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature Present The Firm: The Albumwas finally released in 1997 to mixed reviews. The album failed to live up to its expected sales despite being certified platinum, and the members of the group disbanded to go their separate ways.[37]
During this period, Nas was one of four rappers (the others beingB-Real,KRS-OneandRBX) in the hip-hop supergroupGroup Therapy, who appeared on the song "East Coast/West Coast Killas" fromDr. Dre Presents the Aftermath.[38]
In late 1998, Nas began working on a double album, to be entitledI Am... The Autobiography; he intended it as the middle ground betweenIllmaticandIt Was Written, with each track detailing a part of his life.[13]In 1998, Nas co-wrote and starred inHype Williams's feature filmBelly.[13]I Am... The Autobiographywas completed in early 1999, and a music video was shot for its lead single, "Nas Is Like". It was produced byDJ Premierand contained vocal samples from "It Ain't Hard to Tell". Music critic M.F. DiBella noticed that Nas also covered "politics, the state of hip-hop,Y2K,race, and religion with his own unique perspective" in the album besides autobiographical lyrics.[39]Much of the LP was leaked into MP3 format onto the Internet, and Nas and Stoute quickly recorded enough substitute material to constitute a single-disc release.[31]
The second single onI Am...was "Hate Me Now", featuringSean "Puffy" Combs, which was used as an example by Nas's critics accusing him of moving towards more commercial themes. The video featured Nas and Combs beingcrucifiedin a manner similar to Jesus Christ; after the video was completed, Combs requested his crucifixion scene be edited out of the video. However, the unedited copy of the "Hate Me Now" video made its way to MTV. Within minutes of the broadcast, Combs and his bodyguards allegedly made their way intoSteve Stoute's office and assaulted him, at one point apparently hitting Stoute over the head with a champagne bottle. Stoute pressed charges, but he and Combssettled out-of-courtthat June.[31]Columbia had scheduled to release theinfringedmaterial fromI Am...under the titleNastradamusduring the later half of 1999, but, at the last minute, Nas decided to record an entire new album for the 1999 release ofNastradamus.Nastradamuswas therefore rushed to meet a November release date. Though critical reviews were unfavorable, it did result in a minor hit, "You Owe Me".[13]Fans and critics feared that Nas's career was declining, artistically and commercially, as bothI Am...andNastradamuswere criticized as inconsistent and overtly-commercialized.[40]
In 2000,Nas & Ill Will Records Presents QB's Finest, which is popularly known as simplyQB's Finest, was released on Nas'sIll Will Records.[13]QB's Finestis a compilation album that featured Nas and a number of other rappers fromQueensbridgeprojects, includingMobb Deep,Nature,Capone, theBravehearts,Tragedy Khadafi, Millennium Thug andCormega, who had briefly reconciled with Nas. The album also featured guest appearances from Queensbridge hip-hop legendsRoxanne Shanté,MC Shan, andMarley Marl. Shan and Marley Marl both appeared on the lead single "Da Bridge 2001", which was based on Shan & Marl's 1986 recording "The Bridge".[41]
After trading veiled criticisms on various songs, freestyles and mixtape appearances, the highly publicised dispute between Nas andJay-Zbecame widely known to the public in 2001.[13]Jay-Z, in his song "Takeover", criticised Nas by calling him "fake" and his career "lame".[42]Nas responded with "Ether", in which he compared Jay-Z to such characters asJ.J. Evansfrom the sitcomGood Timesand cigarette company mascotJoe Camel. The song was included on Nas's fifth studio album,Stillmatic, released in December 2001. His daughter, Destiny, is listed as an executive producer onStillmaticso she could receive royalty checks from the album.[43][44]Stillmaticpeaked at No. 5 on the U.S.Billboard200chart and featured the singles "Got Ur Self A..." and "One Mic".
In response to "Ether", Jay-Z released the song "Supa Ugly", whichHot 97radio hostAngie Martinezpremiered on December 11, 2001.[42]In the song, Jay-Z explicitly boasts about having an affair with Nas's girlfriend, Carmen Bryan.[45]New York City hip-hop radio stationHot 97issued a poll asking listeners which rapper made the betterdiss song; Nas won with 58% while Jay-Z got 42% of the votes.[46]In 2002, in the midst of the dispute between the two New York rappers,Eminemcited both Nas and Jay-Z as being two of the best MCs in the industry, in his song "'Till I Collapse". Both the dispute andStillmaticsignaled an artistic comeback for Nas after a string of inconsistent albums.[47]The Lost Tapes, a compilation of previously unreleased or bootlegged songs from 1998 to 2001, was released by Columbia in September 2002. The collection attained respectable sales and received rave reviews from critics.[31]
In December 2002, Nas released theGod's Sonalbum including its lead single, "Made You Look" which used a pitched down sample of theIncredible Bongo Band's "Apache". The album peaked at No. 12 on theBillboardHot 100and No. 1 on theTop R&B/Hip-Hop Albumscharts despite widespread Internet bootlegging.[48]Time Magazine named his album best hip-hop album of the year.Vibegave it four stars andThe Sourcegave it four mics. The second single, "I Can", which reworked elements fromBeethoven's "Für Elise", became Nas's biggest hit to date in 2003, garnering substantial radio airplay on urban,rhythmic, andtop 40radio stations, as well as on the MTV andVH1music video networks.God's Sonalso includes several songs dedicated to Nas's mother, who died of cancer in April 2002, including "Dance". In 2003, Nas was featured on theKornsong "Play Me", from Korn'sTake a Look in the MirrorLP. Also in 2003, a live performance in New York City, featuringLudacris,Jadakiss, andDarryl McDaniels(ofRun-D.M.C.fame), was released on DVD asMade You Look: God's Son Live.[citation needed]
God's Sonwas critical in the power struggle between Nas and Jay-Z in the hip-hop industry at the time. In an article at the time, Joseph Jones ofPopMattersstated, "Whether you like it or not, "Ether" did this. WithGod's Son, Nas has the opportunity to cement his status as the King of NY, at least for another 3-4-year term, or he could prove that he is not the savior that hip-hop fans should be pinning their hopes on."[49]After the album's release, he began helpingthe Bravehearts, an act including his younger brother Jungle and friend Wiz (Wizard), put together their debut album,Bravehearted. The album featured guest appearances from Nas, Nashawn (Millennium Thug),Lil Jon, andJully Black.
Nas released his seventh albumStreet's Disciple, a sprawling double album, on November 30, 2004. It addressed subject matter both political and personal, including his impending marriage to recording artistKelis.[13]The double-sided single "Thief's Theme"/"You Know My Style" was released months before the album's release, followed by the single "Bridging the Gap" upon the album's release. AlthoughStreet's Disciplewentplatinum, it served as a drop-off from Nas's previous commercial successes.[13]
In 2005, New York-based rapper50 Centdissed Nas on his song "Piggy Bank", which brought his reputation into question in hip-hop circles.[13]In October, Nas made a surprise appearance at Jay-Z's "I Declare War" concert, where they reconciled their beef.[13]At the show, Jay-Z announced to the crowd, "It's bigger than 'I Declare War'. Let's go, Esco!" and Nas then joined him onstage,[50]and the two performed Jay-Z's "Dead Presidents" (1996) together, a song that featured a prominent sample of Nas's 1994 track, "The World Is Yours" (1994).[13]
The reconciliation between Nas and Jay-Z created the opportunity for Nas to sign a deal withDef Jam Recordings, of which Jay-Z was president at the time.[13]Jay-Z signed Nas on January 23, 2006; the signing included an agreement that Nas was to be paid about $3,000,000, including a recording budget, for each of his first two albums with Def Jam.[51]
Tentatively calledHip Hop Is Dead...The N,[52]Hip Hop Is Deadwas a commentary on the state of hip-hop and featured "Black Republican", a hyped collaboration with Jay-Z.[13]The album debuted on Def Jam and Nas new imprint at that label, The Jones Experience, at No. 1 on theBillboard200charts, selling 355,000 copies—Nas's third number one album, along withIt Was WrittenandI Am....[53]It also inspired reactions about the state of hip-hop,[13]particularly controversy withSouthern hip-hopartists who felt the album's title was a criticism aimed at them.[54]Nas's 2004 song, "Thief's Theme", was featured in the 2006 film,The Departed.[55]Nas's former label,Columbia Records, released the compilationGreatest Hitsin November.[56]
On October 12, 2007, Nas announced that his next album would be calledNigger. Bothprogressivecommentators, such asJesse JacksonandAl Sharpton, and the conservative-aligned news channelFox Newswere outraged; Jackson called on entertainers to stop using the epithet after comedianMichael Richardsused it onstage in late 2006.[57]Controversy escalated as the album's impending release date drew nearer, going as far as to spark rumors thatDef Jamwas planning to drop Nas unless he changed the title.[58]Additionally, then-Fort Greene, Brooklynassemblyman (later United States Representative)Hakeem Jeffriesrequested that New York State ComptrollerThomas DiNapoliwithdraw $84,000,000 from the statepension fundthat had been invested intoUniversaland its parent company,Vivendi, if the album's title was not changed.[59]On the opposite side of the spectrum, many of the most famous names in the entertainment industry supported Nas for using the racial epithet as the title of his full-length LP.[60][61]Nas's management worried the album would not be sold by chain stores such asWal-Mart, thus limiting its distribution.[62]
On May 19, 2008, Nas decided to forgo an album title.[63]Responding toJesse Jackson's remarks and use of the word "nigger", Nas called him "the biggest player hater", stating "His time is up. All you old niggas' time is up. We heard your voice, we saw your marching, we heard your sermons. We don't want to hear that shit no more. It's a new day. It's a new voice. I'm here now. We don't need Jesse; I'm here. I got this. We the voice now. It's no more Jesse. Sorry. Goodbye. You ain't helping nobody in the 'hood and that's the bottom line."[64]He also said of the album's title: "It's important to me that this album gets to the fans. It's been a long time coming. I want my fans to know that creatively and lyrically, they can expect the same content and the same messages. The people will always know what the real title of this album is and what to call it."[65]
The album was ultimately released on July 15, 2008, untitled. It featured production fromPolow da Don,stic.manofDead Prez, Sons of Light and J. Myers,[66]"Hero", the album's lead single released on June 23, 2008, reached No. 97 on theBillboardHot 100 and No. 87 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks.[67]In July, Nas attained a shoe deal withFila.[68]In an interview withMTV Newsin July, Nas speculated that he might release two albums: one produced byDJ Premierand another byDr. Dre—simultaneously the same day.[69]Nas worked on Dr. Dre's studio albumDetox.[70]Nas was also awarded 'Emcee of the Year' in the HipHopDX 2008 Awards for his latest solo effort, the quality of his appearances on other albums and was described as having "become an artist who thrives off of reinvention and going against the system."[71]
At the2009 Grammy Awards, Nas confirmed he was collaborating on an album withreggaesingerDamian Marleywhich was expected to be released in late 2009. Nas said of the collaboration in an interview "I was a big fan of his father and of course all the children, all the offspring, and Damian, I kind of looked at Damian as a rap guy. His stuff is not really singing, or if he does, it comes off more hard, like on some street shit. I always liked how reggae and hip-hop have always been intertwined and always kind of pushed each other, I always liked the connection. I'd worked with people before from the reggae world but when I worked with Damian, the whole workout was perfect".[72]A portion of the profit was planned to go towards building a school in Africa.[73]He went on to say that it was "too early to tell the title or anything like that".[74]The Los Angeles Timesreported that the album would be titledDistant Relatives.[75]Nas also revealed that he would begin working on his tenth studio album following the release ofDistant Relatives.[76]During late 2009, Nas used his live band Mulatto with music director Dustin Moore for concerts in Europe and Australia.[77]

But we decided that we should make it an album."[84]Life is Goodwould be nominated forBest Rap Albumat the2013 Grammy Awards.

Nas has been praised for his ability to create a "devastating match between lyrics and production" by journalistPeter Shapiro, as well as creating a "potent evocation of life on the street", and he has even been compared toRakimfor his lyrical technique. In his bookBook of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop(2009), writer Adam Bradley states, "Nas is perhaps contemporary rap's greatest innovator in storytelling. His catalog includes songs narrated before birth ('Fetus') and after death ('Amongst Kings'), biographies ('UBR [Unauthorized Biography of Rakim]') and autobiographies ('Doo Rags'), allegorical tales ('Money Is My Bitch') and epistolary ones ('One Love'), he's rapped in the voice of a woman ('Sekou Story') and even of a gun ('I Gave You Power')."[119]Robert Christgauwrites that "Nas has been transfiguring [gangsta rap] sinceIllmatic".[120]Kool Moe Deenotes that Nas has an "off-beat conversational flow" in his bookThere's a God on the Mic– he says: "before Nas, everyMCfocused on rhyming with a cadence that ultimately put the words that rhymed on beat with thesnare drum. Nas created a style ofrappingthat was more conversational than ever before".[121]

In response to this, Jay-Z asked producer Ski Beatz to sample a line from Nas's songThe World is Yours, with the sample featured heavily in what went on to beDead Presidents II. The two traded subliminal responses for the next couple of years, until the beef was escalated further in 2001 after Jay-Z publicly addressed Nas at theSummer Jam, performing what would go on to be known as "Takeover", ending the performance by saying "ask Nas, he don't want it with Hov". After Jay-Z eventually released the song on his 2001 albumThe Blueprint, Nas responded with the song "Ether", from his albumStillmatic, with both fans and critics saying that the song had effectively saved Nas's career and marked his return to prominence, and almost unanimously agreeing Nas had won their feud.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
