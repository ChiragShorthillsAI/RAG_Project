Padgett Sawyer is aTikTokinfluencerin her final year of high school who lives with her divorced mother, a local nurse. She pretends to live in an upscale condo to hide her real living conditions from her followers and sponsors, fearing they wouldn't like her.
One day, Padgett discovers that her boyfriend, influencer and aspiring hip-hop artist Jordan Van Draanen, is cheating on her with abackup dancer. She finds herself humiliated when a live stream of her outburst results in losing followers and sponsorship deals because the camera was still on when it happened. To redeem herself, Padgett accepts a bet to turn Cameron Kweller, an antisocial photography student and the school's least popular young man, into prom king. Despite his indifference towards her, Padgett continues with the bet. She gains information about him from his younger sister, Brin, and to get closer to him, she begins taking horse riding lessons with him.
Over time, while keeping her word on the bet, Padgett begins to bond more with Cameron and discovers that he and his younger sister lost their mother years ago in a plane crash and live with their grandmother while their father resides inSweden. Padgett fixes Cameron's appearance and attire and tries to expand his social interactions at her friend Quinn's party, where he saves her from humiliation when Jordan appears with the backup dancer. At Padgett's friend Alden'sGreat Gatsby-themed birthday party, Cameron fights with Jordan when he tries to get sexual with Brin. His mother's camera is ruined in the process, causing him to leave the party in a rage despite Padgett's attempts to console him. She regrets following through with the bet but does not back down because otherwise, she would have to show the whole school and her social media her authentic self.
The next day, Alden turns on Padgett, revealing her plot to become prom queen alongside Jordan and her true colors. She is also responsible for intentionally live-streaming Padgett's outburst. Padgett begins to fall for Cameron, but she is afraid to express her feelings after she kisses him. When Brin finds out that Padgett kissed Cameron, she suggests he ask her to prom. To ensure Padgett's loss, Alden exposes her bet with Padgett to Cameron, who now believes that she only feigned interest because of the bet. On the prom day, Padgett's mother encourages her to go still, telling her to go as herself and not as a social influencer. Cameron refuses to go to prom. Realizing that her older brother has been smiling for the first time since their mother's death when Padgett came into his life, Brin persuades him to go. He doesn't show up, and Padgett declines her role as Prom Queen. To Alden's surprise, Principal Bosch names Celeste the Prom Queen. Padgett finds Cameron outside the school on a horse and kisses him after apologizing.
Padgett gains her fan following back and takes her social media influencing in a new direction by traveling to various destinations across the world alongside her devoted boyfriend Cameron.[3]

Courtney Howard ofVarietysaid "He's All Thatmakes some smart alterations to the original despite mimeographing the structure, and strikes a benevolent balance between old and new with a light sprinkling of references. However, there are many more maddeningly underwhelming elements."[20]ABC News'Peter Traversgave a negative review, saying "manufactured for theKissing Boothcrowd, this gender-swapped,TikTok-friendly update of the 1999 teen hit sounds awful and it often is, but enough charm pokes through the cracks to sucker anyone who ever fell for a makeover fable."[21]Robyn Bahr ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "He's All Thatmay be a flattened reflection of its predecessor, but both films are charming enough to get away with about one anal sex innuendo joke apiece" and that the film "is really no worse than the first film."[22]
Nell Minow, writing forRogerEbert.com, was more positive in her review of the film, giving it a score of 3 out of 4 stars. She wrote: "sweet little end of summer sorbet with appealing young performers and a script that refreshes the original without overdoing it."[23]Michael Ordoña of theLos Angeles Timesgave a mostly positive review by stating "You'll be pleased to discover the entertaining remake has its charms; it actually is all that, for the most part."[24]

Miramax, LLC, formerly known asMiramax Films, is an American independentfilmandtelevision productionanddistributioncompany owned bybeIN Media GroupandParamount Global. Based inLos Angeles,California, it was founded on December 19, 1979, by brothersBobandHarvey Weinstein.
It was a leading producer and distributor of independent films until it was acquried byThe Walt Disney Companyon June 30, 1993. In 2010, Disney sold it toFilmyard Holdings, a joint venture ofColony NorthStar,Tutor-Saliba CorporationandQatar Investment Authority.[1][2]In March 2016, the company was sold to thebeIN Media Group, which later sold a 49% stake toParamount Global(previously known as ViacomCBS) on April 3, 2020.
Miramax was founded as Miramax Films by the Weinstein brothers, Bob and Harvey along with executive Corky Burger inBuffalo, New York, in 1979, and was named by combining the first names of their parents, Miriam and Max.[3]It was created to distributeindependent filmsdeemed commercially unfeasible by themajor studios.
The company's first major success came when the Weinsteins teamed up with British producerMartin Lewisand acquired the U.S. rights to two concert films Lewis had produced ofbenefit showsforhuman rightsorganizationAmnesty International. The Weinsteins worked with Lewis to distill the two films into one film for the American marketplace. The resulting film, the American version ofThe Secret Policeman's Other Ball, was a successful release for Miramax in the summer of 1982. This release presaged amodus operandithat the company would undertake later in the 1980s of acquiring films from international filmmakers and reworking them to suit American sensibilities and audiences. In its early years, Miramax Films had to focus primarily as a catalyst for music and decided to do a licensing agreement withThorn EMI Videoto release several of Miramax's early films.[4]
Among the company's other breakthrough films as distributors in the late 1980s and early 1990s werePulp Fiction,Scandal,Sex, Lies, and Videotape,Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!,The Crying Game,andClerks. The company also made films such asFlirting with Disaster,Heavenly Creatures, andShakespeare in Love.
Miramax Films acquired and/or produced many other films that did well financially. The company became one of the leaders of the independent film boom of the 1990s. Miramax Films produced or distributed seven films with box office grosses totaling more than $100 million; its highest grossing title,Chicago, earned more than $300 million worldwide.[5]
The company was also successful in securingAcademy Awardnominations for its releases, many of which resulted inOscarwins.
On June 30, 1993,The Walt Disney Companypurchased Miramax Films for $60 million and assumed all of the company's debt, which was more than $40 million. The acquisition gave Disney entry to the independent film market.[6]Harvey and Bob Weinstein continued to operate Miramax Films until they left the company on September 30, 2005. During their tenure, the Weinstein brothers ran Miramax Films independently of other Disney subsidiaries and, as a result, had more autonomy than the other Disney-owned companies. Disney, however, had the final say on what Miramax Films could release (for example, Disney had banned Miramax Films from releasingKids,DogmaandFahrenheit 9/11).[7]Disney'sBuena Vista Home Entertainmentdivision released Miramax output on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray Disc under the nameMiramax Home Entertainmentin some countries, including the United States; elsewhere, the overall distribution of Miramax Films' output was passed to the regional licensees of Miramax International, a distribution arm of Miramax Films that was fully autonomous from Disney's own distribution operations.
With a more stable budget, Miramax Films began moving beyond acquisitions and distribution and into film production. Until September 30, 2005, the company also operated the labelDimension Films, which was solely founded by Bob to specialize in teen, horror, and other genre films,[8]and created theScreamandScary Moviefilm franchises. Harvey funded larger projects from up-and-coming directors, includingRobert Rodriguez,Gus Van Sant, andQuentin Tarantino. Some of the films earned Oscars.[8]At times the studio tried to release a film almost weekly.[9]
In 1997, Miramax Films joinedPeter Jacksonas a primary financial backer in attempting to get theLord of the Ringsfilms produced. Disney disliked the cost of a two-parter, requesting that it be produced as a single film. Jackson andSaul Zaentzrejected Disney's request and looked for another studio or financier. Thus, Miramax Films sold the rights forThe Lord of the RingsandThe HobbittoNew Line Cinemain August 1998 for about $12 million, which ledThe Lord of the Ringsto be produced as a trilogy. Miramax Films retained a 5% stake in the films' gross and then gave 2.5% to the Weinsteins.[10]
Through Miramax Films, Harvey foundedTalkmagazine withTina Brownin 1998 (it shut down in 2002), albeit without the approval of then-Disney chiefMichael Eisner, which upset Eisner. Also that year, 30 former employees filed suit over unpaid overtime wages.[8]
By 2003, Miramax Films was less operative in the independent film market and became more of a mini-major as the company only acquired 3 films while producingCold Mountainfor $80 million. The Weinsteins claimed the company was profitable, but Walt Disney Company presidentRobert Igerindicated in June 2004 that they were not properly accounting for "account standard overhead, distribution fees, bonuses that we pay Harvey and Bob. Nor are they applying current accounting rules."[8]
After extensive negotiations and much media and industry speculation, on March 30, 2005, Disney and the Weinsteins announced that they would not renew their contractual relationship when their existing agreements expired at the end of September 2005. The primary source of dispute was over distribution ofFahrenheit 9/11by Michael Moore.[11]Disney's film studio consortium,Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, assumed control of Miramax Films, which was projected to have a smaller annual production budget. The Weinsteins started a new film production company calledThe Weinstein Company(TWC) and took theDimension Filmslabel with them. The Miramax Films name remained with the film studio owned by Disney. Production at Miramax Films was taken over byDaniel Battsek,[11]who had been head ofBuena Vista Internationalin theUK. Battsek refocused Miramax Films to produce films of high quality but low budget.Maple Picturesheld the rights to distribute Miramax films in Canada from 2008 up until August 10, 2011, when Maple Pictures was acquired byAlliance Films.[12]At the time, the company was criticized for delaying or withholding release of Asian films to which it acquired the U.S. distribution rights.[13]Previously, in 2003, the company was criticized for trying to bar retailers from legally exporting authentic DVDs of the films.[14]
On October 3, 2009, Disney announced that the staff of Miramax Films was to be reduced by 70%, and the number of releases would be reduced by half to just three films per year. The label's marketing, distribution, and administrative functions, which had operated independently, would be folded into the parent studio in Burbank. The move became effective in January 2010.[15]On October 30, 2009, Disney announced the resignation of Daniel Battsek as President of Miramax Films, effective when the transition from the studio in New York toBurbankwas completed.[16]The company merged its operations with The Walt Disney Studios on January 28, 2010, shutting down Miramax Films' separate New York and Los Angeles offices.[11][17]
Though Disney Studio ChairmanDick Cookwas a staunch supporter of Miramax Films, the brand was less of a priority for CEOBob Iger, whose strategy was to focus on Disney's branded mass entertainment that could be exploited across Disney's theme parks, television, and consumer products. Following Disney's $4 billion acquisition ofMarvel Entertainmentin 2009, Cook was succeeded byRich Ross.[18]As a result, Miramax Films was relegated to the status of distribution label within the Walt Disney Company.[19]The company confirmed that it was looking into selling the Miramax label on February 9, 2010, with Bob Iger explaining "We determined that continuing to invest in new Miramax movies wasn't necessarily a core strategy of ours".[20]
On December 3, 2010, Disney closed the sale of Miramax for US$663 million toFilmyard Holdings, an investment group and joint venture ofColony NorthStar,Tutor-Saliba Corporation, andQatar Investment Authority. The sale included 700 film titles, books, development projects, and the "Miramax" name.Mike Lang, the formerNews Corporationbusiness development executive who was selected as the CEO of Miramax,[21]indicated that the company would focus on their existing library, though they would continue making original content.[22][23]
After the sale was closed, some films already developed at Miramax, includingThe TempestandGnomeo & Juliet, were eventually released by Disney under itsTouchstone Picturesbanner, and theatrical distribution ofDon't Be Afraid of the Dark[24]andThe Debt[25]were shifted toFilmDistrictandFocus Featuresrespectively.
On December 16, 2013, Miramax entered into a deal with Harvey and Bob Weinstein'sThe Weinstein Companyto develop and distribute select derivative works of films from the former studio. Sequels, television series, or stage productions of titles such asRoundersandShakespeare in Lovewere among the projects said to be part of this agreement.[26][27][28]
On July 17, 2015, Qatar and Colony NorthStar put Miramax up for sale for an offer of $1 billion.[29][30][31]Harvey and Bob Weinstein had reportedly regained interest in reacquiring the studio via TWC in September.[32][33][34][35][36][37]On March 2, 2016, Miramax was sold tobeIN Media Group, a spinoff ofAl Jazeera Media Network(which formerly owned its namesakebeIN Sports).[38][39][40]
On a July 21, 2016, interview, Harvey Weinstein stated that he was still interested in combining TWC's film library with Miramax's, after the acquisition of the latter by beIN.[41]
After Miramax's founder Harvey Weinsteinwas accused of sexual assaultin October 2017, Miramax became one of 60 parties bidding on The Weinstein Company on January 16, 2018.[42]On April 27, Miramax and Lantern Capital emerged as the strongest contenders to acquire TWC's assets. Ultimately, it wasLanternthat acquired TWC's library.[43]
On June 7, 2019, beIN began the process of selling approximately 50% of Miramax in an effort to offer it for growth.[44]Lionsgate(which distributed Miramax's titles on home video),Spyglass Media Group(owners of the Weinstein Company library, inherited via their deal with Lantern) andViacom(Paramount's parent company whore-mergedwithCBS Corporationon December 4, 2019, to form ViacomCBS) were seen as the leading contenders to acquire a stake in the company.[45]By August 19, 2019, Lionsgate and Viacom were the only contenders, as Spyglass Media Group dropped out of contention.[46]On September 11, 2019, it was announced Lionsgate had dropped their bid, making Viacom the only bidder for the stake in Miramax.[47]On November 8, 2019, Viacom exited the negotiations to acquire them.[48]After merging with CBS Corporation to become ViacomCBS, the combined firm resumed talks with Miramax.[49]
On December 20, 2019, ViacomCBS (now known asParamount Global) announced it would acquire a 49% stake in Miramax for at least $375 million, withParamount Picturesgaining exclusive worldwide distribution rights to its film and television library. Paramount Pictures and Miramax will also co-produce new content based on titles from the library.[50]The deal officially closed on April 3, 2020.[51]
On June 24, 2020, Miramax and ViacomCBS announced their first co-production,The Turkish Detective, a television series based on theCetin Ikmennovels byBarbara Nadel.[52]
On October 2, 2023, it was announced that CEO Bill Block would be leaving the company that week following the end of his contract with them, starting his own production company, BlockFilm, later that month.[53][54]In January 2024,Jonathan Glickmanwas reported to be in talks to join Miramax as CEO, with his company Panoramic Media expected to be acquired by Miramax if talks were successful.[55]On April 2, 2024, Glickman was officially named Miramax's new CEO effective immediately. As part of the deal, Miramax also acquired certain film and TV projects from Glickman's company Panoramic Media.[56]
Miramax Family Filmswas the family division of Miramax Films, founded on September 2, 1993.[57]The label was quietly discontinued in 2006. On March 18, 2019, Miramax revived its family and animation divisions, with both being founded as separate divisions within the company.
Michael Lachance, who had previously developed projects atDreamWorks AnimationandSony Pictures Animation, was named the division's executive vice president.[58]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
