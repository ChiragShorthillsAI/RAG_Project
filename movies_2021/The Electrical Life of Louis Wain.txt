He takes the family and Emily to the theatre to seeThe Tempest, during which he has a recurring nightmare of drowning. Emily comforts him in the men's restroom, causing a scandal when a neighbor gossips about the incident. Caroline fires Emily that night but before she can leave, Louis professes his love and they begin a courtship.
They marry in 1884, causing another scandal due to her being ten years his senior and of lower class. Louis takes freelance artist work to continue supporting his mother and sisters. Emily is diagnosed withbreast cancer. They take in a stray kitten - unusual for the time - which they name Peter. Louis' initially realistic paintings of Peter become more anthropomorphic as Emily's condition worsens.
Financial pressure causes Sir William to cut Louis' workload, he advises Louis spend the time with Emily. She encourages Louis to show his cat pictures to Sir William, who prints them to acclaim in the Christmas edition. Emily dies. Louis draws more cat pictures, creating whole cat societies.
By 1891, Wain's cat pictures are enormously popular, featured on postcards and greeting cards, and changing the perception of cats as acceptable house pets. He hosts cat-themed events and is chairman of The National Cat Society. Unaware of the need tocopyrighthis work, Wain cannot profit from reproductions and the family remains in debt. Sister Marie becomes mentally unwell and the family is evicted.
Sir William provides a property at a reduced rate. Marie is institutionalised and Peter dies, causing Wain's own mental health to deteriorate. NewspapermagnateWilliam Randolph Hearstsponsors Wain on a trip toNew Yorkin 1907, whereMax Kasetells him people love his pictures.

In 1991 it bought a five percent stake in the independent American studioCarolco Pictures.[2]However, in 1992, Le Studio Canal+ suffered financial difficulties afterCarolco Picturesentered a corporate restructure.[citation needed]

The company's first production wasWalter, directed byStephen Frears, which was released in 1982. It is especially known for its gritty,kitchen sink-style films andperiod dramas.
In 1981, producerDavid Roseleft theBBCfor Channel 4 where he was appointed the Commissioning Editor for Fiction byJeremy Isaacs, the channel's founding Chief Executive but became mostly identified with theFilm on Fourstrand. With an initial overall budget of £6 million a year,Channel Four Filmswas to invest in twenty films annually for Film on Four.[1]The first film backed wasNeil Jordan's debut filmAngel(1982).[2]The first film shown as part of Film on Four wasStephen Frears'sWalterwhich was screened on 2 November 1982, the launch date of Channel 4.P'tang, Yang, Kipperbangscreened the following day was also an early highlight.[3]Originally, the company's films were intended for television screenings alone; the "holdback" system prevented investment in theatrical films by television companies because of the length of time (then three years) before broadcasters could screen them. An agreement soon concluded with the Cinema Exhibitors Association allowed a brief period of cinema exhibition if the budget of the films was below £1.25 million.[3]Channel Four Films struck several deals with other film production companies including theBFI Production Board,Goldcrest FilmsandMerchant Ivory.[3]By 1984, Channel Four Films were investing in a third of the feature films made in the UK.[4]
Channel Four's Business Development Department was formed in 1983 for TV and film sales[5]and they also invested in foreign films includingWim Wenders'Paris, Texas(1984) andJan Svankmajer'sAlice(1988).[3]In 1985FilmFour Internationalwas created as a separate international film sales arm and to invest in foreign film, includingAndrei Tarkovsky'sThe Sacrifice(1986).[5][2][3]
Channel Four Film's first big hit was Frears' third feature film for the cinema,My Beautiful Laundrette, in 1985.[6]Originally shot in16mmfor Channel 4 it was met with such critical acclaim at theEdinburgh Film Festivalthat it was acquired byOrion Classicsand distributed to cinemas and became an international success.[7][8][2]
In 1987, FilmFour International agreed a licensing deal with Orion Classics to handle US distribution of two more FilmFour features,Rita, Sue and Bob TooandA Month in the Country.[9]By 1987, Channel 4 had an interest in half the films being made in the United Kingdom.[10]
Rose and Channel Four Films are credited by many as being a significant figure in the regeneration of British cinema and particularly remembered for films such asWish You Were Here,Dance With a Stranger,Mona Lisa, andLetter to Brezhnev. Channel Four Films also invested in earlyWorking Title Filmsas well as most of the films of Frears,Ken LoachandMike Leigh.[2]Leigh told writerHannah Rothschildaround 2008 that Film on Four had saved the British film industry: "This is a non-negotiable, historical fact of life and anybody who suggests that this isn't the case is simply either suffering from some kind of ignorance or has got some terrible chip."[1]
Rose remained in his post as Commissioning Editor until March 1990.[6]During his tenure at Channel 4, Rose approved the making of 136 films, half of which received cinema screenings.[11]Of the films Rose backed, 20 were from overseas sources, including work by directorsTheo Angelopoulos,Andrei TarkovskyandWim Wenders.[12]The company also helped British minority filmmakers includingPo-Chih Leong(Ping Pong(1986));Horace Ové(Playing Away(1986)) andHanif Kureishi(My Beautiful Laundrette;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid(1987)). This continued after Rose's departure with films directed byGurinder Chadha(Bhaji on the Beach(1993)) andSteve McQueen(Hunger(2008)).[13]
David Aukinjoined as head of drama in October 1990 and took over responsibility for Film on Four.[6]He changed his title to head of film in 1997 which he remained until 1998.[2]
The company had another big international success with Jordan'sThe Crying Gamein 1992.[2]In addition it was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Pictureas wasHowards Endthe same year.Damagealso received an Academy Award nomination that year.[6]Later in 1993, Leigh'sNakedand Loach'sRaining Stoneswere entered into competition at the1993 Cannes Film Festival.[6]
The following year,Mike Newell'sFour Weddings and a Funeralbecame thehighest-grossing UK film of all timeandDanny Boyle'sTrainspotting(1996) was also very successful.[2]

A character like Roger is full of contradictions, a city banker with an air of entitlement but also a little insecurity picking away at him. Toby can portray that in his walk alone.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
