Stillwateris a 2021 Americancrime drama filmdirected byTom McCarthy, based on a script he co-wrote with Marcus Hinchey,Thomas Bidegainand Noé Debré. It is the firstDreamWorks Picturesfilm to be distributed byFocus Features. It starsMatt Damonas Bill Baker, an unemployedoil-rigworker from Oklahoma who sets out with a Frenchwoman (Camille Cottin) to prove his convicted daughter's (Abigail Breslin) innocence.
The film had its world premiere at theCannes Film Festivalon July 8, 2021, and was released theatrically in the United States on July 30, 2021, by Focus Features. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $19 million against its $20 million budget.
InStillwater, Oklahoma, Bill Baker is alaid-offroughneckscraping by with odd construction jobs. Working disaster cleanup after a tornado inShawnee, he struggles to find anotheroil rigposition.
Bill meets with Sharon, his late wife's mother, before traveling toFranceto visit his daughter Allison, who has served five years of a nine-year prison sentence. While attending university inMarseille, she was convicted of killing her roommate and lover, Lina.[4][5]
Allison gives her father a letter written in French to deliver to her defense lawyer Leparq, who explains that Allison heard from her former professor, Patrick Okonedo, about a man who claimed to be Lina's killer. Leparq says that no judge will be interested inhearsay, but Bill lies to Allison that her case will be reopened. At his hotel, Bill helps a young girl named Maya, and her mother Virginie translates Allison's letter, revealing her desperation at spending another four years in prison, and how little faith she has in her father to help.
Dirosa, aprivate investigatorand retired police officer who worked on Allison's case, warns that she can only be exonerated with DNA evidence. Bill visits Okonedo, who gives him the phone number of Souad, a student who claims to know Lina's killer. Enlisting Virginie's help, Bill meets Souad and a friend at aQuickrestaurant, where she identifies the killer as Akim, who lives in the Marseille slum ofKalliste-Granière-Solidarité[fr], but her friend grows wary of Bill's questions and they leave.
Combing through social media, Virginie finds photos which Bill brings to Allison, who recognizes Akim. Searching for him in Kalliste, he is beaten by a gang until another group arrives, including Akim. Driven out of the neighborhood, Bill admits to Allison that he lied about Leparq agreeing to help and that he lost Akim. Furious, Allison sends him away.
Four months later, Bill has remained in Marseille, renting a room in Virginie's apartment and helping her care for Maya while working for a construction crew. Allison is granted a day of parole, supervised by Bill, who introduces her to Virginie and Maya. Returning to prison, she tries to hang herself, but Bill continues to visit her as their relationship grows stronger. He and Virginie grow closer as well, developing into a romance.
Bill surprises Maya with tickets for anOlympique de Marseillefootball game at theStade Vélodrome, where he spots Akim. With Maya asleep, Bill abducts Akim, paying Dirosa to test Akim's hair against DNA from the crime scene. Maya later discovers he is keeping Akim prisoner in the basement of their apartment building, but Bill implores her to keep the secret.
Akim tells Bill that Allison hired him to kill Lina, paying him with a gold necklace bearing the word "Stillwater". Dirosa suspects Bill is holding Akim captive, and poses as a building inspector to question Virginie about the basement, arousing her own suspicions.
Bill is soon confronted by the police, but the basement is empty and Maya lies to protect him. Virginie does not admit to freeing Akim, but she kicks Bill out for putting her and Maya at risk, and he hugs a tearful Maya goodbye. Leparq informs Bill that Dirosa came forward with new evidence, allowing Allison's case to be reopened.
Allison is exonerated, and returns with her father to a hero's welcome in Oklahoma. Bill asks her about the Stillwater necklace he gave her when she first left for Marseille, and Allison breaks down, confessing that she paid Akim to evict the unfaithful Lina from their apartment, but never intended for him to kill her. As they sit on the porch, Allison says everything looks the same in Stillwater, while Bill declares that he can hardly recognize it anymore.

Allison is in Marseilles, which is the hometown ofEdmond DantèsinThe Count of Monte Cristo. Dantès was convicted of a crime he did not commit and sent to the Marseille prison island Château d'If, which is visible in the background of several scenes in which Allison and Bill are swimming.
The film had its world premiere at theCannes Film Festivalon July 8, 2021.[11]It was scheduled to be released in the U.S. on November 6, 2020,[9][12]but was delayed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic[13]until July 30, 2021.[14]
Stillwatergrossed $14.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $5.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $19.8 million.[2][3]
In the United States and Canada,Stillwaterwas released alongsideJungle CruiseandThe Green Knight, and was projected to gross around $5 million from 2,531 theaters in its opening weekend.[15]The film made $1.8 million on its first day, including $280,000 from Thursday-night previews. It went on to debut with $5.2 million, finishing fifth.[16]The film fell 45% to $2.6 million in its second weekend, remaining in fifth place.[17]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 75% of 199 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "Stillwaterisn't perfect, but its thoughtful approach to intelligent themes — and strong performances from its leads — give this timely drama a steadily building power."[18]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 60 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[19]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B−" on an A+ to F scale, while 63% ofPostTrakaudience members gave it a positive score, with 34% saying that they would definitely recommend it.[16]
Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film a score of 3.5/4 stars, describing it as "provocative and stirring" and praising Damon's performance as Bill Baker, but wrote: "Bill is also prone to rash actions, which leads to a relatively late development in "Stillwater" that is jarring and misguided and lands this movie just short of greatness."[20]David Sims ofThe Atlanticnoted similarities between the film and director Tom McCarthy's previous films,The VisitorandWin Win, but added: "McCarthy's excellent, if sprawling, script is more interested in the humans behind the headlines and the messy ways people try to reconcile their grief and guilt after indescribable trauma."[21]Simran Hans ofThe Observergave the film a score of 3/5 stars, describing it as "a thoughtful, knotty character study, albeit one nestled inside a polished, and less interesting, action thriller."[22]
Brian Lowry ofCNNwas more critical of the film, writing that it "confounds expectations in mostly frustrating ways", and that it "runs long but doesn't run particularly deep – or at least, not quite deep enough."[23]Clarisse Loughrey ofThe Independentgave the film a score of 2/5 stars, describing it as "an empty gesture of a film", and wrote: "It doesn't reckon with the injustice Knox faced [see Amanda Knox reaction below]. Nor does it sympathise with her time behind bars. She doesn't even get to be the main character. That would be Matt Damon's Bill Baker, Allison's father – a completely fictional figure, with none of this family's details matching up to Knox's."[24]
Amanda Knox, whose real life story is thought to have inspired the movie,[25][26]denounced the film and its creators onTwitterfor profiting from her wrongful conviction and for distorting the facts of her story. Knox said, "by fictionalizing away my innocence, my total lack of involvement, by erasing the role of the authorities in my wrongful conviction, McCarthy reinforces an image of me as a guilty and untrustworthy person."[27]

Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

The studio formerly distributed its own and third-party films. It has produced or distributed more than ten films with box-office grosses of more than $100 million each.
DreamWorks Pictures was sold toViacom, parent ofParamount Picturesin February 2006 (this version is now named DW Studios). In 2008, DreamWorks announced its intention to end its partnership with Paramount and made a deal to produce films with India'sReliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group,[2]re-creating DreamWorks Pictures as an independent entity. The following year, DreamWorks entered into a distribution agreement withWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, wherein Disney would distribute DreamWorks films through theTouchstone Pictureslabel; the deal continued until August 2016. Since October 2016,Universal Pictureshas distributed most of the films produced by DreamWorks Pictures. Currently, DreamWorks operates out of offices atUniversal Studios Hollywood.
DreamWorks is also distinct from itsformer animation division of the same name, which was spun off in 2004 and became a subsidiary ofNBCUniversalin 2016.[3]Spielberg's company continues to use the original DreamWorks trademarks under license from DreamWorks Animation.[4][5]
The original company was founded followingJeffrey Katzenberg's resignation fromThe Walt Disney Companyin 1994. Katzenberg approachedSteven SpielbergandDavid Geffenabout forming a live-action and animation film studio, which had not been done in decades due to the risk and expense, but all three were very successful. They agreed on three conditions: They would make fewer than nine movies a year, they would be free to work for other studios if they chose, and they would go home in time for dinner. They officially founded DreamWorks SKG on October 12, 1994, with financial backing of $33 million from each of the three partners[6]plus $500 million fromMicrosoftco-founderPaul Allen, and $300 million fromCJ GroupheiressMiky Lee, giving the CJ Group an 11% stake in DreamWorks; the deal was also initially understood to include distribution rights to DreamWorks films across Asia excluding Japan, although CJ ultimately handled rights for only China, South Korea and Hong Kong, with all other international territories handled byUnited International Pictures.[7][8][9]Their new studio was based at offices on theUniversal Studios lot, in the same bungalow asAmblin Entertainment. Despite access tosound stagesandsets, DreamWorks preferred to film motion pictureson location. Usually, however, the company would film in a soundstage or set in amajor studio.
In December 1994,DreamWorks Televisionwas formed after DreamWorks agreed to a $200 million seven-year television production joint venture withCapital Cities/ABC.[10]The company was set up to produce series for broadcast networks, cable channels and first run syndication, with nofirst-lookguarantee forABC, but financial incentives favored the network.[11]Their first show,Champions, was scheduled as a mid-season replacement for ABC. Dan McDermott was named the division's chief executive in June 1995.[12]DreamWorks Television's first success wasSpin Cityon ABC,[11]the parent company of which was bought byThe Walt Disney Companyin February 1996.[13]In 2002, the DreamWorks joint venture agreement with ABC ended. That agreement was replaced by a development agreement withNBC, with a first look clause.[11]In 2013, DreamWorks Television merged withAmblin Television.
In 1995,traditional animationartists fromAmblimationjoined the new studio, which led to DreamWorks buying part ofPacific Data Images, a company specializing in visual effects, and renaming it PDI/DreamWorks in 2000. Both were software divisions and would merge later on. By then, DreamWorks had the traditional animators working for their animation department, and the computer animators worked on CG films.Amblimationwould be shut down in 1997, leading the staff to joinDreamWorks Animation.[citation needed]The same year, DreamWorks Interactive, a computer and video game developer andjoint venturebetween DreamWorks andMicrosoft, was founded. On February 24, 2000,Electronic Artsannounced the acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive and merged it withEA PacificandWestwood Studiosto formEA Los Angeles, laterDanger Close Games.[citation needed]
In June 1995, DreamWorks announced that it had signed a $1 billion deal withMCA Inc.(then parent company ofUniversal Pictures) to distribute its theatrical releases in other countries and its home video releases worldwide over 10 years, while DreamWorks itself would distribute them for the company as a film production label in America.[14][15]MCA also bought a 2% stake in the company for $54 million.[16]
In 1996, the company's record label,DreamWorks Records, was founded, the first project of which wasGeorge Michael's albumOlder. The first band signed to the label waseels, who released their debut albumBeautiful Freakthat year. The record company never lived up to expectations, though, and was sold in October 2003 toUniversal Music Group, which operated the label asDreamWorks Nashville. That label was shut down in 2005 when its flagship artist,Toby Keith, departed to form his own label.[17]
In 1997, DreamWorks Pictures released its first three feature films,The Peacemaker, a film about terrorism;Amistad, Spielberg's first film for the studio about an African slave rebellion and the aftermath of the massacre; andMouse Hunt, the studio's first family film about two brothers trying to fight a mischievous mouse.[citation needed]

DreamWorks Pictures continued to distribute DreamWorks Animation productions through their distribution name until 2004.
In 2000, DreamWorks was planning on building a studiobacklotafter buying 1,087 acres of land in thePlaya Vistaarea in Los Angeles. It was to be complete with 18sound stages, with many office buildings and a lake. There would also be new homes, schools, churches, and museums. The project was to be completed in 2001, but was cancelled for financial reasons.[20]Starting in 1999, DreamWorks won three consecutiveAcademy AwardsforBest PictureforAmerican Beauty,GladiatorandA Beautiful Mind(the latter two were co-productions with Universal Pictures). DreamWorks became the first new majorHollywoodmotion picture studio sinceRKO Pictureswas founded in 1928.Go Fish Pictures, a division of DreamWorks with the objective to distributeart-house,independentandforeignfilms, was founded in 2000. The division experienced success with theanimefilmsMillennium Actress(2003) andGhost in the Shell 2: Innocence(2004), respectively, which led them to venture into releasing live-action films, with the release ofThe Chumscrubber. However,The Chumscrubberwas a commercial and critical failure, which led DreamWorks to shut down the division in 2007 shortly after the release of the Japanese filmCasshern.[citation needed]In 2002, DreamWorks signed a deal with In Demand.[21]
For the period beginning October 1, 2004, to January 31, 2006, DreamWorks Pictures distributed its films in the North American domestic theatrical and worldwide television market, with international theatrical and worldwide home entertainment distribution by Universal Pictures.[22]On October 27, 2004, DreamWorks Animation was spun off into a separate public company.
David Geffen admitted that DreamWorks came close to bankruptcy twice. Under Katzenberg's watch, the studio suffered a $125 million loss onSinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas,[23]and also overestimated the DVD demand forShrek 2.[24]In 2005, out of their two large budget pictures,War of the Worldswas produced as a joint effort withParamount Pictureswhich was the first to reap a significant amount of profits, whileThe Islandbombed at the domestic box office but turned a profit internationally throughWarner Bros. Pictures.[23]
In December 2005, theoriginal Viacom, the then-parent of Paramount Pictures, agreed to purchase the live-action studio, still keeping the original name and producing/distribution name. The deal was valued at approximately $1.6 billion, an amount that included about $400 million in debt assumptions.[25]The acquisition of the live-action DreamWorks studio was completed by thesecond iteration of Viacom, which had recentlysplitfrom the original at the end of 2005, on February 1, 2006.[26]
On March 17, 2006, Viacom agreed to sell a controlling interest in the DreamWorks Pictures live-action library toSoros Strategic PartnersandDune EntertainmentII.[27]The film library was valued at $900 million. Paramount Pictures retained the worldwide distribution rights to those films, as well as various ancillary rights, including music publishing (the music publishing rights were later licensed toSony/ATV Music Publishingwhen the company acquired Viacom'sFamous Musicsubdivision), sequels and merchandising. The sale was completed on May 8, 2006.[28]On February 8, 2010, Viacom repurchased Soros' controlling stake in the DreamWorks Pictures library for around $400 million.[29]
In June 2008, it was reported that DreamWorks was looking for financing that would allow it to continue operations, but as an independent production company, once its deal with Paramount ended later that year.[30]Several public equity funds were approached for financing, includingBlackstone Group, Fuse Global,TPG Capitaland several others, but all passed on the deal given their understanding of the Hollywood markets. On September 22, 2008, it was announced that DreamWorks closed a deal with Indian investment firmReliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Groupto create a $1.2 billion stand-alone production company and end its ties with Paramount.[2]In January 2009, Spielberg entered a licensing agreement with DreamWorks Animation to use the DreamWorks trademarks, logo, and name for film productions and releases.[31]
On February 9, 2009, DreamWorks Pictures entered into a long-term, 30-picture distribution deal withWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, by which DreamWorks' films would be released through theTouchstone Picturesbanner, with Disney collecting a 10 percent distribution fee.[32]The deal also included co-funding via a $175 million loan byWalt Disney Studiosto DreamWorks for production and access to slots in Disney's pay television agreement, then withStarz.[32]The agreement was reported to have come after negotiations broke off with Universal Pictures just days earlier.[33]DreamWorks raised $325 million from Reliance Entertainment and an additional $325 million in debt in 2009.[1]On August 18, 2009, DreamWorks and Reliance signed a three-year, $825 million pact for up to six films a year.[34]
DreamWorks' slate of films in 2011,I Am Number Four,Cowboys & Aliens, andFright Nightfailed, whileThe Help,Real Steeland Spielberg'sWar Horsehad success at the box office. This left DreamWorks so financially drained that by 2011, DreamWorks was seeking additional funding from Reliance. Reliance gave a $200 million investment on April 10, 2012. Under the deal, DreamWorks Pictures scaled back production to three films per year and sought co-financiers on big budget films, such as20th Century Fox, who co-financed and handled international distribution forLincolnandBridge of Spies. DreamWorks continued to have Disney distribute and market their films.[1]On August 29, 2012, after re-negotiating their agreement with Disney, DreamWorks formed a deal withMister Smith Entertainmentto distribute its films internationally, while Disney would continue to distribute in North America, Latin America, Australia, Russia, and some territories in Asia.[35]
On September 2, 2015, it was reported that DreamWorks and Disney would not renew their distribution deal, which was set to expire in August 2016,[36][37]withThe Light Between Oceansbeing released in September as the final DreamWorks film distributed by Disney under their original distribution agreement.[38]During that time, DreamWorks was in early negotiations with Universal Pictures to distribute its upcoming films.[36][37]The contract allowing Spielberg to license the DreamWorks name and logo from Jeffrey Katzenberg's DreamWorks Animation was set to expire on January 1, 2016, leading to media speculation that Spielberg would not renew the pact.[31]Disney retained the film rights to the fourteen DreamWorks films it released,[39]as well as acquiring the "DreamWorks II Distribution Co. LLC" copyright from DreamWorks and Reliance on December 11, 2015.[40][41]
On December 16, 2015, Spielberg, Reliance,Entertainment OneandParticipant Mediapartnered to launch the content production companyAmblin Partners,[42]relegating DreamWorks to a brand for adult-themed films produced under the new company.[42][43]In addition to DreamWorks, the new company also would produce films under the Amblin Entertainment and Participant banners. On the same day, Amblin Partners announced a five-year distribution deal with Universal, under which the company's films would be distributed and marketed by either the main Universal label or its specialty label,Focus Features.[44][45]The Girl on the Trainwas the first film released under the new agreement,[39]though a few films, likeGhost in the ShellandThe Postwere released by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox respectively.
The original DreamWorks logo features a boy sitting on acrescent moonwith a fishing rod at night. The general idea for the logo was the idea of the company's founder,Steven Spielberg, who wanted aCGIimage. IllustratorRobert Huntwas commissioned to execute the idea as a painting, and he used his son as the model.[46]The logo was then turned into amotion graphicatIndustrial Light & Magic, in collaboration with Kaleidoscope Films, Dave Carson and Clint Goldman.[47]It was animated by ILM animation supervisorWes Takahashi.[48][49]Music accompanying the logo to start in many live-action DreamWorks films was specially composed byJohn Williams.
The reimagined animation logo had music adapted from the track "Fairytale" forShrek, based on thechildren's picture book of the same nameby authorWilliam Steig. The logo was composed byHarry Gregson-Williamsand made its debut in 2004, with the release ofShrek 2, a film which Gregson-Williams also composed. Two years after its acquisition byUniversal Picturesin 2016, the logo received a new fanfare composed byJohn Powelland incorporate some cues fromShrek 2and tones from Williams' original DreamWorks fanfare to create the music for the logo. The new fanfare debuted in 2019, with the release ofHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, a film for which Powell also composed. In 2022, Harry Gregson-Williams returned to compose a new version of the fanfare, with the debut ofPuss in Boots: The Last Wish.

Participant Media, LLCwas an American independentfilmand television production company founded in 2004 byJeffrey Skoll, dedicated to entertainment intended to spur social change.[1]The company financed and co-produced film and television content, as well asdigital entertainmentthrough its subsidiary SoulPancake, which the company acquired in 2016.[2]
The company was originally named Participant Productions and went on to become a well-known independent financier. The company's name descriptively politicizes[3]its basis on currentlytopicalsubjects presented to induce awareness of problematic social aspects.[4][5][6]
The company produced, financed, or co-produced 135 films and five television series. Its films have been nominated for 73 Academy Awards, and have won 18, including Best Picture forGreen BookandSpotlight.[7][8][9][10]
Participant, which earnedB Corpcertification in 2017,[11]was the largest company that exclusively produces and financessocial impact entertainment.[12]
On April16, 2024, Skoll announced that the company would be ceasing operations after two decades, with nearly all of its staff being dismissed and development of new content shutting down entirely.[13]
The company was founded in January 2004 asParticipant ProductionsbyJeffrey Skoll, the "second employee" ofeBay,[14][8]with $100 million in cash from his  personal funds.[4]Its goal was to produce projects that would be both commercially viable and socially relevant.[15]
Skoll was the company's first chief executive officer, but stepped down in August 2006.[4]The firm's initial plans were to produce four to six films per year, each with a budget of $40 million.[5][15]It focused on films in six areas –  the environment, health care, human rights, institutional responsibility, peace and tolerance, and social and economic justice.[4]It evaluated projects by running them past its creative executives first, only then assessing their cost and commercial viability, and  analyzing their social relevance last.[4][16]Once the decision was made to go ahead with production, the company askednon-profit organizationsto build campaigns around the release.[4][5]In some cases, the studio has spent years creating positive word-of-mouth with advocacy groups, which are often encouraged to use the film to push their own agendas.[17]
The new company quickly announced an ambitious slate of productions. Its first film was thedrama filmAmerican Gun(2005), withequity partnerIFC Films.[5][6]Two weeks later, the company announced aco-productiondeal withWarner Bros.on two films – thegeopoliticalthriller filmSyriana(2005) and the drama filmClass Action(later re-titledNorth Country)(2005).[6][18]Participant Productions contributed half the budget of each film.[6]Its fourth production, a documentary film, was announced in November 2004. TitledThe World According to Sesame Street(2005), the film examined the impact of the children's television showSesame Streeton world culture, focusing onKosovo,Bangladesh,South AfricaandEl Salvador.[19][20]At the same time, the company began to implement anenvironmentally friendlystrategy:Syrianawas the company's firstcarbon-neutralproduction, and the company createdcarbon offsetsfor the documentary filmAn Inconvenient Truth(2006).[21]
In 2005, the company suffered its first stumble. It again agreed to co-finance a picture with Warner Bros.,Vadim Perelman's second feature,Truce.[22]Although Perelman claimed he had "never been moved by a script to such an extent",[22]the film never went into production.[23]North Countrydid poorly at the box office despite recent Academy Award-winnerCharlize Theronin the lead.[7]The World According to Sesame Streetnever found a distributor for theatrical release, and eventually only aired onPBStelevision,Sesame Street's broadcast home.[7]
The company announced in March 2005 that it would executive produce the Warner Bros. drama filmGood Night, and Good Luck.[24]At theCannes Film Festivalin May, the company bought the right to distribute the forthcoming drama filmFast Food Nation(2006)  directed byRichard Linklaterin North America in return for an equity stake.[25][26]A month later, it bought distribution rights to the documentaryMurderballin return for an equity stake.[27]It also executive produced and co-financedAl Gore'sglobal-warmingdocumentary,An Inconvenient Truth.[20][28][29][30]
As heavier production scheduling grew, the company added staff. Ricky Strauss was named the first president in March 2005, with oversight ofproduction,marketingand business development.[31]Attorney and former non-profit chief executive Meredith Blake was hired in June as its Senior Vice President of Corporate and Community Affairs,[32]to oversee development of awareness and outreach campaigns around the social issues raised in the company's films in cooperation with non-profit organizations, corporations, andearned media.[32]Diane Weyermann, director of theSundance Institute's Documentary Film Program, joined the company in October 2005 as Executive Vice President of Documentary Production.[33]
The company's non-film-production efforts continued to grow. The company provided an undisclosed amount of financing in February 2005 to film distributorEmerging Picturesto finance that company's national network ofdigitally equipped cinemas(with Emerging Pictures distributing Participant's films).[34]The company also began its first socially relevant outreach project, helping to finance screenings of thebiographical filmGandhi(1982) in thePalestinian territoriesfor the first time as well as in the countries ofIsrael,Jordan,LebanonandSyria.[35]In support of its upcoming film,An Inconvenient Truth,the studio negotiated a deal for distributorParamount Classicsto donate five percent of its U.S. domestic theatrical gross box-office receipts (with a guarantee of $500,000) to theAlliance for Climate Protection.[36]
The company had a very successful 2005 awards season, with eleven Academy Award nominations and one win.[7]Good Night, and Good Luckgarnered six nominations, includingBest Art Direction,Best Cinematography,Best Director(George Clooney),Best Picture,Best Actor in a Leading Role(David Strathairn) andBest Original Screenplay.[37]Murderballwas nominated forBest Documentary Feature.[37]North Countrywas nominated forBest Actress in a Leading Role(Charlize Theron) andBest Actress in a Supporting Role(Frances McDormand).[37]Syrianawas nominated forBest Actor in a Supporting Role(George Clooney) andBest Original Screenplay.[37]But of the eleven nominations, onlyGeorge Clooneywon forBest Actor in a Supporting RoleinSyriana.[38]
In June, the company announced it would partner withNew Line Cinema(a subsidiary of Warner Bros.) to produceThe Crusaders, a drama aboutBrown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), a landmark ruling of theSupreme Court of the United Stateswhich endedracial segregationinpublic schools.[39]But the film never got beyond the development stage. In September, the company entered into an agreement to co-produce the drama filmThe Visitor(2008) withGroundswell Productions,[40]and two months later agreed to co-produce (withSony Pictures Classics) a documentary film aboutthe Abu Ghraib torture scandal,Standard Operating Procedure(2008), directed byErrol Morris.[41]
The company also took an equity position in and a co-production credit forChicago 10(2007), ananimated documentaryfilm about the 1969Chicago Sevenconspiracy trial.[42][43]
Finally, in December, the company agreed to finance and produce the documentary filmMan from Plains(2007), directed byJonathan Demme, that followed formerU.S. PresidentJimmy Carteras he promoted hispolitical-sciencebook,Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid(2006).[44]
The company also co-financed, withWarner Independent Pictures, the documentary filmDarfur Now(2007),[45]and, withUniversal Studiosand others, co-financed thebiographical filmCharlie Wilson's War(2007).[46]The film had the biggest budget of any of the company's films sinceSyriana.[7]
Three major corporate events also occurred in 2006.
The company's success continued through the 2006 awards season.An Inconvenient Truthwas nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Documentary Feature, and the song "I Need to Wake Up" (byMelissa Etheridge) nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Original Song.[51]The film and song won their respective categories in February 2007.[52][53]
Corporate growth continued in 2007. On January 8, the company hired motion-picture marketing veterans Buffy Shutt and Kathy Jones, both Executive Vice President of Marketing, to coordinate marketing of the company's films.[54]Eight days later, the company hiredTony Award- andEmmy Award-winning event producer John Schreiber as Executive Vice President of Social Action and Advocacy to enhance the company's earned media, non-profit and corporate outreach and advocacy campaigns.[55]
February saw the hire of Adrian Sexton as Executive Vice President to oversee digital and global media projects,[56]and April saw veteran production head Jonathan King join the company as Executive Vice President of Production.[57]Lynn Hirshfield was hired in May as Vice President of Business Development to launch the company's publishing division,[58]and saw Bonnie Abaunza and Liana Schwarz both Vice President of Social Action Campaign Development and Operations to assist with social outreach and advocacy campaigns in mid-June.[59]
In November, the company signed a deal with actressNatalie Portman's newly formed production company, Handsomecharlie Films, under which the two studios would co-produce socially relevant films for a two-year period. No films were produced under this agreement, however.[60]The same month, the company hired veteranShowtimeproducer John Moser to oversee development and production of original programs for television and home cable.[61]But despite the management activity and expansion, not all of the company's films did well.Chicago 10did not sell for several months after it premiered at Sundance, and only significant editing and a reduction in running time led to a distribution deal.[7]
The company also announced additional productions. In January, it said it was co-financing the drama filmThe Kite Runner(2007) withSidney Kimmel EntertainmentandDreamWorks Pictures, the latter company then owned byViacomviaParamount Pictures.[54]The Kite Runnerwas the first collaboration between both Participant and DreamWorks; the two companies would not collaborate again untilThe Helpin 2011. That spring, the company took an equity position inAngels in the Dust(2007), a documentary film about children orphaned byAIDS, and paid the filmmaker to update the film and shoot more footage.[7]
In April, it closed a deal with Warner Independent to turnRandy Shilts' biographical book,The Mayor of Castro Street(1982) into a film,[62]but the project entered development hell, as well as the feature-length documentary about the2007 Live Earthconcert later.[63]Five months later the company agreed   (withBroken Lizard) to co-produce and co-finance the company's first comedy film,Taildraggers, revolving around five pilots trying to stop oil extraction from an Alaskan preserve.[64]As of June 2009, however, the film had not been produced.[65]
Participant then signed a co-production deal with State Street Pictures to finance the biographical drama,Bobby Martinezaboutthe eponymous Latino surferin November.[66]The film entered development hell for nearly two years but hired Ric Roman Waugh to rewrite and direct in April 2009,[67]with supposed production by the beginning of 2012. By the end of 2007, the company was seen as a key player in documentary production.[68]
In March 2008, Participant Productions changed its name to Participant Media to reflect the firm's expansion into television and non-traditional entertainment media.[69]
The company continued to expand its social advocacy and outreach efforts in 2008. On January 16, 2008, it joined and made a financial contribution to a $100 millionUnited Nations-sponsored fund which would provide backing for films which combatted religious, ethnic, racial, and other stereotypes.[70]Fueling the company's expansion was the creation of a $250 million fund with Image Nation, a start-up film studio based in theUnited Arab Emirateswhich is a division of theAbu Dhabi Media Company.[71]Each company contributed roughly half of the fund's total (although some funding came from loans).[71]Participant and Image Nation agreed to produce 18 films over the next five years, which would add approximately four feature-length films per year to Participant's existing slate.[71][72]To boost its marketing efforts, the company also hired Jeffrey Sakson as Vice President of Publicity in April 2008.[73]In September 2008, Participant Media andPublicAffairs Bookssigned a deal under which PublicAffairs would publish four original paperback books designed to expand upon the social messages in Participant's films.[74]The first book to be published under the pact wasFood Inc.: A Participant Guide: How Industrial Food Is Making Us Sicker, Fatter, and Poorer—And What You Can Do About It.[74]The company also founded a new Web site,TakePart.com, to promote Participant Media's films as well as make viewers aware of the social advocacy efforts of Participant's outreach partners.[75]In 2009, the company signed a first look deal with Summit Entertainment.[76]
In March, Participant announced a co-financing deal with Tapestry Films to produceMinimum Wage, a comedy about a corrupt corporate executive sentenced to live for a year on aminimum wagesalary.[69]It was not produced. A month later, the company announced it and Groundswell Productions were co-financingThe Informant!, a comedy directed bySteven Soderberghand starringMatt Damonabout thelysine price-fixing conspiracyatArcher Daniels Midlandin the mid-1990s.[77][78]July saw Participant set up a co-financing deal with three other studios to produceThe Colony, an eco-horror film.[79]It, too, was never produced.
The 2007 awards season saw several more Academy Award nominations for the company's films. Its films had a combined sevenGolden Globe Awardnominations, although it won none.[80]Philip Seymour Hoffmanwas nominated for hissupporting actor roleinCharlie Wilson's War,Richard Jenkinswas nominated for Best Actor inThe Visitor, andAlberto Iglesiaswas nominated forbest original scoreforThe Kite Runner.[81]But the studio won no Oscars that year.[clarification needed]The success during awards season did not extend into 2008. The company had only three films released during the year (Every Little Step,Pressure Cooker, andStandard Operating Procedure), and none of them was nominated for an award from a major arts organization. However, on November 19, 2008, the Producers Guild of America gave Participant founder Jeff Skoll its Visionary Award.[82]
In 2009, it saw the company continue to aggressively produce both feature films and documentaries. In January, it announced that it would producePaul Dinello'sMr. Burnout(about aburned outteacher seeking to rekindle his love of teaching)[83]andFurry Vengeance(a comedy starringBrendan Fraserabout anOregonreal estate developer who is opposed by animals).[78][84]But onlyFurry Vengeancewas produced. That same month Participant signed a five-year production and distribution deal with Summit Entertainment. The agreement, which covered titles financed by Participant's $250 million production agreement with Imagination Media, was nonexclusive (meaning Participant could seek distribution of films by other companies) and was limited to four projects a year.[50]The agreement allowed Summit to charge a distribution fee, and to co-finance titles if it wished.[50]The pact covered home video and pay-television distribution as well.[50]Furry Vengeancewas the first picture produced under the agreement.[84]In April, the company hired screenwriter Miles Chapman to pen an untitled environmentally themed action-adventure script about the hunt for a mystical gem in the heart of Africa.[85]The script went into development hell. The same month, the company agreed to co-finance (with Krasnoff/Foster Entertainment) a biographical drama titledHistory on Trial—which was intended to document the true story ofDeborah Lipstadt, a professor ofJewish studieswho was sued byHolocaust deniersDavid Irvingforlibel.[86][87]The film was not produced, but the company did go on to makeDenial, starring Rachel Weisz, about the same subject in 2016. The company also announced a number of productions in May 2009, including:The Crazies, a remake of the1973 film of the same name;[88]Casino Jack and the United States of Money,a film about theJack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal;[89]Help Me Spread Goodness, a comedy starring and directed byBen Stillerabout a banking executive who is caught by aNigerian Internet scam(the film was not produced);[90][91]andThe Soloist, a drama starringJamie FoxxandRobert Downey, Jr.based on the true story ofNathaniel Ayers, a brilliant musician who developsschizophreniaand becomeshomeless.[78]
The company also expanded in non-film production as well. In March, Participant agreed to conduct outreach and social advocacy efforts on behalf of theLionsgate/Roadside AttractionsdocumentaryThe Coveabout dolphin slaughters by Japanese villagers in a cove near fishing grounds.[92]The firm's TakePart website also released a newiPhoneapplication, Givabit, which solicits charitable donations for Participant Media's nonprofit advocacy partners from iPhone users once a day.[75]In June, the company established a new book publishing subsidiary, headed by Vice President of Publishing Lynn Hirshfield (who changed titles within the company).[74][93]Liana Schwarz was promoted to Senior Vice President of Campaign Development and Operations.[94]
On January 28, 2010, Participant Media co-presented director Mark Lewis' documentary,Cane Toads: The Conquestat the Sundance Film Festival.[95]The film, according toDaily Varietysaid, was the "first specialty doc filmed in digital 3D."[95]A month later, Bonnie Stylides left Summit Entertainment to become Participant's Senior Vice-President of Business Affairs.[96]The studio's hit documentary,Waiting for "Superman", garnered media acclaim, and Participant inked a worldwide distribution deal withParamountshortly before its premiere at Sundance.[97]It also sold North American distribution rights for its documentary,Countdown to Zero, toMagnolia Pictures,[98]and distribution rights to its documentaryClimate of Changeto Tribeca Film (a division ofRobert De Niro's Tribeca Enterprises).[99]
The company also received a $248,000 grant from theRobert Wood Johnson Foundationto raise awareness about access to quality food and childhood obesity.[100]The studio used these funds to create a campaign linked to its promotional efforts for the documentary filmFood, Inc.and signed a deal with Active Media to help run the campaign.[100]It    signed a deal with Planet Illogica (a website collaboratively produced by artists, filmmakers, musicians, and fashion designers) to generate a social action campaign associated with its documentaryOceans(which was released byWalt Disney Pictures).[101]The "Save My Oceans Tour" involved concerts, art installations, and screenings ofOceanson college campuses.[102]
On April 13, Noah Manduke (former president of the consulting firm Durable Good and president of the marketing firmSiegel + Gale) was named chief strategy officer of the Jeff Skoll Group.[103]Skoll created the Skoll Group to oversee his various enterprises, including Participant Media, and Manduke began working with Skoll and Participant Media's top management to begin a strategic planning process and strengthen collaboration between Participant and Skoll's other organizations and companies.[103]The following month, studio executive James Berk was one of only 180 individuals invited to join theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[104]
Based on the success of itsTwilight Sagafilm series, Summit Entertainment announced on March 8, 2011, that it was making a $750 million debt refinancing with cash distribution to its investors, which included Participant Media.[105]
On June 5,The New York Timesran a major story about the studio, declaring: "Participant Media, the film industry's most visible attempt at social entrepreneurship, turned seven this year without quite sorting out whether a company that trades in movies with a message can earn its way in a business that has been tough even for those who peddle 3-D pandas and such."[106]AuthorMichael Cieplynoted thatThe Beaver, Participant's latest released, cost $20 million but had garnered just $1 million in gross box-office sales after a month in theaters –  making the film a "flop".[106]The company's biggest success to date, the newspaper noted, was 2007'sCharlie Wilson's War($66.7 million in gross domestic box office revenue).[106]Skoll was quoted as saying that he had poured "hundreds of millions to date [into the company], with much more to follow", and that the studio had yet to break even.[106]Skoll and Berk, however, noted that Participant Media performs slightly above-average when compared to similarly-sized peers.[106]The advantage came in three areas: home video sales, the company's long-term attempts to build social movements around its films, and its stake in Summit Entertainment (which allowed it to win more favorable distribution terms).[106]
TheTimessaid that audiences may be turned off by Participant's relentless focus on upsetting issues, quoting unnamed sources.[106]The company hoped that it would change this attitude about its films (and make money) with 2011'sThe Help(about racial reconciliation in the American South during the 1960s) andContagion(aSteven Soderberghpicture about the outbreak of a virulent, deadly disease).[106]Skoll also said that Participant had purchased the rights to aNew York Timesarticle about theDeepwater Horizonoil spillof 2010, and that the film would likely focus not simply on oil drilling, but on a number of critical issues, such as climate change and the ecological health of oceans.[106]
By year's end, however, there was less concern about the company's financial future. The studio's $25 million film about racial reconciliation (about a third of the production budget came from Participant),[107]The Help, cleared $100 million in late August,[108]and was just short of $200 million worldwide by late December.[109]The Helpwas the first film since 2010'sInceptionto be number one at the North American box office for three straight weekends in a row,[110]and was only unseated by another Participant Media film,Contagion.[111]The Helpwas nominated for fourAcademy Awards: The film for Best Picture,Viola Davisfor Best Actress, andJessica ChastainandOctavia Spencerfor Best Supporting Actress. Spencer won the Oscar for her role.[112]
Participant executives said on October 14, 2011 that the studio would expand its production to make seven to twelve films per year, would begin producing features and series for television, and would expand its online presence.[113]As part of this plan, in November the studio hired advertising executive Chad Boettcher to be executive vice president for social action and advocacy and20th Century Foxexecutive Gary Frenkel to be senior vice president for digital products and communities.[114]
In January 2012, Participant Media made its first investment in a non-English-language film, the forthcomingPablo Larraínmotion pictureNo(starringGael Garcia Bernal).[115]The semi-biographical film tells the story of a man who initiates an upbeat, innocuous advertising campaign that helps to unseatChileandictator GeneralAugusto Pinochetduring the 1988plebiscitethat led to theChilean transition to democracy. The same month, however, it lost its president, Ricky Strauss, who departed the studio to become head of worldwide marketing at Walt Disney Pictures.[116]
Three weeks later, on February 2, 2012, Participant Media announced that it was partnering with Summit Entertainment,Image Nation, Spanish production company Apaches Entertainment, and Colombian production company Dynamo to produce a supernatural horror film about an American oil company executive who moves his family into a house in a small city inColombia, only to find the home is haunted. The company announced that Spanish director Luis Quilez would direct from a script by Alex and David Pastor (who developed their script with funding from Participant).[117]
On April 16, Participant formed Participant Television, its television division, naming Evan Shapiro as president.[118]Participant also took an equity stake inCineflix MediaCanada-based TV producer and distributor.[119]In December, Participant continued its move into television with the purchase of theDocumentary Channel (USA)andHalogen TV's distribution assets to be combined into a new cable channel within its TV division.[120]

Pete Saunders, a survivor who was appointed to the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors and who arranged the February 4th screening, was asked to take a leave of absence shortly thereafter. Shortly after winning multiple Oscars, including Best Picture, the Vatican's newspaper praisedSpotlightfor exposing these abuses.[129][130][131]The film, however, did face controversy including some criticism from an author ofThe New York Timescalling it, "a misrepresentation of how the Church dealt with sexual abuse cases", arguing that the movie's biggest flaw was its failure to portray psychologists who had assured Church officials that abusive priests could be safely returned to ministry after undergoing therapy treatments.[132]Another criticism was that the film falsely portrayed Jack Dunn, the public relations head and a member of the board atBoston College High School, as a member of the Boston Archdiocesan cover-up (for which the dialogue itself was mythologised).[133][134]
On February 28, 2016, the company won its first Best Picture Academy Award forSpotlight. The acclaimed drama also picked up the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer).

The success ofRomaled to a cultural moment in 2019 called the "Roma Effect," which helped increase visibility and raise awareness for domestic workers in the U.S. and Mexico, where the Mexican Congress voted to pass legislation granting domestic workers access to basic labor rights, such as limited work hours and paid vacation.[150]That year, then-SenatorKamala Harrisand RepresentativePramila Jayapalintroduced the National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights into the US Congress.[151]
In collaboration with theUCLA School of Theater, Film and Television'sSkoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment, Participant published the "State of SIE" report, similar to what it had done a few years earlier with USC when it published the "Participant Index" report. These reports are rare exceptions to Participant Media usually keeping its impact strategies proprietary.
On September 8, 2019, Participant debuted its rebrand and logo at the Toronto Film Festival which coincided with the company's 15th anniversary.[1]The company's rebrand was followed by the announcement thatDavid Lindeextended his contract as CEO of the consumer-engaged brand with a multi-year deal.[152]

Via theDark Waterscampaign, Mark Ruffalo became an outspoken advocate against forever chemicals. He testified in front of Congress[153]about the harms of PFAS and met with North Carolina government officials[154]to ask for stronger action.

On April 16, 2024, founder Jeff Skoll informed Participant's staff of his decision to shut the company down. The decision was attributed to changes over time in content creation and distribution, especially difficulties in developing successful streaming business models and suspension of production on multiple projects due to the2023 Hollywood labor disputes. Sources state almost all of the company's staff would be laid off, with a holding company owning Participant's interests in its library of 140 titles.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
