The film starsRachel Sennottas Danielle, a directionless youngbisexualJewishwoman who attends ashivawith her parents, Joel (Fred Melamed) and Debbie (Polly Draper). Other attendees include her successful ex-girlfriend Maya (Molly Gordon), and hersugar daddyMax (Danny Deferrari) with his wife Kim (Dianna Agron) and their screaming baby. It also featuresJackie Hoffman,Deborah Offner,Rita GardnerandSondra Jamesin supporting roles.
Adapted from Seligman's own 2018 short film of the same name,Shiva Babypremiered online at the 2020South by Southwestfilm festival, while its first public screenings were at the2020 Toronto International Film Festival, due to theCOVID-19 pandemic. It was released in theaters and streaming on April 2, 2021. The events of the film take place almost entirely inreal timeandat one locationas Danielle explores her romantic and career prospects under the intense watch of her family, friends, and judgmental neighbors.
Shiva Babyreceived positive reviews from critics, who praised Seligman's screenplay and direction, cast performances, musical score, representation ofbisexualityand Jewish culture, and for effectively conveying anxiety-inducingclaustrophobia. The film would go on to win several awards.
College senior Danielle and hersugar daddyMax have sex before she hurries to ashivaobservance with her parents, Joel and Debbie. Before theshiva, at her aunt Sheila's house, Danielle is schooled by her mother on how to respond to questions about her disorganized life. Within the house, members of the local extended Jewish community compare her to her ex-girlfriend Maya, who is adored by the neighbors and heading tolaw school. Max, who is a former colleague of Joel's, arrives, and Debbie insists on introducing him to Danielle in the hopes that one of Max's relatives will hire her. They have an awkward exchange and Debbie reveals to Danielle that Max is married, shocking her.
Overwhelmed by prying neighbors, Danielle is further affected by the arrival of Max's seemingly perfect but non-Jewish wife, Kim, and their baby, Rose. After accidentally ripping her tights and hurting her leg, Danielle retreats to the bathroom where she takes a topless photo and sends it to Max. She is interrupted and accidentally leaves her phone in the bathroom. Unable to look away from Max and his family, she offers to clean vomit from an adjacent room in order to escape. Maya comes to help, catching Danielle repeatedly looking at Max. She mistakes the gaze as one directed at Kim and attempts to gauge Danielle's interest, while Danielle tries to dismiss Kim's attractiveness and success.
Danielle is reluctantly introduced to Kim, who is interested in making conversation with and hiring her, though Danielle is jealous and rebuffs her offer. It is also revealed that Kim is thebreadwinnerof the family and therefore unknowingly funds Max's arrangement with Danielle. Kim grows suspicious when she notices Danielle wearing the same expensive bracelet that Max had given to her. Max spills coffee on Danielle, leading her to have a brief heart-to-heart with her mother. Maya also tries to talk to her, but Max interrupts the two; annoyed, Maya loudly reveals details of her and Danielle's past relationship, while Max tries to determine if Danielle is still romantically interested in him. She then follows him to the upstairs bathroom and tries tofellatehim, but he leaves. Upset, Danielle goes outside, finding Maya smoking by the side of the house. The two admit that they miss each other and passionately kiss. Maya is excited, but later finds Danielle's phone in the bathroom and reads notifications from the sugar babyapp; angry, she taunts Danielle about the phone without revealing where it is. Danielle's anxiety grows when she encounters Kim with her parents again, having a measured conversation in which she behaves erratically and hints that Max uses the couple's vacantSoHoapartment as abachelor pad. When Kim asks if Danielle is dating, Joel starts talking about her failed love life and implores the nearby guests to sing a song they used to sing to her as a baby; Danielle feels infantilized and stressfully imagines Kim singing along, and flaunting her relationship with Max.
The guests then gather to sayKaddish, with Rose screaming until Kim takes her away. Max follows Danielle into the kitchen afterwards, and they discuss ending their arrangement. Kim appears and tells Max they should go home, and Danielle leaves to ask her parents if they can go home, too. Moments later, Kim finds Danielle to return her phone, and tries to force her to hold Rose, saying she needs help feeding her. Danielle tries to refuse as Max arrives and argues with Kim about the baby, which pushes Danielle into accidentally knocking a vaseand some sacred books to the floor. Danielle attempts to clean up the mess but has a breakdown on the floor in front of the guests and is comforted by her mother and Maya. Debbie suggests they use helping an elderly attendee to her car as an excuse to leave, and Maya and Danielle reconnect as they carry food outside. Everyone is persuaded to ride home in Joel's overpacked van, with Kim and Max's baby shrieking as Joel struggles to find his keys. Maya and Danielle affectionately hold hands in the back and smile at each other.
Shiva Babyis an expansion of writer-directorEmma Seligman's 2018 short film of the same title, which she had made as her thesis project while studying film atNew York University Tisch School of the Arts(NYU).[6][7]The title refers both to Danielle and to the baby brought to theshiva, Rose.[8]Seligman said that she felt there was room to expand on the short from early on,[9]but needed motivation from lead actressRachel Sennottto start working on a feature;[10]the feature film entered production just before the short premiered at the2018 South by Southwest(SXSW) film festival.[11]Despite the short being accepted to SXSW, giving Seligman confidence, nobody there was interested in making a low-budget feature. Seligman then approached Katie Schiller, who she said was "the best producer in [their graduating class]", at Sennott's encouragement.[12]While developing the feature, Seligman re-watchedGia Coppola's filmPalo Alto, saying that she had "never seen a film so accurately portray the suffocating and debilitating nature of young female insecurities" like it.[13]Seligman was also inspired byTrey Edward Shults'sKrishaand how its location was used for storytelling, which led to Seligman viewingShiva Babythrough a similar psychological thriller lens.[12][14]Other inspiration came from theCoen brothers,Joey Soloway'sTransparent,John Cassavetes, andMike Nichols.[9][10]The costume design of the film was based on outfits worn atshivasSeligman's family had attended.[15]
Seligman said that financingShiva Babywas "probably the hardest thing" she and the producers would do;[16]she sought funding for the feature for a year[13]and received some offers from organizations that requested more creative control over the film in return, which she was unwilling to give.[17]The production also faced setback when Seligman had to return to Canada after finishing the short when her visa expired.[18]FilmmakerAmanda Kramer, a friend of Seligman, put her in contact with Rhianon Jones ofNeon Heart Productions, who became anexecutive producer; more investors became interested with Jones attached.[13]Most of the financing came from outside funding and independent funding from people the production team knew. Seligman toldWomen and Hollywoodthat using primarily one location was also a financial decision.[13]Shiva Baby's budget was around $200,000.[12]Producer Kieran Altmann managed to secure some funding from his parents, Fiona and Martin Altmann, who are credited as executive producers. He said that the competitive filmmaking market in New York helped them work with a small budget, as they could negotiate large discounts on gear rental. The crew were also friends of the producers, and most took a cut in their usual rate,[11]while editor Hanna Park was Seligman's roommate.[12]
I feel like it's pretty universal – a lot of young women, young people, not having self-worth beyond sexual validation. I think it's something that hindered my self-acceptance in college, since it's something I focused a lot of energy on.
The short film had been based on a fictional scenario combining Seligman's "uncomfortable and funny" experience ofshivas, and the community of women she knew who weresugar babiesat NYU. When it came to expanding the story to a feature, she chose to also draw on her ownbisexuality;[20]the desire to showcase more of the character of Danielle and her sexuality is a reason Seligman chose to make the feature.[21]Seligman said that "if no one watches this movie except for some young bisexual women who feel seen, then I feel like I've done my job".[22]The character of Danielle is described as relatable; she is the film's "way in" and the other characters are all seen through her eyes.[23]Seligman was also interested in exploring Max and Kim's relationship,[9]and Debbie and Danielle's mother–daughter relationship further, and in expanding on the central theme of Danielle finding her self-worth through sexual autonomy but "realizing that's not as powerful as she thinks it is".[19]Varietynoted that themes of empowered young women were present in several screenplays in the same season; features editor Malina Saval wrote thatShiva Babyshows through Danielle how a "pressure to be perfect manifests itself in women long before marriage and kids come into focus" and explores how the power of sex is only limited.[24]
Karina Solórzano for theLos Cabos International Film Festivalwrote thatShiva Babyhas "the same elements as some ofWoody Allen's most popular films – including the Jewish family and multiple lovers – but Seligman has her own vision and offers something different", and that it "follows the contrarian path promoted by [...]Disobedience, [but] this is not the central point of the plot; Seligman does not treat the [queer] protagonists as exceptional or disobedient".[25]Solórzano also compared the themes of youth to those ofBooksmart, and the tension to that ofUncut Gems, and discussed the relevance of other themes inShiva Baby, including Danielle's insecurities; the cultural and religious conflicts surrounding Danielle's sexuality; complex female relationships; and the honesty that comes with family gatherings.[25]
Writer-director Seligman became aware of lead actress Sennott at NYU when Sennott was acting in other students' thesis films and making comedy sketches. Thinking that she looked "like someone [Seligman] would run into at a family event", Seligman cast Sennott in their own thesis film, theShiva Babyshort.[26]Sennott was kept on as Danielle when Seligman began expandingShiva Babyinto a feature-length film; they had formed a collaborative bond and Seligman "never even thought about casting someone else",[11]though, unlike her character, Sennott is neither queer nor Jewish.[27][28]When media began criticizingJewface, Sennott as Danielle was frequently mentioned.[29]She worked with Seligman to develop the character over the two years of production from the beginning of the short film to the feature, and read all of Seligman's screenplay drafts.[16]Some of the film's potential financiers asked the producers to consider replacing Sennott with a bigger name star.[11][30]Besides Sennott, the first actor to be cast wasMolly Gordon,[31]who was cast as Danielle's love interest, Maya, without a chemistry read with Sennott; they only met the day before filming began.[32]Seligman says she experiencedimpostor syndromeworking with the cast, especially after holding a rehearsal for a scene between Danielle and Maya but not being able to make it work.[31]After Gordon,Dianna Agronwas cast as Kim.[31]Agron was in Israel when she was sent the script,[33]and met with Seligman in New York shortly after returning. Seligman said that, as a Jewish actress, Agron was excited to "finally" be in a Jewish film,[31]despite playing the only character who is not Jewish.[27][28]Through conversation with Agron, lines were added alluding to her character having Jewish heritage.[26]Producer Lizzie Shapiro toldYnetthat Agron "brought to the role a different dynamic of what it means to be a Jew who looks like [she does]".[33]Commenters have said that Agron's casting is an example ofintertextuality[34]and "a bit of an inside joke".[35]Danny Deferrari was the last actor to be cast, accepting the role of Max a few days before shooting began.[31]
Casting had been challenging; the film focuses on both queer and Jewish culture, so Seligman and the producers wanted to find actors who would "feel authentic to the material".[27]Seligman felt it was important to cast Jewish actors but was open to other people if they seemed perfect for the role.[27]They also discussed authentic queer representation withThe Hindu, calling it a "trickier issue"; having spoken with actors who are notout, Seligman said that "for everyone on screen playing a queer character to be out and proud and talking about their sexuality [...] is a lot to ask of someone."[36]Casting director Kate Geller went to the Jewish theatre community in New York for most of the cast.[23]Due to the low budget, they looked to only cast actors based in New York City,[30]with the exception ofFred Melamed, whom the production flew out from Los Angeles. Melamed had accepted the role of Joel based on reading the script alone.[37]Unbeknownst to Seligman, several cast members already knew each other, such as Melamed andPolly Draper(who plays his wife Debbie), who were friends from theYale School of Drama; they used this as an advantage on set,[30]though Draper had originally been sought to play a different role in the film.[37]The production had been looking for a Jewish actress to play Debbie, but Seligman said that Draper "put a spell on [them] and [they] had to say yes."[31][38]Seligman's own mother also wanted Draper to play the mother character in the film.[26]Draper improvised on-set for her character a lot, as well as adding a mother's perspective,[37]though the production did not have time for full improvisation.[19]
Shiva Babywas filmed over 16 days in August 2019[11][39]at anAirbnbinFlatbush, Brooklyn.[40]Seligman chose the house onArgyle Road[commons]because of its dark wood interior and stained-glass windows providing aYentl-like glow.[31]The shoot was initially planned for summer 2018, which was postponed to 2019; Seligman then wanted to push it again, to 2020, to have more time to raise money, but Sennott "set a timebomb".[12]The film mostlytakes place in one locationduring one day.[10]After scouting the house, Seligman built a model of thefirst floorout ofLegoand used this to plan shots.[16]They said that some of the main struggles related tocontinuity, particularly working with actors who were not always available at the same time.[32][13]The production had only "two days when [they] had the entire [principal] six-person cast together at the same time".[19]Another struggle was the baby playing Rose, who would not stop crying; Seligman said this was a "learning experience" that caused them to rework some scenes to fit in a crying baby.[32]The opening scene, set before theshivaat Max's apartment, was filmed on the last day. Seligman, with a largely female cast and crew, felt prepared for this and other scenes involving intimacy, but discovered during filming that the scenes were more vulnerable and required more sensitivity.[39]
Director of photographyMaria Rusche used anArri Alexa XTcamera to shoot infullscreen2K resolutionandApple ProRes 4444 format, withKowaanamorphiclensesas well as a 10:1CookeCinetalzoom lens. About half of the film was shothandheld.[41]Seligman and Rusche initially considered shootingShiva Babylike aromantic comedy, but "the anxiety hook was what [they] found to set the tone for most of the process".[9]Rusche discussed her equipment choices withIndieWire's Chris O'Falt, explaining that to capture theclaustrophobiaand anxiety in the film in the way they wanted, they needed to have Danielle surrounded by people but still allow the principal cast to play off each other. To achieve this, Rusche decided to use an anamorphic lens so that multiple characters can remain in shot together, through the widerfield of view, while still being distinguished from background characters thanks to the lens's depth. They also wanted to utilize naturalimage distortionto emphasize Danielle's anxiety; Rusche said the effect of the Kowa lenses "helped make it feel like the walls could literally cave in on her" and had "a good balance of edge distortion without falling apart or losing too much sharpness at the edges".[41]
Seligman was uncertain if they wanted to use ascorefor the film when going into production,[42]as they were aiming forrealism, but chose to do so to divert focus from background chatter and represent Danielle's emotions.[28]Seligman wanted it to have strings to reflectKlezmermusic, without being overpowering, a "sweet spot" that they said composer Ariel Marx achieved. Marx also suggested adding the score to some scenes it had not originally been intended, making them more stressful.[42]As well as composing, Marx performed strings, while Sam Mazur contributed percussion.[43]
The score received positive reviews. Stephen Saito forMoveable Festdescribed the score as Marx's version of theJawstheme.[44]IndieWire's Jude Dry wrote that the "tense string score ratchets up the tension, though this technique loses its bite after a few too many uses",[45]while Katie Rife ofThe A.V. Clubpraised it, likening it to the work ofHarry Manfredini.[46]Andrew Parker forThe GATEalso touched on the score'shorror-like qualities, saying it worked well for its contribution to the claustrophobic storytelling.[47]The Film Stagelisted it as one of the best scores or soundtracks of 2021.[48]
Shiva Babywas slated to premiere at the 2020South by Southwest(SXSW); following the festival's cancellation in light of theCOVID-19 pandemic, it was instead screened digitally in April 2020.[49]The producers submitted the film to theSundance Film Festival, and though they were given an extension on submission to work on post-production, it was not accepted.[11]Altmann said that while it was disappointing to be rejected from a festival like Sundance, the team had been aiming for SXSW, as it was where the short premiered.[11]It was also screened digitally at a variety of festivals in August and September 2020,[50][51]and had its first physical screening at theTIFF Bell Lightboxfor the2020 Toronto International Film Festival(TIFF).[52][10]In place of live events, it received cast and director Q&A sessions viavideo links.[18]
In September 2020, just before its TIFF run,Utopiaacquired distribution rights toShiva Baby.[53]It was released inlimited theatersandvideo on demandon March 26, 2021 in Canada, by distributors Pacific Northwest Pictures,[54]and on April 2, 2021, when movie theaters re-opened, in the United States.[55]The soundtrack was released on the same day.[56]Utopia shopped the film to variousstreaming platforms: it was made available in Spain onFilmin,[57]and in several countries onMubifrom June 11, 2021 forPride Month.[58][36]Shiva Babyalso had a limited release in UK theaters in June 2021,[59]and awide releasein Australian theaters beginning July 2021.[4][60]It has been picked up for theatrical distribution in Israel byTLVFest.[61]It began streaming onHBO Maxin July 2021,[62]withHBOand Seligman developing atelevision pilotbased on the premise of the film.[63]
The first theatrical poster and trailer were released on February 18, 2021.[64]The posterwas designed by High Council,[65]withNylonnoting that it captures the film's style; "Sennott dressed to the nines in Jewish deli couture is nothing short of pure camp."[66]A second,red band, trailer was released on March 29, 2021,[67]and a UK trailer followed on May 27.[59]According to Seligman, Utopia targeted their marketing at the young queer female audience by producing content like the red band trailer. Additionally, pandemic lockdowns gave Seligman the time to engage with audiences at many film festivals, creating "if not a grassroots campaign, than a ground-up campaign", in their words. They added: "This is how we were able to find the right audience for the film, we responded to their excitement and included them in our outreach."[18]
Shiva Babywas the most-watched film on Mubi in 2021 by the start of August,[68]and ended the year still in the top spot.[69]It had a record-breaking sixteen-week continuous run (April 2–July 22, 2021) at theQuad Cinemain New York.[70][71][72]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 97% of 147 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "A ruefully funny calling card for debuting director Emma Seligman,Shiva Babytranscends its sitcom setup with strong performances and satisfying insights."[73]Metacriticassigned the film a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[74]
Brian Bromberger ofThe Bay Area Reportersaid it "may be one of the best bisexual films ever made",[75]and Alex de Vore of theSanta Fe Reportersaid that the ending is "one of the most meaningful moments of hope ever captured on film".[76]Madeline Ducharme ofSlate'sOutwardcalledShiva Babyand character Danielle "a step forward for bi representation on screen",[22]and diversity-focusedIncluvie'sAspen Nelson said that it "will be remembered as a crucial film of youthful Jewish representation in cinema."[77]Sennott's performance was noted as one of the best breakouts of 2020.[78][79][80]
Shiva Babywas praised both as and despite being a feature debut.[46][81][82]Jon Frosch ofThe Hollywood Reportersaid the film is worthy of comparison to films made by others later in their career, specifically saying it may be a "softer" version of the Coen brothers'A Serious Man.[83]Other critics noted Seligman's youth in these terms; inScriptmagazine,Tom Stempelcompared them toOrson Welles"when he madeyou know what",[84]and, inVanity Fair,Jordan Hoffmancompared them toSteven SpielbergmakingDuel.[40]
It also received positive reviews for its handling of modern topics.[85]Nelson wrote that it "takes a fresh perspective on the [messymillennial]tropethat mirrors experience and compels emotion".[77]Several critics were impressed thatShiva Babydoes not present Danielle's sex work negatively,[77][86][87]and Allyson Johnson ofThe Young Folksfelt that while the film is ostensiblycoming-of-age, "what makes [it] so instantly transcendent of some of its contemporaries is how much it acknowledges that, despite Danielle's initial presentation, she's still just a brat sometimes".[88]Others noted that whileShiva Babyis rooted in its Jewish identity, it is relatable and its awkward comedy universal.[89][90]Frosch felt that the film could have explored some of its themes more deeply,[83]and there were different views on the film's runtime: Kate Taylor ofThe Globe and Mailfelt that it gets stretched long,[91]while Jason Gorber of/Filmwrote that the "brisk 77 minute running time means the film never overstays its welcome".[92]
Various critics praise the characters andensemble castat the film's center.[45][84][93]Juan Antonio Barquin of theMiami New Timeswrote that the cast embody the specificity and complex relationships of their characters.[94]ForThe Film Stage, Zhuo-Ning Su compared the ensemble to that ofMa Rainey's Black Bottom, calling them a "group of comedic genius".[95]Frosch commented that Seligman's script may lean too much into stereotypes, but this is mitigated by the talented cast.[83]In the lead role, Sennott was highlighted in several reviews,[96][97][76]with Parker saying that she gave "a wonderful, star making performance".[47]Other critics looked at the chemistry of Sennott and Gordon's characters,[46][83][98]and highlighted other actors.[45][93][99][100]
Shiva Babyhas received many awards and nominations, particularly for Seligman's writing and directing as theirfeature filmdebut, and lead actress Sennott.[a]Seligman was nominated for aDirectors Guild Award;[101]casting director Kate Geller won aCasting Society of Americaaward;[102]and the film won theIndependent Spirit John Cassavetes Award, in 2022.[103]It also won aNational Board of Review Awardfor 2021,[104]and production designer Cheyenne Ford was selected to the 2021BAFTABreakthrough US cohort thanks to her work on the film.[105]Between 2020 and 2022 it won a variety of critics', festival, and media titles; for 2020 and, especially, 2021, it was included on many best-of lists.[a]

Emma Seligman(born May 3, 1995) is a Canadian film director and screenwriter. She[a]is best known for the filmsShiva Baby(2020) andBottoms(2023).
Seligman was born on May 3, 1995, inToronto, Ontario, to aJewishfamily.[1]She was raised in aReformAshkenazicommunity in Torontoand attendedNorthern Secondary Schoolthere. Herbat mitzvahceremony was held onMasadainIsrael; the party that followed, held in 2008, was filmmaker-themed.[1][2]She grew up watchingAt the Movies with Ebert & Roeperwanting to "beRoger Ebert."[3]As a teenager, Seligman ran a now-defunct blog calledConfessions of a Teenage Film Buffand contributed film reviews toThe Huffington Post,[4][5]including a review forSpring Breakers, which she wrote at seventeen years old.[1]She studied film atNew York University Tisch School of the Arts, graduating in May 2017.[6][7]Seligman remained in New York after graduating and interned with the production companyAnimal Kingdom.[8]
While atNYU, she made short films includingLonewoods,Void,and her senior thesis film,Shiva Baby. During this time, Seligman also interned at a variety of production studios. She also served on theToronto International Film Festival's select youth committee, where she helped program films for the festival.[9][10]
Her thesis film,Shiva Baby,was selected for2018 South by Southwestfilm festival. At the encouragement of the short film's star,Rachel Sennott, whom she befriended during the audition process, Seligman began developing it into afeature, where Sennott would reprise her lead role.[11][12]The feature-length version ofShiva Babywas set to premiere at2020 South by Southwest, but the premiere was cancelled due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[13]The film eventually premiered at the2020 Toronto International Film Festival.[14]
Shiva Babywas met with critical acclaim. Kristy Puchko ofThe Playlistwrote, "It's astounding this is Seligman's first film, [considering] how masterfully she orchestrates the tension and comedy,"[15]and Dana Piccoli forQueer Media Matterspraised that "while Seligman is still a relative newcomer to the film world, she handlesShiva Babylike an experienced pro."[16]In 2022, the film won theJohn Cassavetes AwardfromFilm Independent, at the time designated for productions with budgets of $500,000 or less.[b][17]
Seligman reunited withRachel Sennottfor her second feature film,Bottoms, ateen sex comedyin which two high school lesbians start a fight club in order to attract their cheerleader crushes. Seligman had the idea for the film while still at NYU, and began working on it with Sennott there.[13]Bottoms was scored by English singer-songwriterCharli XCX.[18]To promoteBottoms, Seligman appeared on the cover ofNew York Magazinewith the films' stars Rachel Sennott andAyo Edebiri. The film headlined theSXSW film festivalon March 11, 2023.[19]Aisha Harris ofNPRpraised the film writing, "Sennott and Seligman strike both a sweet and an abrasive tone that's tricky to pull off, though they do so quite handily."[20]Seligman's inspiration for the film came from high-school comedies such asBring It On,Mean Girls, andGrease.[18]
Seligman's work often focuses on sexual themes, particularly women's relationship to sex. Regarding this choice, she has stated:
Women decode sexual messaging from a young age, from eight years old to twenty-two years old. They have to process what sex means, what it can do for them, what it should do for them, what they're supposed to do for it. Technology, for example with porn or dating sites, has made the sexual messaging more confusing, and I'm interested in how women figure it out.[6]
She has stated that her filmmaking process as a very collaborative experience, and enjoys being able to discuss her work with her actors.[6]
Seligman uses both "she/her" and "they/them" pronouns. She formerly identified asbisexual, but as of 2023 considers herself "justgay".[21]Seligman briefly moved toLos Angelesin 2021, but resides inBushwickas of 2023.[22][13]
Seligman is a member ofJewish Voice for Peaceand has expressed support forPalestinianliberation beyondIsraeli occupation.[23][24]Her favorite Jewish movies areYentl,Keeping the Faith,Fiddler on the Roof,Kissing Jessica Stein,Crossing DelanceyandA Serious Man. Reflecting on these influences, she has stated, “Looking back, I don't know how my Jewish film journey, howShiva Baby, would have come about without those movies, or what it would have been like without them laying the groundwork."[1]
