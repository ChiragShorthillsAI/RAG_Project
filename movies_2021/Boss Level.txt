Roy Pulver, a retiredDelta ForcesoldierinAtlanta, has been stuck in atime loopfor nearly 140 days and has learned the day's patterns through many previous loops. He wakes at 07:00 AM each day, avoids anassassinin his apartment and an attack by a gunman in a helicopter outside his window, then escapes his apartment before it explodes. He has been able to elude more assassins throughout the morning, but finds himself unable to figure out how to survive a final attack at 12:47 PM, waking up back in his apartment on the next loop.
On the day before Roy entered the loop, his estranged wife Jemma had asked Roy to visit her at defense contractor Dynow Labs under the pretense of a job interview. The two argue over Joe, their son, whom Jemma has led to believe that Roy is just a family friend. When Colonel Clive Ventor, head of Dynow, discovers Roy near Jemma's highly classified project, he has him escorted out, but not before Jemma obtains a sample of Roy's hair.
In one loop, Roy tries to call Jemma but instead reaches Ventor, who tells him that Jemma died from a lab accident the day before. Roy becomes suspicious. On a later loop, he finds Joe atUnderground Atlanta, skipping school for avideo game tournament. Roy spends the day with Joe but does not mention Jemma's death. The assassins arrive to kill Roy - who uses his body to protect Joe - telling him, as he dies, that he is his father.
When Roy next wakes, he realizes that the assassins had followed him using a dental tracking device implanted by Alice, his date from the night before, who is a dental hygienist. Through more trial-and-error loops, Roy finds a way to remove the tracker and sneak into Dynow, killing several guards and assassins, but is always stopped by Ventor and the sword wielding Guan Yin. Ventor reveals to Roy that Jemma's project is the Osiris Spindle, a quantum device capable of rewriting history, which Ventor plans to use to set himself up as the world's dictator. Ventor admits he was responsible for Jemma's death after an argument the night before. As she had started the Spindle and no one else knows how to operate it, Ventor warns Roy the Spindle will destroy the world if it runs too long.
On further loops, Roy makes the connection to the Egyptian god of the afterlife,Osiris, from a book with a hidden message that Jemma gifted him for his birthday, and he realizes that Jemma must have placed him in the Spindle to stop Ventor. While he is able to further infiltrate Dynow and kill Ventor after learning sword fighting from "daily" lessons from Dai Feng, Roy learns the assassins were sent to kill Joe, and arrives too late. As he mourns over Joe, the Osiris Spindle explodes and destroys the world.
Roy spends several loops in a despondent state, then decides to spend several more loops with Joe, staying with him until the Spindle's explosion. In one loop, he learns that Jemma had called Joe that morning, later than he previously thought she was still alive, and realizes he can save her. After determining the exact time and place she died at Ventor's hands in Dynow, fourteen minutes after he wakes up, Roy uses the next loop to hijack the helicopter, get to Dynow, kill the waiting assassins, and stop Ventor before he kills Jemma.
Roy tells Jemma he has been spending his loops with Joe, and that he has seen the end of the world. Jemma tells Roy that he has to enter the Osiris Spindle in order to reset it, and that either he would wake up and repeat the day once more or die and stay dead. Roy kisses Jemma before entering the spindle as Jemma looks on in awe. Roy reawakens back in bed and tells himself not to die as the attacks begin.
The international release ends as he enters the Spindle. No mention is made of having to repeat the day, but rather that he may "cease to be" if he enters the Spindle.

With no pixels in sight, Grillo givesBoss Levelthe thing mostvideogame movieriffs lack: a pulse."[31]

It was launched on October 29, 2007, initially as ajoint venturebetweenNews Corporation(later21st Century Fox) andNBC Universal, which was laterbought byComcast. Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initiallybrandedas "Hulu Plus," which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and un-delayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—anover-the-topstreaming television service offering access tobroadcast televisionchannels.
In 2011, Hulu launchedits services in Japan, marking its first and only international expansion. Three years later in 2014, Hulu Japan was acquired byNippon TVand spun off from its American counterpart.[2]Since February 2021, Hulu's original content has since been distributed outside of the U.S. viaDisney+under theStarbrand. In 2019, Disney acquired a majority stake in Hulu as part of itsacquisition of 21st Century Fox, and subsequently acquired the remaining stakes held by AT&T and Comcast in 2019 and 2023, respectively, giving it full ownership. After the acquisition, Disneysoft launchedan integration of Hulu into Disney+ as a content hub in December 2023, allowing subscribers of both services to access Hulu content from within the Disney+ app. Hulu is one of the three streaming services in the Disney Bundle, alongside Disney+ andESPN+.
On January 6, 2025, Disney began its acquisition of a 70% stake inFuboTV, with the latter merging with Hulu's Live TV service. The combined company will remain publicly traded on theNew York Stock Exchange, but will be controlled by Disney executives. As part of the deal, Fubo settled a lawsuit againstESPN Inc.(majority-owned by Disney),Fox Corporation(21CF's successor), andWarner Bros. Discovery(WarnerMedia's successor after its merger withDiscovery, Inc.) over a joint venture known asVenu Sports, with Fubo being granted a preliminary injection to stop its launch in August 2024. The merger will take 12 to 18 months according to Disney and Fubo. Venu Sports was discontinued a few days later.
The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

It invited users to leave their email addresses for the upcomingbeta test.[13]In October 2007, Hulu began the private beta testing by invitation, and later allowed users to invite friends.[14]Hulu launched for public access in the United States on March 12, 2008.[15]
Hulu began an advertising campaign during NBC's broadcast ofSuper Bowl XLIIIwith an initial ad starringAlec Baldwintitled "Alec in Huluwood."[16]Advertisements have since aired featuringEliza Dushku,Seth MacFarlane,Denis Leary, andWill Arnett.[citation needed]
In July 2007,Providence Equity, the owner ofNewport Television, became one of the earliest "outside" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 millionequity investment,[17]before the company was known as "Hulu."[18]With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an "independent voice on the board."[18]In April 2009,the Walt Disney Companyjoined the Hulu consortium as a stakeholder, with plans to offer content fromABC,ESPNandDisney Channel.[19][20][21][22]
Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

Comcast, the only other shareholder, announced on May 14, 2019, that it had agreed to cede its control to Disney, and reached an agreement for Disney to purchase its 33% stake in the company as early as 2024.[38]
On May 14, 2019, Comcast relinquished its control in Hulu to Disney effective immediately. As a result, the streaming service became a division ofWalt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International(DTCI) with Comcast effectively becoming asilent partner. Under the agreement, Comcast's 33% stake can be sold to Disney atfair market valueas early as 2024. The fair market value will be determined at that time, but Disney guaranteed a minimum valuation of the entire company at $27.5 billion (valuing the Comcast stake as worth at least $9.075 billion).[39]Randy Freer would report to Disney executiveKevin Mayer.[39]

However, Comcast had not offered reasonable terms for an early buyout[54]and had instead expressed interest in buying Hulu themselves if it were for sale.[53]
On May 18, it was announced that Disney+ and Hulu would remove nearly 60 original films and series on May 26 in order to "cut costs."

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
