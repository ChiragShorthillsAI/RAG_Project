Ewing is a native of the Detroit area. She was introduced to film by her father who encouraged her and her siblings to watch Fellini films at a young age. But it was her exposure to Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" at the age of ten that had the greatest impact. "It blew my mind into thousands of pieces, and I couldn't stop going back to see it over and over again," she says. "I didn't know something could be so potent."[1]
Ewing graduated ofMercy High School[2]and then attended and graduated from the Georgetown University.[3]
In 2001 she and Rachel Grady founded Loki Films in New York.[4]
Her first film as a director was the short "Dissident: Oswaldo Paya and The Varela Project," a short film financed by the National Democratic Institute[5]about the now deceased activist and his efforts to push for human rights in Cuba.
Her first feature-length documentary,  "The Boys of Baraka," was co-directed with Rachel Grady. The film, made with ITVS, premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival and was release theatrically by ThinkFilm before airing on PBS.[6]The film follows a group of 12-year-old boys from Baltimore who leave home for an experimental middle school in rural Kenya.[7]
In 2006 she and Grady released "Jesus Camp," which premiered at The Tribeca Film Festival and was released by Magnolia Pictures.[8]The film was nominated for the 2006 Academy Award.[9]
In 2011 she returned to her native Detroit to make "DETROPIA," an impressionistic documentary that focuses on the challenges of a shrinking city and those who refuse to give up on it.[10]The film premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and won the editing award[11]
In 2017 she co-directed Netflix Original film, "One of Us,"  which follows three Hasidic Jews who attempt to leave the insular community and pursue a secular life. The film premiered at the 2017Toronto International Film Festival. Ewing appeared onCharlie Rosein October 2017 to discuss the film and said thatHasidic Jewsdied disproportionally in the Holocaust because they "refused to blend in". She later apologized.[12]
Ewing made her narrative debut in 2020 with "I Carry You With Me," a love story based on her two close friends, Ivan and Gerardo, who had emigrated to the United States from a conservative town in Mexico. The film began as a documentary, but over the course of the process Ewing realized it was best presented as a narrative film with non-fiction elements woven through.[13]The film made  its world premiere at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival where it won the jury and audiences awards in the festival's NEXT section. The film was nominated for two IndependentSpirit Awardsand was released bySony Pictures Classicsin 2021.

Ángeles Cruz(born 1969) is a Mexican actress, film director, and screenwriter. As a filmmaker, she has focused on themes of ostracism, female sexuality, and gender violence. In a 2022 interview, she explained, "I have three imbalances: I come from an indigenous community, I am a woman, and I am a lesbian – things that have been stereotyped and placed in an emerging situation of survival."[1]
Her work has been recognized with threeAriel Awards.
Ángeles Cruz is originally from Villa Guadalupe Victoria inSan Miguel el Grande[es], a mostly indigenous community high in the mountains ofOaxaca.[2][3]She grew up primarily speaking Spanish, but learned someMixtecfrom her father.[4]In her community there was no electricity, no water, and no cinema. She saw only one film in her first sixteen years,El joven Juárez[es], which her father had in16 mm.[1]"When I saw the film for the first time in a cinema, it changed me, transformed me; it totally pulled out the rug," she recalled.[5]
She wanted to be anagronomistand dedicate herself to farming, but her family had to relocate, first toTlaxiaco, and later toOaxaca. There, she switched to studying theater, a decision she credits to her high school teacher Sergio Santamaría.[6]
Cruz studied at the Miguel Cabrera Center of Artistic Education in Oaxaca, and later completed alicentiatein acting at theINBATheater Art School in Mexico City.[7]
In 1994, she began getting roles in cinema. Her first film as an actress was the Swedish-Danish dramaLa hija del pumaabout massacres that occurred in Guatemala against the indigenous people.[1]Her performance was nominated for theGuldbagge Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.[7]
In 2011, Cruz started writing her own stories, and directed a short film made from one such script,La tiricia o cómo curar la tristeza. It was produced by theInstituto Mexicano de Cinematografía, and won theAriel Awardfor Best Short Film in 2013.[8]
She continued with the shortsLa cartaandArcángel, followed by her first feature,Nudo Mixteco, starringSonia Couoh[es]andNoé Hernández, which tells three stories of women living in indigenous communities in Oaxaca. Regarding the film's explicit love scenes between women, Cruz said,
Homosexuality has been crossed out in the world due to ignorance and due to this impasse that exists. For me it was important to name it and show it forcefully, not leave it to the imagination, not self-censor and let it remain in the line of imagination for the viewer to complete. I feel that it is a beautiful manifestation of love, and I feel that lesbian women in the communities have also remained in the dark, marginalized. Male homosexuality is named, everything from the male gaze. It seemed important to me to name it.[9]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
