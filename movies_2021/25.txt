The Tragedy of Macbethis a 2021 Americanhistoricalthriller film[3]written, directed and produced byJoel Coen, based on the playMacbethbyWilliam Shakespeare. It is the first film directed by one of theCoen brotherswithout the other's involvement. The film starsDenzel Washington,Frances McDormand(who also produced the film),Bertie Carvel,Alex Hassell,Corey Hawkins,Harry Melling,Kathryn Hunter, andBrendan Gleeson.
The Tragedy of Macbethpremiered at the2021 New York Film Festivalon September 24, 2021. Following alimited theatrical releaseon December 25, 2021 byA24, the film was distributed via streaming onApple TV+on January 14, 2022. The film received critical acclaim for its direction, cinematography, and the performances of Washington, McDormand, and Hunter. For his performance in the title role, Washington was nominated for theAcademy Award,Golden Globe,Critics' Choice Award, andScreen Actors Guild Awardfor Best Actor. The film also receivedAcademy Awardnominations forBest CinematographyandBest Production Design.
Macbeth,ThaneofGlamis, and Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, having led King Duncan's army to victory over the traitorous Thane of Cawdor, are approached by three witches on the battlefield. The witches hail Macbeth as the future Thane ofCawdorand proclaim that he shall some day be King and that Banquo shall father a line of kings.
Soon thereafter, King Duncan fulfills the first prophecy by ordering the Thane of Ross to execute Cawdor and reinvest the title upon Macbeth, but King Duncan names his own sonMalcolmas the prince ofCumberland, which Macbeth sees as an encumbrance to his path to the throne. When Duncan spends a night at Macbeth's castle, Lady Macbeth, aware of the prophecies, convinces her husband to commitregicide. She drugs the King's servants, and a hesitant Macbeth murders the King. At dawn, Macduff, Thane of Fife, discovers the body, and Macbeth ties up loose ends by summarily executing the servants, ostensibly as just punishment for their supposed betrayal of the King.
Fearing for his own life, Malcolm flees to England, and Macbeth assumes the throne as the new King. Uneasy over the prophecy concerning Banquo, Macbeth arranges to have him and his sonFleancemurdered. Macbeth's assassins, accompanied by Ross as theThird Murderer, kill Banquo. Ross then pursues Fleance through a field.[4]
An increasingly paranoid Macbeth becomes a feared tyrant. At a royal banquet, he hallucinates and begins raving at an apparition of Banquo. Lady Macbeth has the guests dismissed before sedating Macbeth. During his trance, Macbeth is again visited by the witches. They conjure a vision of Fleance, who tells him to beware of Macduff, that he shall be King untilGreat Birnam Woodcomes toDunsinane Hill, and that he shall be harmed by no man born of a woman. Macbeth orders the whole Macduff household to be slaughtered; only Macduff survives, having fled to England earlier.
A guilt-ridden Lady Macbeth gradually descends into insanity. Ross secretly visits England and informs Macduff of his family's demise. A grief-stricken Macduff vows revenge, while Malcolm raises an army with English help. The troops cut down branches from Birnam Wood, using them as camouflage, and march on Macbeth's castle at Dunsinane, fulfilling one of the prophecies. Lady Macbeth dies, implied to have been killed by Ross,  plunging Macbeth into further despair. Still convinced of his invincibility, he is ultimately challenged by Macduff to a duel. Macduff declares he is not born of a woman but instead "untimely ripped" from his mother's body. Macbeth initially refuses but ultimately accepts Macduff's challenge. Macduff defeats andbeheadsMacbeth, fulfilling the final prophecy. Malcolm is crowned the new King of Scotland. Meanwhile, Fleance is revealed to be alive, and Ross spirits him away from Scotland. A flock of crows emerges in the foreground clearing the path and signaling the fulfillment of the witches' prophecy regarding Banquo's progeny.[4]
It was announced in March 2019 thatJoel Coen, in a rare solo effort, was set to write and direct a new take on theWilliam Shakespeareplay.Scott Rudinwas originally set to produce, andA24would distribute.[6]Denzel WashingtonandFrances McDormandwere set to star in the film;[when?][6]McDormand had previously portrayed both Lady Macbeth and one of the Three Witches in a 2016 American stage production ofMacbeth.[1]In November,Brendan GleesonandCorey Hawkinsentered negotiations to join the cast. Both were confirmed in January 2020, along with the addition ofMoses Ingram,Harry MellingandRalph Inesonto the cast.[7][8]
Filming began in Los Angeles with cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel on February 7, 2020.[9][10][11]To give the film a look "untethered from reality", it was shot entirely on sound stages.[12]In April, Coen announced that the film would officially be titledThe Tragedy of Macbeth.[3]It was announced on March 26, 2020, that filming had been halted due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[13]Production resumed on July 23, 2020,[14]and concluded on July 31, 2020.[15]In April 2021, Rudin stepped down as producer following allegations of abuse.[16]
The film's score was composed byCarter Burwell, the Coen brothers' longtime collaborator.[12]The score's ominous tone is punctuated by moments of solo violin described by Burwell as “taking flight out of the darkness.” Helping the composer to channel the idea of a folk-style sound from unknown lands was award-winning violinistTim Fain.[17]Regarding Joel directing alone without Ethan, Burwell stated, "Ethan didn't want to make movies anymore. He seems to be happy with what he's doing. They both have tons of unproduced scripts sitting on shelves, but I don't know what Joel will do without him."[18]
The film is presented inblack-and-whitewith anaspect ratioof 1.37:1; the production design and visual style intended to evokeThe Passion of Joan of Arc1928 landmark film byCarl Theodor Dreyer, asIngmar Bergman'sThe Seventh Seal1957 film did before.
The film was theatrically released by A24 followed by global launch onApple TV+.[19]It had its world premiere at the2021 New York Film Festivalon September 24, 2021.[20][21]It was released in alimited releaseon December 25, 2021, prior to streaming on Apple TV+ on January 14, 2022.[22]It also concluded theLondon Film Festival.
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 92% of 287 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's consensus reads: "Led by a stellar Denzel Washington,The Tragedy of Macbethstrips the classic story down to its visual and narrative essentials."[23]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 87 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[24]
Peter BradshawofThe Guardianwrote: "The movie hits its stride immediately with a taut, athletic urgency and it contains some superb images – particularly the eerie miracle of Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane, with Malcolm’s soldiers holding tree-branches over their heads in a restricted forest path and turning themselves into a spectacular river of boughs."[25]
Alison Willmore ofVulturewrote: "WhileThe Tragedy of Macbethis Joel Coen’s first solo directing effort ... that aspect of their long collaboration remains steady. Macbeth becomes, like so many of the Coens’ protagonists, a character trapped in his own fixations and failings, the concave world onscreen a reflection of the self he can't escape."[26]
Dave Calhoun ofTime Outwrote that it was "stage-bound in all the right ways, reminiscent of a much earlier cinema, when filmmakers barely stepped outdoors and wielded magic with shadow and light on soundstages. It’s short, sharp and savage."[27]Robbie CollinofThe Daily Telegraphwrote that it "has simmered its source text long and low, leeching every last drop of pungency and savour from the carcass", and added that it "resonates with the ancient power of a ritual."[28]
Clarisse Loughrey ofThe Independentfound Coen's symbolism to be "a literal manifestation of the avian imagery Shakespeare summons in his play ... a hallmark of the films he made with his brother Ethan – each of them rich, puzzle box films that use every element of composition and mood to whisper their true meaning to their audience."[29]
Richard Roeperfromthe Chicago Sun-Timesgave the film three and a half stars out of four, calling it "one of the most visually striking and leanest versions of 'the Scottish play' ever put on film, with blockbuster performances from Oscar winners Frances McDormand and Denzel Washington as Lady and Lord Macbeth, and a brilliant supporting cast."[30]
Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkergave the film a generally negative review, stating that "Coen’s straining for seriousness and yearning for importance breaks through to the other side with the howlers of unintentional comedy ... Coen’s stripped-down adaptation sets out to normalize Shakespearean language, but he ends up going too far."[31]

Apple TV+is an Americansubscriptionover-the-topstreaming serviceowned byApple. The service launched on November 1, 2019, and it offers a selection of original production film and television series calledApple Originals.[9]The service was announced during theApple Special Event of March 2019,[10][11]where entertainers from Apple TV+ projects appeared onstage, includingJennifer Aniston,Oprah Winfrey, andSteven Spielberg.[12][13]The service can be accessed through Apple's website and through theApple TV app, which has gradually become available on manyApple devicesand some major competingdigital media players,[14]including somesmart TVmodels and video-game consoles.
Apple plans to expand the services' availability,[15][16][17][18]and there are workarounds for subscribers whose device is not presently supported.[14]Access is included as part of theApple Onesubscription.[19]Most of the content is available inDolby Visionprofile 5 andDolby Atmos. Upon its debut, Apple TV+ was available in about 100 countries, fewer than the reported target of 150.[20][21]Several countries were excluded from service despite other Apple products being available.[22][23][24]Commentators noted that the fairly wide initial reach of the service offered Apple an advantage over other recently launched services such asDisney+, and that because Apple distributes its own content through the service instead of distributing licensed third-party content (as, for example,Huludoes) it will not be limited by licensing issues during its expansion.[25][26][27]
By early 2020, Apple TV+ had poor growth and low subscriber numbers relative to competing services.[28][29][30][31]In the middle of that year, Apple began to license older television programs and films, attempting to stay competitive with other services, attract and retain a viewership for its original content, and convert into subscribers users who were trialing the service.[29][28]Since then, the service has become the home to critically acclaimed content: between September 2021 and March 2022, Apple TV+ netted aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy SerieswithTed Lassoand theAcademy Award for Best PicturewithCODA, the first Best Picture win for a film distributed by a streaming service.[32]Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston have all signed a multi year look deal with Apple TV+ to develop more television projects under their production companies after their critically acclaimed shows. Apple TV+ (along with the simultaneously announceda-la-cartepremium-videosubscription aggregation serviceApple TV app) is part of a concerted effort by Apple to expand its service revenues.[16][33][34]The service's programming arm isApple Studios.
Apple had long been rumored to have an interest in beginning astreaming televisionservice, and in 2015 entered into negotiations with varioustelevision studiosand programmers to aggregate their content for a live-television streaming bundle.[35][36]Negotiations fell apart over differing views on how to value the content, lack of transparency on details, and the personality of Apple's chief negotiator,Eddy Cue.[35]
In October 2016, Apple CEOTim Cooksaid that television is "of intense interest to me and other people here", and added that Apple has "started focusing on some original content", which he called "a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it's an area we're focused on."[37]
In June 2017, Apple began to take the first major steps to form its new television unit by hiring the co-presidents ofSony Pictures Television, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to oversee all aspects of worldwide video programming.[36][2]In August, Matt Cherniss was hired as Head of Domestic Creative Development, reporting directly to Van Amburg and Erlicht.[3]For the rest of 2017, Apple continued to fill out its executive team for Apple TV+, with Kim Rozenfeld joining as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted,Jay Huntjoining as Creative Director for Europe,Morgan Wandelljoining as Head of International Creative Development, Tara Sorensen joining as Head of Kids Programming, and Max Aronson, Ali Woodruff, Carina Walker, and Michelle Lee joining as development and creative executives.[38][39][4][6][40]
Throughout 2019, Apple continued to build out its unscripted content team, with Molly Thompson hired as Head of Documentaries in April.[5]In November, Rozenfeld stepped down as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted to focus on producing content again with a first-look content production deal with Apple under his Half Full Productions. Cherniss took over Rozenfeld's duties overseeing current scripted programming.[41]
In May 2018, it was reported that Apple was expected to start a sister project to its original content service, and begin selling subscriptions to certain video services directly via itsApple TV appapplication oniOSandtvOS, rather than asking Apple device owners to subscribe to those services through applications individually downloaded from Apple's app store.[42]
In October 2018, it was reported that Apple would distribute its future original content through a still-in-development digital video service within its TV application that is pre-installed in all iOS and tvOS devices. The service was expected to feature both original content, free to owners of Apple devices, as well as subscription "channels" from legacy media companies such asHBOandStarz, which would allow customers to sign up for online-only services.[43]Later that month, it was reported that Apple intended to roll out the service in the U.S. during the first half of 2019 and that it would expand its availability to around 100 countries in the months after its launch.[44]
On March 25, 2019, Apple held a press event to announce Apple TV+. At the event, Apple showed a teaser of its upcoming original content and formally announced some of it, with actors and producers attached to the content appearing on stage. The announced content includedHelpsters, the first series fromSesame Workshop, the producer ofSesame Street, and Oprah Winfrey's first projects for Apple TV+, including a documentary under the working titleToxic Labor[45]about workplace sexual harassment, a documentary series about mental health, and a revival ofOprah's Book Clubas a standalone television series.[46][47]
On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would launch on November 1 at $4.99 per month (with a 1-week free trial) for an account that can be shared with up to six family members. Apple also announced that it would be give away a year of Apple TV+ to anyone who bought a newApple TV,Mac,iPad,iPhone, oriPod Touchbeginning that day.[48]Student subscribers to the monthlyApple Musicservice at a discounted rate also have Apple TV+ bundled in at no additional cost for the time being.[49]
From the start of Apple TV+ on November 1, 2019, Apple offered a free one-year subscription to anyone buying certain of its hardware products (an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod Touch, or Mac).[50]Apple initially extended the free year that was due to end on November 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021,[51]but then announced in mid-January 2021 that it would extend it a second time to July 31, 2021.[52]
In mid-June 2021, Apple added a note to its website advising customers that new users subscribing after June 30, 2021, would receive only three months of free subscription instead of a year.[53]
On October 24, 2022, Apple announced it was to increase pricing of Apple TV+ (along withApple MusicandApple One) subscriptions in many regions. The monthly plan increased $2 to $6.99, and the annual plan increased $20 to $69.[54]
During the announcement of Apple TV+, Apple announced a number of prominent writers, directors, and stars who would be featured in the service. The signing of high-profile talent was intended to attract viewers to the service.[55]
As of March 2019[update], five of the upcoming series had completed production, with six more well into filming.[56]On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would have eight original series (seven scripted and one unscripted) and one original documentary available at launch, with plans to launch new original content every month thereafter. Most series were expected to launch with three episodes, with a new episode released weekly thereafter, although Apple said that not all series would follow that model and that some series might instead launch all at once.[57]
Early critical reaction to the bulk of the service's programming was mixed to poor, but commentators predicted that Apple would have time to grow into its new role as a content provider and to produce well-regarded content, especially as the free year of the service provided with many Apple product purchases enticed users to continue watching, and for some to eventually pay for a subscription, as new series are released.[58][59][15]
On March 13, 2020, Apple suspended all active filming on Apple TV+ shows due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, and all production on series was postponed for an indeterminate period.[60]
Apple's decision in mid-2020 to license large swaths of existing older content for the Apple TV+ service was viewed, in part, as buying time for its original content production during the pandemic by keeping users engaged and in a habit of visiting the service regularly, so that a viewer base would be in place by the time new Apple original content was released.[29][28]
In addition, Apple TV+ endeavored to gain new high-profile content, taking advantage of the pandemic's disruption of theatrical film releases. Among these acquisitions were the 2020 feature filmGreyhoundstarringTom Hanks, which was purchased fromSony Picturesfor $70 million.[61]In July 2020, the service won a heated bidding war forEmancipation, a slavery-based action-thriller starringWill Smithand directed byAntoine Fuqua.[62]Apple paid a record $105 million for the rights.[62]Apple also reportedly considered a $350 to $400 million offer for the rights to stream theJames BondfilmNo Time to Die, which was far short of the $650 to $800 million studioMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(owned byAmazon, which is one of theBig Techcompanies alongside Apple) was willing to accept.[63]
In October 2017, following reports ofsexual abuse allegationsagainst producerHarvey Weinstein, Apple announced that it was severing ties withThe Weinstein Company(TWC) and cancelling a plannedbiopicseries aboutElvis Presley.[64]
In April 2018, Apple signedKerry Ehrinto a multi-year deal to produce original content.[65]Ehrin and Apple renewed the deal in May 2020.[66]
In June 2018, Apple signed theWriters Guild of America's minimum basic agreement andOprah Winfreyto a multi-year content partnership.[67][68]The same month, Apple announced that it had given a multi-series order toSesame Workshopto produce variouslive-actionand animated series as well as a single puppet-based series.[69]
In September 2018, it was reported that Apple had decided to shelveVital Signs, a six-episode biopic television series centering on the life of hip-hop producer and performerDr. Dreand starringIan McShane,Sam Rockwell, andMichael K. Williams, due to concerns about the show's content being too graphic, with moments cited including characters usingcocaine, instances ofgun violence, and an explicitorgyscene. Reports further indicated that Apple CEO Tim Cook was taking a hands-on approach to the company's Worldwide Video Unit, with programming decisions reportedly being aligned to Cook's personal taste, with a preference for family-friendly shows. Various programs in different stages of production apparently had their content altered, including the toning down ofThe Morning Showand the removal of crucifixes from a scene in theM. Night Shyamalandrama series. Additionally, Apple reportedly passed on a television series from comedianWhitney Cummingsabout the #MeToo movement because it was "too sensitive a topic".[70][71][72]Cummings's series was ultimately put into development byAmazon Prime Videoin October 2018.[73]
In November 2018, Apple entered into a multi-year agreement with entertainment companyA24to produce a slate of original films in partnership with its Worldwide Video Unit.[74]The same month, Apple signed a deal with DHX Media (nowWildBrain) and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide to develop and produce original programs, including new series, specials, and shorts based on thePeanutscharacters. One of the first productions created through the deal was an original short-form,STEM-relatedseriesfeaturing astronautSnoopy.[75]Also that month, Apple signedJustin Linand his production company, Perfect Storm Entertainment, to a multi-year overall deal to produce original television content.[76]

Apple TV+ released its first movie in theaters,Killers of the Flower Moon. Apple has said that its primary goal in releasing the film is to attract more subscribers, not to do well at the box office, but it brought in $145 million.[118]Apple TV+ also released another movie,Napoleon. Apple is seemingly pleased with its box-office returns, which reached $221 million and nearly made back its budget. It is apparent that Apple is attempting to compete with movie production companies.[119][120][121]
In March 2022, Apple announced that it would airFriday Night Baseball, a weekly doubleheader ofMajor League Baseball(MLB) games with live pre- and postgame shows on Apple TV+ in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom starting in the2022 Major League Baseball season.[122]

Apple TV+ subscribers can watch select games at no additional charge, and receive a discount on the MLS Season Pass.[126][127]
In mid-2020, Apple began discussions with film and television studios to license their previously released content as part of an effort to build a back catalog of non-original films and television shows for the streaming service.[30][29]The shift was designed to help the service better compete against the large content libraries competitors likeNetflixhave.[30]This represented a pivot for Apple, which had initially attempted to build the service entirely on original content, avoiding licensing fees to help keep monthly subscription fees low, and relying on its Apple TV Channels content partners to supply other content users wanted.[30][29]
Analysts believed that the addition of older, highly re-watchable content like popular sitcoms and well-liked films would help retain the slowly growing subscriber base while Apple continues to develop original content.[28]The shift was also an acknowledgement of poor growth, especially relative to competing services.[28]The back catalog development was also seen as a move to attempt to persuade free trial users to transition into paid users as the first wave of one-year trials was scheduled to expire in November 2020.[29]
On May 26, 2020, Apple announced its first acquisition of catalogue content would be theFraggle Rockseries.[128]In addition to being the exclusive home of the 1983–1987Jim Henson Companyseries, Apple would develop a new, full-length, rebootedFraggle Rockseries after the success of theFraggle Rock: Rock On!short-form series on Apple TV+.[129]On October 19, 2020, Apple announced the exclusive transmission rights of the various animated productions of thePeanutsfranchise, withdrawing them from broadcast television after 55 years; as part of that agreement, Apple TV+ must make the majorPeanutsspecials available for free in short windows.[130]After an outcry from fans of the specials, Apple sublicensedA Charlie Brown ThanksgivingandA Charlie Brown ChristmastoPBSfor commercial-free airing.[131]In 2021,It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brownalso came to the PBS rotation. The PBS sublicensing arrangement ended before October 2022.[132]
In March 2024, Apple made 51 catalog films available under a "Great Movies special collection" banner.[133]
Apple has announced a number of partnerships, bundles, and initiatives to increase subscriber growth in the service.[when?]

It is currently unknown if this slate of films will have a theatrical release or be exclusive to Apple's streaming service,Apple TV+.[44]

During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, A24 was approved to continue filming and promotional activities since they do not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP).[57]
In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

Linked page for 'Joel Coen' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_brothers):
Joel Daniel Coen(born November 29, 1954)[1]andEthan Jesse Coen(born September 21, 1957),[2]together known as theCoen brothers(/ˈkoʊən/), are an American filmmaking duo.Their filmsspan many genres and styles, which they frequently subvert or parody.[3]Among their most acclaimed works areBlood Simple(1984),Raising Arizona(1987),Miller's Crossing(1990),Barton Fink(1991),Fargo(1996),The Big Lebowski(1998),O Brother, Where Art Thou?(2000),No Country for Old Men(2007),A Serious Man(2009),True Grit(2010) andInside Llewyn Davis(2013).
The brothers generally write, direct and produce their films jointly, although due toDGAregulations, Joel received sole directing credit while Ethan received sole production credit untilThe Ladykillers(2004), from which point on they would be credited together as directors and producers; they also shared editing credits under the aliasRoderick Jaynes. The duo started directing separately in the 2020s, resulting in Joel'sThe Tragedy of Macbeth(2021) and Ethan'sJerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind(2022) andDrive-Away Dolls(2024). They have been nominated for 13Academy Awardstogether, plus one individual nomination for each, sharingBest Original ScreenplayforFargo, andBest Picture,Best DirectorandBest Adapted ScreenplayforNo Country for Old Men. They won thePalme d'OrforBarton Finkat the1991 Cannes Film Festival.
The Coens have written films for other directors, includingSam Raimi'sCrimewave(1985),Angelina Jolie'sWorld War IIbiopicUnbroken(2014) andSteven Spielberg'sCold WardramaBridge of Spies(2015). They producedTerry Zwigoff'sBad Santa(2003) andJohn Turturro'sRomance and Cigarettes(2005).  Ethan is also a writer of short stories, theater and poetry.
They are known for their distinctive stylistic trademarks including genre hybridity.[4]No Country for Old Men,A Serious ManandInside Llewyn Daviswere included on theBBC's2016 poll of the greatest motion pictures since 2000.[5]In 1998, theAmerican Film Institute(AFI) rankedFargoamong the100 greatest American movies.[6]Richard Corlisswrote of the Coens: "Dexterously flipping and reheating old movie genres like so many pancakes, they serve them up fresh, not with syrup but with a coating of comic arsenic."[7]
Joel Daniel Coen (born November 29, 1954) and Ethan Jesse Coen (born September 21, 1957) were born and raised inSt. Louis Park, Minnesota, a suburb ofMinneapolis.[8]Their mother, Rena (néeNeumann; 1925–2001), was anart historianatSt. Cloud State University,[9]and their father, Edward Coen (1919–2012), was a professor of economics at theUniversity of Minnesota.[10]The brothers have an older sister, Deborah, who is a psychiatrist in Israel.[11][12]
In regards to whether our background influences our film making ... who knows? We don't think about it ... There's no doubt that our Jewish heritage affects how we see things.
Both sides of the Coen family were Eastern EuropeanAshkenazi Jews.[11]Their paternal grandfather, Victor Coen, was abarristerin theInns of Courtin London before retiring toHovewith their grandmother.[14]Edward Coen was an American citizen born in the United States,[14]but grew up inCroydon, London and studied at theLondon School of Economics.[11]Afterwards he moved to the United States, where he met the Coens' mother, and served in theUnited States ArmyduringWorld War II.[11][14]
The Coens developed an early interest in cinema through television. They grew up watching Italian films (ranging from the works ofFederico Fellinito theSons of Herculesfilms) aired on a Minneapolis station, theTarzan films, and comedies (Jerry Lewis,Bob HopeandDoris Day).[15]
In the mid-1960s, Joel saved money from mowing lawns to buy aVivitarSuper 8camera.[16]Together, the brothers remade movies they saw on television, with their neighborhood friend Mark Zimering ("Zeimers") as the star.[17]Cornel Wilde'sThe Naked Prey(1965) became theirZeimers in Zambezi, which featured Ethan as a native with a spear.Lassie Come Home(1943) was reinterpreted as theirEd... A Dog, with Ethan playing the mother role in his sister'stutu. They also made original films likeHenry Kissinger, Man on the Go,Lumberjacks of the NorthandThe Banana Film.[18]
Joel and Ethan graduated fromSt. Louis Park High School[19]in 1973 and 1976, respectively, and fromBard College at Simon's RockinGreat Barrington, Massachusetts.[20]
After Simon's Rock, Joel spent four years in the undergraduate film program atNew York University, where he made a 30-minute thesis film,Soundings.[21]In 1979, he briefly enrolled in the graduate film program at theUniversity of Texas at Austin, following a woman he had married who was in the graduate linguistics program. The marriage soon ended in divorce and Joel left UT Austin after nine months.[22]
Ethan went on toPrinceton Universityand earned anundergraduate degreein philosophy in 1979.[20]His senior thesis was a 41-page essay, "Two Views ofWittgenstein'sLater Philosophy", which was supervised byRaymond Geuss.[23]
After graduating fromNew York University, Joel worked as aproduction assistanton a variety ofindustrial filmsand music videos. He developed a talent for film editing and metSam Raimiwhile assisting Edna Ruth Paul in editing Raimi's first feature film,The Evil Dead(1981).[24]
The duo made their debut withBlood Simple(1984). Set inTexas, it tells the tale of a bar owner (Dan Hedaya) who hires a detective (M. Emmet Walsh) to kill his wife and her lover (Frances McDormandandJohn Getz, respectively). It contains elements that point to their future direction: distinctive homages to genre movies (in this casenoirandhorror),plot twistslayered over a simple story, snappy dialogue anddark humor.Janet Maslinwrote: "The camera work byBarry Sonnenfeldis especially dazzling. So is the fact that Mr. Coen, unlike many people who have directed great-looking film noir efforts, knows better than to let handsomeness become the film's entire raison d'être. In addition to its stylishness,Blood Simplehas the kind of purposefulness and coherence that show Mr. Coen to be headed for bigger, even better, things."[25]Joel's direction was recognized at theSundanceandIndependent Spiritawards.[26]It was the first film shot by Sonnenfeld, who collaborated with the Coens on their two subsequent films and went on to be a director. It marked the first of many collaborations between the Coens and composerCarter Burwell. It was also the screen debut of McDormand, who went on to feature in many of the Coens' films (and marry Joel).[27]
Their next project wasCrimewave(Raimi, 1985), written by the Coens and Raimi. Joel and Raimi also madecameosinSpies Like Us(1985).
The brothers wanted to follow their debut with something fast-paced and funny.Raising Arizona(1987) follows an unlikely married couple: ex-convict H.I. (Nicolas Cage) and police officer Ed (Holly Hunter), who long for a baby but are unable to conceive. When furniture tycoon Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) appears on television with his newly born quintuplets and jokes that they "are more than we can handle", H.I. steals one of the quintuplets to bring up as their own.Pauline Kaelnoted its "cornpone-surreal quality" and wrote that the Coens "are going with their strengths. They're making a contraption, and they're good at it because they know how to make the camera behave mechanically, which is just right here—it mirrors the mechanics of farce ... The Sunsets look marvellously ultra-vivid; the paint doesn't seem to be dry—it's like opening day at a miniature-golf course."[28]Geoff Andrewwrote: "the lives and times of Hi, Ed and friends are painted in splendidly seedy colours, turning Arizona into a mythical haven for a memorable gaggle of no-hopers, halfwits and has-beens. Starting from a point of delirious excess, the film leaps into dark and virtually uncharted territory to soar like a comet."[29]The film featured McDormand,William Forsythe,Sam McMurray,Randall "Tex" Cobband marked the first of many collaborations between the Coens andJohn Goodman.[30]
Miller's Crossing(1990) is agangster filminspired byDashiell Hammett'sRed Harvest(1929) andThe Glass Key(1931). It starsGabriel Byrneas Irish mobster Tom Reagan and featuresAlbert Finney,Marcia Gay Harden,Steve Buscemi,Jon PolitoandJohn Turturro. The film was released almost simultaneously withGoodfellasand was not a commercial success, but received positive reviews.Christopher Orrcalls it "a distillation of all the tropes and themes and moods of the classic gangster film."  It was the Coens' first collaboration with production designerDennis Gassner.[31]
They followed it withBarton Fink(1991); set in 1941, it follows a New York playwright, the eponymous Fink (Turturro), who moves toLos Angelesto write aB-picturefor a venal movie mogul (Michael Lerner). Fink is modeled on playwrightClifford Odets, and the character W.P. Mayhew (John Mahoney) is based onWilliam Faulkner.Barton Finkwas a critical success, earning Oscar nominations and winning Best Director, Best Actor andPalme d'Orat the1991 Cannes Film Festival.[32]It was their first film with cinematographerRoger Deakins, a key collaborator for the next 25 years.[33]
The Hudsucker Proxy(1994) is an homage to thescrewball comediesofFrank CapraandHoward Hawks. Co-written with Raimi, the film follows a mailroom clerk (Tim Robbins) who is promoted to president of the Hudsucker corporation by a cynical director (Paul Newman) in a scheme to devalue the company's stock; a fast-talking newspaperwoman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) tries to scoop the story. Critics praised the production design but criticized the tone. It was abox office bomb($30 million budget, $3 million gross in the US).[34]
The brothers bounced back with the "homespun murder story"Fargo(1996), set in their home state ofMinnesota. In it, car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), who has serious financial problems, has his wife kidnapped so that his wealthy father-in-law (Harve Presnell) will pay the ransom, which he plans to split with the kidnappers (Buscemi andPeter Stormare). Complications ensue, and local copMarge Gunderson(McDormand) starts to investigate. Produced on a small budget of $7 million,Fargowas a critical and commercial success, with particular praise for its dialogue and McDormand's performance. The film received several awards, including aBAFTAaward andCannesaward for direction, and twoOscars: aBest Original Screenplayand aBest Actress Oscarfor McDormand.[35][36]Roger Ebertwrote that "it rotates its story through satire, comedy, suspense, and violence, until it emerges as one of the best films I've ever seen. To watch it is to experience steadily mounting delight, as you realize the filmmakers have taken enormous risks, gotten away with them, and have made a movie that is completely original, and as familiar as an old shoe – or a rubber-soled hunting boot from Land's End, more likely."[37]
The Big Lebowski(1998) is acrime comedyabout Jeff "The Dude" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), a Los Angeles slacker who is involved in a kidnapping case after being mistaken for a millionaire of the same name (David Huddleston.)[38]It featuresPhilip Seymour Hoffmanas Lebowski's flunky, Goodman and Buscemi as The Dude'sbowlingbuddies andJulianne Mooreas his "special lady friend". It was influenced byRaymond Chandler'sThe Big Sleep(1939) andRobert Altman'sThe Long Goodbye.[39]It has become acult classic.[40]An annual festival,Lebowski Fest, began in 2002, and many adhere to the philosophy of "Dudeism".[41]Entertainment Weeklyranked it 8th on their Funniest Movies of the Past 25 Years list in 2008.[42]It was the first collaboration between the Coens andT Bone Burnett, credited as "Music Archivist".[39]
The Coen brothers' next film,O Brother, Where Art Thou?(2000), was another critical and commercial success. The title was borrowed from thePreston SturgesfilmSullivan's Travels(1941), whose lead character, movie director John Sullivan, had planned to make a film with that title.[43]Based loosely onHomer'sOdyssey(complete with aCyclops,sirens,et al.), the story is set inMississippiin the 1930s and follows a trio of escaped convicts who, after absconding from achain gang, journey home to recover bank-heist loot the leader has buried—but they have no clear perception of where they are going. The film highlighted the comic abilities ofGeorge Clooneyas the oddball lead character Ulysses Everett McGill, and ofTim Blake NelsonandJohn Turturro, his sidekicks. The film'sbluegrassand old-time soundtrack, offbeat humor anddigitally desaturatedcinematography made it a critical and commercial hit.[44][45]It was the first feature film to use all-digital color grading.[46]Thefilm's soundtrack CDwas also successful, spawning a concert and concert/documentary DVD,Down from the Mountain.
The Coens next produced anothernoirishthriller,The Man Who Wasn't There(2001).
The Coens directed the 2003 filmIntolerable Cruelty, starring George Clooney andCatherine Zeta-Jones, a throwback to the romantic comedies of the 1940s. It focuses on hotshot divorce lawyer Miles Massey and a beautiful divorcée whom Massey managed to prevent from receiving any money in her divorce. She vows to get even with him while, at the same time, he becomes smitten with her.Intolerable Crueltyreceived generally positive reviews, although it is considered one of the duo's weaker films.[47]Also that year, they executive produced and did an uncredited rewrite of the Christmas black comedyBad Santa, which garnered positive reviews.[48]
In 2004, the Coens madeThe Ladykillers, a remake of theBritish classicbyEaling Studios.[49]A professor, played byTom Hanks, assembles a team to rob a casino. They rent a room in an elderly woman's home to plan the heist. When the woman discovers the plot, the gang decides to murder her to ensure her silence. The Coens received some of the most lukewarm reviews of their careers in response to this film.[50][51]
They directed two short films for two separateanthology films—Paris, je t'aime(Tuileries, 2006) starringSteve Buscemi,[52]andTo Each His Own Cinema(World Cinema, 2007) starringJosh Brolin.[53]Both films received highly positive reviews.[54][55]
No Country for Old Men, released in November 2007, closely followsthe 2005 novel of the same namebyCormac McCarthy. Vietnam veteran Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), living near the Texas/Mexico border, stumbles upon, and decides to take, two million dollars in drug money. He must then go on the run to avoid those trying to recover the money, includingsociopathickillerAnton Chigurh(Javier Bardem), who confounds both Llewelyn and local sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). The plotline is a return to noir themes, but in some respects it was a departure for the Coens; with the exception ofStephen Root, none of the stable of regular actors appears in the film.No Countryreceived nearly universal critical praise, garnering a 94% "Fresh" rating atRotten Tomatoes.[56]It won four Academy Awards, includingBest Picture,Best DirectorandBest Adapted Screenplay, all of which were received by the Coens, as well asBest Supporting Actorreceived by Bardem. The Coens, as "Roderick Jaynes", were also nominated forBest Editing, but lost.

Hunter was born in New York to Greek parents, and was raised in England.[7][8]She trained atRADA, where she is now an associate and regularly directs student productions, and studied clowning withPhilippe Gaulier.[9]

She has worked with renowned companies in that field includingShared ExperienceandComplicité.[11]She won anOlivier Awardin 1991 for playing the millionairess inFriedrich Dürrenmatt'sThe Visit.[12]
Critics have noted Hunter's unusual physical presence and her range.Charles SpencerofThe Telegraphwrote, "diminutive in stature, and slightly lame, she has a deep, guttural voice, eyes like black olives and the most expressive of faces. Almost nothing seems beyond her range, from farcical clowning to deepest, darkest tragedy."[13]
Hunter's "uncommon ability to shape-shift"[14]has led her to play roles typically reserved for male actors. She was the first British woman to playKing Learprofessionally.[15][16]
Hunter's portrayal of Lear conscientiously challenged the audience to separate character and performer: her voice and clothing read as male, but she physicalized lines such as "Down from the waist they are Centaurs/Though women all above" to remind the audience of the female body playing the part.[17]Another male role she played was inThe Bee, directed byHideki Noda, which played at theSoho Theatrein June 2006 and 2012.[18]
Hunter has also played animals and other creatures.

In November 2013, she co-starred as the fairyPuckinJulie Taymor's production ofA Midsummer Night's Dream,the show that opened theTheatre for a New AudienceinBrooklyn.[21]Ben BrantleyofThe New York Timesdescribed Hunter's Puck as "genuinely original" and "part music-hall comedian, part fairground contortionist."[22]
In 2008, Hunter co-starred in the first[citation needed]English-language production ofFragments, a collection of short plays bySamuel Beckett, directed byPeter Brook.[23]Of the London run at the Young Vic, Andrew Dickson ofThe Guardianwrote, "the evening belongs to Kathryn Hunter, who crams into a few minutes of stage time more than most actors achieve in a career."[24]The piece toured internationally, appearing in New York in 2011.[23]
Hunter was made an Artistic Associate at theRoyal Shakespeare Company(RSC) in 2008.[25][26]
From January to March 2009, she debuted as an RSCdirectorwith a production ofOthelloat theWarwick Arts Centre,Hackney Empire,Northern Stage,Oxford PlayhouseandLiverpool Playhouse.[27]Her husband Marcello Magni was movement director on the production and appeared in it as Roderigo. Other cast members includedMichael Gouldas Iago,Patrice Naiambanaas Othello, andNatalia Tenaas Desdemona.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
