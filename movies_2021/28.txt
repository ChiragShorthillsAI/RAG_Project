A Quiet Place Part IIis a 2020 Americanpost-apocalyptichorror filmwritten, directed and co-produced byJohn Krasinski. It is the sequel to the 2018 filmA Quiet Place, following the family from the first film as they continue to navigate and survive in a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by blind aliens with an acute sense of hearing.Emily Blunt,Millicent Simmonds,Noah Jupe, and Krasinski reprise their roles from the first film, whileCillian MurphyandDjimon Hounsoujoin the cast.
Paramount Pictures began the development of a sequel in April 2018, following the box-office success of the first film. By the following August, Krasinski was working on the screenplay, and in February 2019, he was confirmed as returning to direct. Krasinski's starting idea for the film was making Simmonds the lead, as he considered her character the conduit for the themes from the first film that he wanted to expand on in the sequel. Production took place inWestern New Yorkfrom June to September 2019. Krasinski was credited with writing the sequel, based on characters created byScott Beck and Bryan Woods. The sequel was produced on a budget of around$55–61 million, over three times the original's$17 million.
The film had its world premiere inNew York Cityon March 8, 2020; after over a year ofpostponementsdue to theCOVID-19 pandemic, it was theatrically released in the United States onMay 28, 2021. It became available to stream onParamount+45 days after its theatrical debut. The film set several box office records, including the biggest opening weekend during the course of the pandemic, and grossed $297.4million worldwide. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the story and the addition of Murphy's character Emmett. The film was followed by thespin-offprequelA Quiet Place: Day One(2024). A third film is in development.
During aLittle League Baseballgame in the small town ofMillbrook, New York, the Abbott family – wife Evelyn, husband Lee, deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau – and other spectators witness a strangemeteor-like object hurtle toward theEarth. Shortly after, the hostileextraterrestrialcreatures dubbedDeath Angelsemerge from the meteor and begin slaughtering the townspeople. The blind creatures possess armored skin and extraordinary speed and strength, and track victims with hypersensitive hearing, attacking anything that makes even the slightest noise.
Over a year later, the Angels have killed much of the Earth's population, including Lee and Beau.[a]Regan has discovered thathigh-frequencyaudio feedback makes them vulnerable, and devises a makeshift method of transmitting the noise from hercochlear implantthrough a portablemicrophone. With their home destroyed, the family search for other survivors. Entering a fenced-off area, Evelyn accidentally sets off a sound alarm, alerting the Angels. As they flee, Marcus steps into abear trap, attracting an Angel with his screams. Regan and Evelyn kill the Angel, free Marcus, and run into an abandoned steelfoundry.
An old friend, Emmett, takes them to hissoundproofunderground hideout. Emmett, who has recently lost his family and developed a cynical outlook on life, refuses to help further. Marcus hears the song "Beyond the Sea" playing on the radio, and Emmett says the song has aired continuously for four months. Regan determines it is a hint that survivors have taken refuge on theNorwalk Islands, a day's travel to the southeast. She theorizes that if she can reach the island's radio tower the hearing aid's high-frequency noise can be broadcast so other survivors can weaponize the signal. She ventures out alone to find the island but is attacked; Emmett saves her from an Angel. Regan persuades him to help complete her mission. Evelyn leaves her newborn baby with Marcus at the foundry to fetch medical supplies in town. Marcus discovers the corpse of Emmett's wife. Startled, he alerts an Angel and, in trying to flee, accidentally locks himself and the baby inside anair-tightcompartment.
Emmett and Regan arrive at a marina to board a boat to the island. They are attacked by madbandits, and Emmett deliberately attracts Angels that slaughter the attackers. When one Angel drowns, he realizes that the creatures cannot swim. The two row to the island where a small colony of survivors are living normally. The colony leader reveals that when theU.S. governmentdiscovered the Angels were unable to swim, theU.S. National Guardattempted to move people to the islands. However, the chaos from boarding created noise that attracted the Angels, leaving only two boats of the original twelve that made it to the island.
Evelyn returns to the foundry and frees her children before theysuffocate. The three hide inside the bunker as the Angel prowls the foundry. At the island the next day, an Angel that's drifted to the island attacks the colonists and kills the colony leader. At the radio station, Regan transmits the high frequency via the station's signal and plays it over the station's speakers, incapacitating the Angel, and then killing it with a metal conduit.
At the foundry, Marcus picks up Regan's transmission and plays the high-pitched frequency through his portable radio before shooting the Angel dead. Regan leaves the hearing aid connected to the radio station's microphone, allowing the broadcast signal to be weaponized by others.
A Quiet Place Part IIwas produced underParamount Pictureswith a budget of$61 million.[5]It was written and directed byJohn Krasinski, who also produced the film alongsideMichael Bay,Andrew Form, andBrad Fuller.[1]
Paramount produced the first film,A Quiet Place, on a budget of$17 million.[9]The studio released the film in the United States and Canada in April 2018, where it grossed$50.2 millionon opening weekend, well above a mid-$20 million forecast. Later in April, Paramount Chair and CEOJim Gianopulosannounced that a sequel was in development. The first film totaled $188 million in the US and Canada and $340.9 million worldwide.[10]John Krasinski, who co-wrote, directed and starred in the first film, said he considered it "as a one-off".[11]Uncertain of finding similar success in a sequel, he initially told Paramount to seek another writer and director.[11]The first film's screenwritersScott Beck and Bryan Woodsdid not return for the sequel. Woods said they were not interested in a franchise approach, and that they would rather try "to create original ideas" and use their writing credits "as an opportunity to push several projects."[12]Beck said, "Instead of focusing on sequels per se, it's about investing back into the ecosystem of original ideas in a massive marketplace."[13]
Three months afterA Quiet Place's release, Krasinski decided to brainstorm ideas for a sequel.[14]According to Krasinski, Paramount rejected pitches from other writers and directors that were considered too franchise-oriented.[15]He said, "I had this small idea, which was to make Millie [Simmonds] the lead of the movie... her character opens the door to all the themes I was dealing with in the first movie."[14]The studio invited him to write a script based on his idea.[15]By August 2018, Krasinski was writing the film.[16]He wrote a draft in three and a half weeks.[17]
In the following February, he was confirmed to direct the sequel, and actorsEmily Blunt,Millicent Simmonds, andNoah Jupewere set to reprise their roles.[18]In March,Cillian Murphyjoined the cast.[19]Murphy described his character as such, "For me, Emmett represents where the heart of the world lies right now, which is: finally feeling like they've all given up. Here comes this girl [Regan] who allows you to believe in more, and allows you to believe in yourself. That idea, I've always been really enthralled by."[20]In the following June,Brian Tyree Henrywas also added,[21]but later left the film due to scheduling problems. He was replaced byDjimon Hounsouin August.[22]
Krasinski said he wrote himself into the sequel because the first film "was such a personal experience" and his "love letter" to his children. He said, "It was really important for me to continue the metaphor and we actually start dealing with how this all started."[23]Simmonds, who is deaf in real life, described her character's evolution after the first film, "She has a lot of pressure to become an adult very quickly." Simmonds has a more prominent role in the sequel, and according toSyfy Wire,deafnessandAmerican Sign Language"are inherently linked to the heroism of its heroine." Simmonds worked with an ASL coach to make sure her signing and articulation were clean. She said she felt "a sense of pressure" being in a position to represent the deaf and hard of hearing.[24]
In June 2019, production began on the sequel.[25]Filming officially commenced onJuly 15.[26]There were 47 days of filming throughoutWestern New York, includingAkron,Olcott,Dunkirk,Lackawanna, andBuffalo.[27]Other locations includedErie Countyand the city ofNorth Tonawanda,[28]and Barcelona Harbor in the town ofWestfieldinChautauqua County.[29]Filming also took place on a giantsound stageat Buffalo FilmWorks inSouth Buffalo.[30]An abandonedBethlehem Steelplant in Lackawanna was used as a filming location. One of the last filming locations, the northboundSouth Grand Island Bridge, was shut down for 13 hours for filming.[31]
In addition to Western New York, filming took place in theHudson Valley, specifically the towns ofDover,Pawling, andNew Paltz.[32]In New Paltz, theWallkill Valley Rail Trailwas revisited to film on a bridge that was featured in the first film.[33]The production invested over $10 million inUpstate New York, created 400 hires, and involved 300 background actors.[34]By late September, production was finished.[35]
Polly Morganwas the cinematographer forA Quiet Place Part II, replacingCharlotte Bruus Christensenfrom the first film. Morgan continued the first film's use of35 mm filmand described its effect, "AlthoughA Quiet Place 2is a horror, it looks pretty and engaging, with a nostalgic look that you would find hard to achieve digitally." The film's "extensive dark situations" (night scenes and stage work that comprised 75% of screen time) were shot withKodak Vision3 500T 5219film stock, while Vision3 250D 5207 was used mainly for day exteriors. Morgan filmed withPanavisionPanaflex Millennium XL2 cameras and T-Seriesanamorphic lenses, which had been adjusted to match the C-Series lenses Christensen used on the first film. One of Morgan's most challenging situations was lighting and shooting the furnace setting.[36]
The sequel's cinematography also evolved from its predecessor in following more action. Morgan described director Krasinski's intent, "John wanted to always keep the camera moving and create long 'oners' to play with rhythm and tension and to show how normal life can suddenly become very different and dangerous—all in the same shot." Morgan used an array of tracking vehicles, on which there were different camera mounts includingjibs, cranes, andSteadicamvests, with the vehicles often going full speed.[36]
For the sequel's sound design, supervising sound editorsErik AadahlandEthan Van der Rynandre-recording mixerBrandon Proctor returned for the film. Krasinski instructed them to try to "follow the rules" set up in the first film and said of the experience, "What we found was by doing that, and not trying to be cool, we ended up uncovering way more stuff than we ever would've been able to [otherwise]."[37]
In an interview withHeadliner Magazine, Ethan Van der Ryn and Erik Aadahl shared how sound (and silence) was a central character in the film: "We started hearing stories after the first film that people were afraid to eat their popcorn in the theatre! That was thrilling for us to hear because it's like, 'Okay, this experiment that we tried actually works'! We were able to literally make the audience hold their breath."[38]
When Paramount Pictures planned to commercially releaseA Quiet Place Part IIin March 2020, the studio released a 30-second teaser trailer before select theatrical screenings ofBlack Christmas, which was released on December 13, 2019. Less than a week later, the teaser trailer became available online. A full trailer was released on January 1, 2020.[39]During pre-game coverage before theSuper Bowlon February 2, 2020, Paramount released a 30-second TV spot,[40]which revealed that Krasinski had reprised his role in a newly filmed flashback sequence.[41]
In early March, Paramount initiated "survival room" experiences in New York and Los Angeles in which groups of visitors could try to overcome "physical and mental obstacles" without making too much noise.[42]The setups cost less than a million dollars for Paramount. A marketing executive anticipated between seven thousand and eight thousand people to go through the experience and for fans andsocial media influencersto engage inexperiential marketing.[43]Emily Bluntappeared onJimmy Kimmel Live!on March 10 to promote the film. She appeared in a parody commercial advertisingA Quiet Plane, starring as a stewardess that enforces silence as a top priority to a plane's passengers.[44]Before the film's postponement (see below), Paramount planned to host adouble-featureevent on March 18, 2020, that would have screened the first and second films and given collector's prints to attendees.[45]
Following the postponement ofA Quiet Place Part IIand other films during the start of theCOVID-19 pandemic,teleconferencing became popular, and Paramount's marketing team started providing virtual backgrounds ofA Quiet Place Part IIand other films to be available onZoom Video Communications.[46]
For the film's eventual May 2021 release date, Paramount released a final trailer several weeks in advance.[47]The A.V. Club's William Hughes wrote that the new trailer was a retread of previous trailers with the most noteworthy element being its message that the film was the "experience that theaters are made for", encouraging increasingly-vaccinated moviegoers during the pandemic to go to movie theaters.[48]
A Quiet Place Part IIhad its world premiere at theLincoln CenterinNew York CityonMarch 8, 2020.[49]Paramount Pictures released the film in theaters onMay 28, 2021 after a year's worth of delays due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.The New York Timesdescribed it as "one of the first major films to receive an exclusive theatrical release from a Hollywood studio in the not-quite-post-coronavirus era."[17]The studio released the film onParamount+45 days after its theatrical release.[50]
Originally set for May 15, 2020 and March 20, 2020, as the pandemic case numbers had begun to rise in mid March, Paramount postponed it toSeptember 4, 2020.[51][52]Without a streaming service from 2020 to early 2021, Paramount auctioned off multiple upcoming feature films but decided to keepA Quiet Place Part II.[53]The studio eventually changed the date toApril 23, 2021,[54]then, September 17, 2021[55]before moving it to May 28, 2021.[56]
The studio initially planned to release the film in theaters globally starting onMarch 18, 2020, before it delayed the film due to the pandemic.[57]Paramount had already spent around 60% of its budget for global prints and advertising, andDeadline Hollywoodwrote that the film's delay was "truly a shocker" because the P&A expenses seemed to indicate that rescheduling was not an option. The studio films slated for the previous weekend, March 13, were the last to be released before mass theater closures.[58][59]Director John Krasinski said he wanted moviegoers to see the film together and that with the pandemic, it was not the right time to provide that experience.[57]CNBCwrote that in particular, the film andIn the Heightswere considered films best experienced with a crowd.[60]
The film was initially to be released in the United Kingdom and Australia onMarch 19, 2020,[61]and in the United States and Canada, includingDolby CinemaandIMAX, onMarch 20, 2020.[39]Paramount initially stated on March 6 that it would not reschedule the film in response to the pandemic,[62]but on March 12, the studio pulled the film from release worldwide with the intent of scheduling it later in the year.[57]In April 2020, it announced the release date ofSeptember 4, 2020.[52]The September release date would have been the start of the US holidayLabor Day Weekend.Deadline Hollywoodwrote at the time that the weekend is "summer [box office's] finale", and "typically the deadest period ever for moviegoing", but that the studio anticipated pent-up demand after pandemic fears subside.[63]
In July 2020, Paramount changed the film's release date fromSeptember 4, 2020 toApril 23, 2021. At the time of the announcement, movie theaters in the United States and Canada had been closed for nearly four months, and the pandemic was continuingto spread across the United States. The second postponement followed other studios' decisions at the time to indefinitely delay the Warner Bros. filmTenetand the Disney filmMulan.Varietyreported, "While those films had been long positioned to help revive moviegoing, sources say that Paramount did not wantA Quiet Place Part 2to stay on Labor Day weekend and have the pressure of being the first new movie out of the gate during the pandemic."[54]
In January 2021, Paramount postponed the film's release fromApril 23, 2021 toSeptember 17, 2021. At the time of postponement, COVID-19 infections had surged in the United States in recent months.Varietywrote of the circumstances in the United States and Canada, "Around 65% of movie theaters remain closed, and cinemas that have stayed open have struggled to sell tickets." The postponement followed other studios' postponing of their filmsNo Time to Die,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,Morbius,Cinderella, andThe King's Man.[64]On the September 2021 date at the time,A Quiet Place Part IIwould have been scheduled to open againstDeath on the Nile,The Boss Baby: Family Business, andThe Man from Toronto,[65]all three of which later had their own dates shifted.
In February 2021, Paramount announced thatA Quiet Place Part IIwould become available on its streaming serviceParamount+45 days after its theatrical release.Deadline Hollywoodreported that it was "a clear sign that Paramount is committed to theatrical, but still open to the future of streaming."[50]Before the COVID-19 pandemic, movie theater operators sought for films to be theatrically released for 90 days before being released onhome media. As a result of the pandemic, Warner Bros. opted to release their 2021 slate of films onHBO Maxthe same day as in theaters, andUniversal Picturesmade its films available viavideo-on-demand17 days after their theatrical releases.Varietyreported, "Paramount's strategy may be received the most favorably among film exhibitors", withA Quiet Place Part IIamong Paramount's tentpole films having the 45-day frame and its other titles having a 30-day frame.[66]Boxoffice Proreported that the original film grossed 94% of its total of $188 million in the United States and Canada by its 45th day, which indicated that Paramount's "decision works more in favor of exhibitors than against."[67]
On March 4, 2021, director John Krasinski announced that the release date would be moved to May 28, 2021, which is the start of theMemorial Dayholiday weekend in the United States.Boxoffice Prowrote, "This marks the first time post-pandemic that a theatrically exclusive major studio tentpole has moved a planned releaseupby this many months rather thanback."[68]The publication also wrote that the film would be "the first live-action tentpole exclusively in theaters" sinceTenetwas released in August 2020.[69]
Earlier in the day of Krasinski's announcement, Universal Pictures had postponed the action filmF9from late May 2021 to June 25, 2021. In the move-up process, Paramount postponed another of its films,Infinite, from the May 28 release date.[70]Deadline Hollywoodreported that Paramount was encouraged to releaseA Quiet Place Part IIearlier due to theaters reopening in New York City starting the weekend of March 5, 2021 and with plans for theaters in Los Angeles to also reopen in the near future.[56]
As a result of Paramount shortening the theatrical run from 90 days to 45, John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, and producers including Michael Bay whose compensation depends on box-office receipts, requested for the studio to compensate them for the shorter run.[71]
For its theatrical release on May 28, 2021,A Quiet Place Part IIwas released in3,752 theatersin the United States and Canada.[72]
The film was also released in 12 other markets on its opening weekend, including China as a last-minute addition.[73]

BeforeA Quiet Place Part IIwas postponed from late March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic,Boxoffice Propredicted the film would gross$72 millionon its opening weekend, based on the first film's opening weekend ($50.2 million) and the continued involvement of Emily Blunt and John Krasinski; but noted that the film would face competition from other titles such asMulan.[75][62]In February, early industry tracking had the film debuting to around $55–60 million.[76][77]Deadline Hollywood's Anthony D'Alessandro wrote, "A Quiet Place Part IIis currently strong with females under 25, African Americans and Hispanic demos, but overall I hear it's strong with all quads."[76]
For its 2021 theatrical release,Boxoffice Proforecast that the film would gross between $30 million and $50 million on its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, with a total gross between $75 million and $125 million.[69]IndieWirewrote, "It has a core male audience that skews younger with minority moviegoers, along with strong interest and critical support", and predicted between $40 million and $50 million.[72]According toFandango, US advance ticket sales were double the sales from the planned March 2020 release and also more than the sales for the first film in 2018.[78]The film made $19.3 million on its first day, including $4.8 million from Thursday night previews, topping the $4.3 million preview figure of the first film; both grosses were the highest of the pandemic. It went on to debut to $48.3 million in its three-day opening weekend and a total of $58.5 million over the four day Memorial Day frame, topping the box office and marking the biggest opening weekend sinceSonic the Hedgehogin February 2020.[79]In its sophomore weekend the film grossed $19.5 million, finishing second, behindThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.[80]The film crossed the $100 million domestic mark on June 11, becoming the first film of the pandemic era to do so. In its third weekend the film regained the top spot, upsetting newcomerIn the Heightswith $12 million.[81]
A Quiet Place Part IIreceived mostly positive reviews from film critics.[82][83]Screen Rantwrote that critics liked the film and praised its "two-pronged story" and the introduction of Cillian Murphy's character.[84]The Independentwrote that critics were divided.[85]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 91% of 361 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "A nerve-wracking continuation of its predecessor,A Quiet Place Part IIexpands the terrifying world of the franchise without losing track of its heart."[86]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 71 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[87]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, an improvement from the first film's B+ score.PostTrakreported 83% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend it.[79]
Peter BradshawofThe Guardiangave the film 4 stars out of 5, stating, "This sequel from writer-directorJohn Krasinskimay not quite have all its focus and intimate horror, while the borrowings fromAlien,Jurassic ParkandJawsare admittedly more obvious this time around. But it's a really effective and engrossing followup, with an absolutely sensational "prelude" sequence at the top of the movie, a barnstorming shocker equal to anything inAQP1." He also praised the performances ofMillicent SimmondsandCillian Murphy, stating that "Simmonds is an excellent performer: bold, confident and forthright, holding her own opposite the alpha-emoting presence of Murphy."[88]Jeannette Catsoulis ofThe New York Timesgave the film a positive review, stating, "...while this new installment is, like its predecessor, wonderfully acted and intuitively directed (byJohn Krasinski, who is solely responsible for the story this time around), it has also largely replaced the hushed horror of the original with full-on action. Faster, coarser and far noisier,Part IIsacrifices emotional depth for thriller setups that do less to advance the plot than grow the younger characters", and, "Though in many respects an exemplary piece of filmmaking,Part IIremains hobbled by a script that resolves two separate crises while leaving the movie itself in limbo."[89]Justin Chang ofNPRsaid that "A Quiet Place Part II[is] an unexpectedly resonant film for the present moment as this country slowly emerges from a crisis that—while surely less terrifying than an alien apocalypse—has revealed humanity at its best and its worst", and praised Krasinski's direction, saying, "Not being able to fall back on verbal exposition has forced Krasinski to become a ruthlessly efficient visual storyteller. It's often said thatAlfred Hitchcock's movies are so sharply directed, you could turn the sound off and still follow the action—a truth that applies to these movies as well."[90]
Bloody Disgustingrated the film 3.5/5 and called it "a satisfying, worthwhile sequel".[91]The A.V. Clubgave it a B− and remarked that it was "a part two in the classic, traditional sense, echoing without quite amplifying the pleasures of its predecessor."[92]io9declared that the film was "a quintessential great sequel."[93]Nick Allen ofRogerEbert.comgave the film three out of four stars, criticizing Krasinski for not taking risks but praising its "incredibly robust and kinetic" action scenes.[94]
The series was given the Seal of Authentic Representation from theRuderman Family Foundationfor the portrayal of Regan Abbott by Millicent Simmonds, as an actor with a disability and at least five lines of dialogue.[102]John Krasinski was given an Excellence in Directing prize by The Media Access Awards for a commitment to disability inclusion on the film.[103]
In May 2021, Blunt revealed that Krasinski had plans for a third film. Acknowledging that he had wanted to see how the second installment was received before moving forward on the next film, she stated it is intended to be a trilogy.[104]In July 2021, Blunt confirmed that Krasinski is working on a third installment, separate from the spin-off film, with intentions to once again serve as director.[105]In February 2022,A Quiet Place Part IIIwas officially announced with a scheduled release date in 2025.[106]However, in February 2024, the film no longer had a set release date.[107]

When open casting for the film began, her former drama teacher shared the news with her, and she auditioned for a role in the film.[2]She competed with over 250 others. When she won the role, she moved toNew York Citywith her mother and her younger siblings to filmWonderstruck. She used American Sign Language interpreters to communicate on set and also received a tutor to continue schoolwork while filming.[2]Vanity Fair's Charles Bramesco said of her casting, "A Utah native without any major film credits to her name, young Simmonds is expected to make quite a splash both as a new face in the industry as well as an icon for deaf and otherwise sensory-disabled actors."[10]WhenWonderstruckpremiered at the2017 Cannes Film Festival, theAssociated Press's Jake Coyle said Simmonds's screen debut was "hailed as a breakthrough".[11]Simmonds was subsequently nominated for several awards for best youth performance (seeaccolades). The Associated Press also recognized Simmonds as one of eight actors who were Breakthrough Entertainers of 2017.[12]
In 2018, Simmonds starred in the horror filmA Quiet Placeas the deaf daughter of a hearing couple, played byJohn KrasinskiandEmily Blunt. While the producers did not specifically plan to cast a deaf actress to play the deaf daughter, Krasinski, who was also the director, pushed to have a deaf actress.[13]Simmonds and her family answered Krasinski's questions for writing a screenplay about a family with a deaf child.[14]The filmmakers hired an ASL interpreter for Simmonds, so that signed and spoken language could be interpreted fluently on set.[15]Simmonds helped teach her fellow actors to sign.[16]
In 2018, Simmonds appeared in a two-episode arc in the third season of theDisney Channeltelevision seriesAndi Mack. She had first appeared as an extra in the first season, and the series creators invited her back for a recurring role.

Simmonds said of the spoken dialogue, "I can't even remember how it was brought up or who had the idea, but I remember my mom asking me how I felt about it, and I told her I thought I could try. I was actually pretty nervous about it. I don't use my voice a lot in public."[18]
In the following year, Simmonds appeared in an episode of the second season ofThis Close.[19]In October, Simmonds was cast in a lead role in the pilot for the TV seriesClose UponFreeform,[20]and production took place later in the year inVancouver. By May 2020, Freeform passed on the pilot.[21]

She also contrasted the repetitive nature of stage performances with the varying day-to-day scenes in film and TV.[9]Entertainment Weekly's Emlyn Travis wrote, "Simmonds, who is deaf, performs the tunes in American Sign Language alongside her costars, who... also sign with and interpret for her character throughout the performance in an excellent display of representation and accessibility on stage."[29]Grey Houseclosed on July 30, 2023 due to low ticket sales.[30]

With deaf characters historically played by hearing actors, or sign language obscured by the editing process, Simmonds said in 2021 that she considers her filmsWonderstruck,A Quiet Place, andA Quiet Place Part IIas "a corrective" to that history.[6]In 2022, Simmonds partnered with Cut + Clarity to create the "Millie ASL Mama" necklace, which features the ASL sign for "mother", to benefit the Deaf Mentor Program at Ski-Hi Institute.[40]In a 2023 interview, she advised young deaf individuals aspiring to enter the entertainment industry to advocate for themselves and clearly communicate their needs.[9]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
