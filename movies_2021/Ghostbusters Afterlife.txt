Set 32 years after the events ofGhostbusters II, it follows a single mother and her children who move to anOklahomafarm they inherited from her estranged fatherEgon Spengler, a member of the original Ghostbusters.
A thirdGhostbustersfilm was in development since the release ofGhostbusters II, but production stalled because Murray refused to return to the series. AfterHarold Ramisdied on February 24, 2014,Sony Picturesproduceda female-driven rebootthat was released in 2016. In January 2019, it was announced that Jason Reitman would direct a sequel to the original films, with the new cast being announced by July, while the original cast signed on two months later.Principal photographytook place from July to October of the same year.Rob Simonsen, a frequent collaborator of Jason, was hired to compose the film's score. This was the final film to be produced by and involve the franchise's co-creator and Jason's fatherIvan Reitmanbefore his death in February 2022.
After being delayed four times from an original July 2020 date due to theCOVID-19 pandemic,Ghostbusters: Afterlifewas screened unannounced duringCinemaConinLas Vegason August 23, 2021, and was released in the United States on November 19 byColumbia Pictures(viaSony Pictures Releasing). The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the cast's performances, Reitman's direction, the film's nostalgic tone, and its respectful tribute to Ramis. It grossed $204.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $75 million, and was followed byGhostbusters: Frozen Empirein 2024.
In Summerville,Oklahoma,Egon Spenglercaptures an entity in occultistIvo Shandor's mine outside the town and lures another to his farm. He activates an elaborate setup on his property, but the power fails. Egon manages to conceal theghost trapin his home before being attacked by the entity and suffering a fatal heart attack, and the entity returns to the mine.
Egon's estranged, financially struggling daughter Callie inherits the farm and moves there with her children, Trevor and Phoebe, after being evicted from theirChicagoapartment. Trevor becomes infatuated withcarhopLucky Domingo, and the scientifically minded Phoebe enrolls in a summer science class taught byseismologistGary Grooberson, whom Callie later dates.
Phoebe discovers the farmhouse is haunted, and thepoltergeistresiding in it leads her to the ghost trap, which she shows to Gary and her new friend, "Podcast". Gary, a fan of the Ghostbusters, helps her learn more about them and her grandfather. He, Phoebe, and Podcast tamper with the trap, releasing Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer the Gozerian, which escapes to the mine. The farm ghost leads Phoebe to Egon's underground laboratory and, after revealing himself as her grandfather, guides her in restoring the Ghostbusters' equipment.
While testing theproton packwith Podcast, Phoebe finds a ghost they call "Muncher" that haunts Shandor's foundry and flees to the town. Having repaired the Ghostbusters' CadillacEcto-1's engine (with Egon's help), Trevor uses the car to chase Muncher with the pair; they capture it but are arrested for the damage incurred, and their equipment is seized.
Using the Ghostbusters' telephone number that she had written down, Phoebe contactsRay Stantzfor help and informs him of Egon's death. In turn, Ray tells her what became of the Ghostbusters after they defeated Vigo the Carpathian:[b]The team had disbanded following a downturn in business, and Egon then stole all their equipment and moved to Summerville to pursue an unspecified threat. Shortly after, Gary is attacked and possessed by Vinz after returning the children home following a date with Callie. Egon's ghost leads Callie to a wall of detailed notes and pictures he kept of her life, showing he cared about her more than she thought, just before she becomes possessed by Zuul, Gatekeeper of Gozer.
Phoebe, Podcast, Lucky, and Trevor find a Gozerian temple within the mine. Exploring further, they discover the long-dead Shandor beginning to revive in his casket as automated proton cannons, installed by Egon, hinder Gozer's attempts to cross over. Vinz sabotages the cannons and performs a mating rite with Zuul, allowing Gozer to escape and take physical form. Shandor awakens and pledges his fealty to Gozer, but she immediately kills him.
The children discover Egon's "farm" is an array of ghost traps buried in a dirt field. As supernatural chaos rages through the town, they free Muncher and use him to recover the seized ghostbusting equipment and Ecto-1, then head to the mine. Phoebe distracts Gozer so Podcast can re-capture Zuul, freeing Callie and weakening Gozer's physical form. They lure Gozer and Vinz to the trap field, but it malfunctions, and she frees Zuul, who possesses Lucky and fully restores Gozer's power.
Ray and the other surviving original Ghostbusters,Peter VenkmanandWinston Zeddemore, arrive to help, and Gozer, having arranged Egon's death, seeks to complete her revenge against the quartet for vanquishing her.[c]Supported by Egon's now-manifested ghost, Phoebe uses his proton pack to battle Gozer. The Ghostbusters assist by crossing their packs' proton streams while Trevor uses his to charge the traps' power source, allowing Callie to activate them and capture Gozer, Vinz, and Zuul. Lucky and Gary are freed from their possessions, and Egon reconciles with his family and friends before passing on to the afterlife.
Later, the original Ghostbusters return to New York City, and Peter is revealed to be married toDana Barrett. Winston, having become a wealthy entrepreneur and family man since leaving the Ghostbusters, returns the fully restored Ecto-1 to the team'sold firehouse headquarters. In the basement, a light on their old ghost containment system begins to flash red.
The new film's cast was announced in July 2019, with the cast of the original film signing on two months later:
The film's cast also includesMarlon Kazadias Thickneck;[8]Sydney Mae Diaz as Swayze; and Aykroyd's youngest daughter Stella as Deputy Medjuck, a nod toJoe Medjuck, who was an associate producer onGhostbusters(1984), an executive producer on thesubsequent movies, and a co-founder of production companyGhost Corps.Harold Ramisposthumously appears asEgon Spenglerin archival clips and photographs taken fromGhostbusters(1984).[15]Bob Gunton(credited as "The Ghost Farmer") andIvan Reitmanalso portray living and ghostly versions of Egon, respectively, using prosthetics and digital makeup.[16][17][18]J. K. Simmonsplays Ivo Shandor, the leader of a Gozer-worshiping cult responsible for theSumerian godGozer's arrival inGhostbusters. Simmons took the role as a token of friendship with the Reitmans, with whom he frequently collaborates in films like Jason's 2007 filmJunoand the 2017 filmFather Figures, co-produced by Ivan.Olivia Wilde,[16]who portrayed Mesopotamian deityInannain Ramis's final filmYear One, physically portrays Gozer,Shohreh Aghdashlooprovides Gozer's voice, andEmma Portnerplays Gozer's CGI spirit form, previously portrayed by Slavitza Jovan andPaddi Edwardsin voice inGhostbusters(1984).Josh Gadwas one of many actors who contributed to the voice of Muncher, a metal-eating miner ghost conjured after as√©ancewent wrong at Summerville Foundry in the 1940s.[19][18]Ira Heiden(a friend of Jason Reitman's),Sarah Natochenny, andShelby Youngvoiced the Mini-Pufts, tiny versions and replicated forms of theStay Puft Marshmallow Man, but were not credited for their performances.[20][21]
In the early 1990s, following the release ofGhostbusters II,Dan Aykroydwrote a script for a third film tentatively titledGhostbusters III: Hellbent.[22]In the script, the Ghostbusters are transported to a parallel-universe version of Manhattan called Manhellton, where the people and places are "hellish" versions of Earth, and the characters meet and confront the Devil.[23][24]At the time, Aykroyd stated that Columbia Pictures was interested, though the principal actors, especially Bill Murray, were not. The Hellbent script's main characters are a new, younger group of Ghostbusters; Ray, Egon, and Winston struggle to keep the business going after Peter's relationship with Dana becomes serious.[24]Elements of this story were used inGhostbusters: The Video Game(2009), which Aykroyd considered to be "essentially the third movie".[25]At various stages of its development,Chris Farley,Chris Rock, andBen Stillerwere reported as potential stars of a newGhostbustersfilm.[26]
By 2004, Columbia had begun pursuing a sequel but Murray, who disliked sequels, was uninterested in the project.[27]The following year, Harold Ramis confirmed plans to introduce Stiller into the principal cast.[23][28]By 2009, the project had failed to progress,[22]but by January 2010,Ivan Reitman, director of the first twoGhostbustersfilms, confirmed he would direct a third one.[29][30]Also in March, Murray discussed development of the film and his mixed feelings about reprising his role.[31][32]A release was scheduled for Christmas 2012.[33]That October, Aykroyd commented on the screenplay written byGene StupnitskyandLee Eisenberg, stating that he was particularly impressed with the writing of Murray's character and the implementation of the new team with the original while he and Ramis worked on a second draft of the script.[34]
By August 2011, Aykroyd stated that filming was scheduled to begin later that year with a story focused on passing the Ghostbusters mantle to the younger actors.[35][36]When Murray decided against reprising his role, Aykroyd said another actor might replace him.[37]Aykroyd also said he wanted retired actorRick Moranisto return asLouis Tully.[38]By February 2012, the film was placed on hold as the production team re-evaluated the project. Without Murray, the studio searched for replacement actors and considered including his character as aCGI-rendered ghost.[39]In June, Murray again acknowledged all involved were attempting to develop the third film before dropping out of the film the following month.[40][41][42]In July, Aykroyd confirmed the film was back in development with a script re-write fromEtan Cohen.[43]Aykroyd said of the script: "It's got to be perfect. That's the whole thing. There's no point in doing it unless it's perfect. So that's what we're up to now."[43]By September, Reitman announced the developments of a remake.[44]In May 2013, Aykroyd discussed plot points including real experiments being done by college students atColumbia Universityas a source of inspiration. The plot would revolve around research being done by the university, which would bring about threats from other dimensions. A new team of Ghostbusters would form to save Earth's plane of existence from supernatural threats.[45]The script reportedly included Murray's character with hopes Murray would decide to join the production.[46]
Following the death of Harold Ramis on February 24, 2014,[47]Sony/Columbiastated that Ramis would appear in a cameo in the film. The film was delayed again to rework the script.[48]By March 2015, Reitman was no longer attached to direct the third film, but would remain as producer, with plans to begin principal photography by early 2015.[49]Weaver wanted her character's son to feature as a member of the team, and Reitman said he had already been included in the script.[50]
A new film connected to the original two films was revealed in January 2019. Ivan Reitman's sonJasonwas confirmed to direct from a script he co-wrote withGil Kenanwhile Ivan would serve as a producer.[51]The film would feature teenagers‚Äîtwo males and two females‚Äîas the recruits for theGhostbustersteam.[52]
Jason Reitman said the film ignores the events of 2016'sGhostbustersreboot, which was directed byPaul Feig.[53][citation needed]Reitman said he did not mean to snub the 2016 film and that he had "nothing but admiration" for Feig. Feig said Reitman had been a supporter of his film and that he "can't wait to see his take on theGhostbustersuniverse".[54]Reitman later said the idea of a teenage girl wanting to be a Ghostbuster had come to him, and with a positive reaction from Feig's film, proved the idea that anyone could be a Ghostbuster would work. Reitman also said theGhostbustersfranchisecould readily expand on this idea with all types of people becoming Ghostbusters, personally thanking Feig for making this possible.[55]Reitman considered, unlike the three priorGhostbustersfilms‚Äîall of which involve people going into the ghostbusting business‚Äîhe wanted to make this film about family first. With Kenan, Reitman created a script based around the Spengler family and the reason they are so disconnected.[56]According to Dan Aykroyd: "Jason Reitman wrote a beautiful, heartfelt script that takes the real DNA from the first two movies and transfers that directly to the third, the next generation. It hands the legacy off to a new generation of stars, players, actors, and characters."[57]Murray, who was also confirmed to be reprising Peter Venkman, was positive about the script.[58]Ramis's daughter Violet (whom Reitman befriended during the filming of the first film), gave her blessing after reading an early version of the screenplay, saying that the story "captures the spirit of what the old movies are". She occasionally visited the sets and was (at the insistence of Reitman and propmaster Guillaume DeLouche) photographed wearing her late father's proton pack prop from the first film while prop makers from The Hand Prop Room inLos Angeleswere building lighter replicas of it for Mckenna Grace to wear.[18]
With a script centered around family, Reitman felt it was appropriate to change the backdrop from New York City to the American West to give the film a new identity and a different color palette. The script was structured to slowly reveal the connection to the Egon Spengler character, which would bring in elements of earlierGhostbustersfilms. For example, the film sees Aykroyd's character return to running Ray's Occult Books, as seen inGhostbusters II, but only the events of the original film are directly referenced.[56][59]
The castings ofMckenna Graceas the young female protagonist,Finn Wolfhardas her brother, andCarrie Coonas their single mother were revealed in March 2019.[5][9]Reitman described Grace as an avid fan of the series and a perfect fit for his concept of a teenage female Ghostbuster.[55]Wolfhard, who had dressed as a Ghostbuster during the second season ofStranger Things, was unsure he would get the role, saying that "Jason Reitman is probably not even going to look at my tape" because of that.[60]Paul Ruddwas cast in the film in June, later confirming his role of Mr. Grooberson, the children's new teacher who knows of the Ghostbusters' legacy.[10][61][6]Rudd himself had worked with Harold Ramis in an uncredited role for his final filmYear One.
NewcomersCeleste O'Connorand Logan Kim were cast in July.[62]Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Annie Potts were confirmed to be reprising their roles from the first twoGhostbustersfilms.[63][12][57][58]Rick Moranis, who also appeared in the first twoGhostbustersfilms, did not return to reprise his role in the film.[64]
Reitman shot on location and relied onpractical effectas much as possible to maintain stylistic continuity with the original films. The Spengler farmhouse was a practical set built on a ridge that recalled thePsychohouse. An old barn was relocated and reconstructed piece-by-piece on location for the unveiling of Ecto-1. TwoEctomobileswere used during filming. While the vehicles were vintage 1959Cadillac Miller-Meteor Sentinels, modern performance engines and suspension upgrades were required to complete the stunt sequences which were filmed on real city streets.[65]
Reitman and the production crew reviewed the designs of the original film's ghosts and other supernatural creatures for use inAfterlife, observing the designs looked different from each other and were distinct.[56]The creature known as "Muncher", co-created by creature designer Brynn Metheney, is similar toSlimer; Reitman explained: "Something happened to Slimer over the years that people started thinking of him as the dalmatian of the firehouse. The original Slimer was an angry dude and very scary and we wanted to get back to that",[56]and Metheney wanted to make Muncher whom "the audience can latch on to" easily, giving him a universal appeal of him being "funny and cool and cute and weird in every way" like Slimer yet completely new and different from his green predecessor. Though the film did not reveal Muncher's origin, Metheney's character personality reveals that the ghost in life was a miner "conjured into existence by as√©ancegone wrong in the 1940s" at Summerville Foundry's supervisor's office and he has haunted the plant ever since then, "after terrorizing the group that contacted him". Her most ambitious design was the Mini-Pufts; she wanted to give them a realistic look on scale and texture of authentic marshmallows than the colossalStay Puft Marshmallow Man, even bought packages of them to make tiny marshmallow men for visual references and inspirations. For the scenes of Summerville Crossrip, Metheney created the "flaming phantasms" that chase a firetruck and pedestrians outside the Spinners Roller Hop and included the animated seriesThe Real Ghostbusters'popular three-eye ghost Bug-Eye in homage to the show. Other apparition concepts that did not make the final cut include a rancher ghost, Louise the crossing guard ghost of Summerville Middle School, possessed balloons and sandwiches, and more miner ghosts (Dynamite, Pick Axe, Lunchbox, Coats, and Shovel) after Muncher. Creature effects designer Arjen Tuiten, who is a fan of the first film's special effects artistSteve Johnson, personally created the "Old Miner Ghost" in resemblance to his idol's "Zombie Taxi Ghost" without Metheney's involvement.[18]
Egon's Aztec Death Whistle was designed by Landon Lott under Jason Reitman's instruction,[18]and despite the claim in the film that whistles like it is "designed to ward off evil spirits", their actual purpose remains unclear.[66]
Ramis's likeness was recreated with digital makeup created by Pier Lefebvre and his team atMoving Picture Company(MPC) Film in Los Angeles, scanned from his appearance in the original films to create his digital double with alterations on it based on several photographs and footage of him being aged taken before his death.[16][18]Bob Guntonand Ivan Reitman (his right hand holding Mckenna Grace's to steady the barrel of a proton pack's neutron wand) physically performed the role. Special effects technicians and puppeteers, including Ronald Binion (suit puppeteer for Slimer in the 2016Ghostbustersfilm), portrayed Egon's poltergeist by puppeteering objects and lights in his house and storm-cellar laboratory.[18]
Under the working title "Rust City",principal photographybegan on July 12, 2019, in and aroundCalgary,Alberta, and lasted until October. Location filming occurred in surrounding communities such asCrossfield,Beiseker,[67]DrumhellerandFort Macleod(Muncher chase scene) during July and August.[68]Other locations around Alberta were also used.[68][69][70]Filming was wrapped after sixty-eight days on October 18.[71]

Simonsen studiedElmer Bernstein's score for the firstGhostbustersfilm and recruited Bernstein's sonPeter, who guided the orchestration of Simonsen's score and the use of material fromGhostbusters(1984), as a score consultant.[citation needed]Simonsen used theondes martenotthroughout the score, which was played by Cynthia Millar, who played the same instrument on Bernstein's 1984Ghostbustersscore.

TheAssociated Pressnoted the "crucial difference" between this film and the2016 rebootis thatGhostbusters: Afterlife"cost about half as much to make".[115]Varietydescribed the film's opening weekend box office as "stronger-than-expected" and "an important victory for the studio after it failed in 2016 to revive the decades-old series".[116]
