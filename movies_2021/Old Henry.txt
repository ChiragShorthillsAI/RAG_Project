Widower Henry McCarty and his son Wyatt live on a farm inOklahoma Territoryin 1906 near Henry's brother-in-law Al. After Henry and Wyatt find a lost horse with blood on the saddle, Henry locates its owner, a near-dead man named Curry. Next to Curry is a pistol and a satchel full of money. Henry wants no part of it and gets on his horse to leave the man be. But he changes his mind and brings the unconscious Curry and the money back to the farm to treat his wounds. Henry interrogates Curry, who claims to be a lawman and the sole survivor of apossesent after a gang of outlaws. He asks for help keeping the outlaws from retrieving the money he managed to steal from them.
While his father goes to town for help, Wyatt secretly takes Curry's gun to practice shooting. Curry slips free and tries to wrestle back the gun, but Henry suddenly appears and overpowers him. Henry reveals that he turned back after spotting three men investigating the spot where he first found Curry. The trio, wearing sheriff's badges and led by a man named Sam Ketchum, come to the farm in search of Curry. They claim that Curry is the real outlaw but arouse Henry's suspicions when Ketchum begins asking questions about Henry's own identity and family.
Henry does not give up Curry, and the men leave after a tense standoff. That evening, Henry has a conversation with Curry in which the latter reveals detailed knowledge of people known to Henry, which convinces Henry to undo some of his restraints. Curry tells of his experiences as a young ranch hand who witnessed the death ofBilly the Kid. One of Ketchum's men, Dugan, tries to sneak under the house so he can shoot Henry from below. Henry spots him, forces Dugan out with a shotgun, and strangles him to death while Wyatt watches.
The next morning, Ketchum returns with his gang. Curry encourages Henry to surrender and turn him over, arguing that they should not die for his sake. However, Ketchum reveals he has taken Al as a hostage and, when Henry refuses to surrender, shoots him in cold blood. After stopping his son from running outside and getting killed, Henry goes into his room and arms himself with several guns, telling Wyatt "Keep your damn head down, you'll be alright". Curry recognizes the phrase as something Billy the Kid said to him years ago and realizes that Henry is in fact Billy the Kid, who faked his own death with the help of a sympatheticPat Garrett.
Henry pretends to surrender before shooting Ketchum in the face, gunning down several men, and slipping out the back door of his farmhouse. While Curry and Wyatt hold off the remaining gang members, Henry stealthily eliminates the gang until only Stilwell, the gang's tracker, is left. Stilwell tosses his guns and tries to use his throwing knife, but Henry shoots it out of his hand and then shoots him through his eye.
Henry suddenly comes under fire as Ketchum emerges, revealing that the shot only mangled his cheek. Both men chase and shoot at each other until Ketchum runs out of bullets, with Henry using his last shot to blow the outlaw's head off. Returning to the house, Henry is about to bandage up the injured Curry when he spots a brand on his arm used for marking criminals. Curry shoots Henry in the stomach, admitting that he was in fact a lawman, joined Ketchum's gang alongside his colleagues so the gang could impersonate lawmen and commit the heist.  Curry apologizes but says now he has the  chance to be the man who killed Billy the Kid.
Wyatt overhears all this,   and kills Curry before he can finish off Henry. Wyatt tries to help his father, but Henry tells him that it is too late. Henry speaks earnestly to his son, telling him that the world is changing, and Henry has no place in it anymore but that he hoped his son would now find a place for himself after teaching him to be an honest man. He dies in Wyatt's arms. Wyatt buries his father next to his mother and leaves the farm along with the gang's cash.
In an interview,Tim Blake Nelsonsaid starring in the 2018 Western filmThe Ballad of Buster Scruggstaught him how to handle a gun, "I was working with guns every day for about five months to be able to do the pistol tricks."[1]On December 15, 2020, Hideout Pictures andShout! Studiosannounced a partnership to produce, finance, and distribute three Westerns, includingOld Henryfrom writer and director Potsy Ponciroli.[2]According to Nelson, he was heating up his food when he came across an email that offered him the title role. He toldGQthat his initial response was to say, "Well, it happened. You've been offered a character that's described as old."[1]
During pre-production, Nelson spent six months researching how his character would sound and move. He then spent another six months working on the 100-page screenplay with Ponciroli and two months physically preparing his body to handle a gun, ride a horse, and get in shape to look like a farmer.[3]Nelson's role in the film was confirmed on January 12, 2021.[4]On his performance, he says he "wanted for Henry by the end of the movie to be vastly different from the character he was at the beginning of the movie, and for the audience to never be able to name a single moment where the transformation happens."[3]
Nelson feared the public would negatively compare his role as Henry to his performance as Buster Scruggs, characters he finds to be "opposites". He spoke with Ponciroli about the issue and the pair agreed the film would not featuregunspinning; the final product features one spin during the film's finale that serves as a "punctuation".[5]On January 14, 2021,Stephen Dorff,Trace Adkins,Scott Haze, andGavin Lewisjoined the cast.[6]Principal photographyforOld Henrytook place in Tennessee between January and March 2021.[6][7]
Old Henryhad its world premiere out of competition at theVenice Film Festivalon September 7, 2021.[8]It was released in around 30 theaters in the United States on October 1, 2021.

In the United States and Canada,Old Henrygrossed $42,068 at the box office.[11][12]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 94% of 72 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "Led by a reliably solid performance from Tim Blake Nelson,Old Henryserves up a supple cut of vintage western rawhide."[13]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[14]
The film's plot and execution received generally positive reviews. FromTheWrap, Steve Pond said he wished parts of the film were "more expansive" but overall described it as a "beautiful elegy" with a finale that feels "just right."[15]Writing forThe Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney described the direction of the film as a "well-crafted exercise in old-fashioned but durable genre tropes" that later "evolves into a satisfying reflection on the more complicated, somber realities behind the icons of the Wild West."[16]In a negative review,The Guardian'sXan Brooks found it to be too familiar to other Westerns and expressed doubt that the film should have been screened at the Venice Film Festival.[17]
Furthermore, Tim Blake Nelson's performance as the title character received praise. Rooney said Nelson was able to "communicate with pathos both the regret and the steely resolve behind every beady-eyed squint."[16]Variety'sOwen Gleibermanwrote that the film was "built as a kind of pedestal for Nelson's performance."[18]
Old Henrywas chosen as the best feature film of the 2021Almería Western Film Festival.[19]At the end of the year, theNational Board of Reviewselected it in its annual list of theTop Ten Independent Films.[20]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
