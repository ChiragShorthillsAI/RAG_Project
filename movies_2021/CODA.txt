A stage musical adaptation was in the works as of 2022.
InGloucester, Massachusetts, 17-year-old Ruby Rossi is the onlyhearingmember of her family; her parents, Frank and Jackie, and older brother, Leo, are alldeaf. Ruby assists with the family fishing business and plans to join it full-time after high school. One day at school, Ruby sees her crush, Miles Patterson, signing up for choir as his elective, so she also signs up. The music teacher, Mr. Bernardo "Mr. V" Villalobos, encourages Ruby to sing more and assigns her to a duet with Miles.
Meanwhile, Frank and Leo struggle to make ends meet with the fishing business as new fees and sanctions are imposed by the local board. At a board meeting, everyone is angry about the fact that more boats are disappearing from the harbor. During the yelling, Frank announces that he is going to start his own company to get around the new restrictions and intends to sell his fish on his own, inviting other local fishermen to join him. The family struggles to get the new business off the ground, relying on Ruby to spread the word.
Mr. V encourages Ruby to audition forBerklee College of Music, hisalma mater, and offers her private lessons to prepare. Ruby agrees, but her increasing commitments to the family business (her parents are dependent upon her to interpret for them) cause her to be late to their lessons. Mr. V grows irritated with Ruby's constant tardiness and chastises her for wasting his time and not caring enough about music.
While fishing one day, when Ruby is off swimming with Miles, Frank and Leo sail with a federal fishing observer on board, who does not know in advance that they are deaf. The boat is intercepted by theCoast Guardafter failing to respond to ship horns and radio calls. Frank and Leo are fined and have their fishing licenses suspended for negligence. When they tell Ruby that she should have been on the boat with them, Ruby tells them she cannot always interpret for them and she was not at fault. Frank and Leo appeal and get their license back on the condition that they have a hearing person on board at all times. Ruby announces to the family that she is forgoing college and will join the business full-time. Frank and Jackie are supportive, but Leo reacts angrily, insisting that they can manage without Ruby as she truly has talent. He and Ruby later have an argument where he tells her that she will regret not going to college forever.
Ruby's family attends her choir recital and notices the positive reception from the surrounding audience. That night, Frank asks Ruby to sing for him while he feels her vocal cords, growing emotional. The family then drives toBostonwith Ruby for her Berklee audition. Before her audition, she sees Miles, who reveals that he failed at his audition and wishes her luck. Ruby's family sneaks up to the balcony while Mr. V comes to accompany her on piano. Ruby is nervous and unprepared at first, but after Mr. V deliberately makes a mistake on his accompaniment, she is allowed to start again and gains confidence when she sees her family. Ruby signs along while singing "Both Sides, Now" byJoni Mitchell, so they can understand what she is singing.
Ruby is accepted to Berklee and invites Miles to visit her in Boston. Meanwhile, the hearing workers in the family's fishing business have been learningsign language, enabling them to communicate with and interpret for the family. Ruby's friend Gertie drives her to Boston for college as her family sees them off; Ruby signs, "I love you so much" (literal translation: "I really love you") to them as they drive away.
CODA, written and directed bySian Heder, is an English-language remake of the French-language filmLa Famille Bélier, which was released in 2014 and was successful at the French box office. Philippe Rousselet was one of the original film's producers, and he had the right to do a remake.[10]He and producer Patrick Wachsberger approached Heder to direct a remake for a United States audience.[11]Heder said, "They were interested in adapting the film, but they wanted someone to make it unique and take the premise from the original and, also, reinvent it."[10]By May 2019, the companiesPathé Filmsand Vendôme Group had formed a film production partnership to develop and produce English-language films, with the first beingCODA.[12]
CODAis set inGloucester, Massachusetts. While its predecessorLa Famille Bélierwas set on a rural dairy farm in France, Heder chose to setCODAin Gloucester, being familiar with the city from visiting theNorth Shorein the summer when growing up. Heder explained, "For me, it has the combination of being very picturesque and quintessentially New England but also with a working-class grit to it."[10]Heder learnedAmerican Sign Languagein the process of writing the script, with 40% of it ultimately being in ASL.[10]The director was helped by two deaf collaborators whom she called "ASL masters",Alexandria Wailesand Anne Tomasetti.[11]
To prepare for the film, Heder observed a fish processing plant and consulted the localharbormasterabout how authorities would raid a boat. She received feedback from directorKenneth Lonergan—who directed the 2016 filmManchester by the Sea, which was set inManchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts[13]—and members of the fishing-industry nonprofit Gloucester Fishermen's Wives Association. Several consultants and a fisherman educated Heder in local fishing practices.[13]
Marlee Matlin, an award-winning and internationally known actress, was the first person cast for the film. During the development process, the film's financiers resisted casting deaf actors for the remaining deaf characters, but Matlin threatened to drop out unless deaf actors were cast, and the financiers ultimately relented.[14]
Heder described the casting as an opportunity for Matlin to play against type, her previous roles have been "'put-together' and classy characters". Heder said, "Marlee, in real life, is much more funny, and she has a dirty sense of humor. This (role) was a working-class fisherman's wife, and she has a lot of elements of her personality that were very right for this character." Matlin used her connections withDeaf West Theatrein Los Angeles, California, to help Heder find additional deaf actors. Heder sawTroy Kotsurin a Deaf West production and cast him as the fisherman and father. She castDaniel Durantafter finding him through auditions. Matlin, Kotsur, and Durant were already familiar with one another through their collaboration on the Deaf West production of the musicalSpring Awakening.[10]
Matlin described her interest in gettingCODAmade, "I felt that audiences would really see deaf people in a film ... There are so many levels for people to identify with and, for people with no connection, who have never met a deaf person, to see sign language, to see deaf people in normal, day-to-day settings ... People think that deaf people are monolithic in how they approach life. And this film bursts that myth ... But to burst that myth, it had to be told as authentically as possible. And it's strange because studios clearly have the ability to greenlight a film and cast whomever they want, and there continues to be a lack of awareness that you can tell universal stories with deaf characters."[14]Kotsur said, "You have to think a little bit outside the box and present more opportunities, instead of just having two options ... You know, you write this script because somebody's deaf, or I'm writing it because it's a character that happens to be deaf. There's a distinction there."[11]
Heder hired a rotating group of ASL interpreters that facilitated communication with signing and speaking among the cast and crew.[10]She connected with the deaf community in nearbyBostonto secure the interpreters for on-set communication.[13]Matlin said, "[Heder] really immersed herself into our culture and made every attempt to learn and to work with us and having two directors of sign language on the set, plus interpreters, plus the crew who learned our language, everyone working together, it was working like on any other set, but the sign language aspect made it extra special."[15]
The director also auditioned hundreds of teenage girls before castingEmilia Jonesas the hearing member of the deaf family. Jones took voice lessons and learned ASL for nine months before filming started. Heder also chose to castEugenio Derbezas the girl's choirmaster, seeing him as a fit for her "amalgamation of Heder's college rhythm teacher and her high school drama and English teachers".[10]
The film was shot on location in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in the middle of 2019.[13]
In the film, the family lives in whatWBUR'sThe ARTerydescribed as a "creaky clapboard cottage [with] a yard jammed with boats, traps, and nets". Duringlocation scouting, Heder came across what she found to be the ideal house for the family home and received permission from its residents to use it as a filming location. The choirmaster's home was aVictorian-stylehouse on the sea, where Heder had visited family friends multiple times in her childhood, and they allowed her to film there.[13]
The portrayal of "Gloucester High School" was actually the old Briscoe Middle School inBeverly, Massachusetts, which had previously closed, in preparation to being converted to the Beverly Village for Living & the Arts.[16]
A fisherman who educated Heder in local fishing practices allowed hisfishing trawlerto be used as a film set. Scenes set in a flooded quarry were filmed at the Steel Derrick quarry inRockport, Massachusetts.[13]
Marius de Vriescomposed the film's soundtrack and compiled and co-produced the album with Nicholai Baxter, featuring the original score and incorporated songs.[17]Speaking on creating music for the film, which had predominantly deaf characters playing the leading roles, he called it his "biggest challenge" and added that the music should be strong to connect with the emotions.[18]Most of the incorporated songs in the film wererecorded liveand sung by the lead actorsEmilia JonesandFerdia Walsh-Peelo, accompanied by theCODAchoir, who were students atBerklee College of MusicandGloucester High School.[19][20]The soundtrack also featured an original song sung by Jones, "Beyond the Shore," which is played during the end credits of the film.[21]The soundtrack album was released byRepublic Recordson August 13, 2021, coinciding with the film's release.[22]
CODAhad its world premiere onJanuary 28, 2021, at the2021 Sundance Film Festivalas one of the opening-day films.[23]It screened as part of the festival's US Dramatic Competition.[24]Due to theCOVID-19 pandemic in the United Statesat the time,CODAwas screened virtually.[13]
The film received "immediate rave reviews", according toAgence France Presse, which highlighted the positive comments fromVarietyandDeadline Hollywood.[25]IndieWirewrote,"[Heder]has reportedly crafted a crowd-pleasing tearjerker whose commercial promise will easily spark a bidding war between theatrical distributors and deep-pocketed streamers."[26]USA Todaysummarized the reception, "Propelled by its powerful inclusivity of the deaf community, it's a refreshing reboot of the traditional teen romance and coming-of-age story."[15]
Two days afterCODA's premiere,Appleacquired distribution rights to the film for a festival-record $25 million.[27]At Sundance,CODAwon the U.S. Grand Jury Prize, U.S. Dramatic Audience Award, and a Special Jury Ensemble Cast Award. The film's director Sian Heder won Best Director in the U.S. Dramatic section.[28]
In March 2022,CODAwas screened at theFamily Theaterof theWhite House.[29][30]
The film was released through the streaming serviceApple TV+in selected countries on August 13, 2021.[31]IndieWireestimated the film grossed around $100,000 in its domestic opening weekend.[32]
Apple spent about $10 million on the film's award campaign.[33]By March 20, 2022, the film had been streamed in 973,000 households in the United States, including 375,000 since the Oscar nomination announcements on February 8.[34]In the three days following its Best Picture win, the film saw a 300% increase in views from the previous week and was the most-streamed program on Apple TV+.[35]
According to Kotsur, the film was initially rated R "for language," as displayed in the subtitles during the deaf characters' dialogue in some scenes, but after several "back-and-forths" and fights with theMPA, it was ultimately reduced to PG-13 "for strong sexual content and language, and drug use" months before its official release. Kotsur added "...vulgar sign language is just a part of our culture. But are you hearing people ready? That's why it was so cool. It's fascinating to see that in the script".[36]
The film remains the only Best Picture Oscar winner to have never been available on physical media.[37]
Review aggregator websiteRotten Tomatoesreported that 94% of 295 reviews of the film were positive, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's critics' consensus reads, "CODA's story offers few surprises, but strong representation and a terrific cast—led by Emilia Jones' brilliant performance—bring this coming-of-age story vividly to life."[38]Metacriticassigned the film a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[39]
Benjamin Lee'sGuardian-based three-star review offered this summary: "Coda is a mostly likable concoction, but one that's just too formulaic and ultimately rather calculated to secure the emotional response it so desperately wants by the big finale."[40]Writing forThe New York Times, editor Jeannette Catsoulis wrote, "An openhearted embrace of deaf culture elevates this otherwise conventional tale of a talented teenager caught between ambition and loyalty".[41]Variety'sOwen Gilberman stated that Sian Heder had got the gift, "the holy essence of how to shape and craft a drama that spins and burbles and flows".[42]His feeling was that the film "brings this all off with such sincerity and precision" and is so "enthrallingly well-acted, that you may come away feeling grateful that this kind of mainstream dramatic craftsmanship still exists", and also praised Jones and Kotsur's performances.[42]
The Hollywood Reporter'sJon Frosch opined that "CODAfaithfully works its way through a checklist of tropes from high school comedies, disability dramas, musical-prodigy and inspiring-teacher narratives, coming-of-age tales about young people struggling to declare independence from overbearing families and indie chronicles of blue-collar America."[43]Ann HornadayofThe Washington Postcalled it an "old-fashioned movie that adheres to admittedly familiar principles of storytelling and emotional stakes, but by way of such a winning cast, evocative atmosphere and genuine tone that its impossible not to love".[44]
RogerEbert.combased critic Tomris Laffly wrote "It's not that Heder doesn't embrace the aforesaid conventions for all their comforting worth — she does. But by twisting the formula and placing this recognizable story inside a new, perhaps even groundbreaking setting with such loving, acutely observed specificity, she pulls off nothing short of a heartwarming miracle with her film."[45]Brian Lowry ofCNNdescribed it as "small movie that hits all the right notes".[46]
In contrast, Tim Robey, writing forThe Telegraph, criticized it as "dramedy that could have taken more risks", and added, "Heder's script makes every easy and rigged choice available, reducing far too many of the family dynamics to the level of a bickering sitcom." Comparing it with theDarius Marder-directedSound of Metal(2020), which he called "a genuinely adventurous, formally experimental take on deaf issues", he wrote thatCODA"feels too cute by half".[47]
Deaf viewers had varied reactions to the film. They praised the casting and performances of deaf actors and found the depiction of deaf characters as self-sufficient and sexually active people to be in welcome contrast to previous depictions on screen. Delbert Whetter, vice chair of nonprofitRespectAbility, said, "After seeing so many stories where people with disabilities are depicted as helpless, forlorn souls needing to be rescued, it is so refreshing to see a story with deaf characters that are small business owners and leaders in their fishing community, with depth and nuance that rival and even exceed that of their hearing counterparts in the story." Deaf writerSara Novićalso said, "I liked that these characters were sexual beings—deaf and disabled people are often neutered or virginal in movies and books, and that's extremely boring and inaccurate."[48]
Jenna Beacom, asensitivity readerand young adult author, found much of the film "misrepresented, especially deaf people's competence and ability to thrive in 2021", and said that, while "thrilled that the movie exists, in the sense of contributing to more deaf representation and hopefully more opportunities for even better representation", she was "very disturbed by how negatively the movie portrays the deaf and CODA experiences."[48]A deaf parent of a singer herself, Beacom found the film's assumption "that being deaf means that you can't enjoy music, or understand anyone else's enjoyment" to be unfounded.[49]Nović also said, "I actually think the story of a first-gen college student, just without the music—she could have been studying anything—is more compelling, anyway ... I don't think that we needed the music part for this to be an interesting story."[50]
Other viewers also criticized the portrayal of deaf characters' inability to appreciate music as a commontropein films featuring deaf characters, such asMr. Holland's Opus,Beyond Silence, andSound of Metal.[51][52]Lennard J. Davis, a CODA and disability scholar, wrote, "this genre of films is glued to a different reality: it is as if birds were obsessed with making movies in which humans were miserable about their inability to fly."[52]
The film's depiction of the hearing child interpreting for her parents even in settings where professional interpreters would be required by theAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990, such as a court hearing and medical appointments, received widespread criticism as being misrepresentative.[48][53][54]
In 2023,Screen Rantranked it number 5 on its list of "The 10 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far)," writing that "Every so often, there is a small indie movie that comes out of nowhere and surprises everyone.CODAis the most recent example of such a sleeper hit and one of the most crowd-pleasing movies of the 2020s...this small family drama that was filled with light-hearted moments won over so many people and left plenty of tears in their eyes."[3]
It also ranked number 18 onCollider's list of "The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far," calling it "one of the definitive crowd pleasers of the decade."[4]MovieWebranked it number 15 on its list of the "20 Most Underrated Films of the Last 5 Years," writing that "it certainly deserves way more credit" and called it "groundbreaking in its representation of disability."[55]
At the94th Academy Awards,CODAwon all three awards that it was nominated for:Best Picture,Best Supporting Actor(Kotsur), andBest Adapted Screenplay.[56]It is the first film produced or distributed by astreaming service, the firstSundancefilm, and the first film featuring predominantly deaf actors in leading roles to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[57]The film had the fewest nominations for a Best Picture winner since 1932'sGrand Hotel, and is also the sixth film and the first since 2018'sGreen Bookto win Best Picture without a director nomination.[58]
CODAwas nominated forBest Motion Picture - DramaandBest Supporting Actor(for Kotsur) at the79th Golden Globe Awards. It received three nominations at the75th British Academy Film Awards, winning two, includingBest Supporting Actorfor Kotsur, making him the first deaf person to ever win a BAFTA, andBest Adapted Screenplayfor Heder. At the28th Screen Actors Guild Awards, the film made history with Kotsur, Matlin and Durant becoming the first deaf/non-hearing performers to win, along with Jones, Derbez and Walsh-Peelo, forOutstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.[59]At the33rd Producers Guild of America Awards, the film was also awarded theProducers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture.[60]
CODAwas one of 28 films that receivedthe ReFrame Stampfor 2021, awarded by the gender equity coalitionReFramefor films that are proven to have gender-balanced hiring.[61]The film was also given the Seal of Authentic Representation from theRuderman Family Foundationfor Matlin's and Durant's roles as Ruby's mother and brother. The seal is given to films and series that feature actors with disabilities who have at least five lines of dialogue.[62]
On March 23, 2022, it was reported byThe New York Timesthat, in an effort to keep the film relevant after awards season, its producers plan to team up withDeaf West Theatreto develop a stage musical adaptation of the film, with a creative team and production scheduled yet to be announced. DJ Kurs, Deaf West's artistic director, expressed excitement for the project: "As a Deaf person, I knew from the start thatCODAwould make a perfect musical: It addresses our relationship with music and how we move through the world of sound like immigrants in a foreign country, learning new, seemingly arbitrary rules on the fly." Like Deaf West's production ofSpring Awakening, the musical will incorporate both signing in American Sign Language and live singing.[63]
The report also noted that Rousselet had been asked in 2014 about making a stage version ofLa Famille Bélier, but that he and the producers wanted to prioritize makingCODAand forging a relationship with Deaf West first. Rousselet further remarked "It's going to be a new adventure for us. But I think it has everything – the characters, the music, the wonderful environment – to make a beautiful musical." Kotsur said that he hopes the musical will have its initial staging within two years; he seemed to suggest that he might reprise his role as Frank in the production.[63]Kurs noted his desire to have Matlin and Durant also reprise their roles as Jackie and Leo, respectively, along with Kotsur.[64]
In August 2024, Deaf West Theatre announced its 2024–25 season and officially confirmed that the musical is still in the works.[65]

Apple TV+is an Americansubscriptionover-the-topstreaming serviceowned byApple. The service launched on November 1, 2019, and it offers a selection of original production film and television series calledApple Originals.[9]The service was announced during theApple Special Event of March 2019,[10][11]where entertainers from Apple TV+ projects appeared onstage, includingJennifer Aniston,Oprah Winfrey, andSteven Spielberg.[12][13]The service can be accessed through Apple's website and through theApple TV app, which has gradually become available on manyApple devicesand some major competingdigital media players,[14]including somesmart TVmodels and video-game consoles.
Apple plans to expand the services' availability,[15][16][17][18]and there are workarounds for subscribers whose device is not presently supported.[14]Access is included as part of theApple Onesubscription.[19]Most of the content is available inDolby Visionprofile 5 andDolby Atmos. Upon its debut, Apple TV+ was available in about 100 countries, fewer than the reported target of 150.[20][21]Several countries were excluded from service despite other Apple products being available.[22][23][24]Commentators noted that the fairly wide initial reach of the service offered Apple an advantage over other recently launched services such asDisney+, and that because Apple distributes its own content through the service instead of distributing licensed third-party content (as, for example,Huludoes) it will not be limited by licensing issues during its expansion.[25][26][27]
By early 2020, Apple TV+ had poor growth and low subscriber numbers relative to competing services.[28][29][30][31]In the middle of that year, Apple began to license older television programs and films, attempting to stay competitive with other services, attract and retain a viewership for its original content, and convert into subscribers users who were trialing the service.[29][28]Since then, the service has become the home to critically acclaimed content: between September 2021 and March 2022, Apple TV+ netted aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy SerieswithTed Lassoand theAcademy Award for Best PicturewithCODA, the first Best Picture win for a film distributed by a streaming service.[32]Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston have all signed a multi year look deal with Apple TV+ to develop more television projects under their production companies after their critically acclaimed shows. Apple TV+ (along with the simultaneously announceda-la-cartepremium-videosubscription aggregation serviceApple TV app) is part of a concerted effort by Apple to expand its service revenues.[16][33][34]The service's programming arm isApple Studios.
Apple had long been rumored to have an interest in beginning astreaming televisionservice, and in 2015 entered into negotiations with varioustelevision studiosand programmers to aggregate their content for a live-television streaming bundle.[35][36]Negotiations fell apart over differing views on how to value the content, lack of transparency on details, and the personality of Apple's chief negotiator,Eddy Cue.[35]
In October 2016, Apple CEOTim Cooksaid that television is "of intense interest to me and other people here", and added that Apple has "started focusing on some original content", which he called "a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it's an area we're focused on."[37]
In June 2017, Apple began to take the first major steps to form its new television unit by hiring the co-presidents ofSony Pictures Television, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to oversee all aspects of worldwide video programming.[36][2]In August, Matt Cherniss was hired as Head of Domestic Creative Development, reporting directly to Van Amburg and Erlicht.[3]For the rest of 2017, Apple continued to fill out its executive team for Apple TV+, with Kim Rozenfeld joining as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted,Jay Huntjoining as Creative Director for Europe,Morgan Wandelljoining as Head of International Creative Development, Tara Sorensen joining as Head of Kids Programming, and Max Aronson, Ali Woodruff, Carina Walker, and Michelle Lee joining as development and creative executives.[38][39][4][6][40]
Throughout 2019, Apple continued to build out its unscripted content team, with Molly Thompson hired as Head of Documentaries in April.[5]In November, Rozenfeld stepped down as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted to focus on producing content again with a first-look content production deal with Apple under his Half Full Productions. Cherniss took over Rozenfeld's duties overseeing current scripted programming.[41]
In May 2018, it was reported that Apple was expected to start a sister project to its original content service, and begin selling subscriptions to certain video services directly via itsApple TV appapplication oniOSandtvOS, rather than asking Apple device owners to subscribe to those services through applications individually downloaded from Apple's app store.[42]
In October 2018, it was reported that Apple would distribute its future original content through a still-in-development digital video service within its TV application that is pre-installed in all iOS and tvOS devices. The service was expected to feature both original content, free to owners of Apple devices, as well as subscription "channels" from legacy media companies such asHBOandStarz, which would allow customers to sign up for online-only services.[43]Later that month, it was reported that Apple intended to roll out the service in the U.S. during the first half of 2019 and that it would expand its availability to around 100 countries in the months after its launch.[44]
On March 25, 2019, Apple held a press event to announce Apple TV+. At the event, Apple showed a teaser of its upcoming original content and formally announced some of it, with actors and producers attached to the content appearing on stage. The announced content includedHelpsters, the first series fromSesame Workshop, the producer ofSesame Street, and Oprah Winfrey's first projects for Apple TV+, including a documentary under the working titleToxic Labor[45]about workplace sexual harassment, a documentary series about mental health, and a revival ofOprah's Book Clubas a standalone television series.[46][47]
On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would launch on November 1 at $4.99 per month (with a 1-week free trial) for an account that can be shared with up to six family members. Apple also announced that it would be give away a year of Apple TV+ to anyone who bought a newApple TV,Mac,iPad,iPhone, oriPod Touchbeginning that day.[48]Student subscribers to the monthlyApple Musicservice at a discounted rate also have Apple TV+ bundled in at no additional cost for the time being.[49]
From the start of Apple TV+ on November 1, 2019, Apple offered a free one-year subscription to anyone buying certain of its hardware products (an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod Touch, or Mac).[50]Apple initially extended the free year that was due to end on November 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021,[51]but then announced in mid-January 2021 that it would extend it a second time to July 31, 2021.[52]
In mid-June 2021, Apple added a note to its website advising customers that new users subscribing after June 30, 2021, would receive only three months of free subscription instead of a year.[53]
On October 24, 2022, Apple announced it was to increase pricing of Apple TV+ (along withApple MusicandApple One) subscriptions in many regions. The monthly plan increased $2 to $6.99, and the annual plan increased $20 to $69.[54]
During the announcement of Apple TV+, Apple announced a number of prominent writers, directors, and stars who would be featured in the service. The signing of high-profile talent was intended to attract viewers to the service.[55]
As of March 2019[update], five of the upcoming series had completed production, with six more well into filming.[56]On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would have eight original series (seven scripted and one unscripted) and one original documentary available at launch, with plans to launch new original content every month thereafter. Most series were expected to launch with three episodes, with a new episode released weekly thereafter, although Apple said that not all series would follow that model and that some series might instead launch all at once.[57]
Early critical reaction to the bulk of the service's programming was mixed to poor, but commentators predicted that Apple would have time to grow into its new role as a content provider and to produce well-regarded content, especially as the free year of the service provided with many Apple product purchases enticed users to continue watching, and for some to eventually pay for a subscription, as new series are released.[58][59][15]
On March 13, 2020, Apple suspended all active filming on Apple TV+ shows due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, and all production on series was postponed for an indeterminate period.[60]
Apple's decision in mid-2020 to license large swaths of existing older content for the Apple TV+ service was viewed, in part, as buying time for its original content production during the pandemic by keeping users engaged and in a habit of visiting the service regularly, so that a viewer base would be in place by the time new Apple original content was released.[29][28]
In addition, Apple TV+ endeavored to gain new high-profile content, taking advantage of the pandemic's disruption of theatrical film releases. Among these acquisitions were the 2020 feature filmGreyhoundstarringTom Hanks, which was purchased fromSony Picturesfor $70 million.[61]In July 2020, the service won a heated bidding war forEmancipation, a slavery-based action-thriller starringWill Smithand directed byAntoine Fuqua.[62]Apple paid a record $105 million for the rights.[62]Apple also reportedly considered a $350 to $400 million offer for the rights to stream theJames BondfilmNo Time to Die, which was far short of the $650 to $800 million studioMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(owned byAmazon, which is one of theBig Techcompanies alongside Apple) was willing to accept.[63]
In October 2017, following reports ofsexual abuse allegationsagainst producerHarvey Weinstein, Apple announced that it was severing ties withThe Weinstein Company(TWC) and cancelling a plannedbiopicseries aboutElvis Presley.[64]
In April 2018, Apple signedKerry Ehrinto a multi-year deal to produce original content.[65]Ehrin and Apple renewed the deal in May 2020.[66]
In June 2018, Apple signed theWriters Guild of America's minimum basic agreement andOprah Winfreyto a multi-year content partnership.[67][68]The same month, Apple announced that it had given a multi-series order toSesame Workshopto produce variouslive-actionand animated series as well as a single puppet-based series.[69]
In September 2018, it was reported that Apple had decided to shelveVital Signs, a six-episode biopic television series centering on the life of hip-hop producer and performerDr. Dreand starringIan McShane,Sam Rockwell, andMichael K. Williams, due to concerns about the show's content being too graphic, with moments cited including characters usingcocaine, instances ofgun violence, and an explicitorgyscene. Reports further indicated that Apple CEO Tim Cook was taking a hands-on approach to the company's Worldwide Video Unit, with programming decisions reportedly being aligned to Cook's personal taste, with a preference for family-friendly shows. Various programs in different stages of production apparently had their content altered, including the toning down ofThe Morning Showand the removal of crucifixes from a scene in theM. Night Shyamalandrama series. Additionally, Apple reportedly passed on a television series from comedianWhitney Cummingsabout the #MeToo movement because it was "too sensitive a topic".[70][71][72]Cummings's series was ultimately put into development byAmazon Prime Videoin October 2018.[73]
In November 2018, Apple entered into a multi-year agreement with entertainment companyA24to produce a slate of original films in partnership with its Worldwide Video Unit.[74]The same month, Apple signed a deal with DHX Media (nowWildBrain) and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide to develop and produce original programs, including new series, specials, and shorts based on thePeanutscharacters.

Stewart toldThe New York Timesthat Apple pushed back on episodes aboutChinaandartificial intelligence.[116][117]
Apple TV+ released its first movie in theaters,Killers of the Flower Moon. Apple has said that its primary goal in releasing the film is to attract more subscribers, not to do well at the box office, but it brought in $145 million.[118]Apple TV+ also released another movie,Napoleon. Apple is seemingly pleased with its box-office returns, which reached $221 million and nearly made back its budget. It is apparent that Apple is attempting to compete with movie production companies.[119][120][121]
In March 2022, Apple announced that it would airFriday Night Baseball, a weekly doubleheader ofMajor League Baseball(MLB) games with live pre- and postgame shows on Apple TV+ in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom starting in the2022 Major League Baseball season.[122]

Apple TV+ subscribers can watch select games at no additional charge, and receive a discount on the MLS Season Pass.[126][127]
In mid-2020, Apple began discussions with film and television studios to license their previously released content as part of an effort to build a back catalog of non-original films and television shows for the streaming service.[30][29]The shift was designed to help the service better compete against the large content libraries competitors likeNetflixhave.[30]This represented a pivot for Apple, which had initially attempted to build the service entirely on original content, avoiding licensing fees to help keep monthly subscription fees low, and relying on its Apple TV Channels content partners to supply other content users wanted.[30][29]
Analysts believed that the addition of older, highly re-watchable content like popular sitcoms and well-liked films would help retain the slowly growing subscriber base while Apple continues to develop original content.[28]The shift was also an acknowledgement of poor growth, especially relative to competing services.[28]The back catalog development was also seen as a move to attempt to persuade free trial users to transition into paid users as the first wave of one-year trials was scheduled to expire in November 2020.[29]
On May 26, 2020, Apple announced its first acquisition of catalogue content would be theFraggle Rockseries.[128]In addition to being the exclusive home of the 1983–1987Jim Henson Companyseries, Apple would develop a new, full-length, rebootedFraggle Rockseries after the success of theFraggle Rock: Rock On!short-form series on Apple TV+.[129]On October 19, 2020, Apple announced the exclusive transmission rights of the various animated productions of thePeanutsfranchise, withdrawing them from broadcast television after 55 years; as part of that agreement, Apple TV+ must make the majorPeanutsspecials available for free in short windows.[130]After an outcry from fans of the specials, Apple sublicensedA Charlie Brown ThanksgivingandA Charlie Brown ChristmastoPBSfor commercial-free airing.[131]In 2021,It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brownalso came to the PBS rotation. The PBS sublicensing arrangement ended before October 2022.[132]
In March 2024, Apple made 51 catalog films available under a "Great Movies special collection" banner.[133]
Apple has announced a number of partnerships, bundles, and initiatives to increase subscriber growth in the service.[when?]
It has included Apple TV+ in several reduced-cost bundles designed to increase uptake and stickiness of subscriptions, including a bundle with Apple Music available for students, a bundle offeringCBS All AccessandShowtimefor an additional $9.99 monthly for TV+ subscribers, and a bundling of the service as part of theApple Onesubscription package.[134][135][136]
It has partnered with largecable television MSOsand telecommunicationsmobile network operators, such asAltice USA,[137]the UK'sEE,[138]and Ireland'sEir TV,[139][140]to offer those systems' customers Apple TV+ as part of a bundle, sometimes including anApple TV 4Kset-top box.
By February 2020, about 10 million people had signed up for Apple TV+.[30][29]This included users who received a free one-year trial with the purchase of an Apple device,[30][29]although it was estimated that less than 10% of Apple device owners eligible for the trial had activated it, perhaps because of Apple's failure to promote the service, Apple's desire to slow the uptake rate due to accounting concerns, or users' lack of interest in the service's perceived poor content options.[30]About half of those 10 million users actively used the service.[31]In late 2020, the continuing expansion of availability of the Apple TV app to a growing number of smart TV platforms and to newer lines ofPlayStationandXboxvideo game consoles (specifically, thePS4andPS5, and the XboxOne,Series S, andSeries X[141]) was seen as potentially boosting subscriber numbers for Apple TV+, including as part of Apple One subscription bundle purchases.[142]But Apple has created no native TV app for theWindowsandAndroidplatformsor official method to stream the content toChromecastor on theAndroid TVplatform (except for selectSonyBraviatelevision models[143]), leaving users of those devices to use a web browser to view Apple TV+ content, where possible, or to employ other workarounds, especially for sending Apple TV+ content to a television set.[14]On December 16, 2020,Googleannounced it would add the Apple TV app to itsChromecast with Google TVdevice in early 2021 and to its Android TV platform by June 1, 2021;[144][145]Google made Apple TV available on its Chromecast with Google TV, as well as on selectSonyandTCLsmart TVsrunning the Google TV interface, on February 18, 2021.[146]On December 18, 2020, theBritish Urban Film Festivalannounced that it was to be the first UK film festival to host all of its official selections on theApple TV app.[147]
The service received several nominations for the2021 Golden Globe Awardsin both the television and film categories and was regarded as having "established an impressive track record for turning out consistently good—and sometimes great—programming for subscribers, despite offering a much, much smaller overall offering."[148]Apple's seriesTed Lassowon fourPrimetime Emmy Awards in 2021, includingOutstanding Comedy Series,Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series(Jason Sudeikis),Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series(Brett Goldstein) andOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series(Hannah Waddingham).[149]
Apple TV+ is the first streaming service to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture, withCODAat the94th Academy Awards.[150]As of March 2022, it is estimated to have 25 million paid subscribers and an additional 50 million viewers who access the service via promotions.[151]
Apple is partnering withBharti Airtelto provide its music and video streaming services to the telecom company's premium clients in India from 2024 at no cost, providing the American behemoth access to thousands of users in the most populated country.[152]
On the 96th Academy Awards, Apple Films earned a record breaking 14 Oscar nominations, withKillers of the Flower Moonreceiving 10 andNapoleonreceiving 4. This marked the second time an Apple Films received a Best Picture nomination.[citation needed]
In October 2024,Amazonannounced that Apple TV+ would be available as an add-on subscription onAmazon Prime Videoin the United States later that month on October 15, with other countries to follow.[153][154]
In January 2025, Apple TV+ announced that the service would be free for the first weekend of 2025, from January 3 - January 5, as a way to "increase publicity and global knowledge" regarding their service, worldwide.
In February 2025, Apple announced the Apple TV+ app is available to download fromGoogle Playon Android mobile devices.[155]

Pathé SAS[2](French:[pate]; styled asPATHÉ!) is a French major film production and distribution company, owning a number of cinema chains through its subsidiaryPathé Cinémasand television networks across Europe.
It is the name of a network of French businesses that were founded and originally run by the Pathé Brothers of France starting in 1896. In the early 1900s, Pathé became the world's largest film equipment and production company, as well as a major producer ofphonograph records. In 1908, Pathé invented thenewsreelthat was shown in cinemas before a feature film.[3]
Pathé is the second-oldest operating film company, behindGaumont, which was established in 1895.
The company was founded asSociété Pathé Frères(French:[patefʁɛʁ]; "Pathé Brothers Company") inParis, France on 28 September 1896, by the four brothersCharles, Émile, Théophile and Jacques Pathé.[4]During the first part of the 20th century, Pathé became the largest film equipment and production company in the world,[5]as well as a major producer ofphonograph records.
The driving force behind the film operation and phonograph business wasCharles Pathé, who had helped open aphonographshop in 1894 and established a phonograph factory atChatouon the western outskirts of Paris. The Pathé brothers began selling Edison and Columbia phonographs and accompanyingcylinder recordsand later, the brothers designed and sold their own phonographs that incorporated elements of other brands.[6]Soon after, they also started marketing pre-recorded cylinder records. By 1896 the Pathé brothers had offices andrecording studiosnot only in Paris, but also inLondon,Milan, andSt. Petersburg. Pathé manufactured cylinder records until approximately 1914. In 1905,[7]the Pathé brothers entered the growing field ofdisc records.[8]
In France, Pathé became the largest and most successful distributor of cylinder records and phonographs. These, however, failed to make headway in foreign markets such as theUnited Kingdomand theUnited Stateswhere other brands were already in widespread use.[9]
In December 1928, the French and British Pathé phonograph assets were sold to the BritishColumbia Graphophone Company. In July 1929, the assets of the American Pathé record company were merged into the newly formedAmerican Record Corporation.[7]
The Pathé and Pathé-Marconi labels and catalogue still survive, first as imprints ofEMIand now currently EMI's successorParlophone Records. In 1967EMI Italianatook control of the entire catalog. In turn, theUniversal Music Groupacquired EMI Italiana in 2013.
As the phonograph business became successful, Pathé saw the opportunities offered by new means of entertainment and in particular by the fledglingmotion pictureindustry. Having decided to expand the record business to include film equipment, the company expanded dramatically. To finance its growth, the company took the nameCompagnie Générale des Établissements Pathé Frères Phonographes & Cinématographes(sometimes abbreviated asCGPC) in 1897, and its shares were listed on theParis Stock Exchange.[10]In 1896,Mitchell MarkofBuffalo,New York, became the first American to import Pathé films to the United States, where they were shown in the Vitascope Theater.[11]
In 1907, Pathé acquired theLumière brothers' patents and then set about to design an improved studio camera and to make their own film stock. Their technologically advanced equipment, new processing facilities built atVincennes, and aggressive merchandising combined with efficient distribution systems allowed them to capture a huge share of the international market. They first expanded toLondonin 1902 where they set up production facilities and a chain of cinemas.[12]
By 1909, Pathé had built more than 200 cinemas in France and Belgium and by the following year they had facilities inMadrid,Moscow,RomeandNew York Cityplus Australia and Japan. Slightly later, they opened a film exchange inBuffalo, New York.[12]Through itsAmerican subsidiary, it was part of theMPPCcartel of production in the United States. It participated in theParis Film Congressin February 1909 as part of a plan to create a similar European organisation. The company withdrew from the project in a second meeting in April which fatally undermined the proposal. In 1906, Pathé Frères had pioneered the luxury cinema with the opening of the Omnia Cinéma-Pathé in Paris.[13]
Prior to the outbreak ofWorld War I, Pathé dominated Europe's market in motion picture cameras and projectors. It has been estimated[14]that at one time, 60 percent of all films were shot with Pathé equipment. In 1908, Pathé distributedExcursion to the Moonby Segundo de Chomón, an imitation ofGeorges Méliès'sA Trip to the Moon. Pathé and Méliès worked together in 1911.[15]Méliès made a filmBaron Munchausen's Dream, his first film to be distributed by Pathé. Pathé's relationship with Méliès soured, and after he went bankrupt in 1913,  his last film was never released by Pathé.[16]
After World War I, Charles Pathé started divesting himself from various film interests, believing that the French film industry would never recover after 1918.[17]The company's subsequent decline relegated Pathé primarily as a distributor of short subjects and it became a minor player in the mainstream film industry.[17]
Worldwide, the company emphasised research, investing in such experiments as hand-coloured film and the synchronisation of film and gramophone recordings. In 1908, Pathé invented thenewsreelthat was shown in theatres prior to the feature film. The news clips featured the Pathé logo of a crowing rooster at the beginning of each reel. In 1912, it introduced 28 mm non-flammable film and equipment under the brand name Pathescope.Pathé Newsproduced cinema newsreels from 1910, up until the 1970s when production ceased as a result of mass television ownership.[18]
In the United States, beginning in 1914, the company built film production studios inFort Leeand Jersey City, New Jersey, where their building still stands.The Heights, Jersey Cityproduced the extremely successful serialised episodes calledThe Perils of Pauline. By 1918 Pathé had grown to the point where it was necessary to separate operations into two distinct divisions. With Emile Pathé as chief executive,Pathé Recordsdealt exclusively with phonographs and recordings. Brother Charles managedPathé-Cinéma',' which was responsible for film production, distribution, and exhibition.[19]
In 1922 they introduced thePathé Babyhome film system using a new9.5 mm film stock, which became popular during the next few decades. In 1921, Pathé sold off its United States motion picture production arm. It was renamed "Pathé Exchange" and later merged intoRKO Pictures, disappearing as an independent brand in 1931. Pathé sold its British film studios toEastman Kodakin 1927, while maintaining the theatre and distribution arm.[19]
Pathé was already in substantial financial trouble whenBernard Natantook control of the company in 1929. Studio founderCharles Pathéhad been selling assets for several years to boost investor value and keep the studio's cash flow healthy. The company's founder had even sold Pathé's name and "rooster" trademark to other companies in return for a mere two percent of revenues. Natan had the bad luck to take charge of the studio just as theGreat Depressionconvulsed the French economy.[20][21]
Natan attempted to steady Pathé's finances and implement modern film industry practices at the studio. He acquired another film studio,Société des Cinéromans, fromArthur BernèdeandGaston Leroux, which let Pathé expand into projector and electronics manufacturing. He also bought the Fornier chain of motion picture theatres and rapidly expanded the chain's nationwide presence.[20][21][22]The French press, however, attacked Natan mercilessly for his stewardship of Pathé. Many of these attacks wereantisemitic.[23]
Pathé-Natan did well under Natan's guidance. Between 1930 and 1935, despite the world economic crisis, the company made 100 millionfrancsin profits, and produced and released more than 60 feature films (just as many films as major American studios produced at the time). He resumed production of the newsreelPathé News, which had not been produced since 1927.[20]
Natan also invested heavily into research and development to expand Pathé's film business. In 1929, he pushed Pathé intosound film. In September, the studio produced its first sound feature film, and its first sound newsreel a month later. Natan also launched two new cinema-related magazines,Pathé-RevueandActualités Féminines, to help market Pathé's films and build consumer demand for cinema. Under Natan, Pathé also funded the research ofHenri Chrétien, who developed theanamorphic lens(leading to the creation ofCinemaScopeand otherwidescreenfilm formats common today).[21][22]
Natan expanded Pathé's business interests into communications industries other than film. In November 1929, Natan established France's firsttelevisioncompany,Télévision-Baird-Natan. A year later, he purchased aradiostation inParisand formed a holding company (Radio-Natan-Vitus) to run what would become a burgeoning radio empire.[20][21][22]
In order to finance the company's continued expansion, Pathé's board of directors (which still included Charles Pathé) had voted in 1930 to issue shares worth 105 million francs. Then theGreat Depressionhit France in 1931, and only 50 percent of the shares were purchased. One of the investor banks collapsed due to financial difficulties unrelated to Pathé's problems, and Pathé was forced to follow through with the purchase of several cinema chains it no longer could afford to buy.  Although the company continued to make a profit, it lost more money thanks to these acquisitions than it could bring in.[21][22]In 1935, a commercial court began examining Pathé's accounts, and by 1936 it was declared bankrupt and Natan was dismissed.[24]The studios were not doing badly and continued to make films,[24]but his companies went into receivership and were claimed by the state.
French authorities pursued charges offraudagainst Natan, including financing the purchase of the company without any collateral, of bilking investors by establishing fictitiousshell corporations, and financial mismanagement. He was also accused of hiding his Romanian and Jewish heritage by changing his name. In 1938, Natan was arrested and imprisoned, never to regain his freedom. In 1939 he wasindictedand sentenced to four years in jail.[24]As a result, he was in prison when France fell to the Nazis, a time when other Jewish filmmakers fled or went into hiding. On his release from prison in 1942, he was delivered to the Nazis, and by September 1942 had been deported toAuschwitz, where he was murdered.[20][21][22][25]
In 1943, the company was forced to undergo a restructuring, and was acquired by Adrien Ramauge, changing its name to Société Nouvelle Pathé Cinema.[26]Over the years, the business underwent a number of changes including diversification into producing programmes for the burgeoning television industry. During the 1970s, operating theatres overtook film production as Pathé's primary source of revenue.
In the late 1980s, Italian financierGiancarlo Parrettitried to make a bid for Pathé, even taking overCannonand renaming itPathé Communicationsin anticipation of owning the storied studio. Parretti's shady past, however, raised enough eyebrows in the French government that the deal fell through. It turned out to be a fortunate decision, as Parretti later took overMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and merged it with his Pathé Communications Group to createMGM-Pathé Communicationsin 1990, only to lose it in bankruptcy in late 1991.
In 1990Chargeurs, a French conglomerate led by Jérôme Seydoux, took control of the company.[27]As a result of the deregulation of the French telecommunications market, in June 1999 Pathé merged withVivendi, with the exchange ratio for the merger fixed at three Vivendi shares for every two Pathé shares.The Wall Street Journalestimated the value of the deal at US$2.59 billion. Following the completion of the merger, Vivendi retained Pathé's interests inBritish Sky BroadcastingandCanalSatellite, a French broadcasting corporation,[28]but then sold all remaining assets to Jérôme Seydoux's family-owned corporation, Fornier SA, which changed its name to Pathé.
A list of current and former assets of Pathé.[29]
In its home country France, Pathé self-distributes its films throughPathé Films(formerly calledAMLF(Agence méditerranéenne de location de films) from 1972 to 1998). On home video, their films are distributed by Fox Pathé Europa, a joint venture betweenWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, Pathé andEuropaCorp.
In August 1992, Pathé's then-parent company Chargeurs purchasedGuild Entertainmentfrom Wembley PLC, becoming Pathé's de-facto UK distributor.[32]Initially,PolyGram Videodistributed Guild's VHS releases until March 1995, when Chargeurs formed a UK rental joint-venture with20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, who became Guild/Pathé's home video distributor, the rental joint-venture would be namedFox Guild Home Entertainment.[33]
After the Chargeurs demerger in 1996,[34]Pathé began retiring the Guild brand, initially rebranding the theatrical arm asGuild Pathé Cinemaand eventually in June 1997, asPathé Distributionafter securing a deal to produce films in the country.[35]The home video division followed suit toward the end of the year, rebranding under the Pathé name, the video rental division Fox Guild Home Entertainment would be renamedFox Pathé Home Entertainmentthe following year. Despite this, Guild Home Video remained as an in-name-only dormant business of Pathé until folding on 17 December 2019.[36]
On 12 March 2009, Pathé announced that they would close their UK/Ireland theatrical distribution unit and form a new partnership withWarner Bros. Picturesto handle the theatrical distribution of their titles in the UK, following a handful of films that flopped at the box office. The move was made so Pathé could focus more on the development and production of its own titles instead of acquisitions. The partnership would allow the two companies working together to identify co-production opportunities. Pathé would remain as an international sales agent for films, while 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment would remain as the distributor for home video.[37]Select film acquisitions that were planned to be distributed by Pathé, such asChatroomandDead Man Running, were sold toRevolver Entertainment.
On 1 February 2011, it was announced that20th Century Foxwould take over as Pathé's theatrical distributor. Pathé UK's co-CEO Francois Ivernel deemed it easier for one company to handle the licensing process for both theatrical and home video.[38]
Withthe purchase of 20th Century Foxbythe Walt Disney Companyon 20 March 2019,Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturestook over distribution of Pathé's material, releasing bothMisbehaviourandThe Human Voice,Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainmentwould release the two films on home video. The longstanding deal with Fox/Disney deal expired on 30 June 2021, and Pathé decided not to renew. Pathé UK managing director Cameron McCracken was pleased with Disney's treatment of the company's films, deeming them to have given the films the same treatment that Fox did.[39]
On 7 June 2021, a few weeks before the expiration of the Fox deal, Pathé UK announced they would revert their distribution toWarner Bros. Pictures, with the first films being released under the new deal beingParallel MothersandThe Duke. Unlike the 2009 deal, this new deal would also include home video and digital rights as well, which Fox/Disney previously handled.[40]
On 15 November 2023, Pathé UK announced that they would exit out of the UK theatrical market and restructure to focus on the premium television market instead. The exit was due to structural changes in the film industry following the impact ofCoronavirus pandemic, issues with the structure of independent distribution in the country (which led to fellow rivalEntertainment One(now Lionsgate Canada) closing their UK distribution arm earlier in the year), some of their filmsflopping at the box office, and the retirement of Cameron McCracken.[41]Some time later,StudioCanal UKtook over distribution of their material on home video through their Elevation Sales joint-venture withLionsgate UK.
