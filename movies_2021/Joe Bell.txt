Joe Bellis a 2020 Americanbiographical dramaroad filmdirected byReinaldo Marcus Green, from a screenplay byLarry McMurtryandDiana Ossana. The film starsMark Wahlberg,Reid Miller, andConnie Britton, and follows the true story of a man named Joe Bell, who sets out walking across America to speak out against bullying and honoring his teenage son,Jadin Bell, who died bysuicideafter he was bullied for being gay. The film was produced byJake Gyllenhaal’s production company,Nine Stories Productions, with Gyllenhaal himself serving as executive producer.
The film had its world premiere under its original titleGood Joe Bellat the2020 Toronto International Film Festivalon September 14, 2020, and was released in the United States on July 23, 2021, byRoadside Attractions. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who were divided on whether it was feel-good and inspirational or reductive and contrived.
In May 2013,Oregonmill worker Joe Bell is walking throughIdahowith his 15-year-old son,Jadin. Nine months prior, Jadin revealed to his parents that he is being bullied at school because he isgay. Joe is accepting although still often uncomfortable; he supports Jadin when he joins the cheerleading squad but asks him to practice in the back yard, worried that their neighbors will pass judgement.
Along the way, they stop at a diner where the news on TV mentionssame-sex marriage. When two patrons make a disparaging remark, Joe tells them about his mission – to walk across America in order to raise awareness againsthomophobicbullying – before leaving hastily. Jadin tells his dad that men like that won't change and that bullying starts with their children, who need to be educated properly about its effects.
Back in 2012, Jadin attends a Halloween party and meets Chance, acloseted homosexual; they share a kiss and begin secretly dating. At a school football game, Jadin is heckled by several people in the crowd for being a cheerleader and his parents get up and leave in embarrassment. Later, he is bullied on social media, but is comforted by his younger brother, Joseph. Chance then ends their relationship, scared that his parents will find out. Back on the road, Joe tells Jadin he was supportive of his cheerleading despite never showing it, and the two reenact Jadin's old routine in the rain after they set up camp for the night.
Joe and Jadin arrive inSalt Lake City, Utah. They check into a motel and Joe goes to agay bar, where he engages with some locals and tells them his son's story. When asked why he didn't bring him, Joe tells them that his son is dead. Joe has been walking alone the whole time; Jadin's presence was all in his mind.
Jadin's mom, Lola, and Joseph visit Joe on the road. Lola shows Joe a note that was left on Jadin's grave, an apology written by one of the boys who had bullied him. Joe reacts angrily and takes it out on Joseph, leaving both him and Lola upset and fearful. When Joe is later spotted by some locals (after having seen him on TV giving speeches at various events) and takes photographs with them, Lola questions if he is walking for Jadin or for the fame. Back home, Lola calls Joe and tells him she found an essay Jadin had written detailing his experiences of bullying and expressing his desire to commitsuicide.
Back in February 2013, Jadin is assaulted in the school locker room by a group of jocks. Joe and Lola meet with the school principal who advises Jadin transfers schools or attends therapy. Jadin tearfully refuses, claiming he is not the one who needs help. The bullying continues, particularly on social media. One morning, Lola finds a suicide note in Jadin's bedroom as a jogger discovers Jadin's body, havinghanged himselfin a nearby park. Lola rushes to the scene to find Jadin has already died. Days later, Joe, who has spiraled into a deep depression, gets into his car with a gun, but Joseph stops him. Joe then decides to walk from Idaho toNew York City, where Jadin always wanted to live.
Joe calls Lola from the road and tells her he cannot walk any further, but she convinces him to keep going for Jadin. Days later, a local sheriff, Gary, stops Joe as he walks the side of the highway. He buys Joe a hot meal and they talk; Gary reveals his son, William, is also gay. He tells Joe that he has never considered that William has ever wanted to take his own life. Joe urges him to tell William that it is okay to be who he is, something he never told Jadin and regrets, knowing he will have to live with that for the rest of his life.
Joe continues walking and sees Jadin again. Joe apologizes and tells Jadin that he always loved him; Jadin says he knows. Joe then calls Lola and apologizes to her also, and thanks her for putting up with him. He promises to be better about staying in touch on the road.
In October 2013, Gary receives a call about a traffic accident inColoradoand arrives at the scene where a semi-truck driver had fallen asleep and hit a pedestrian on the shoulder of theUS 40, killing him instantly. The victim is revealed to be Joe.
The film ends with Joe and Jadin meeting in a field, walking together towards the sunlight. As the credits roll, images and videos of the real Bell family are shown.

On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 40% based on 127 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Good Joe Bell's heartfelt message - and Reid Miller's stirring breakout performance - are unfortunately undermined by formulaic storytelling."[16]OnMetacritic, it has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[17]Audiences surveyed byPostTrakgave the film a 79% positive score, with 57% saying they would definitely recommend it.[15]
Giving it a "C",The A.V. Club'sA. A. Dowd stated "The film has its heart in the right place, but its head is foggy and possibly concussed; it seems uncertain how to reshape its ripped-from-the-headlines story into satisfying drama."[18]Steve Pond ofTheWrapcalled the film "An open-hearted, unapologetically emotional story of a man struggling to come to terms with what happened to his son and with his own complicity in it" and said "[t]here are shocks along the way, handled gently or dropped as a gut punch".[19]
Peter Debruge ofVarietywas more critical, calling the film a "didactic anti-bullying melodrama that feels more akin to old-school TV movies" and saying that "[a] movie like this would be a good start, if this were 1980. A decade and a half afterBrokeback Mountain, however, it feels like a huge step backward."[20]

In 2014, McMurtry received theNational Humanities Medal.[2]
InTracy Daugherty's 2023 biography of McMurtry, the biographer quotes criticDave Hickeyas saying about McMurtry: "Larry is a writer, and it's kind of like being a critter.  If you leave a cow alone, he'll eat grass.  If you leave Larry alone, he'll write books.  When he's in public, he may say hello and goodbye, but otherwise he is just resting, getting ready to go write."[3]
McMurtry's birth certificate states that he was born inWichita Falls, Texas, the son of Hazel Ruth (née McIver) and William Jefferson McMurtry.[4]He grew up on his parents' ranch outsideArcher City, Texas. The city was the model for the town of Thalia which is a setting for much of his fiction.[5]He earned a BA from theUniversity of North Texasin 1958 and an MA fromRice Universityin 1960.[6][7]
In his memoir, McMurtry said that during his first five or six years in his grandfather's ranch house, there were no books, but his extended family would sit on the front porch every night and tell stories. In 1942, McMurtry's cousin Robert Hilburn stopped by the ranch house on his way to enlist for World War II, and left a box containing 19 boys' adventure books from the 1930s. The first book he read wasSergeant Silk: The Prairie Scout.[8]
During the 1960–1961 academic year, McMurtry was a Wallace Stegner Fellow at theStanford UniversityCreative Writing Center, where he studied the craft of fiction underFrank O'ConnorandMalcolm Cowley,[9]alongside other aspiring writers, includingWendell Berry,Ken Kesey,Peter S. Beagle, andGurney Norman. (Wallace Stegnerwas on sabbatical in Europe during McMurtry's fellowship year.[10])
McMurtry and Kesey remained friends after McMurtry left California and returned to Texas to take a year-long composition instructorship atTexas Christian University.[11]In 1963, he returned to Rice University, where he served as a lecturer in English until 1969, and a visiting professor at George Mason College (1970) and American University (1970–71).[12]He entertained some of his early students with accounts of Hollywood and the filming ofHud, for which he was consulting. In 1964, Kesey and hisMerry Prankstersconducted their noted cross-country trip, stopping at McMurtry's home in Houston. The adventure in the day-glo-painted school busFurthurwas chronicled byTom Wolfein his bookThe Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. That same year, McMurtry was awarded aGuggenheim Fellowship.[13]
McMurtry won numerous awards from theTexas Institute of Letters: three times theJesse H. JonesAward—in 1962, forHorseman, Pass By; in 1967, forThe Last Picture Show, which he shared with Tom Pendleton'sThe Iron Orchard; and in 1986, forLonesome Dove. He won theAmon G. Carteraward for periodical prose in 1966 forTexas: Good Times Gone or Here Again?[14]and the Lon Tinkle Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1984.[15]In 1986, McMurtry received the annualPeggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Awardfrom theTulsa Library Trust.[16]He reflected on his 1985 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel,Lonesome Dove, inLiterary Life: A Second Memoir(2009), writing that it was the "Gone With the Windof the West … a pretty good book; it's not a towering masterpiece."[17]
McMurtry described his method for writing novels inBooks: A Memoir. He said that from his first novel on, he would get up early and dash off five pages of narrative. When he published the memoir in 2008, he said this was still his method, although by then, he wrote 10 pages a day. He also wrote every day, ignoring holidays and weekends.[18]McMurtry was a regular contributor toThe New York Review of Books.[19]
McMurtry was a vigorous defender of free speech and, while serving as president of PEN American Center (nowPEN America) from 1989 to 1991, led the organization's efforts to support writerSalman Rushdie,[20]whose novelThe Satanic Verses(1988) causeda major controversyamong someMuslims, with theSupreme Leader of Iran,AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini, issuing afatwācalling for Rushdie's assassination, after which attempts were made on his life.[21]
In 1989, McMurtry testified on behalf of PEN America before theU.S. Congressin opposition to immigration rules in the 1952McCarran–Walter Actthat for decades permitted the visa denial and deportation of foreign writers for ideological reasons.[17]He recounted how before PEN America was to host the 1986 International PEN Congress, "there was a serious question as to whether such a meeting could in fact take place in this country... the McCarran–Walter Act could have effectively prevented such a gathering in the United States." He denounced the relevant rules as "an affront to all who cherish the constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and association. To a writer whose living depends upon the uninhibited interchange of ideas and experiences, these provisions are especially appalling." Subsequently, some provisions that excluded certain classes of immigrants based on their political beliefs were revoked by theImmigration Act of 1990.[22]
While at Stanford, McMurtry became a rare-book scout.[23]During his years inHouston, he managed a book store called the Bookman. In 1969, he moved to the Washington, D.C., area.

It became one of the largest antiquarian bookstores in the United States, carrying between 400,000 and 450,000 titles. Citing economic pressures from Internet bookselling, McMurtry came close to shutting down the Archer City store in 2005, but chose to keep it open after great public support.
In early 2012, McMurtry decided to downsize and sell off the greater portion of his inventory. He felt the collection was a liability for his heirs.[24]The auction was conducted on August 10 and 11, 2012, and was overseen by Addison and Sarova Auctioneers ofMacon, Georgia. This epic book auction sold books by the shelf, and was billed as "The Last Booksale", in keeping with the title of McMurtry'sThe Last Picture Show. Dealers, collectors, and gawkers came outen massefrom all over the country to witness this historic auction. As stated by McMurtry on the weekend of the sale, "I've never seen that many people lined up in Archer City, and I'm sure I never will again."[25]
In April 2006, McMurtry was elected a member of theAmerican Antiquarian Society.[26]
McMurtry became well known for the film adaptations of his work, which were seen by many viewers, especiallyHud(from the novelHorseman, Pass By), starringPaul NewmanandPatricia Neal;[27]thePeter Bogdanovich–directedThe Last Picture Show;[28]James L. Brooks'sTerms of Endearment, which won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture (1984);[29]andLonesome Dove, which became a popular television miniseries starringTommy Lee JonesandRobert Duvall.[30][31]
In 2006, he was co-winner (withDiana Ossana) of both the Best ScreenplayGolden Globe[32]and theAcademy Awardfor Best Adapted Screenplay forBrokeback Mountain, adapted from a short story byE. Annie Proulx. He accepted his Oscar while wearing a dinner jacket overjeansandcowboy boots.[33]In his speech, he promoted books, reminding the audience the movie was developed from a short story. In his Golden Globe acceptance speech, he paid tribute to his Swiss-madeHermes 3000typewriter.[34]
McMurtry married Jo Scott, an English professor who has authored five books.[35]Before divorcing, they had a son together,James McMurtry. Both James and his own son, Curtis McMurtry, are singer/songwriters and guitarists.[36]
In 1991 McMurtry underwent heart surgery.[37]During his recovery, he suffered severe depression. He recovered at the home of his future writing partner Diana Ossana and wrote his novelStreets of Laredoat her kitchen counter.[38][39]
McMurtry married Norma Faye Kesey, the widow of writerKen Kesey, on April 29, 2011, in a civil ceremony in Archer City.[40]
McMurtry died on March 25, 2021, at his home in Tucson, Arizona. He was 84 years old.[41]
It was announced in early 2023 that McMurtry's personal property including his writing desk, typewriters and personal book collection would be sold at public auction by Vogt Auction inSan Antonio,Texas, on May 29, 2023.[42]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
