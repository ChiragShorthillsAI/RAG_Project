The film had alimited theatrical releaseon December 3, 2021, prior to streaming onNetflixon December 10, to a generally positive reception from critics and audiences.
At theAustralian Wildlife ParkinSydney, zookeeper Chaz Hunt has a show that demonstrates scary and deadly animals. Maddie, aninland taipan, appears regularly at the show but is feared by the public. Maddie is supported by Jackie, a motherlysaltwater crocodile, who tells her and her three best friends —Frank, afunnel-web spider, Zoe, athorny devil, and Nigel, amarbled scorpion— about theOutback, a place recognizable with three mountains where creatures like them belong. One day, Jackie is removed from the zoo after she tries to save Chaz's son, Chazzie, from a moat; the staff and patrons believed she was trying to eat him. Saddened and in despair, Maddie decides to escape to the Outback with her companions to find a place where they can live happily. During their escape, Pretty Boy, a celebritykoalaand the group's rival, tries to alert the park's security but is accidentally paralyzed by Nigel when the group try to stop him. The group reluctantly decides to take him with them, but not before he is caught on a security camera exhibiting mouth foam from his paralysis.
While crossingSydney Harbour, they run into Jacinta, agreat white shark, who is part of a mysterious organization called the Uglies Secret Society (USS) where animals considered "monsters" help each other upon hearing the password ("I'm ugly. You’re ugly. We should all be this ugly. Ugly is the new beautiful."). When they reachCircular Quay, Pretty Boy tries to get the attention of the city for rescue but finds that the world misbelieves he has rabies after seeing the footage and he ends getting chased by an angry mob, which corner him, Maddie, and her friends, but Maddie helps them narrowly escape by saying the USS password, sending the group into the sewers. After getting help from Legs, aRedback Spiderand her pack in getting around the sewers, Pretty Boy finds that he has been incorrectly  reported dead and his popularity has been taken by aquokkanamed Giggles. Chaz and Chazzie find the group and attempt to tranquilize them, but they escape via an ice cream truck.
At a school in the outer suburbs, after Maddie frees two lovelorncane toadsnamed Doug and Doreen, the animals get a ride on an excursion bus that takes them to theBlue Mountains. Chaz and Chazzie catch up and the animals get in the bus to hide, but inadvertently cause the bus to be pulled over, allowing Chaz to enter to search the vehicle for them but an Aboriginal girl named Norine allows them to escape. However, Chaz throws Pretty Boy out a window and Frank accidentally sends himself, Maddie, Zoe, and Nigel falling off a cliff, landing on an unconscious Pretty Boy in the process.
Maddie argues with Pretty Boy, who berates her for ruining his popularity and breaks down, but when Maddie tries to comfort him, he bursts into a fit of laughter. At that moment however, Chaz falls off the same cliff as the group did and lands on Maddie, Frank, Zoe, and Nigel, who end up getting all over his face, causing Chaz to panic and he throws them off his face but, in doing so, unknowingly pins Maddie to the ground with a stick. Horrified, Frank, Zoe, and Nigel try to save her, but they fall into a pit that Chaz seals off. Having assumed that Chaz had been trying to rescue him, Pretty Boy gleefully approaches Chaz for him to take him home, but he kicks him away and prepares to sedate Maddie. Feeling betrayed, Pretty Boy says the USS password, which alerts someTasmanian devils, Dave, Lucifer, and Beelzebub, to their presence. They attack Chaz and rescue the others. After the animals escape, Chaz reveals to Chazzie that his adventurous and Aussie wildlife expert history was all a lie and he only moved fromFloridato Australia after being inspired by television shows featuring Australian zookeepers (such asSteve Irwin). He decides to make it up to Chazzie by really going after the animals and bringing them back to the park, though Chazzie is no longer sure about the mission, shocked at the truth of his father.
Over the next few days, the animals are helped by many creatures of the USS (which include Clive, adung beetle, Vlad, abat, Susan and Deirdre, twoRazorbacks, and Phil, aplatypus) on their way to the Outback, while Pretty Boy bonds more with the creatures. One night, Maddie and Pretty Boy form a close friendship; Maddie sings a song that she had sung at the park earlier and was her only memory of her mother: she was washed out of the nest inside her egg by afloodand after a perilous journey, was found on the road by Chaz. Pretty Boy reveals that he was also orphaned, with his mother beingkilled by a moving car. The next day, Pretty Boy finds a tree of koalas, led by a female koala named Skylar, and foolishly leaves the other creatures, to their relief and Maddie's dismay.
Maddie and the others reach the three mountains. Not long after they arrive, Chaz, with the help of a biker crew from a pub, rounds up and captures Frank, Zoe, and Nigel. Chazzie runs into Maddie and is initially scared of her, but warms up to her upon seeing that she is just as scared as he is of her. Chaz, having misinterpreted Chazzie's encounter with Maddie as catching her, captures Maddie as well and places the creatures in boxes in the back of his jeep, but Chazzie, realizing that he would have betrayed his father, sets Maddie free without Chaz noticing, but makes no effort in freeing her friends.
Maddie, who broke down crying over losing her friends, tries to get the animals of the land to help her rescue them, but they initially refuse due to the fact none of them had ever left before. However, Pretty Boy, having found life with the other koalas not as great as he thought due to Skylar being overly chatty and shallow, returns. He cheers her up and agrees to help her rescue her friends. Using afire truck, they catch up to the truck and try to break them out. The rescue becomes a disaster when Pretty unmounts the truck to help Maddie, causing the ladder to spin uncontrollably just as Maddie accepts her friends as her adopted siblings, resulting in Zoe taking advantage of Nigel's fear of the colorbeigeto make him emit a high-pitch scream to break the glass, which even Zoe believed was unbreakable due a sticker meant to discourage humans from breaking it.
Using one of the bikers’ bikes, Maddie and Pretty Boy reunite with their friends and are chased into acanyon, where the Outback inhabitants, having changed their minds about not helping Maddie, and even the other koalas, including Skylar, arrive to help, but everyone is caught in a trap sprung by Clive as a way to get revenge on Chaz for the loss of his deceased brother Duncan, who, prior to the events of the film, tried to escape but ended up getting eaten by aseagull. As a result, they reach a cliff where Chazzie is left dangling over the edge on the ladder. While trying to save Chazzie, Maddie finally stands up to Chaz and tells him that, despite being the dangerous snake on the planet, she is not the monster he says she is and bites his wrist band to help Pretty Boy pull Chazzie to safety. As Maddie is revealed to have molted afterwards, Chaz fully sees these creatures as heroes and decides to let them return to the wild, while also reconciling with Chazzie.
As the Outback inhabitants celebrate the group's heroism, they reunite with Doug and Doreen, who now have numerous children which swarm Pretty Boy, and Jackie, who is revealed to be the head of the USS and had escaped by knowing a few tricks to do so & then ordered the USS that she had founded during her lifetime to help the group on their journey, and they all join their new life in the Outback.
Writer and director Harry Cripps had previously created the concept for the cancelled filmLarrikinswithDreamWorks Animation, which was also supposed to feature a score and music byTim Minchin;[2]the project was revived as a short film titledBilbyin 2018.[3]In an interview withTheWrap, Cripps said thatLarrikinshad "focused on the cute animals, and so I didn't want to go back down that same road, I went to the dark side."[4]Clare Knight, whose previous animated film experience includes her work as Lead Editor of theKung Fu Pandafranchise, said "A lot of executives would say to us, 'A snake? Snakes aren't huggable. Does your lead have to be a snake?' And it was a challenge for us that we really wanted to make these animals appealing."
Initially, while Netflix was concerned about the "huggability of the animal cast", both Knight and Cripps said that working for the streaming giant's animation unit was positively heavenly. "It's been great. Again, we're first-time directors, so Netflix is willing to give us a shot and give us a voice, so we really feel great. We would've felt if this was DreamWorks, we possibly would've been pigeonholed as writer and editor and not necessarily been given this chance. And the fact that we reached such a big, global audience with this great depiction of Australia I think, is a wonderful thing for us."[4]
The film's score was composed byRupert Gregson-Williams. Executive producerAkiva Goldsman, as director, had previously worked with Rupert onWinter's Tale. Rupert had also previously composed the score for animated films such asOver the Hedge,Bee Movie,Postman Pat: The Movie,Open Season: Scared Silly, andAbominable.
The soundtrack features four original songs, including "Hello World" byEvie Irieand "Beautifully Ugly" byTim Minchinand Irie.[7]
All score tracks are composed byRupert Gregson-Williams.
Several other songs were featured in the film and trailers but not included in the soundtrack album:[7][8]
On November 30, 2020,Netflixannounced that the animated filmBack to the Outbackwould make its world debut in late 2021.[9][10]However, in October 2021, it was announced that the film would premiere worldwide on December 10, 2021.[11]It also had alimited theatrical releaseon December 3, prior to its streaming release on Netflix.[12]
In the week following its worldwide release, the film reached Top 10 Lists on Netflix in 64 countries, including Australia and the United States.[13]
On review aggregator websiteRotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 82% based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 6.10/10.[14]OnMetacritic, it has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[15]
Brad Newsome ofThe Sydney Morning Heraldsaid that the "Gorgeous character design and some delightful voice performances elevate this uneven CGI romp in which a bunch of “ugly” Australian animals break out of a zoo and head for the outback."[16]Natalia Winkelman ofThe New York Timeswas also positive, writing: "However generic this movie is in premise, there is wit to be found in its details, and warmth in its message."[17]
Luke Buckmaster ofThe Guardianwas more critical, saying "ho-hum animation won’t thrill viewers whose age exceeds their shoe size." He gave the film a 2 out of 5 rating.[18]

In a 1996 interview withThe Sun-Herald, she spoke of her success and experiences on the show: "I would be stupid to let it go to my head because it could all end tomorrow and I would just fade back into obscurity. I like working onHome and Awaybut it's a heavy workload so I get stressed out a lot. We work about 15 hours a day, including the time it takes to learn lines. I know a lot of people work those sort of hours but I think we really feel it because most of us are young and fairly inexperienced. But I am very grateful because it is good experience. It's like an apprenticeship, but we do it in front of 20 million people so all our mistakes are up for the world to see."[13]For her performance in the series, Fisher received nominations forMost Popular New Talentat the 1995Logie Awards,[14]and forMost Popular Actressat the 1997 ceremony.[15]

AlthoughScooby-Dooreceived negative reviews, the film was a commercial success, grossing US$275.7 million worldwide.[20]On that early stage in her career, Fisher remarked: "I only came out on the back of the movie for the premiere ofScooby Doo. And then, I ended up getting representation and ended up getting a job, almost straight away. So, I was fortunate, in that I didn't have to come out to L.A. and join a queue of however many people, and try to get work. I came in on the back of what was deemed as a big studio movie that had had extraordinary success".[21]She subsequently played supporting roles in the independent filmDallas 362(2003) and the Australian comedyThe Wannabes(also 2003). In his review for the latter, David Rooney ofVarietyfelt that Fisher "adds easy charm and a thinly developed hint of romantic interest", in what he summed as an "uneven but endearing farce about breaking into showbiz".[22]In the comedyI Heart Huckabees(2004), directed byDavid O. Russell, she played what was described as a "punchy little part", by newspaperThe Age.[23]

On her part in the film, she remarked: "It was an interesting character to play, because she was so crazy and lacking in any kind of social etiquette. She doesn't care what anyone thinks." For one particular scene, involving sexual content, she used abody double. "I negotiated that from the beginning, trying to analyse why. I find pornographic violence, just gratuitous and unnecessary than nudity, because there's nothing more peaceful and beautiful".[25]The film was favourably received by critics and made US$285.1 million worldwide.[26]Empiremagazine found Fisher to be an "unexpected, scene-stealing joy",[27]and her performance earned her theBest Breakthrough Performance Awardat the 2006MTV Movie Awardsand twoTeen Choice Awardsnominations.

WhileWedding Dazeopened in second place on its UK opening weekend,[28]the film received mediocre reviews from critics.[29]Nevertheless,Reel Film Reviewsfound the film to be an "irreverent, sporadically hilarious romantic comedy that boasts fantastic performances from stars Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher".[30]In the thrillerThe Lookout(2007), oppositeJoseph Gordon-LevittandMatthew Goode, Fisher played a woman used by a gang leader to seduce a man with lasting mental impairments. Describing on how she took her character, she said: "It was one of those situations where I read the script and thought, 'This is the take. I don't want to play the cliché femme fatale. I don't want to come in and be the woman with the sexual appetite, who wants to take down this man. I want to come in and make her this big beating heart, and innocent a woman who has no identity, who knows the man she's with, who doesn't have an agenda.' Because every character in the script has an agenda. I thought how interesting if my character doesn't have one if she's a victim of her own kindness. So, that was my starting point."[21]WhileThe Lookoutreceived a limited release, the film was favourably received.[31]The comedyHot Rod(also 2007), withAndy Samberg, saw Fisher star as the college-graduate neighbour on whom an amateur stuntman has a crush.

Fisher obtained her first leading film role in the comedyConfessions of a Shopaholic(2009), where she played a college graduate who works as a financial journalist in New York City to support her shopping addiction. She felt "apprehensive" as she took on her firststar vehicle, stating: "I was gobsmacked that anyone would give me my own movie. I am eternally bewildered. Every time I see [producer]Jerry Bruckheimer, I want to shake him and say: 'Are you mad? Why would you put me on a poster?'".[36]Upon its release, the film received lukewarm reviews from critics; whileTime Outdescribed her as "silly and adorable",The Christian Science Monitorremarked: "Isla Fisher is such a bundle of comic energy that watching her spin her wheels in the aggressively unfunnyConfessions of a Shopaholiccounts as cruel and unusual punishment for her as well as for us".[37]Despite the critical response, the film was a commercial success; it opened with US$15 million on its North America opening weekend and went on to gross US$108.3 million worldwide.[38]Fisher received her thirdTeen Choice Awardnomination.[39]

His showDarksidelaunched him into the public eye, achieving critical success at the 2005Melbourne International Comedy Festivaland the2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
Minchin has a background in theatre and has appeared in various stage productions, in addition to small acting roles on Australian television. A documentary film about Minchin,Rock N Roll Nerd(directed by Rhian Skirving), was released theatrically in 2008 and broadcast byABC1in 2009. He is the composer and lyricist of theOlivier Award-winning,Tony Award-winning andGrammy Award-nominated showMatilda the Musicaland the Olivier Award-winning and Tony Award-nominated showGroundhog Day The Musical. In 2013, he played rock star Atticus Fetch onCalifornicationand in 2019 he co-wrote and starred as Lucky Flynn in the TV seriesUpright.
In 2013, theUniversity of Western Australiaawarded Minchin an honoraryDoctor of Lettersdegree for his contribution tothe arts. In 2015 he was awarded a second honorary Doctor of Letters degree from theMountview Academy of Theatre Artsand in 2019 he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Performing Arts fromEdith Cowan University.  He was appointed aMember of the Order of Australiain the2020 Australia Day Honours"for significant service to the performing arts, and to the community".[3]
Timothy David Minchin was born inNorthamptonon 7 October 1975, the son of Australian parents Ros and David Ellison Minchin.[4][5][6]He holds both Australian and British citizenship, as everyoneborn in the UK before 1983was automatically a citizen of the country. His father and grandfather were both surgeons inPerth. He is also descended fromR. E. Minchin, founding director ofAdelaide Zoo.[7]Minchin returned to Australia with his parents and was raised in Perth,[8][9]alongside his elder brother, Dan, and two younger sisters, Katie andNel.[10][6]
Minchin started learning to play the piano at the age of eight, but gave it up after three years because he did not enjoy the discipline. He developed a renewed interest in the instrument after he started writing music with his brother Dan, a guitarist, but still describes himself as a "hack pianist ... a 'more you practise, the better you get' kind of guy".[11]He was educated atChrist Church Grammar School,[11]an independent school in Perth. He graduated from theUniversity of Western Australia(UWA) in 1996 with aBAin English and theatre, and from theWestern Australian Academy of Performing Artsin 1998 with an Advanced Diploma in contemporary music.[12]
Minchin describes his act as a "funny cabaret show" and sees himself primarily as a musician and songwriter as opposed to a comedian; he has said that his songs "just happen to be funny."[13]His reasoning for combining the disciplines of music and comedy was revealed in one interview when he said: "I'm a good musician for a comedian and I'm a good comedian for a musician but if I had to do any of them in isolation I dunno."[14]
He draws on his background in theatre for his distinctive onstage appearance and persona.[9]In his performances, he typically goes barefoot with wild hair and heavy eye makeup, which is juxtaposed with a crisp suit and tails, and a grand piano. According to Minchin, he likes going barefoot in his shows because it makes him feel more comfortable. He considers the eye makeup important because while he is playing the piano he is not able to use his arms and relies on his face for expressions and gestures; the eyeliner makes his features more distinguishable for the audience.[11]He has said that much of his look and persona is about "treading that line between mocking yourself and wanting to be an iconic figure. Mocking the ridiculousness and completely unrealistic dream of being an iconic figure."[15]
The shows consist largely of Minchin's comedic songs and poetry, with subjects including social satire, inflatable dolls, sex fetishes, and his own failed rock star ambitions. In between songs, he performs short stand-up routines.[13]Several of his songs deal with religion, a subject with which Minchin—anatheistand a fan ofRichard Dawkins—says he is "a bit obsessed".[16]He argues that, as one of the most powerful and influential forces in the world, religion should never be off-limits to satirists. He says that his favourite song to perform is "Peace Anthem for Palestine", which reflects his feelings about religious conflict.[17]His comedy also deals withtaboosmore broadly.[18]A prime example of this is the song "Prejudice", which parodies the power awarded to something as simple as a word. In October 2010 he was made a Distinguished Supporter of theBritish Humanist Association.
After graduating from WAAPA in 1998, Minchin started out composing music for documentaries and theatre. In 2000, he wrote and starred in the musicalPopat the Blue Room Theatre in Perth.[19]He released a CD titledSitwith his band Timmy the Dog in 2001 but achieved little success.[20]In 2002, after only one professional acting job, he moved from Perth to Melbourne to pursue work.[21]Minchin struggled initially; he could not get an agent for a year and had been unable to find any acting work.[20]While several record companies gave him encouragement, they were not sure how his music—a mixture of satirical songs and more serious pop songs—could be marketed. He decided to compile all of his humorous songs into a single live show to "get the comedy stuff off my chest" before going back to more serious music.[22]
Minchin says he entered into comedy "naively", having never even attended a live comedy gig before performing one himself.[16]His break-out showDarkside(co-produced by Laughing Stock Productions) achieved critical success at the 2005 Melbourne International Comedy Festival, where it won the inaugural Festival Directors' Award and attracted the notice of Karen Koren, the manager of the well-knownGilded Balloonvenues.[23]Koren backed the show's run at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where Minchin received thePerrier Comedy Awardfor Best Newcomer.[9][24]His 2006 showSo Rockwas nominated for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival's top prize, theBarry Award, and in 2007 he was given the award for Best Alternative Comedian at theHBO US Comedy Arts Festival.[13][25]
Live recordings of his 2005 and 2006 shows,DarksideandSo Rock, have been released as CDs. In 2007, he released a DVD titledSo Live, featuring a live recording in theSydney Opera HouseStudio with material from both of his previous shows.[15]As this DVD was only released in Australia, he released a DVD in 2008 entitledSo F**king Rock Livein the UK, containing largely the same material asSo Live.
In August 2008, Minchin debuted his third solo show,Ready for This?, at the Edinburgh Fringe and subsequently took it on tour across the UK. During the Edinburgh run, he contributed toThe Guardiannewspaper's podcasts,[26]despite his new show containing a song about aGuardiancritic who once gave his show a negative review.[27][28]Responding to the song, which contains graphic violence, the critic laconically remarked that he had not yet had time to listen to it: "Life's too short and I've already done my bit by sitting through that show in Edinburgh."[29]
A live recording of this atQueen Elizabeth Hallin London, was released as an album for download viaiTuneson 20 July 2009. An Australian recording was released in Australia on DVD on 9 September 2009, and then as a United Kingdom release in the second half of 2010.
It was announced at the end of 2009 that one of Minchin's beat poems, "Storm", was to be made into a short animated movie. A blog was launched to accompany the film-making process, and a short trailer was released on 8 January 2010.[30][31]The full movie was launched on YouTube on 7 April 2011.[32]
In the movie, he takes on alternative medicine: "By definition alternative medicine has either not been proved to work, or been proved not to work. Do you know what they call alternative medicine that's been proved to work? Medicine."[32]
Minchin was the subject of the winning entry, by painterSam Leach, in the 2010Archibald Prize, Australia's most important portraiture competition.[33]
Minchin embarked on a new arena tour calledTim Minchin and the Heritage Orchestrastarting at theNIA, Birminghamon Wednesday 8 December 2010. A departure from the structure of his previous live shows, his act was scaled up to be performed with theHeritage Orchestra. It contained a mixture of material, including new songs on the subject of prayer and of rationality (themes which often appear in his previous work). Minchin stated that the aim of incorporating the orchestra into his act was to create a comedy show that would not be ruined by being performed in arenas, as stated in the special features of the DVD and Blu-ray. The show toured the UK and Australia, and was filmed at theRoyal Albert Hallin London for a Blu-ray and DVD that was released in November 2011.[34]
The show also toured Australia under the titleTim Minchin vs. The Orchestras, where he performed with the city state orchestra in each location.
On 30 August 2018, Minchin announced he would be returning to touring with a new show calledBACK, also billed asOld Songs, New Songs, Fuck You Songs. It marked the first time Minchin returned to touring since 2012 (with the exception of a micro tour of Los Angeles in October 2017 calledLeaving LA).
The tour started in Adelaide, touring Australia and New Zealand in March and April 2019, followed by a tour of the UK in October and November 2019.[35]The tour featured new songs such as "Fuck This", "Leaving LA", and "If This Plane Goes Down", as well as songs from his recent musical works such as "When I Grow Up" fromMatilda the Musicaland "Seeing You" fromGroundhog Day. The show also saw Tim reveal a new band that played alongside him for the rest of the night. This band played throughout the show, performing with Minchin for songs ranging from "Cheese" (first introduced inTim Minchin and the Heritage Orchestra), "Prejudice" and new song "I'll Take Lonely Tonight" to a modified version of "If I Didn't Have You". A new song called "15 Minutes (of Shame)" was also performed with the live band.
An Encore tour ofBACKbegan touring in Australia in March 2020, however dates were postponed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic in Australia.[36]The tour resumed in Australia in June and July 2021, followed by an encore tour of the UK in October, November and December 2021.[37]The recording of the final UK shows at theShepherd's Bush Empirewas broadcast to cinemas on 23 November 2022 and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 12 December 2022.

Apart Togetherwas released on 20 November 2020, with a streamed digital concert coinciding with the full album's debut.[40]It received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The Independent called it "crisply observed and tenderly considered.", stating that "Minchin's unswerving commitment to all that good, decent, truthful stuff is irresistible."[41]However, iNews referred to the album as nothing more than an "hour-long vanity project...Minchin obviously has things to say about the world but he hasn't really found the right way to say them", but also admitted that "There are glimmers of great humanity and honesty, small moments of beauty. Minchin excels when he tries less hard."[42]
In 2023, Minchin announced he will perform some informal solo concerts calledAn Unfunny Evening with Tim Minchin and His Pianoat theLyric Theatre, Londonand across the UK and Ireland on a tour, and later from October 2023 in Australia and New Zealand. Unlike his previous comedy shows, it will feature a fluid set list of songs fromApart Together, Matilda, Groundhog Day, his TV and film projects and from his early song-writing days.[43]In June of 2024 it was announced that this show would tour in North America, with two Canadian dates as well as stops in various locations around the U.S.
On 3 December 2024, Minchin announced that he and his band will perform 5 intimate shows to celebrate the opening of the Foundry Theatre at theSydney Lyricfrom 11 to 15 February 2025, titledFirst at the Foundry.

In December 2011, Minchin performed a specially written song called "Woody Allen Jesus"[56]onThe Jonathan Ross Show. However, despite the show's producers andITV'slawyers approving the composition for broadcast, it was removed at the last minute. Responding on his blog, Minchin stated:[57]"Someone got nervous and sent the tape to ITV's director of television, Peter Fincham. And Peter Fincham demanded that I be cut from the show. He did this because he's scared of the ranty, shit-stirring, right-wing press, and of the small minority of Brits who believe they have a right to go through life protected from anything that challenges them in any way."[58]
In August 2012, Minchin appeared onChain Reaction, first being interviewed byDerren Brown, and later interviewingCaitlin Moran.[59]

The BBC received widespread condemnation for cutting the final song, which had been prerecorded, short for timing purposes.
In an interview with Forbes in August 2020, Minchin revealed that while living and working in Los Angeles, he had been pitched a semi-autobiographical sitcom. "There was a project that a writer pitched to Warner Bros., which was a vehicle for me along the lines of a Seinfeld, where there was a character called Tim, who was a musical comedian had moved to LA from London.

The directorMatthew Warchusapproached Minchin after seeing hisReady for This?tour and hearing his songWhite Wine in the Sun. The musical premiered at theCourtyard TheatreinStratford-upon-Avon, running from 9 November 2010 to 30 January 2011, and it began itsWest Endrun at theCambridge Theatreon 25 October 2011 to great critical acclaim, winning a record-breaking 7Laurence Olivier Awardsincluding Best New Musical.[71][72]In 2013,Matildaopened onBroadwayat theShubert Theatre,[73]and earned 12 Tony Award nominations, winning 4.[74]The musical has subsequently been presented worldwide winning numerous awards.

In response to a Twitter Q&A, Minchin revealed that he and a British playwright are currently in early development in writing a new musical, and will begin composing mid-2020. He also revealed that the musical is planned to open in Australia and will be a biographical story opposed to an original or adaptation.[82]

Minchin co-starred asFriar Tuckin the 2018 American filmRobin Hood.[87]
In 2021 his voiceover work included Busker K. Bushy, Esq. inPeter Rabbit 2: The Runawayand Pretty Boy inBack to the Outbackwhich he also wrote and performed the single "Beautiful Ugly" withEvie Irie.

During his 2009 interview forAustralian Skeptics' podcastThe Skeptic Zone, Minchin addressed his performance style as one that allows bringing up issues that can be upsetting or judgemental to others, such as the "moral hypocrisy about the idea that the Bible is perfect, the only place that you need to go to for your moral guidance ... and about, obviously, prejudice in the church, its role in ostracising homosexuals ... your defences are down when you're laughing as well and it's couched in music. All I'm doing is making things consumable that are otherwise difficult to consume."[89]
As the son and grandson of medical surgeons, Minchin addressedalternative medicineclaims by relating that unbiased tests for efficacy are the key:
You're in such a strong position when you understand the scientific process because all you say is, "Do you understand that the great breakthrough of humanity was figuring out how to make decisions about things whilst discarding human foibles? So, anecdotal evidence involves all your subjectivity—if we do it like this we don't have that anymore. Why, surely do you understand howpowerfulthat is?" And if they don't, then that's what you have to explain to them. It's an extremely powerful thing and a very basic thing.[89]
Minchin further explained hisskepticaloutlook:
I've always been an atheist; I've always been an empiricist really. I've never believed in ghosts or psychics or anything like that 'cause it's quite simple—you don't have to know much to go, "Really?" Or, to just applyOccam's Razor, to go, "Is it more likely that souls do circus tricks, or more likely that they're talking to dead people? And if the latter, by what process? What do you mean talking to dead people? Aren't their voice boxes rotten? So without a voice box, how do they talk, and by what means?" It doesn't take much to be skeptical about that. But really understanding, as I'm still learning, why science is powerful, is a new step towards being boring at dinner parties.[89]
When asked if he thought the universe is full of life, Minchin summarised: "The chances of this happening might be one in infinity. Put it this way: the chance that there being intelligent alien life are, for me, infinitely higher than the chance there being a creator god."[89]
In an interview withIndependent Investigations Groupmember John Rael, Minchin explains that what upsets him most about paranormal beliefs is "special pleading" by people who say vague things such as "there is no harm in it". Minchin states that there is very little harm in something likereiki, but asks "where do you draw the line?" when it comes to needing real evidence if a therapy works or not. He states that he is an atheist as well as a sceptic, and cannot understand how someone can be a sceptic and still be religious. "If you apply doubt to anything ... the whole religion thing is obviously a fantasy."[90]
In 2016, during the course of Australia'sRoyal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual AbuseMinchin wrote "Come Home (Cardinal Pell)", which criticised CardinalGeorge Pell. Launched on Channel Ten'sThe Project, it received wide publicity but was highly controversial.[91]Immediately after its debut, journalistSteve Pricecriticised the piece, describing it as "personal abuse" of Pell.[92]Liam Viney described it as being aprotest songand analysed its mechanics.[93]Minchin later described it as "the most overt piece of activism I've done".[94]
The royal commission had been called to investigate how institutions like schools, churches, and government organisations have responded to allegations and instances of child sexual abuse.[95]When the royal commissioner granted the 74-year-old George Pell permission to appear as a witness via video link from Rome, rather than attend in person as he had previously done, Minchin wrote the song "Come Home (Cardinal Pell)". In response, a statement from Pell's office said the cardinal had led the battle against child abuse in the church for 20 years.[96]Attorney GeneralGeorge Brandistold ABC TV that giving evidence by video was "not at all unusual".[97]
The song helped fund journeys to Rome for victims of sex abuse so they could watch the cardinal deliver his evidence,[98]with aGoFundMeaccount set up byThe ProjecthostsMeshel LaurieandGorgi Coghlan.[99]The ABC7.30programme noted on 17 February 2016: "the song's going viral with almost 200,000 YouTube views" but "supporters of Cardinal Pell say it's verbal abuse set to music."[91]Jesuit human rights lawyerFrank Brennansaid it risked endangering the integrity of the royal commission.[100]Conservative columnistAndrew Boltdescribed the song as a "hymn of hatred".[101]
"Come Home (Cardinal Pell)" reached No. 11 on the Australian Singles Chart, for the week of 20 February 2016.[102][103]Later, it was nominated forAPRA's Song of the Year,[104]andKate Miller-Heidkeperformed the song at the APRA Music Awards ceremony.[105]
In 2017, during theAustralian Marriage Law Postal SurveyMinchin sang "I Still Call Australia Homophobic"[106]– a re-work ofPeter Allen's, "I Still Call Australia Home"[107]– that refers to those supporting the "No" case as homophobic and "bigoted cunts".[108]The Minchin video was shown on theABC InsidersTV current affairs program.[109]He was criticised by politiciansTony AbbottandMitch Fifield.[109][110]
Minchin and his wife Sarah, whom he married in 2001 and with whom he has a daughter and a son,[111]returned to Australia from Los Angeles in December 2017.[86]They currently live inSydney.[112][113]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
