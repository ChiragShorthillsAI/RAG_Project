Breaking News in Yuba Countywas released in the United States on February 12, 2021, byAmerican International Pictures, making it the company's first release since the 1980 filmDressed to Kill.
Timid Sue Buttons lives inKentuckywith her husband, Karl. She wishes to be more assertive, but others constantly take advantage of her. Unbeknownst to Sue, Karl's ex-convict brother Petey has unwillingly involved him inmoney laundering.
Karl has to launder three million dollars through Mina and Ray for her father, Mr. Kim. Sue, whose birthday has been ignored by everyone, drives to Karl's bank to confront him about forgetting her birthday. As she arrives, spotting Karl with flowers, she believes he is planning a surprise. Sue follows him to amotelwhere he is meeting hismistressLeah and walks in on them in the act. The shock and physical exertion causes Karl's heart to stop. After ordering Leah out, Sue watches TV host Gloria Michaels' program about missing child Emma Rose and decides to pretend that Karl has gone missing to receive attention and validation.
Sue buries Karl and his possessions near the motel, then files a missing persons report, but is ignored by the officers, including Detective Cam Harris. Frustrated, she trashes her home but is interrupted by her half-sister, local news reporter Nancy. Sue claims that she woke up, found her house ransacked, and assumes Karl has been abducted.
Nancy interviews Sue on the air, getting lots of local attention. Detective Harris arrives to investigate and is suspicious of Sue's inconsistent story. Petey confronts Mina and Ray about Karl's disappearance and Mina extorts him for twenty thousand dollars. After discovering Karl hadn't deposited the cash, they assume he has fled with it.
Sue gives an interview to Gloria Michaels suggesting that Karl was kidnapped as he knew who had taken Emma Rose, attracting even more attention. Petey and his boss Rita rob a jewelry store to raise the money to pay off Mina. When he delivers the ransom Mina tells him Karl will be released. Mina and Ray ambush Sue at her home looking for Karl, but leave without harming her.
Before Nancy can interview Sue and Emma Rose's parents together, Leah confronts Sue. She attempts to extort her for the missing three million, which Sue knows nothing about (she buried it, along with Karl's things). Their conversation is witnessed by Detective Harris. Sue then tells Mina that Leah knows where Karl is, so she and Ray kidnap her.
Harris, not able to question Leah and believing Sue is behind her disappearance, detains her for questioning. Nancy videos the arrest and then tips off the media, so a large crowd forms outside the police station. The interrogation is interrupted by Harris's captain, who removes her from the case and releases Sue.
Meanwhile, Rita and Petey kidnap Mina to negotiate Karl's release. However, Mr. Kim mistakenly believes that Leah is the hostage that is being negotiated for. Leah lies to him that Sue has both Mina and the money, but is killed by Ray and Mr. Kim with adrill press.
Petey receives a call that Jonelle is going into labour. When he arrives home, she reveals that she has found jewelry from the robbery, and gives him an ultimatum to give up his life of crime. Back at Rita's store, both she and her wife Debbie are shot dead by Ray, who has come to rescue Mina, after Debbie kills Mina with ahatchet. He then sets fire to the store. Petey returns to the store as Ray arrives at Petey and Jonelle's house to kill them, but she ambushes and kills him with a knife.
Sue is picked up from the police station by Nancy, who reveals that Sue's conversation with Leah was recorded by one of the interview microphones. When she demands the truth, Sue accuses her of being upset that she is getting more attention than her.
At Sue's, Mr. KimkneecapsNancy, so Sue confesses the truth. He brings her to the motel at gunpoint, while Harris and her partner are there investigating. Harris finds security footage of Sue at the motel.
As she is leaving, Harris spots Sue and Mr. Kim. After digging up the money, he plans to kill her until they are surprised by Harris and her partner. Mr. Kim shoots and kills Harris' partner and is shot by Harris; Sue truthfully screams that she didn't know about the money to an unmoved Harris, but the not-yet-dead Mr. Kim shoots Harris before Harris shoots him fatally. Sue tries to apologize to the dying Harris, who tells her to fuck herself before she expires.
Sizing up the situation, Sue realizes she can get off scot-free as the police will determine that Mr. Kim killed Karl and the officers before he could kill her. Emma Rose, the missing child, is found safe at a bus stop inMiami, Florida, having run away from home. One year later, Sue has written a bestselling book about her experience and is interviewed by her 'friend' Gloria Michaels.

American International Pictures LLC[1](AIPorAmerican International Productions) is an Americanfilm productioncompany owned byAmazon MGM Studios. In its original operating period, AIP was an independent film production anddistributioncompany known for producing and releasing films from 1955 until 1980, a year after its acquisition byFilmwaysin 1979.
It was formed on April 2, 1954, asAmerican Releasing Corporation(ARC) by formerRealart Pictures Inc.sales managerJames H. Nicholsonand entertainment lawyerSamuel Z. Arkoff[2]and their first release was the 1953 UK documentary filmOperation Malaya. It was dedicated to releasing low-budget films packaged asdouble features, primarily of interest to theteenagersof the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.
The company eventually became a part ofOrion Pictures, which in turn, became a division of Amazon MGM Studios. On October 7, 2020, four decades after the original closure,MGMrevived AIP as a label for acquired films for digital and theatrical releases, with MGM overseeing across streaming platforms andUnited Artists Releasinghandling theatrical distribution in North America until 2023 when Amazon MGM Studios took over.
Nicholson and Arkoff served asexecutive producerswhileRoger CormanandAlex Gordonwere the principalfilm producersand, sometimes, directors. WriterCharles B. Griffithwrote many of the early films, along with Arkoff's brother-in-law, Lou Rusoff, who later produced many of the films he had written. Other writers includedRay Russell,Richard MathesonandCharles Beaumont.Floyd Crosby,A.S.C.famous for his camera work on a number of exotic documentaries and theOscarwinner,High Noon, was chief cinematographer. His innovative use of surreal color and odd lenses and angles gave AIP films a signature look. The early rubber monster suits and miniatures ofPaul Blaisdellwere used in AIP'sscience fiction films. The company also hiredLes Baxter[3]andRonald Steinto compose many of its film scores.
In the 1950s, the company had a number of actors under contract, includingJohn Ashley,Fay SpainandSteve Terrell.
When many of ARC/AIP's first releases failed to earn a profit, Arkoff quizzed film exhibitors who told him of the value of the teenage market as adults were watching television.[4][5]AIP stopped making Westerns with Arkoff explaining: "To compete with television westerns you have to have color, big stars and $2,000,000".[6]: 126
AIP was the first company to usefocus groups,[7]polling American teenagers about what they would like to see and using their responses to determine titles, stars, and story content. AIP would question their exhibitors (who often provided 20% of AIP's financing[6]: 35) what they thought of the success of a title, then would have a writer create a script for it.[6]: 156A sequence of tasks in a typical production involved creating a great title, getting an artist such as Albert Kallis who supervised all AIP artwork from 1955 to 1973[8]to create a dynamic, eye-catching poster, then raising the cash, and finally writing and casting the film.
According to Filmink, "AIP ran on basic principles: keep overheads down (i.e. no permanent studio space), keep all costs down, use fading stars (eg Ray Milland) or its own up-and-coming names (eg John Ashley), use cheap directors, go for genre (horror, sci fi, action, peplum), follow the trends, abandon the trends when audience enthusiasm lessens, give audiences something they can’t get from a regular studio picture, build your own franchises."[9]
Samuel Z. Arkoff related his tried-and-true "ARKOFF formula" for producing a successful low-budget movie years later, during a 1980s talk show appearance. His ideas for a movie included:
Later, the AIP publicity department devised a strategy called "the Peter Pan Syndrome":
a) a younger child will watch anything an older child will watch;b) an older child will not watch anything a younger child will watch;c) a girl will watch anything a boy will watch;d) a boy will not watch anything a girl will watch;therefore:to catch your greatest audience you zero in on the 19-year-old male.[10]
AIP began as the American Releasing Corporation, a new distribution company formed in 1954 by James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff.
They were interested in distributing a car chase movie produced byRoger Cormanfor his Palo Alto Productions,The Fast and the Furious(1955). Corman had received offers from other companies for the film, but ARC offered to advance money to enable Corman to make two other films. Corman agreed,The Fast and the Furiousperformed well at the box office and the company was launched.[citation needed]
Corman's next two films for the company were a Western,Five Guns West(1955), which Corman directed, and a science fiction film,The Beast with a Million Eyes(1955). The title from the latter had come from Nicholson.
ARC also distributed the WesternOutlaw Treasure(1955) starringJohnny Carpenter.
ARC got Corman to direct another Western and science fiction double billApache Woman(1955) andDay the World Ended(1955). Both scripts were written by Arkoff's brother-in-lawLou Rusoff, who would become the company's leading writer in its early days.Apache Womanwas produced by Alex Gordon, an associate of Arkoff's,Daywas produced by Corman. Both were made by Golden State Productions, ARC's production arm.[11][12]
Normally, B movies were made for the second part of a bill and received a flat rate. As television was encroaching on the B movie market, Nicholson and Arkoff felt it would be more profitable to make two low budget films and distribute them together on adouble feature. Nicholson came up with a title for a film to supportDay the World Ended,The Phantom from 10,000 Leagues(1955), but lacked the money to make both films. They split the costs with Dan and Jack Milner, film editors who wanted to get into production. The resulting double bill was very successful at the box office.[11]
Gordon also producedThe Oklahoma Woman(1955), a Western by Corman, made through Sunset Productions. It was put on a double feature withFemale Jungle(1955), afilm noir.
Other films released under the ARC banner include a British documentaryOperation Malaya(1955) and Corman'sGunslinger(1956).
Arkoff and Nicholson had always wanted to name their company "American International Pictures", but the name was unavailable. When the name became available, they changed over.
There were three main production arms at AIP in the late 1950s: Roger Corman, Alex Gordon & Lou Rusoff, and Herman Cohen. Arkoff and Nicholson would buy films from other filmmakers as well, and import films from outside America.
Corman continued to be an important member of AIP (though he also worked for Allied Artists and his own Filmgroup company during this period). He had a big hit for the company with the science fiction filmIt Conquered the World(1956) from a script by Rusoff that was rewritten byCharles B. Griffith.
His films includedRock All Night(1956);Naked Paradise(1957), in which Arkoff had a small role;The Undead;Sorority Girl;The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent(1957);Machine Gun KellywithCharles Bronson; andTeenage Caveman(1958), withRobert Vaughn.
AIP also distributed films Corman helped finance, such asNight of the Blood Beast,She Gods of Shark ReefandThe Brain Eaters(all released in 1958).
The other key producer for AIP was Alex Gordon who mostly made films though his Golden State Productions outfit, usually written byLou Rusoff. He madeGirls in Prison(1956), with directorEdward L. Cahnwho would become one of AIP's most prolific directors. AIP released it on a double bill withHot Rod Girl(1956).
Cahn also directed the following for Gordon:The She-Creature(released as a double feature withIt Conquered the World);Flesh and the Spur, the last Western made by AIP;Shake, Rattle & Rock!, a rock musical withMike Connors;Runaway Daughters(1956);Voodoo Woman;Dragstrip Girl(1957), withJohn Ashley;Motorcycle Gang(1957), again with Ashley;Jet AttackandSubmarine Seahawk(1958). Most of these were written by Rusoff and directed byEdward L. Cahn.
Gordon left AIP and Rusoff alone producedHot Rod Gang(1958) andGhost of Dragstrip Hollow(1959).
Another key producer for AIP wasHerman Cohen, who had a huge hit withI Was a Teenage Werewolf(1957) starringMichael Landon. He followed it withI Was a Teenage Frankenstein,Blood of Dracula(both also in 1957 as a double feature),How to Make a Monster(1958),The Headless GhostandHorrors of the Black Museum(both in 1959).
Other key collaborators who worked for AIP in the late 1950s included:
AIP would flesh out their distribution schedule by buying films made by outside producers. These includedThe Astounding She-Monster, the documentaryNaked Africa,The Screaming Skull(1957),The Cool and the Crazy,Daddy-O,Dragstrip RiotandTank Battalion(1958).
AIP developed a mutual relationship with Britain'sAnglo-Amalgamatedwho would distribute AIP's product in the UK. In return, AIP would distribute their films in the U.S., such asThe Tommy Steele Story(1957) andCat Girl(1957).[14]
AIP also importedThe White Huntress(1954, England),Pulgarcito(1958, Mexico) andThe Sky Calls(1959, Russia).
AIP became a victim of its own success when other companies started copying its double feature strategy. Costs were rising and were not compensated by increased box office grosses. AIP shut down most of their production arms and focused on distributing films from Italy, while they decided what to do next.
In October 1959 AIP announced it had secured finance from Colonial Bank (who had financed three of their films to date) for ten films over the next 12 months. The remaining 14 to 20 projects planned were paid by Pathe Laboratories. The ten films wereDiary of a High School Bride,Drag Race,The Haunted House of Usher,End of the World,World Without Women,Bombs Away,Blood Hill,Take Me To Your Leader,SheandEve and the Dragon. Not all of these would be made.[15]
The company moved into rented office space at the formerChaplin Studios.
In the late 1950s, AIP kept their company afloat by importing films from Italy. These includedSheba and the Gladiator(1959),Goliath and the Barbarians(1959) andBlack Sunday(1960); the latter film proved to be one of the company's early successes.
There was alsoAtomic Agent(1959, France),The Angry Red Planet(1959, Denmark),Tiger of Bengal(1959) andThe Indian Tomb(1960) fromFritz Langin Germany, edited together asJourney to the Lost City,Portrait of a Sinner(1959, West Germany),The Professionals(1960, Great Britain), andEscape to Paradise(1960, the Philippines).
They also boughtWhy Must I Die?andThe Jailbreakers(1960).
In the early 1960s, AIP gained kudos by combiningRoger Corman,Vincent Priceand the stories ofEdgar Allan Poeinto a series of horror films, with scripts byRichard Matheson,Charles Beaumont,Ray Russell,R. Wright CampbellandRobert Towne.
The original idea, usually credited[who?]to Corman and Lou Rusoff, was to take Poe's story "The Fall of the House of Usher", which had both a high name-recognition value and the merit of being in thepublic domain, and thusroyalty-free, and expand it into a feature film. Corman convinced the studio to give him a larger budget than the typical AIP film so he could film the movie in widescreen and color, and use it to create lavish sets as well.[16]
The success ofHouse of Usherled AIP to finance further films based on Poe's stories. The sets and special effects were often reused in subsequent movies (for example, the burning roof of the Usher mansion reappears in most of the other films asstock footage), making the series quite cost-effective. All the films in the series were directed by Roger Corman, and they all starred Price exceptThe Premature Burial, which featuredRay Millandin the lead. It was originally produced for another studio, but AIP acquired the rights to it.[16]
As the series progressed, Corman made attempts to change the formula. Later films added more humor to the stories, especiallyThe Raven, which takes Poe's poem as an inspiration and develops it into an all-out farce starring Price,Boris KarloffandPeter Lorre; Karloff had starred in a 1935 film with the same title. Corman also adaptedH. P. Lovecraft's short novelThe Case of Charles Dexter Wardin an attempt to get away from Poe, but AIP changed the title to that of an obscure Poe poem,The Haunted Palace, and marketed it as yet another movie in the series. The last two films in the series,The Masque of the Red DeathandThe Tomb of Ligeia, were filmed in England with an unusually long schedule for Corman and AIP.
Although Corman and Rusoff are generally credited with coming up with the idea for the Poe series, in an interview on theAnchor BayDVD ofMario Bava'sBlack Sabbath,Mark Damonclaims that he first suggested the idea to Corman. Damon also says that Corman let him directThe Pit and the Pendulumuncredited. Corman's commentary forPitmentions nothing of this and all existing production stills of the film show Corman directing.
During the early 1960s, AIP produced a series of horror films inspired by the Poe cycle. Of eight films, seven feature stories that are actually based on the works of Poe.
Seven of the films, with the exception ofThe Premature Burial, featuredVincent Priceas the star. Occasionally, Corman's 1963 filmThe Terror(produced immediately afterThe Raven) is recognized as being part of the Corman-Poe cycle, although the film's story and title are not based on any literary work of Poe.
Some Poe films announced by AIP but not made includeThe Gold Bug,The Thousand and Second Tale of Scheherazade, andThe Angel of the Odd.[17]
In 1962, Arkoff said AIP was in a position similar toColumbia Picturesjust before they madeSubmarineandDirigible:
Before that they were on poverty row. Our better position will enable us to obtain more important writers, perhaps more important producers as well. We're a privately owned company at the moment but perhaps within two or three years we will become a public company.[18]
Beginning with 1963'sBeach Party, AIP created a new genre ofbeach party filmsfeaturingAnnette FunicelloandFrankie Avalon. The original idea and the first script were Rusoff's. The highly successful and often imitated series ended in 1966 with the seventh film,The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini. Many actors from the beach films also appeared in AIP's spy-spoofs, such asDr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine(1965) and car racing films likeFireball 500(1966) andThunder Alley. During this time, AIP also produced or distributed most of Corman's horror films, such asX: The Man with the X-ray Eyes.
In 1966, the studio releasedThe Wild AngelsstarringPeter Fonda, based loosely on the real-life exploits of theHells Angelsmotorcycle gang.  This film ushered in AIP's most successful year and kicked off a subgenre ofmotorcycle gang filmsthat lasted almost 10 years and includedDevil's Angels,The Glory StomperswithDennis Hopper, andThe Born Losers—the film that introduced theBilly Jackcharacter.
In 1968, AIP launched a $22 million film programme.[19]Thepsychedelicandhippiescenes of the late '60s were also exploited with films likeThe Trip, also with Fonda,Riot on Sunset Strip,Wild in the Streets,Maryjane,Gas-s-s-sandPsych-OutwithJack Nicholson. These "social protest" films were also highly successful. Horror movies also enjoyed a revival of popularity in the late 60s.[20]
In the UK, AIP struck up a film making partnership withNat CohenandStuart Levy'sAnglo-Amalgamated. Anglo eventually released over 140 AIP-made or owned movies in the UK, mainly on double bills. The arrangement also saw Anglo Amalgamated's British-made films distributed in the US by AIP. AIP's co-productions with Anglo includedCat Girl,Circus of HorrorsandThe Masque of the Red Death. AIP also had co-production arrangements withTigon British Film Productions,Hammer Film ProductionsandAmicus Productions. Amongst the movies made under these arrangements wereWitchfinder General,The Vampire LoversandScream and Scream Again. AIP maintained a production office in London until 1973 before it was closed down. Nevertheless, the company remained active in making and financing British films, includingHennessyandThe People that Time Forgot. They were also, briefly, involved in setting up two Hammer projects-VampirellaandTo the Devil a Daughter(AIP distributed the latter on its initial US run.)
On a trip to Italy, Arkoff metFulvio Lucisano, an Italian screenwriter and producer who eventually headed Italian International Film,[citation needed]which co-produced 25 films in Italy for AIP.[21]Due to importing completed productions from other foreign countries being cheaper and simpler than producing their own in-house studio films in America, AIP had released manygiallo,peplum,EurospyandMacaroni Combatwar filmsfeaturing many American stars and Italian stars such as thecomedy teamofFranco and Ciccio. However, AIP released only twoSpaghetti Westerns(Massacre TimeretitledThe Brute and the BeastandGod Forgives... I Don't!), perhaps recalling their failure with Westerns in the 1950s. Many of these films were edited, rewritten with different (dubbed English) dialogue, usually by Arkoff's nephewTed Rusoff, and sometimes re-scored by Les Baxter.
AIP, throughHenry G. Saperstein, is known for being the major U.S. distributor forToho'sGodzillaandDaiei'sGamera(kaiju) films of the 1960s and 1970s. AIP also distributed other Japanese science fiction films likeFrankenstein Conquers the World,Monster from a Prehistoric Planet,The X from Outer Spaceand theSouth KoreanproductionYongary, Monster from the Deep, as well as two Japanese animated features fromToei Animation,Alakazam the GreatandJack and the Witch.
AIP also released a pair of Japanese spy thrillers re-dubbed as a comedy co-written byWoody AllencalledWhat's Up Tiger Lily?.[22]
The studio also released edited and English-dubbed versions of severalEastern Blocscience fiction films that had the dialogue rewritten for the American market and in some cases had additional scenes filmed with American and British actors. These include the Soviet filmPlaneta Bur(Planet of Storms) which was released by AIP in two different English-dubbed versions, asVoyage to the Prehistoric PlanetandVoyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Womenand the highly regarded 1963 Czech science fiction filmIkarie XB-1, which was re-titledVoyage to the End of the Universe.
A few years later, AIP backed a British Poe film directed byGordon Hessler:The Oblong Box(1969) based onthe short story of the same name.
In 1964, AIP became one of the last film studios to start its own television production company,American International Productions Television(a.k.a.American-International TelevisionorAIP-TV).[23]AIP-TV at first released many of their 1950s films to American television stations, then filmed unsuccessfultelevision pilotsforBeach PartyandSergeant Deadhead. The company then made several color sci-fi/horrortelevision filmsbyLarry Buchananthat were remakes of black-and-white AIP films, and sold packages of many English-dubbed European, Japanese and Mexican films (the last type were produced byK. Gordon Murray) and foreign-made live-action and animated TV series (includingPrince Planet). The best known animated series AIP-TV distributed wasSinbad Jr. and his Magic Belt.
In order to allay the fears of cinema owners who feared current releases would soon end up being shown on television, AIP issued a statement retroactive to 1963 that the company would not release any of their films to television until five years after cinema release, unless the film had not made back its original negative costs.[24]AIP-TV also filmed specials for promotion of AIP films, such asThe Wild Weird World of Dr. Goldfoot(1965, ABC) andAn Evening of Edgar Allan Poe(1972, syndication), both withVincent Price.
In 1978, AIP-TV distributed the pop music seriesTwiggy's Jukebox. For several years around this time, AIP-TV also distributed several British TV series, includingThe Avengers, to U.S. stations.
AIP started their own record label,American International Records, in 1959[25]to release music used in their films. There were a number of soundtrack albums as well.[26]
AIP Records was once distributed byMGM Records,[27]the record label owned by AIP's successor-in-interest MGM.
In 1969, AIP went public to raise extra capital, issuing 300,000 shares.[28][29]
In 1970, they entered into an agreement withCommonwealth United Entertainmentto issue their films.[30]In 1971 they released 31 films, their greatest number to date, and were seen as one of the most stable companies in Hollywood.[31]Despite their exploitation roots, they did not concentrate on R- or X-rated filmmaking during this period.[32]
In 1972, James H. Nicholson resigned from AIP to set up his own production company working out of20th Century Fox, called Academy Pictures Corporation; its only two releases wereThe Legend of Hell HouseandDirty Mary, Crazy Larry.[33][34]AIP bought out over 100,000 of Nicholson's shares.[35]He died shortly thereafter of a cancerous brain tumor.[36]
Around this timeRoger Cormanstopped making films for AIP, focusing on his company,New World Pictures. According toFilmink"Corman leaving AIP coincided with Nicholson and Arkoff splitting up – they were like two parents who decide to get divorced when their eldest child finally moves out of home."[37]
Arkoff continued on at AIP as president until the end of the decade. Heads of production during the 1970s includedLarry Gordon(from January 1972 until early 1974)[38]andJere Henshaw(from 1977 until the demise of the company).
By the early 1970s, AIP felt the horror movie cycle was in decline and so switched to other genres, such as kung fu and gangsters.[39]Notably, they produced some of that decade'sblaxploitationfilms, likeBlaculaandFoxy Brown. In a throwback to the old "studio days", the company is credited with makingPam Griera household name, as the majority of her early '70s films were made under contract to American International.
In the mid- to late 1970s, AIP began to produce more mainstream films, such asBunny O'Hare,Cooley High,The Great Scout & Cathouse Thursday,The Amityville Horror,Love at First Bite,Meteor,Force 10 from Navarone,Shout at the Devil,The Island of Dr. MoreauandC.H.O.M.P.S.[40]The increased spending on these projects, though they did make some money, contributed to the company's downfall. In the meantime, the studio imported and released its final foreign film, an Australian film,Mad Max, dubbed intoAmerican English.
James Nicholson's first wife Sylvia was still a major shareholder of the company. She sued AIP for mismanagement, but this was resolved in 1978 when AIP bought out her shares.[41]
By the late 1970s, filmmaking costs continued to rise, AIP's tactic of moving into bigger budgeted quality pictures was not paying off at the box office, and Arkoff began to think of merging the company. "We've been theWoolworthsof the movie business but Woolworths is being out priced", said Arkoff.[42]Talks began withFilmways, Incorporated. Negotiations stalled for a while,[43]but resumed a number of months later.[44]In 1979, AIP was sold to Filmways for $30 million and became a subsidiary production unit thereof, renamed Filmways Pictures in 1980.[45][46]
Arkoff was unhappy with the direction of the company and resigned to set up his own production company, receiving a pay out worth $1.4 million.[47][48]
AIP-TV was absorbed as the wholly owned program syndication arm of Filmways Television. Filmways was later bought by Orion Pictures Company in 1982 and Filmways was later renamedOrion Pictures Corporation, but retained the distribution arm. This allowed Orion to establish its own distribution, after utilizingWarner Bros.for distribution. Warner Bros. still has distribution rights to Orion films which were originally distributed by this company. Today, a majority of the AIP library is owned byAmazon MGM Studios(via Orion Pictures). The American International name is still a registered trademark owned by Amazon MGM Studios's Orion Pictures unit.[49][50]
On October 7, 2020, it was announced that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer relaunched AIP as a label for films that the studio will acquire for digital and limited theatrical releases. An MGM executive, Eric Hohl, was accepted as a president of the studio. MGM will oversee AIP's new films across all streaming platforms and the theatrical releases of them will be handled by its joint distribution ventureUnited Artists Releasing. The first film from the relaunched AIP wasBreaking News in Yuba County, directed byTate Taylorand starringAllison Janney, which was released on February 12, 2021.[51]

I could've gone to school until I was 75 years old as long as somebody would've paid my rent. I would've been a professional student."[5]
She wanted a career with impact and envisioned a career in writing or journalism, but Hall's first semester of graduate school changed drastically when her father died of astroke.[8]"It was sudden. And I think when sudden events that are painful happen in your life, you know, they redirect your course," Hall reflected. "When you're young, you don't grasp the gravity of life. But when you lose someone that you spend most of your life with, and you're young, you do. And so I think that started me thinking about what I really wanted to do in life. And I know my father would have wanted me to finish school. So I did that."[9]She began a career in the entertainment industry, starting off with a guest appearance onSadat X's 1996 albumWild Cowboyson the track, "The Interview".

Mickey and Mallory are a Bonnie and Clyde for the '90s, Stone's '90s; they're damaged goods — haunted, horny and out for blood.Harrelsonand Lewis ... play the dysfunctional hell out of them ... Women don't [usually] dominate Stone films [but] Lewis towers overKillers, finding the wildcat and the bruised child in Mallory.[39]

The distance between riot grrrl and suburban mom is quite a stretch. But as middle age approaches, time has a way of landing mouthy young rebels in roles they never expected to inhabit. Take Juliette Lewis, the personification of scary defiance [in]Natural Born Killers... InKelly & Cal, [she] conveys the excruciating discomfort of a slightly crumpled former upstart struggling to adapt to a staid, middle-class existence. That means reining in the anarchic impulses of her youth and tolerating polite, buttoned-up in-laws.[90]
Lewis' next role was inJem and the Holograms(2015), an adaptation of the 1980s animated seriesJem,[91]where she played a music producer.

Natalie is nothing like myself. But because there's certain things, like 'tough' and 'wrong side of the tracks' or whatever, people think it's something I've played before, but I haven't. [It has taken] me like 30 years for people to go, 'Wow, she does unpredictable stuff, and it's high quality'".[111]During that same period, Lewis appeared as Judy onPeacock's reboot ofQueer as Folk(2022) and co-starred in the biographical Hulu miniseriesWelcome to Chippendales(also 2022).Richard Roepercalled the latter "colorful and shiny but increasingly dark and twisted" in his review for theChicago Sun-Times, adding that Lewis' portrayal of forthright costume designer Denise Coughlan was "outstanding".[112]

Lewis married professional skateboarderSteve Berrain September 1999.[122]She filed for divorce in April 2003.[123]Lewis described the divorce as "amicable",[123]later commenting, "Steve would be the first to admit he was a workaholic. You have to be ready to have a partnership. And sometimes you're like, 'Whoa, this is too much. I only actually have enough steam to focus on my own thing'".[32]
Lewis has supportedLittle Kids Rock, an American nonprofit organization that works to restore and revitalize music education in disadvantaged U.S. public schools, by painting aFender Stratocasterguitar and donating it to an auction to raise money for the organization.[124]
