In the same year, her bookEarth Angels: Migrant Children in America, was published byPomegranate Press. It contained 150 photographs by Buirski of children of migrant farmworkers in New York, Florida, California, Washington, and Texas, showing young children at play but also at work during the day and going to school at night. The book raises issues related to exposure to pesticides and other hazards, oppressive heat, low wages, and bad housing.[3][4]
