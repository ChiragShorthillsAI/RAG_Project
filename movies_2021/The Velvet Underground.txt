The Velvet Undergroundis a 2021 Americandocumentary filmdirected and produced byTodd Haynesthat chronicles the life and times of the rock bandthe Velvet Underground.[3]
The film had its world premiere at theCannes Film Festivalon July 7, 2021. It was released theatrically and onApple TV+on October 15, 2021, to critical acclaim.
The Velvet Underground was an influential band that arose from the music, art, and film avant-gardes of early-1960s New York City. Although not a commercial success at the time, it had a significant impact onunderground,experimental, andalternativemusic and the development ofpunkandnew wave music.[4][5]Its core members wereLou Reed,Sterling Morrison,John Cale,Doug Yule, andMaureen Tucker. ArtistAndy Warholmanaged and promoted the band—convincing them to add German singer and modelNicoto their line-up. Haynes's film examines the cultural milieu of the band and its musical and cinematic influences. It tracks the band's history from formation to the break-up of its original line-up in the early 1970s. Interviews with surviving band members Cale and Tucker and musicians the band influenced are woven with archival music and film material.
In August 2017,Todd Hayneswas hired to direct and produce a documentary film about the Velvet Underground.[6]Haynes received cooperation of the surviving members of the band including founding membersJohn Cale[7][8]andMaureen Tucker. Interviews for the film were shot in 2018.[9]Doug Yule, who replaced Cale in the band in 1968, appears in voiceover but was not filmed.[10][11]
In October 2020,Apple TV+acquired distribution rights to the film.[12]It had its world premiere at theCannes Film Festivalon July 7, 2021.[13]It was released theatrically and on Apple TV+ on October 15, 2021.[14]On December 13, 2022, it was released on DVD and Blu-ray byThe Criterion Collection.[15][16]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 132 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "The Velvet Undergroundtakes a fittingly idiosyncratic approach to delivering a rock documentary that captures the band as well as its era."[17]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted score of 87 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[18]
Some critics felt the documentary glossed over the band's 1969self-titled albumand contributions by Yule.[19][20][21]

Apple TV+is an Americansubscriptionover-the-topstreaming serviceowned byApple. The service launched on November 1, 2019, and it offers a selection of original production film and television series calledApple Originals.[9]The service was announced during theApple Special Event of March 2019,[10][11]where entertainers from Apple TV+ projects appeared onstage, includingJennifer Aniston,Oprah Winfrey, andSteven Spielberg.[12][13]The service can be accessed through Apple's website and through theApple TV app, which has gradually become available on manyApple devicesand some major competingdigital media players,[14]including somesmart TVmodels and video-game consoles.
Apple plans to expand the services' availability,[15][16][17][18]and there are workarounds for subscribers whose device is not presently supported.[14]Access is included as part of theApple Onesubscription.[19]Most of the content is available inDolby Visionprofile 5 andDolby Atmos. Upon its debut, Apple TV+ was available in about 100 countries, fewer than the reported target of 150.[20][21]Several countries were excluded from service despite other Apple products being available.[22][23][24]Commentators noted that the fairly wide initial reach of the service offered Apple an advantage over other recently launched services such asDisney+, and that because Apple distributes its own content through the service instead of distributing licensed third-party content (as, for example,Huludoes) it will not be limited by licensing issues during its expansion.[25][26][27]
By early 2020, Apple TV+ had poor growth and low subscriber numbers relative to competing services.[28][29][30][31]In the middle of that year, Apple began to license older television programs and films, attempting to stay competitive with other services, attract and retain a viewership for its original content, and convert into subscribers users who were trialing the service.[29][28]Since then, the service has become the home to critically acclaimed content: between September 2021 and March 2022, Apple TV+ netted aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy SerieswithTed Lassoand theAcademy Award for Best PicturewithCODA, the first Best Picture win for a film distributed by a streaming service.[32]Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston have all signed a multi year look deal with Apple TV+ to develop more television projects under their production companies after their critically acclaimed shows. Apple TV+ (along with the simultaneously announceda-la-cartepremium-videosubscription aggregation serviceApple TV app) is part of a concerted effort by Apple to expand its service revenues.[16][33][34]The service's programming arm isApple Studios.
Apple had long been rumored to have an interest in beginning astreaming televisionservice, and in 2015 entered into negotiations with varioustelevision studiosand programmers to aggregate their content for a live-television streaming bundle.[35][36]Negotiations fell apart over differing views on how to value the content, lack of transparency on details, and the personality of Apple's chief negotiator,Eddy Cue.[35]
In October 2016, Apple CEOTim Cooksaid that television is "of intense interest to me and other people here", and added that Apple has "started focusing on some original content", which he called "a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it's an area we're focused on."[37]
In June 2017, Apple began to take the first major steps to form its new television unit by hiring the co-presidents ofSony Pictures Television, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to oversee all aspects of worldwide video programming.[36][2]In August, Matt Cherniss was hired as Head of Domestic Creative Development, reporting directly to Van Amburg and Erlicht.[3]For the rest of 2017, Apple continued to fill out its executive team for Apple TV+, with Kim Rozenfeld joining as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted,Jay Huntjoining as Creative Director for Europe,Morgan Wandelljoining as Head of International Creative Development, Tara Sorensen joining as Head of Kids Programming, and Max Aronson, Ali Woodruff, Carina Walker, and Michelle Lee joining as development and creative executives.[38][39][4][6][40]
Throughout 2019, Apple continued to build out its unscripted content team, with Molly Thompson hired as Head of Documentaries in April.[5]In November, Rozenfeld stepped down as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted to focus on producing content again with a first-look content production deal with Apple under his Half Full Productions. Cherniss took over Rozenfeld's duties overseeing current scripted programming.[41]
In May 2018, it was reported that Apple was expected to start a sister project to its original content service, and begin selling subscriptions to certain video services directly via itsApple TV appapplication oniOSandtvOS, rather than asking Apple device owners to subscribe to those services through applications individually downloaded from Apple's app store.[42]
In October 2018, it was reported that Apple would distribute its future original content through a still-in-development digital video service within its TV application that is pre-installed in all iOS and tvOS devices. The service was expected to feature both original content, free to owners of Apple devices, as well as subscription "channels" from legacy media companies such asHBOandStarz, which would allow customers to sign up for online-only services.[43]Later that month, it was reported that Apple intended to roll out the service in the U.S. during the first half of 2019 and that it would expand its availability to around 100 countries in the months after its launch.[44]
On March 25, 2019, Apple held a press event to announce Apple TV+. At the event, Apple showed a teaser of its upcoming original content and formally announced some of it, with actors and producers attached to the content appearing on stage. The announced content includedHelpsters, the first series fromSesame Workshop, the producer ofSesame Street, and Oprah Winfrey's first projects for Apple TV+, including a documentary under the working titleToxic Labor[45]about workplace sexual harassment, a documentary series about mental health, and a revival ofOprah's Book Clubas a standalone television series.[46][47]
On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would launch on November 1 at $4.99 per month (with a 1-week free trial) for an account that can be shared with up to six family members. Apple also announced that it would be give away a year of Apple TV+ to anyone who bought a newApple TV,Mac,iPad,iPhone, oriPod Touchbeginning that day.[48]Student subscribers to the monthlyApple Musicservice at a discounted rate also have Apple TV+ bundled in at no additional cost for the time being.[49]
From the start of Apple TV+ on November 1, 2019, Apple offered a free one-year subscription to anyone buying certain of its hardware products (an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod Touch, or Mac).[50]Apple initially extended the free year that was due to end on November 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021,[51]but then announced in mid-January 2021 that it would extend it a second time to July 31, 2021.[52]
In mid-June 2021, Apple added a note to its website advising customers that new users subscribing after June 30, 2021, would receive only three months of free subscription instead of a year.[53]
On October 24, 2022, Apple announced it was to increase pricing of Apple TV+ (along withApple MusicandApple One) subscriptions in many regions. The monthly plan increased $2 to $6.99, and the annual plan increased $20 to $69.[54]
During the announcement of Apple TV+, Apple announced a number of prominent writers, directors, and stars who would be featured in the service. The signing of high-profile talent was intended to attract viewers to the service.[55]
As of March 2019[update], five of the upcoming series had completed production, with six more well into filming.[56]On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would have eight original series (seven scripted and one unscripted) and one original documentary available at launch, with plans to launch new original content every month thereafter. Most series were expected to launch with three episodes, with a new episode released weekly thereafter, although Apple said that not all series would follow that model and that some series might instead launch all at once.[57]
Early critical reaction to the bulk of the service's programming was mixed to poor, but commentators predicted that Apple would have time to grow into its new role as a content provider and to produce well-regarded content, especially as the free year of the service provided with many Apple product purchases enticed users to continue watching, and for some to eventually pay for a subscription, as new series are released.[58][59][15]
On March 13, 2020, Apple suspended all active filming on Apple TV+ shows due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, and all production on series was postponed for an indeterminate period.[60]
Apple's decision in mid-2020 to license large swaths of existing older content for the Apple TV+ service was viewed, in part, as buying time for its original content production during the pandemic by keeping users engaged and in a habit of visiting the service regularly, so that a viewer base would be in place by the time new Apple original content was released.[29][28]
In addition, Apple TV+ endeavored to gain new high-profile content, taking advantage of the pandemic's disruption of theatrical film releases. Among these acquisitions were the 2020 feature filmGreyhoundstarringTom Hanks, which was purchased fromSony Picturesfor $70 million.[61]In July 2020, the service won a heated bidding war forEmancipation, a slavery-based action-thriller starringWill Smithand directed byAntoine Fuqua.[62]Apple paid a record $105 million for the rights.[62]Apple also reportedly considered a $350 to $400 million offer for the rights to stream theJames BondfilmNo Time to Die, which was far short of the $650 to $800 million studioMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(owned byAmazon, which is one of theBig Techcompanies alongside Apple) was willing to accept.[63]
In October 2017, following reports ofsexual abuse allegationsagainst producerHarvey Weinstein, Apple announced that it was severing ties withThe Weinstein Company(TWC) and cancelling a plannedbiopicseries aboutElvis Presley.[64]
In April 2018, Apple signedKerry Ehrinto a multi-year deal to produce original content.[65]Ehrin and Apple renewed the deal in May 2020.[66]
In June 2018, Apple signed theWriters Guild of America's minimum basic agreement andOprah Winfreyto a multi-year content partnership.[67][68]The same month, Apple announced that it had given a multi-series order toSesame Workshopto produce variouslive-actionand animated series as well as a single puppet-based series.[69]
In September 2018, it was reported that Apple had decided to shelveVital Signs, a six-episode biopic television series centering on the life of hip-hop producer and performerDr. Dreand starringIan McShane,Sam Rockwell, andMichael K. Williams, due to concerns about the show's content being too graphic, with moments cited including characters usingcocaine, instances ofgun violence, and an explicitorgyscene. Reports further indicated that Apple CEO Tim Cook was taking a hands-on approach to the company's Worldwide Video Unit, with programming decisions reportedly being aligned to Cook's personal taste, with a preference for family-friendly shows. Various programs in different stages of production apparently had their content altered, including the toning down ofThe Morning Showand the removal of crucifixes from a scene in theM. Night Shyamalandrama series. Additionally, Apple reportedly passed on a television series from comedianWhitney Cummingsabout the #MeToo movement because it was "too sensitive a topic".[70][71][72]Cummings's series was ultimately put into development byAmazon Prime Videoin October 2018.[73]
In November 2018, Apple entered into a multi-year agreement with entertainment companyA24to produce a slate of original films in partnership with its Worldwide Video Unit.[74]The same month, Apple signed a deal with DHX Media (nowWildBrain) and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide to develop and produce original programs, including new series, specials, and shorts based on thePeanutscharacters.

Apple TV+ released its first movie in theaters,Killers of the Flower Moon. Apple has said that its primary goal in releasing the film is to attract more subscribers, not to do well at the box office, but it brought in $145 million.[118]Apple TV+ also released another movie,Napoleon. Apple is seemingly pleased with its box-office returns, which reached $221 million and nearly made back its budget. It is apparent that Apple is attempting to compete with movie production companies.[119][120][121]
In March 2022, Apple announced that it would airFriday Night Baseball, a weekly doubleheader ofMajor League Baseball(MLB) games with live pre- and postgame shows on Apple TV+ in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom starting in the2022 Major League Baseball season.[122]

Apple TV+ subscribers can watch select games at no additional charge, and receive a discount on the MLS Season Pass.[126][127]
In mid-2020, Apple began discussions with film and television studios to license their previously released content as part of an effort to build a back catalog of non-original films and television shows for the streaming service.[30][29]The shift was designed to help the service better compete against the large content libraries competitors likeNetflixhave.[30]This represented a pivot for Apple, which had initially attempted to build the service entirely on original content, avoiding licensing fees to help keep monthly subscription fees low, and relying on its Apple TV Channels content partners to supply other content users wanted.[30][29]
Analysts believed that the addition of older, highly re-watchable content like popular sitcoms and well-liked films would help retain the slowly growing subscriber base while Apple continues to develop original content.[28]The shift was also an acknowledgement of poor growth, especially relative to competing services.[28]The back catalog development was also seen as a move to attempt to persuade free trial users to transition into paid users as the first wave of one-year trials was scheduled to expire in November 2020.[29]
On May 26, 2020, Apple announced its first acquisition of catalogue content would be theFraggle Rockseries.[128]In addition to being the exclusive home of the 1983–1987Jim Henson Companyseries, Apple would develop a new, full-length, rebootedFraggle Rockseries after the success of theFraggle Rock: Rock On!short-form series on Apple TV+.[129]On October 19, 2020, Apple announced the exclusive transmission rights of the various animated productions of thePeanutsfranchise, withdrawing them from broadcast television after 55 years; as part of that agreement, Apple TV+ must make the majorPeanutsspecials available for free in short windows.[130]After an outcry from fans of the specials, Apple sublicensedA Charlie Brown ThanksgivingandA Charlie Brown ChristmastoPBSfor commercial-free airing.[131]In 2021,It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brownalso came to the PBS rotation. The PBS sublicensing arrangement ended before October 2022.[132]
In March 2024, Apple made 51 catalog films available under a "Great Movies special collection" banner.[133]
Apple has announced a number of partnerships, bundles, and initiatives to increase subscriber growth in the service.[when?]
It has included Apple TV+ in several reduced-cost bundles designed to increase uptake and stickiness of subscriptions, including a bundle with Apple Music available for students, a bundle offeringCBS All AccessandShowtimefor an additional $9.99 monthly for TV+ subscribers, and a bundling of the service as part of theApple Onesubscription package.[134][135][136]
It has partnered with largecable television MSOsand telecommunicationsmobile network operators, such asAltice USA,[137]the UK'sEE,[138]and Ireland'sEir TV,[139][140]to offer those systems' customers Apple TV+ as part of a bundle, sometimes including anApple TV 4Kset-top box.
By February 2020, about 10 million people had signed up for Apple TV+.[30][29]This included users who received a free one-year trial with the purchase of an Apple device,[30][29]although it was estimated that less than 10% of Apple device owners eligible for the trial had activated it, perhaps because of Apple's failure to promote the service, Apple's desire to slow the uptake rate due to accounting concerns, or users' lack of interest in the service's perceived poor content options.[30]About half of those 10 million users actively used the service.[31]In late 2020, the continuing expansion of availability of the Apple TV app to a growing number of smart TV platforms and to newer lines ofPlayStationandXboxvideo game consoles (specifically, thePS4andPS5, and the XboxOne,Series S, andSeries X[141]) was seen as potentially boosting subscriber numbers for Apple TV+, including as part of Apple One subscription bundle purchases.[142]But Apple has created no native TV app for theWindowsandAndroidplatformsor official method to stream the content toChromecastor on theAndroid TVplatform (except for selectSonyBraviatelevision models[143]), leaving users of those devices to use a web browser to view Apple TV+ content, where possible, or to employ other workarounds, especially for sending Apple TV+ content to a television set.[14]On December 16, 2020,Googleannounced it would add the Apple TV app to itsChromecast with Google TVdevice in early 2021 and to its Android TV platform by June 1, 2021;[144][145]Google made Apple TV available on its Chromecast with Google TV, as well as on selectSonyandTCLsmart TVsrunning the Google TV interface, on February 18, 2021.[146]On December 18, 2020, theBritish Urban Film Festivalannounced that it was to be the first UK film festival to host all of its official selections on theApple TV app.[147]
The service received several nominations for the2021 Golden Globe Awardsin both the television and film categories and was regarded as having "established an impressive track record for turning out consistently good—and sometimes great—programming for subscribers, despite offering a much, much smaller overall offering."[148]Apple's seriesTed Lassowon fourPrimetime Emmy Awards in 2021, includingOutstanding Comedy Series,Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series(Jason Sudeikis),Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series(Brett Goldstein) andOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series(Hannah Waddingham).[149]
Apple TV+ is the first streaming service to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture, withCODAat the94th Academy Awards.[150]As of March 2022, it is estimated to have 25 million paid subscribers and an additional 50 million viewers who access the service via promotions.[151]
Apple is partnering withBharti Airtelto provide its music and video streaming services to the telecom company's premium clients in India from 2024 at no cost, providing the American behemoth access to thousands of users in the most populated country.[152]
On the 96th Academy Awards, Apple Films earned a record breaking 14 Oscar nominations, withKillers of the Flower Moonreceiving 10 andNapoleonreceiving 4. This marked the second time an Apple Films received a Best Picture nomination.[citation needed]

Haynes received further acclaim for his second feature film,Safe(1995), a symbolic portrait of a housewife who developsmultiple chemical sensitivity.Safewas later voted the best film of the 1990s byThe Village VoiceFilm Poll. His next feature,Velvet Goldmine(1998), is a tribute to the 1970sglam rockera. The film received the Special Jury Prize for Best Artistic Contribution at the1998 Cannes Film Festival.
Haynes gained acclaim and a measure of mainstream success withFar from Heaven(2002), receiving his firstAcademy Awardnomination forBest Original Screenplay. He continued to direct critically lauded films such asI'm Not There(2007),Carol(2015),Wonderstruck(2017),Dark Waters(2019), andMay December(2023), as well as the documentary filmThe Velvet Underground(2021). Haynes also directed and co-wrote theHBOmini-seriesMildred Pierce(2011), for which he received threePrimetime Emmy Awardnominations.
Haynes was born January 2, 1961, inLos Angeles, and grew up in the city'sEncinoneighborhood.[3][4]His father, Allen E. Haynes, was a cosmetics importer, and his mother, Sherry Lynne (née Semler), studied acting. Haynes is Jewish on his mother's side.[5][6]His younger sister is Gwynneth Haynes of the bandSophe Lux.[7]
Haynes developed an interest in film at an early age, and produced a short film,The Suicide(1978), while still in high school. He studied art andsemioticsatBrown University, where he directed his first short filmAssassins: A Film Concerning Rimbaud(1985), inspired by the French poetArthur Rimbaud(a personality Haynes would later reference in his filmI'm Not There). At Brown, he metChristine Vachon, who would go on to produce all of his feature films. After graduating from Brown, Haynes moved toNew York Cityand became involved in the independent film scene, launching Apparatus Productions, a non-profit organization for the support of independent film.[1]
According toCinematic/Sexual: An Interview with Todd Haynes, in response to whether his academic background affected his film-making practice, Haynes stated that his high school teacher taught him a valuable lesson: "Reality can't be a criterion for judging the success or failure of a film, or its effect on you. It was a simple, but eye-opening, way of approaching film."[8]
In 1987, while an MFA student atBard College, Haynes made a short,Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story, which chronicles the life of American pop singerKaren Carpenter, using Barbie dolls as actors.[1]The film presents Carpenter's struggle with anorexia and bulimia, featuring several close-ups ofIpecac(the nonprescription drug Carpenter was reputed to have used to make herself vomit during her illness). Carpenter's chronic weight loss was portrayed by using a "Karen" Barbie doll with the face and body whittled away with a knife, leaving the doll looking skeletonized.
Superstarfeatured extensive use of Carpenter songs, showcasing Haynes's love of popular music (which would be a recurring feature of later films). Haynes failed to obtain proper licensing to use the music, prompting a lawsuit from Karen's brotherRichardfor copyright infringement. Carpenter was reportedly also offended by Haynes's unflattering portrayal of him as a narcissistic bully, along with several broadly dropped suggestions that he was gay andin the closet. Carpenter won his lawsuit, andSuperstarwas removed from public distribution; to date, it may not be viewed publicly.[1]Bootlegged versions of the film are still circulated, and the film is sporadically made available on YouTube.[9][10]
Haynes's 1991 feature film debut,Poison, garnered him further acclaim and controversy.[1]Drawing on the writings of gay writerJean Genet, the film is a triptych ofqueer-themed narratives, each adopting a different cinematic genre: vox-pop documentary ("Hero"), 50s sci-fi horror ("Horror") and gay prisoner romantic drama ("Homo"). The film explores traditional perceptions of homosexuality as an unnatural and deviant force, and presents Genet's vision ofsado-masochisticgay relations as a subversion of heterosexual norms, culminating with a marriage ceremony between two gay male convicts.Poisonmarked Haynes's first collaboration with his longtime producerChristine Vachon.
Poisonwas partially funded with a grant from theNational Endowment for the Arts(NEA),[1]"at a time when the agency was under attack from conservative groups for using public funds to support sexually explicit works".[11]This, along with the film's sexual themes, was a source of controversy.[11][1]The film subsequently became the center of a public attack byReverend Donald Wildmon, head of theAmerican Family Association, who criticized the NEA for fundingPoisonand other works by gay and lesbian artists and filmmakers. Wildmon, who had not viewed the film before making his comments publicly,[12]condemned the film's "explicit porno scenes of homosexuals involved in anal sex", despite no such scenes appearing in the film.[13]Poisonwent on to win the 1991Sundance Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize, establishing Haynes as an emerging talent and the voice of a new transgressive generation.[1][14][15]The film writerB. Ruby RichcitedPoisonas one of the defining films of the emergingNew Queer Cinemamovement, with its focus on maverick sexuality as an anti-establishment social force.[16][17]
Haynes's next short film,Dottie Gets Spanked(1993), explored the experiences of a quiet and gentle six-year-old boy in the early 1960s who has various indirect encounters with spanking, most significantly involving his idol, a TV sitcom star named Dottie. The film was aired onPBS.[1]
Haynes's second feature film,Safe(1995), was a critically acclaimed portrait of Carol White, a San Fernando Valley housewife (played byJulianne Moore) who develops violent allergies to her middle-class suburban existence.[1]After a series of extreme allergic reactions and hospitalization, Carol diagnoses herself with acute environmental illness, and moves to aNew Agecommune in theNew Mexicodesert run by anHIV positive"guru" who preaches both that the real world is toxic and unsafe for Carol, and that she is responsible for her illness and recovery. The film ends with Carol retreating to her antiseptic, prison-like "safe room", looking at herself in the mirror and whispering "I love you" to her reflection.
The film is notable for its critical (though not entirely unsympathetic) treatment of its main character. Julie Grossman argues in her article "The Trouble With Carol" that Haynes concludes the film as a challenge to traditional Hollywood film narratives of the heroine taking charge of her life, and that Haynes sets Carol up as the victim both of a repressive male-dominated society, and also of an equally debilitatingself-helpculture that encourages patients to take sole responsibility for their illness and recovery.[18]Carol's illness, although unidentified, has been read as an analogy for the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s, as a similarly uncomfortable and largely unspoken "threat" in 1980s Reaganist America.[1][19]Safewas critically acclaimed, giving Moore her first leading role in a feature film, and gave Haynes a measure of mainstream critical recognition.[1]It was voted the best film of the 1990s by the Village Voice's Critic Poll.[20]The film historianDavid Thomsonlater described it as "one of the most arresting, original and accomplished films of the 1990s".[21]
Haynes took a radical shift in direction for his next feature,Velvet Goldmine(1998), starringChristian Bale,Ewan McGregor,Jonathan Rhys-MeyersandToni Collette. The film's title takes its name fromDavid Bowie's song "Velvet Goldmine".[22]Filmed and set mostly in England, the film was an intentionally chaotic tribute to the 1970s glam rock era, drawing heavily on the rock histories and mythologies of glam rockersDavid Bowie,Iggy PopandLou Reed. Starting withOscar Wildeas the spiritual godfather of glam rock, the film revels in the gender and identity experimentation and fashionable bisexuality of the era, and acknowledges the transformative power of glam rock as an escape and a form of self-expression for gay teenagers.[citation needed]
The film follows the character of Arthur (Bale) an English journalist once enraptured by glam rock as a 1970s teenager, who returns a decade later to hunt down his former heroes: Brian Slade (Rhys Meyers), a feather boa-wearingandrogynewith an alter ego, "Maxwell Demon", who resembles Bowie in hisZiggy Stardustincarnation, and Curt Wild (McGregor), an Iggy Pop-style rocker. The narrative playfully rewrites glam rock myths which in some cases sail unnervingly close to the truth.[citation needed]Slade flirts with bisexuality and decadence before staging his own death in a live performance and disappearing from the scene, echoing Bowie's own disavowal of glam rock in the late 1970s and his subsequent re-creation as an avowedly heterosexual pop star. The film features a love affair between Slade and Wild's characters, recalling rumors about Bowie and Reed's supposed sexual relationship. Curt Wild's character has a flashback to enforcedelectric shock treatmentas a teenager to attempt to cure his homosexuality, echoing Reed's teenage experiences as a victim of the homophobic medical profession.
Haynes was keen to use original music from the glam rock period, and (learning his lesson fromSuperstar)[citation needed]approached David Bowie before making the film for permission to use his music in the soundtrack. Bowie declined, leaving Haynes to use a combination of original songs from other artists and glam-rock inspired music written by contemporary rock bands for the film, includingSuede.[citation needed]Velvet Goldminepremiered in main competition at the1998 Cannes Film Festival, winning a special jury award for Best Artistic Contribution.[23]Despite the initial critical praise, the film received mixed reviews from critics.[citation needed]Costume designerSandy Powellreceived anAcademy Awardnomination for her costume design and won the Oscar in the same year for her work onShakespeare In Love.[24]
Haynes achieved his greatest critical and commercial success to date withFar from Heaven(2002), a 1950s-set drama inspired by the films ofDouglas Sirkabout a Connecticut housewife Cathy Whittaker (Julianne Moore) who discovers that her husband (Dennis Quaid) is secretly gay, and subsequently falls in love with Raymond, her African-American gardener (Dennis Haysbert). The film works as a mostly reverential and unironic tribute to Sirk's filmmaking, lovingly re-creating the stylizedmise-en-scene, colors, costumes, cinematography and lighting of Sirkianmelodrama. Cathy and Raymond's relationship resemblesJane WymanandRock Hudson's inter-class love affair inAll That Heaven Allows,and Cathy's relationship with Sybil, her African-American housekeeper (Viola Davis) recallsLana TurnerandJuanita Moore's friendship inImitation of Life. While staying within the cinematic language of the period, Haynes updates the sexual and racial politics, showing scenarios (an inter-racial love affair and gay relationships) that would not have been permissible in Sirk's era. Haynes also resists a Sirkian happy ending, allowing the film to finish on a melancholy note closer in tone to the "weepy" melodramas of the 1940s and 1950s cinema such asMildred Pierce.
Far from Heavendebuted at theVenice Film Festivalto widespread critical acclaim and garnered a slew of film awards, including theVolpi Cupfor Moore, and four Academy Award nominations: lead actress for Moore, Haynes's original screenplay,Elmer Bernstein's score, andEdward Lachman's cinematography.Far from Heavenlost in all four categories, but the film's success was hailed as a breakthrough for independent film achieving mainstream recognition and brought Haynes to the attention of a wider mainstream audience.[1]
In another radical shift in direction, Haynes's next filmI'm Not There(2007) returned to the mythology of popular music, portraying the life and legend ofBob Dylanthrough seven fictional characters played by six actors:Richard Gere,Cate Blanchett,Marcus Carl Franklin,Heath Ledger,Ben WhishawandChristian Bale. Haynes obtained Dylan's approval to proceed with the film, and the rights to use his music in the soundtrack, after presenting a one-page summary of the film's concept to Jeff Rosen, Dylan's long-time manager.[25]I'm Not Therepremiered at theVenice Film Festivalto critical acclaim, where Haynes won theGrand Jury Prizeand Blanchett won the Volpi Cup, eventually receiving an Academy Award nomination forBest Supporting Actress.[26][27]
Haynes's next project wasMildred Pierce, a five-hour miniseries forHBObased on the novel byJames M. Cainand the 1945 film starringJoan Crawford. The series starredKate Winsletin the title role and featuredGuy Pearce,Evan Rachel Wood,Melissa Leo,James LeGrosandHope Davis. Filming was completed in mid-2010 and the series began airing on HBO on 27 March 2011. It received 21Primetime Emmy Awardnominations, winning five, and Winslet won aGolden Globe Awardfor her performance.[28][29]
Haynes's sixth feature film,Carol, is an adaptation of the 1952 novelThe Price of SaltbyPatricia Highsmith. The cast featuresCate Blanchett,Rooney Mara,Sarah PaulsonandKyle Chandler. The film premiered in competition at the2015 Cannes Film Festival, where it won theQueer Palmand a shared Best Actress prize for Mara.[30][31]Carolreceived critical acclaim[32]and was nominated for 6 Academy Awards, 5 Golden Globe Awards, 9BAFTA Awards, and 6Independent Spirit Awards.[33][34][35][36]Geoffrey McNab ofThe Independentpraised the film praising Haynes writing "In sly and subversive fashion, Haynes is laying bare the tensions in a society that refuses to acknowledge "difference" of any sort". McNabb added, "They are both helped that in Todd Haynes, they have a director who is sensitive to every last nuance in their performances".[37]
On October 20, 2017, Haynes'sWonderstruckwas released, having premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2017. The film is an adaptation ofBrian Selznick's children's bookof the same name.WonderstruckstarsJulianne Mooreand is produced by Haynes's collaboratorChristine VachonandAmazon Studios, which is also distributing the film.[38][39]The movie describes two deaf children, one in 1927 and the other in 1977, who embark on separate quests to find themselves. When asked why he'd made a children's movie, in his October 15, 2017, NPR interview, Haynes explained, "I felt like it spoke to something indomitable about the nature of kids and the ability for kids to be confronted with challenges and the unknown and to keep muscling through those challenges."[40]The film received mixed reviews but earned praise forEdward Lachman'sblack-and-whitecinematography.
Haynes directed a film titledDark WatersforParticipant Media.[41][42]The film is based onNathaniel Rich'sNew York Times Magazinearticle “The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare,” which is about corporate defense attorneyRobert Bilottand his environmental lawsuit against the American conglomerateDuPont.[43]Mark RuffaloandAnne Hathawaystar,[44]and principal photography began in January 2019, inCincinnati.[45]The film was released on November 22, 2019.[46]
Haynes's premiered his first documentary feature,The Velvet Underground, at theCannes Film Festivalon July 7, 2021, and it went on to be released on October 15, 2021, in theaters and onApple TV+, to critical acclaim. The film rejects documentary biopic tropes, evoking a place and time through extensive use of montage. “What montage can do is always more sophisticated than we give it credit for,” Haynes says. “I wanted the audience to fill in the holes themselves and make their own discoveries and feel like these ideas are alive again, because they’re coming through you, and they’re not just being told to us like in a lecture.”[47]Haynes was nominated for theCritics' Choice Documentary Award for Best First Documentary Feature.[48]
Haynes's latest film,May December, reunites him with frequent collaborator Julianne Moore and co-starsNatalie PortmanandCharles Melton. The film, loosely based aroundMary Kay Letourneau, revolves around a married couple whose relationship is put through a test after an actress arrives to do research for a film about their past. The script was written bySamy Burch, with a story by Burch andAlex Mechanik.[49][50]The film was shot in Savannah, Georgia, and wrapped filming in December 2022.[51]The film received positive reviews[52]with Peter Debruge ofVarietywriting, "Todd Haynes unpacks America’s obsession with scandal and the impossibility of ever truly knowing what motivates others in this layered look at the actor’s process."[53]The film went on to receive nominations for fourGolden Globe AwardsincludingBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.[54]Haynes himself was nominated for theIndependent Spirit Award for Best Director.[55]
In 2023, Todd Haynes was given a Moving Image Award by theMuseum of the Moving Image(MOMI) in New York City. MOMI also curated a retrospective of his work, and published a book,Todd Haynes: Rapturous Process.[56]
Haynes said in September 2023 that he has been working on a sexually explicit film about a "love story between two men set in the 1930's", starringJoaquin Phoenix.[57]The project was cancelled shortly before production began when Phoenix abruptly quit.[58]
In 2015 he was reported to be developing a TV series based on the 2012 documentaryThe Source FamilyforHBO.[38][59]
Haynes is set to direct aPeggy Leebiopic, titledFever, based on a screenplay originally drafted byNora Ephronbefore her death in 2012, starringMichelle Williamsin the title role afterReese Witherspoonbacked out of the role to produce instead.Billie Eilishis in early talks to executive produce. The primary screenwriter is nowDoug Wright.[60]
Haynes is reportedly set to direct the HBO seriesTrust,based on Hernan Diaz'snovel of the same name,  withKate Winsletas the lead after working together onMildred Pierce.[61][62]
AllMoviewrites that "Haynes is known for making provocative films that subvert narrative structure and resound with transgressive, complexeroticism. ... Although he doesn't characterize himself as a gay filmmaker who makes gay films … Haynes' name has become synonymous with theNew Queer Cinemamovement and its work to both explore and redefine the contours of queer culture in America and beyond."[63]
Haynes's work is preoccupied withpostmodernistideas of identity and sexuality as socially constructed concepts and personal identity as a fluid and changeable state. His protagonists are invariably social outsiders whose "subversive" identity and sexuality put them at odds with the received norms of their society. In the Haynes universe, sexuality (especially "deviant" or unconventional sexuality) is a subversive and dangerous force that disrupts social norms and is often repressed brutally by dominant power structures. Haynes presents artists as the ultimate subversive force since they must necessarily stand outside of societal norms, with an artist's creative output representing the greatest opportunity for personal and social freedom. Many of his films are unconventional portraits of popular artists and musicians (Karen CarpenterinSuperstar,David BowieinVelvet GoldmineandBob DylaninI'm Not There).[citation needed]
Haynes's films often feature formal cinematic or narrative devices that challenge received notions of identity and sexuality and remind the audience of the artificiality of film as a medium. Examples include usingBarbie dollsinstead of actors inSuperstaror having multiple actors portray the protagonist inI'm Not There. Stylistically, Haynes favors formalism over naturalism, often appropriating and reinventing cinematic styles, including the documentary form inPoison,Velvet GoldmineandI'm Not There, the reinvention of theDouglas SirkmelodramainFar from Heavenand extensive referencing of 1960s art cinema inI'm Not There.[citation needed]
Haynes is gay,[64][65][66]and identifies asirreligious.[67]After living in New York City for more than a decade, Haynes moved toPortland, Oregon, in 2002.[4][68]He has been in a relationship with Bryan O'Keefe, an archival producer, since 2002.[69]
An edited book of personal interviews was published in 2014, titledTodd Haynes: Interviews.[70]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin. Since 1980, it has been struck in most years by theRoyal Mintfor sale to collectors and investors. Commemorative versions have been issued, such as in 2022, following thedeath of Elizabeth II; this depicted her son and successor,Charles III. (Full article...)

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
