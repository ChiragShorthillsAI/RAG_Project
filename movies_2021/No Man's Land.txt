Texas RangerRamirez questions Bill and, not wanting to let his son be arrested for shooting an unarmed illegal immigrant, fabricated the story of him shooting the unarmed Fernando. Jackson, feeling guilty and frustrated that he could get arrested, is confronted by Ramirez and is forced to ride his horse across the river and into the Mexican border after being chased by Ramirez. The ranger comes back to inform Bill and Monica to try and convince them to call Jackson to come back to the States. Meanwhile, Jackson rides his horse to a smuggling camp, where he meets Luis, who tries to rob him of his horse before escaping.
Gustavo meets Luis after visiting the morgue, and Luis gives him a gun so that Gustavo can find and kill Jackson. As Jackson journeys in the desert, he is picked up by cattle ranchers Hector and his daughter, Maria, and takes him and his horse back to his ranch. While working at Hector's ranch, Jackson bonds with Maria and the other ranchers.

The next morning, Jackson calls his father, who tells him that the Texas Rangers will come to extradite him to the States with theMexician Police, but he hangs up. Jackson leaves his horse under Maria's care before taking a bus toGuanajuato. However, Luis follows Jackson on the bus where he is taking. Luis and Gustavo stopped the bus and caught Jackson, but he was distracted by one of the passengers recording the scene on a phone, which allowed Jackson to escape into the forest.
