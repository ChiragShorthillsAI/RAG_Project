Chaos Walkingis a 2021 Americandystopianscience-fictionaction-thriller film[5]directed byDoug Limanand written byPatrick NessandChristopher Ford. It is based on Ness's science fiction trilogyChaos Walking, adapting its first book, 2008'sThe Knife of Never Letting Go. It starsTom Holland,Daisy Ridley,Mads Mikkelsen,Demián Bichir,Cynthia Erivo,Nick JonasandDavid Oyelowo. It follows a young man who lives in a dystopian world without women, where all living creatures can hear each other's thoughts in streams of images, words, and sounds, called "Noise". When a woman crash-lands on the planet, he protects her from danger.
Announced in 2011, the film underwent several rewrites based on an initial draft byCharlie Kaufman, withJamie Linden,John Lee Hancock, Gary Spinelli, Lindsey Beer, Ford and Ness revising it further. Liman was later announced as director in 2016, and principal photography began in 2017. Originally set to release on March 1, 2019, it was removed from the schedule to accommodate the film's reshoots in April 2019 after poor test screenings.
The film premiered in South Korea on February 24, 2021, and in the United States on March 5, 2021. It received generally negative reviews from critics who derided the lack of character development and overall execution. The film was also labeled acommercial failure, grossing $27.1 million worldwide against a $100‒125 million budget, resulting in awrite-downforLionsgate.
In 2257 AD, on the colony planet New World, the male colonists have been afflicted with the Noise, a condition which causes everyone to see and hear each other's thoughts. The colonists were at war with the native humanoid species referred to as The Spackle, which killed the female colonists, while half the men survived.
Todd Hewitt lives in Prentisstown with his adoptive fathers, Ben Moore and Cillian Boyd. Other residents include the preacher Aaron, the town's mayor David Prentiss, and his son Davy. Prentiss (David) has learned to control his Noise, making his thoughts difficult to see and hear.
A spaceship that lost contact with the First Colony approaches New World and a scout ship is sent to investigate the planet, but crashes. Todd discovers someone stealing and chases the thief, only to come upon the crash site.
Returning to town, Todd tries to keep quiet, but the others hear and see his thoughts about the crashed ship. They head to investigate the crash scene but find no survivors. Todd eventually meets Viola, the ship's only survivor, and is shocked to see a girl, as he has never seen one before.
The men from Prentisstown capture Viola and bring her to the mayor, who questions her. Prentiss leaves to speak to the men and leaves Davy in charge of watching her. Davy toys with one of Viola's gadgets, which inadvertently shoots holes in the walls, allowing Viola to escape.
As she does, Viola overhears Prentiss talking about preventing her from contacting the colony's mothership, intercepting their landing, killing them while they are still under cryosleep, and scavenging the ship.
Viola hides in Todd's family's barn, where Todd finds her. He tries to keep her hidden when one of Prentiss's men arrives looking for her. Ben tells Todd about Farbranch, a settlement where Viola might be safe.
Viola escapes, with Todd following. Prentiss and the men arrive at the farm, demanding her back, claiming she is a spy. Davy kills Cillian, and Ben is forced to join them.
Meanwhile, Todd catches up to Viola and they travel to Farbranch, accompanied by Todd's dog Manchee. En route, she reveals she is from a Colony Ship carrying over four thousand passengers and her parents were too ill for the journey from Earth to New World.
When they encounter a Spackle, Todd attempts to kill it, but Viola stops him as it does not appear to be dangerous. They arrive at Farbranch, a town inhabited by men, women, and children, some of whom are displeased with Todd's presence, as he is from Prentisstown.
Todd has his mother's diary, which Viola reads to him since he's illiterate. It reveals that the women were not killed by the Spackle, but rather by the Prentisstown men. They could not stand not knowing the thoughts of the women who could hear theirs, which drove them crazy.
Prentiss and his men arrive. Ben tries to get Todd to surrender Viola, but he is upset with him for lying. Ben uses his Noise to distract Prentiss and his men with an image of Viola, while Todd and Viola escape. Aaron chases after them. They come upon a boat, but as they escape, Aaron drowns Manchee.
The next day, Viola and Todd arrive at the ruins of the first colony ship. There, they try to send a signal to her colony ship, but the antenna is damaged, so he attempts to repair it. When Prentiss and his men arrive, Todd surrenders, as he is holding Ben hostage. Aaron attempts to kill Viola, who immolates him with one of her gadgets.
Todd appears, but Prentiss shoots Ben. He goes to him and Ben slips him a knife. Todd engages Prentiss, who uses illusions of himself to distract Todd and shoots him. Before he can finish him off, Todd uses illusions of his mother and other women, calling Prentiss a coward. Viola pushes Prentiss off the cliff to his death.
The colony ship appears in the sky, causing Davy and the remaining Prentisstown men to flee. Todd wakes up in the colony ship's medical room. Viola says she has learned to love his planet and shows him the new colonies her people are building.
Additionally, dog actors Wiston and Lamborghini both portray Manchee the Dog.Óscar Jaenadawas cast as Wilf, but all of his scenes were eventually cut from the film.Harrison Osterfieldalso makes a uncredited appearance as a man from Farbranch.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
