Lady of the Manoris a 2021 Americanfantasycomedyfilm written and directed by brothersJustin Longand Christian Long in their directorial debuts. It starsMelanie Lynskey,Judy Greer, Justin Long,Ryan Phillippe,Luis Guzmán, andPatrick Duffy. The film premiered at theGasparilla International Film Festival,[1]and was released byLionsgateon September 17, 2021.[2]
InSavannah, Georgia, Hannah Kolinsky, a generally unmotivated, oft-intoxicated drug dealer, is mistaken for a sexual predator, arrested, and subsequently dumped by her boyfriend. Her luck appears to change when Tanner, the smarmy but cute heir of an aristocratic Southern family, hires her to take over the role ofliving historytour guide at his childhood home, anAntebellummansion. We come to learn that his real reason for doing so is to lure Hannah into bed, having fired the previous guide for rejecting his advances.
Hannah proves to be a slouchy, inarticulate and generally inept tour guide, failing in her attempts to impersonate Lady Wadsworth, the long-deceased matriarch of the house. Much to Hannah's chagrin, it is here that the ghost of Wadsworth starts haunting the premises, chastising the useless employee for doing such a terrible job. Hannah eventually gives in and allows the spectral Wadsworth to tutor her on history and etiquette, and their better qualities begin to rub off on one another as they develop an unlikely friendship.
Steering clear of her lecherous employer after a couple of disastrous encounters, Hannah instead welcomes the nerdish charms of Max, an amiable history professor she meets by chance. She also teams up with Wadsworth to uncover vital evidence that the manor was intended to be bequeathed to Wadsworth's best friend and former maid, whose descendants still work there today. Through a series of detective shenanigans, wrongs are righted, and Max and Hannah become an item.
In November 2019, it was announced thatJustinand Christian Long would write and direct the film.[3]It was later revealed thatMelanie Lynskey,Judy Greer, Long,Ryan Phillippe,Luis GuzmánandPatrick Duffyhad joined the cast of the film.[4]Lynskey said that she agreed to take the part because "the thought of being in sweatpants and just acting like I was high for a whole movie was so freeing".[5]
Principal photographybegan on January 2, 2020, inTampa, Florida.[6]Filming also took place inSt. Petersburg.[7]
Critics were dismissive of the film's reliance onscatological humour,[8]but Lynskey's performance was well received, with Angie Han ofThe Hollywood Reportercommenting that she "brings the same airtight commitment to hot mess Hannah that she does to all her varied roles" and finding her chemistry with co-starJudy Greerto be "warm and genuine";[9]whileScreen Rantfelt that she "shines as ... the rudderless, classless ... screw-up. [She] unabashedly embraces physical humor ... and really commits to the gags. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments in the film, and Lynskey is at the center of all of them".[10]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 28% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 3.90/10.[11]AtMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 30 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating " generally unfavourable reviews".[12]

Her other credits includeHBO'sTogetherness(2015–2016) andHulu'sCastle Rock(2018), as well as the miniseriesMrs. America(2020) andCandy(2022).

She received a further Emmy nomination (Guest Actress, 2023) for her work on HBO'sThe Last of Us. Lynskey is married to actorJason Ritter, with whom she has a daughter.
Lynskey was born inNew Plymouth, New Zealand, to Kay Barbara (Mahoney), a real estate agent, and Tim Lynskey, an orthopedic surgeon.[7]She has Irish, English, and Scottish ancestry; her surname originates in Ireland.[8][9]Lynskey played an active role in the raising of her siblings;[10]she is the eldest of five children, and has three brothers and one sister.[9]She was raised in theBaptistfaith.[11]
When she was six, Lynskey's family moved to England for one year before returning to New Zealand.[9][12]She recalls moving "a lot" due to her father's profession: "My dad was a medical student when I was born, so he was studying and going to different universities. And then he was doing his residency, so I was always the new kid in school".[13]She later attendedNew Plymouth Girls' High School, where she was involved in the drama department and school plays.[9]She has spoken about being shy at school and finding comfort in acting: "It was so freeing, having someone give me the words to say and not being myself for a minute. It just felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders".[14]After graduating high school, Lynskey studied for a year and a half atVictoria University of Wellington, majoring in English literature,[15]but dropped out to focus on her film career.[16]
Lynskey's professional debut came at age 15 with a starring role inHeavenly Creatures, a psychological drama based on a 1950smurder case.[17]Lynskey portrayed Pauline Parker, a schoolgirl who conspires to kill her mother. She auditioned for the role when a casting director visited her high school;[18]prior to this, five hundred girls had been considered for the part, but "none were right".[19]Fran Walsh, who co-wrote the screenplay, admired Lynskey's "quiet intensity" and said, "We knew immediately that she was right for the role".[19]Lynskey turned 16 during the making ofHeavenly Creaturesand was 17 by the time of its release in 1994.[17]Critics were effusive about the performances, especially those of Lynskey and her co-star,Kate Winslet.[20][21][22]Roger Ebertcomplimented the film's director,Peter Jackson, on picking "the right two actresses", noting that "There is a way Lynskey has of looking up from beneath glowering eyebrows that lets you know her insides are churning"[23]whileRichard Corlisswrote in his review forTime:
The film's serendipitous stroke was to find Winslet and, especially, Lynskey, a first-time actress. They are perfect, fearless in embodying teenage hysteria. They declaim their lines with an intensity that approaches ecstasy, as if reading aloud fromWuthering Heights. The giggles that punctuate the girls' early friendship are not beneath Winslet and Lynskey. The screams that end the film are not beyond them.[24]
Heavenly Creaturesis recognised as a milestone in New Zealand cinema.[25][26][27]It was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplay,[28]while Lynskey was named Best Actress at the 1995New Zealand Film Awards.[5]She regards working with Jackson and Winslet as an important learning experience.[29][30]She grew particularly close to Winslet during filming, who later toldThe Irish Times, "Mel is like the left side of my body. [We] had the exact relationship in terms of communication and love that Pauline andJuliethad. From the minute we saw each other".[31]Despite the film's success, its creators tried to discourage Lynskey from pursuing a full-time acting career, as it was not thought to be realistic.[32]She later revealed, "[People were] looking out for me ...  'Thanks for doing this movie for us, and now be sure that you go to university and get a normal job.' No one wanted to be responsible for me being like, 'I'm gonna run off to Hollywood!' ... New Zealanders are very practical. Everybody was kind of like, 'That was fun [but] it's not what your life is gonna be'".[32]
Over the next three years, Lynskey continued her education while auditioning for various film parts.[33][30]She also had a minor role as a policewoman in Peter Jackson's first project afterHeavenly Creatures,The Frighteners(1996),[34]and starred in a production ofJean Genet'sThe Maidsfor theNew Zealand Fringe Festival.[35]Her return to substantial film roles came with the independent dramaForeign Correspondents, where she played Melody, a timid receptionist who strikes up an unusual bond with an overseaspen pal.[36]The director,Mark Tapio Kines, contacted Lynskey to offer her the part after reading online that she was eager to work in America.[37]Filming took place in Los Angeles in 1997,[38]with the project drawing attention for its "breakthrough" use ofcrowdfunding.[37]Her next film was the period fairytale romanceEver After(1998), a feminist reimagining ofCinderellathat was shot in the south of France;[39][40]Lynskey playedDrew Barrymore's "charming and funny" stepsister, Jacqueline De Ghent.[41]She attributes her growth in self-confidence around this time, as well as the advancement of her career, to the support and advice she received from Barrymore and their co-star,Anjelica Huston, during the making of the film.[42]
Lynskey appeared in four features in 1999: teen comedyDetroit Rock City, period dramaThe Cherry Orchard, British gangster dramaShooters, and thecult hitsatireBut I'm a Cheerleader—considered to be one of the foremost examples ofLGBTQcinema—where she played a lesbian undergoing conversion therapy.[43][44][45]Next, she wore "big hair and fake nails" to portray Gloria,[46]a girl from New Jersey, in the musical romantic comedyCoyote Ugly(2000), withSalon'sStephanie Zacharekcalling her "a bridge-and-tunnelBetty Boop, full of google-eyed charm".[47]She then returned to New Zealand to star in the independent thrillerSnakeskin(2001), which premiered at theCannes Film Festivaland earned Lynskey a Best Actress nomination at that year'sNew Zealand Film Awards.[48][49]Variety'sDavid Strattonfelt that her work inSnakeskin, where she played Alice, a free-spirited drifter who embarks on a dangerous road trip, was "excellent".[50]
In 2002, Lynskey re-teamed with directorAndy Tennant—whom she previously worked with onEver After—to play a key role in the romantic comedySweet Home Alabama, withThe Austin Chroniclementioning her as a highlight among the ensemble cast.[51]The scene in which her character, Lurlynn, nurses her baby in a crowded bar has since been recognised for its cultural relevance.[52]Next, she had a supporting role inAbandon, the directorial debut ofStephen Gaghan. In his review of the psychological thriller,Variety'sTodd McCarthypointed out that Lynskey did "some self-conscious scene stealing" with her portrayal of a mousy librarian.[53]She made her television debut that same year in theStephen KingminiseriesRose Red, playing the protective older sister of a girl with supernatural powers.[54]
InShattered Glass(2003), a drama depicting the downfall of disgraced ex-journalistStephen Glass, Lynskey appeared as Amy Brand, a writer forThe New Republic. CriticAndrew Sarrisnoted that "the performances [of] Ms.Sevigny, Ms.Dawsonand Ms. Lynskey do more than [just] complement Mr.Christensen's central characterization; they provide a sane backdrop for [his] pathological deceptions to steadily unravel against".[55]Later that year, she began playing the part ofRose, an endearingly devious stalker, on theCBSsitcomTwo and a Half Men.Having initially made a one-off appearance in the pilot episode, she was invited by the producers to become a series regular and went on to feature in various storylines throughout the first two seasons.[56]Worried about beingtypecastas a result of her involvement with the series,[57]Lynskey decided to leave the main ensemble in 2005 to concentrate on film work, a move that showrunnerChuck Lorresaid he had "a lot of respect for", despite "not [being] happy at first".[58]She returned infrequently toTwo and a Half Menas a guest star up until its final episode, which aired in February 2015.[59]"Doing three or four episodes a year enabled me to pay my mortgage and do independent films", she later said. "People in [the indie world] didn't know I was on this huge sitcom. Then, [others] would recognise me from [the show] and think that I never had another job. But I couldn't have done one without the other".[60]
Lynskey played Pauline Harnois, the fame-hungry fiancée of soldierRene Gagnon, inClint Eastwood's epic war filmFlags of Our Fathers(2006).[61]She then joined the main ensemble of the short-livedFoxseriesDrive(2007),[62]withLos Angeles TimescriticMary McNamaradescribing her work as Wendy Patrakas, a new mother desperate to get away from her abusive husband, as "especially compelling".[63]Her next project was the Western miniseriesComanche Moon, which aired on CBS in January 2008. In their critique of the show,Peoplefelt that Lynskey's portrayal of Pearl Coleman, a settler whose marriage falls apart after she is raped, was among the best in the cast.[64]Later that year, she returned once again to New Zealand to headline the romantic dramaShow of Hands,[65]earning strong notices and a Best Actress nomination at theQantas Film Awardsfor playing Jess, a single parent who enters a gruelling endurance competition to win a car.[66][67][68]
In theSam Mendes–directed dramedyAway We Go(2009), Lynskey appeared as Munch, an adoptive mother dealing with the effects of repeated pregnancy loss. The performance was roundly praised,[69][70]with critics finding the moment her character performs a grief-stricken pole dance in front of her husband to be particularly poignant;[71]writing forThe Boston Globe,Wesley Morrisstated, "Lynskey dramatizes sadness and dysfunction with quiet, moving physicality. [Her] whole life is there in her long face and drooping limbs. It's the best performance in the movie."[72]She co-starred that same year as Ginger, the foolishly devoted wife of thieving whistleblowerMatt Damon'sMark Whitacre, inSteven Soderbergh's darkly comedic biopicThe Informant!.[73]Writing forThe Independent, Geoffrey Macnab felt that Lynskey provided "sterling support" to Damon.[74]During promotion of the film in September that year, Soderbergh told theLos Angeles Times:
She is so watchable. You never quite know what you're going to get, you just know it's going to be good. Her rhythms are really unusual, like her cadence and her reaction times to things, and the way [she] lays out a sentence. It's just really, really interesting.[75]
While making the film, Soderbergh discouraged Lynskey from contacting the real Ginger Whitacre, as he wanted Lynskey to reach her own conclusion about whether she had been complicit in her husband's crimes. "I decided she had no idea what was going on", she later said. "She was trusting, she [thought her job was] to stay in the house and take care of the kids ... She wasn't asking too many questions".[76]Lynskey counts her time working onThe Informant!as one of her favourite professional experiences.[58]
Also in 2009, Lynskey appeared as the pregnant girlfriend of a cannabis farmer inTim Blake Nelson'sLeaves of Grass, withRogerEbert.combelieving her performance to be one of the key contributors to the black comedy's "quirky charm".[77]Nelson said of her casting, "Melanie came in and read for me and, though she's from New Zealand, she was by far the most credible version of an Oklahoma girl I saw. And I probably auditioned 50 actresses for that role".[78]Next, she received positive notices for her work as Julie Bingham,[79][80]a soon-to-be bride, in theOscar-nominateddramedyUp in the Air.[81]With his previous films, directorJason Reitmanhad always rejected the idea of casting non-American actors in American roles,[75]but Lynskey said that she "tricked" him into giving her the part by avoiding conversation with him during her audition, thus concealing her real accent; Reitman admitted to being "thrilled" by this.[82]In October 2009, she was presented with a Spotlight Award at theHollywood Film Festival.[83][84]
Lynskey played an insecure wife inHelena from the Wedding(2010), withThe Hollywood Reporterstating in their review, "The actors form a seamless ensemble, but [the film] belongs to [Lynskey]".[85]She then appeared in the sports dramaTouchback(2011), receiving praise for her role as the childhood sweetheart of an ex-football prodigy,[86][87]and garnered positive notices the same year for her portrayal of drug addict Cindy Timmons inTom McCarthy's dramedyWin Win.[88][89]Writing forThe Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney noted that Lynskey brought "welcome soft shadings to the story's disruptive element",[90]while Mary Pols stated in her review forTime, "[Lynskey] has become one of the most reliably intriguing supporting actresses in film ... she had [parts in]Away We Go,The Informant!andUp in the Air[and was] wonderful in all three. InWin Winshe gives a very different kind of performance and is even better."[91]
In 2012, Lynskey appeared briefly as the flirtatious Karen indoomsdayromantic comedySeeking a Friend for the End of the Worldand had a key role as Aunt Helen, the sexually abusive relative of the teenage protagonist, in coming-of-age dramaThe Perks of Being a Wallflower.[92]Due to the nature of her character inPerks, she said that agreeing to take on the part had been a difficult decision.[93]Her next role was that of love interest Sally in the same year'sPutzel, an independent romcom.[94]In their critique of the film, theTallahassee Democratstated that Lynskey "steals the show ... [Putzel] sparks to life whenever [she] arrives on the screen",[95]whileRedefinedescribed her as "delightful" and "deftly believable".[96]
Lynskey's portrayal of Amy Minsky inHello I Must Be Going(2012), an unemployed divorcee who finds herself living back at home with her parents, was met with critical acclaim.[97][98]For the first time in her career, Lynskey appeared in every scene throughout the film; she described the experience as "a lot of pressure" and said that, because of her lack ofbankabilityat the time, she had assumed the part would be given to somebody likeMichelle WilliamsorMaggie Gyllenhaal.[99]Speaking of his decision to cast Lynskey, directorTodd Louisosaid, "I knew if I cast her, the film had the potential to resonate on a thousand different levels".[99]In his review for theLos Angeles Times,Kenneth Turanwrote:
If you know the name Melanie Lynskey, you're already planning to see her inHello I Must Be Going. If you don't, this film will have you making up for lost time. That's how good an actress she is ... Though there is something of the sad sack about [Amy], Lynskey inhabits the role so completely, brings such exquisite naturalness to her performance, that she becomes someone we root for unreservedly.[100]
In a similar appraisal,USA Todaynoted that "Lynskey brings dimension and intelligence" and a "sympathetic blend of humor [and] dignity to the role".[101]The performance earned her a nomination for theGotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Actor,[102]whileScreen Rantplaced it at #6 in their rundown of the best film acting of the early 2010s.[103]The following year, Lynskey took on a lead role inThe Big Ask, an independent black comedy. Her work as Hannah was praised,[104][105]with Brian Tallerico stating in his review forRogerEbert.com, "[she] so often finds ways to elevate lackluster screenwriting, and does so again here. She's the best thing about the movie."[106]
In April 2014, Lynskey was named an Emerging Master honouree at theRiverRun International Film Festival.[107]Her first film project that year wasHappy Christmas, where she played Kelly, a creatively bored novelist whose passion for writing is rekindled when her disruptive sister-in-law comes to visit. The film drew attention for being almost entirelyimprovised,[108]withStephen HoldenofThe New York Timesstating, "The performances [are] so natural that the actors melt into their characters";[109]while other critics singled out Lynskey as a highlight.[110][111]She then had a supporting role inDavid Wain's satirical romcomThey Came Together, and played the female leads inWe'll Never Have Paris—the directorial debut ofSimon Helberg—andAngus MacLachlan'sGoodbye to All That. In his review ofGoodbye to All That,Bilge Ebirisaid that Lynskey's portrayal of frustrated wife Annie was "fantastic",[112]whileVarietydescribed her as "heartbreaking ... This is what falling out of love looks like. It's not screaming matches and altercations; it's apathy and indifference."[113]Towards the end of 2014, she provided the voice of Beatrice, an ill-tempered bluebird, forCartoon Network'sOver the Garden Wall.[114][115]In their appraisal of the animated miniseries, which has since been recognised as a cult classic,[116][117]The A.V. Clubcommented, "Lynskey steals the show with her amazing putdowns and passive-aggressiveness, smartly avoiding overdone sass or sarcasm."[118]
Between 2015 and 2016, Lynskey played Michelle Pierson onHBO'sTogetherness, which focused on the lives of two couples living under the same roof. Created by theDuplass brothers, the heavily improvised dramedy series was a "dream" job for Lynskey,[119][120]who referred to its co-writer and director,Jay Duplass, as her "creative soulmate".[11]The show's performances were commended, with critics paying particular attention to Lynskey.[121][122]Writing for theLos Angeles Times, Robert Lloyd said, "[Lynskey] is all deep waters and live wires; soft and steely, trying on new personas for size, her Michelle becomes the series' gravitational center.

[Lynskey is] one of those actresses I'm never not glad to see, and it's a treat to see her front-and-center here, carrying an entire movie mainly with her eyes, face and shoulders. A performance like this one can be quite tricky—you're essentially reactive a lot of the time, more of a sponge for the film than the motor driving it along—but Lynskey makes everything active by letting you feel Ruth's emotions and sense her train of thought as she puts various pieces together in her head, drawing correct or wrongheaded conclusions. She's also just a terrific audience surrogate. When she snarls or snaps, I wanted to cheer.[142]
I Don't Feel at Homewon theGrand Jury Prizeat the2017 Sundance Festivalwhile Lynskey received a nomination for that year'sGotham Independent Film Award for Best Actress.[143][144]Next, she headlined the controversial independent dramaAnd Then I Go,[145]withParade's Samuel R.

Regarding her acting technique, Lynskey has said, "I don't have any [professional] training ... so the only thing I have to go on is my own instinct. So if a director gives me a note that doesn't feel like it's in line with my instinct, it's very hard for me to do something that ... feels like a lie. So, I'll argue it, and I can get kind of feisty because I feel it in my body, I know what is right".[190]

I'll audition for something and then the feedback has been, 'The director wants you, the creative people want you, but the studio is saying no' ... but I understand. People are investing a lot of money and they want somewhat of a guarantee".[191]She has subsequently taken on leading roles in numerous independent films and been labelled an "indie queen".[192][193][194][195]
Speaking in 2017 about taking risks in her film work, Lynskey said, "I want to tell stories about women who are interesting and complicated and not like people you've seen before ... There aren't that many opportunities [to do that] except in the independent film world. I've made films that have cost $50,000 for the entire film. If you're willing to work like that, you get chances to do really creative, interesting stuff".[6]
Lynskey is often complimented on her ability to perform an American accent.[196][197][198][199][4][200]She attributes this to staying withJoss Whedonwhen she first moved to Los Angeles: "When I came here, I stayed in his guest bedroom ... I watched movie after movie and learned American accents".[201]Tim Blake Nelsonrecalled that when she auditioned for the part of Colleen inLeaves of Grass, "She came in and auditioned for me and then ... opened [her] mouth and started talking in a New Zealand accent and I just couldn't believe it, because her south-eastern Oklahoma accent was so spot on, and it's a very specific accent."[202]
Lynskey is known for herimprovisationskills, which she attributes to classes she attended in her youth.[108][203]She regularly employsdreamworkto help her get into character,[203][204]as well music:[205]"Every movie I've done I have a particular song I keep going back to that puts me in the right emotional place."[206]

I was already starving myself and as thin as I could possibly be ... people [were] putting a lot ofSpanxon me in wardrobe fittings ... [costume designers would say], "Nobody told me there would be girls like you" ... the feedback [around that time] was constantly ... 'You're not beautiful'".[216]That same year, when asked how she was dealing with the response to her role onYellowjackets, Lynskey explained toThe Guardianthat a lot of attention was being placed on her weight: "It's [about] trying to tune out [the negative comments] and [listening instead] to the women who say: thank you for just being on screen and not pinching your tummy, or being like: 'I wish I was thinner'".[14]Meanwhile, she said that the creators ofYellowjacketswere "excited" about her being "an average-size woman": "Nobody's pressuring me to look a different way [and] that's something that I did not think would ever be possible".[223]
In February 2023, Lynskey responded to criticism of her casting inThe Last of Us, when fashion modelAdrianne Curryimplied that Lynskey's body type made her ill-suited to the role of a villainous leader: "[The character is] supposed to be smart, ma'am. I don't need to be muscly. That's what henchmen are for."[224]Jeffrey Pierce, Lynskey's co-star on the show, defended her by saying, "Hollywood has done a terrible job of creating the mythology of, what is a man? What is a woman? What are these aesthetics that we hold up as power?", adding that he thought Lynskey had handled the situation with "grace [and] courage".[225]

Liam Matthews ofTVGuidefelt that Greer "perfectly played [Askey] with spiteful ineptitude," whereas Gwen Ihnat ofThe A.V. Clubdescribed Greer's performance as "uncharacteristically wily [...] refusing to admit that she may have fingered the wrong guy and crafting any number of implausible theories to make that accusation stick.[172][173]The series garnered strong ratings forNBC, and Greer received aHollywood Critics Associationaward nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Broadcast Network or Cable Limited Series.[174][175]InShowtime'sThe First Lady, Greer replacedPamela Adlonas Nancy Howe, the personal confidant of First LadyBetty Ford(Michelle Pfeiffer).[176]While the series received mixed reviews, Meghan O'Keefe published an article onDeciderasserting that Greer "[almost] single-handedly" saved the series, further stating that "Greer might be the only actor in the whole cast who is able to make the didactic, obvious dialogue sound natural and fun."[177][178]

Greer joined the cast of theHBOminiseriesWhite House Plumbers, which depicts theWatergate scandal. Greer was cast as Fran Liddy, the wife ofG.

Greer grew up Catholic, although at the age of 10 she convinced her parents to let her go to a Presbyterian church in 1985, claiming that she thought she would be closer to God there. The real reason was that she thought the boys were cuter at that church.[8]In 2014, Greer stated that she was no longer a practicing Catholic.[190]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
