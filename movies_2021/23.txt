The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolfis anadult animateddark fantasyfilm forNetflix, produced byLauren Schmidt Hissrich, and starringTheo James,Lara Pulver,Graham McTavish, andMary McDonnell. The film serves as aspin-offof the Netflix seriesThe Witcher.[3]It focuses on the origin story ofGeralt's mentor and fellow witcher Vesemir.[4]The film premiered on August 23, 2021.[5][6]
In 1165,[7]the witcher Vesemir saves a child from aleshenin the forests of Kaedwen. Before dying, the creature says something in an archaic elven dialect to Vesemir, leading him to suspect that it was under someone's control. Vesemir is visited by the elf Filavandrel, who thinks the leshen was controlled by Kitsu, one of many elven girls who have gone missing. Meanwhile, the sorceress Tetra Gilcrest, an advisor to the Kaedwen king, argues that witchers should be outlawed and hunted down, but the elderly courtier Lady Zerbst is sympathetic to the witchers and speaks in their favor.
Vesemir reminisces about his youth when he, along with his best friend Illyana, were servants for a noble whose mistress was saved from amahrby a witcher named Deglan with Vesemir's help. Enticed by promises of fortune and desiring to make a name for himself, Vesemir traveled to Kaer Morhen and underwent the training and mutations to become a witcher.
In the present day, Vesemir and his fellow witcher, Luka, are arrested for killing two Kaedwani knights in a bar fight. Lady Zerbst persuades the king to send Vesemir, accompanied by Tetra to rid the forest of Kitsu. She personally delivers the mission order to Vesemir, who recognizes her as Illyana. Vesemir and Tetra set out and she tells him the story of a young sorceress wrongfully killed by a witcher as part of a con, an act which convinced her that witchers are too powerful and cannot be trusted. They find Kitsu, mutated and now able to cast powerful illusions, and fight herbasilisk. They kill the monster, but Kitsu escapes.
Following Kitsu, the pair come across an old and abandoned elven school where they find the bodies of the other missing female elves. They rescue the captured Filavandrel, who explains that Kitsu tried to replicate the experiments that were done on her, and they come to the conclusion that corrupt witchers are responsible, wanting to terrorize the locals into hiring them. Vesemir surmises that the monsters he encountered were probably created in Kaer Morhen and leaves to confront Deglan, who has risen to a high position of leadership. As he departs, Tetra destroys Kitsu's den, finds Kitsu later surveying the destruction, and blames the witchers. Back at court, she reveals the witchers' culpability, and is granted use of the Kaedwani army to lay siege to Kaer Morhen. Illyana sees a captured Luka being put to death and flees to warn Vesemir.
Deglan admits to Vesemir to creating the monsters, including Kitsu, to protect their way of life and are alerted by Illyana of Tetra's assault, which is assisted by Kitsu's monsters. Illyana helps the witcher recruits flee into the mountains. Vesemir confronts Tetra, who has captured the order's mages and is holding them hostage. Kitsu arrives and traps him in an illusion where he never became a witcher, instead having a family with Illyana. However, Vesemir is able to break out of the illusion and engages in a fierce battle with Tetra and her forces. He seemingly kills Tetra and Kitsu, only to realize that Tetra had deceived him with another illusion, killing the mages to destroy the knowledge of creating witchers and mortally wounding Illyana.
Tetra reveals she is the daughter of the sorceress killed by the witcher from her story before the dying Deglan strikes her down. Knowing that the recruits are still alive, he urges Vesemir to guide and watch over them as the new leader. At the behest of Illyana, Vesemir allows Kitsu to flee with her life. Vesemir takes Illyana to a lake, where she always dreamed of living by. The two share a brief moment before she peacefully passes away. He then sets out and catches up to the recruits, including a youngGeralt, with the understanding that they are the last of their kind.

In January 2020,Netflixannounced that an animated film adaptation was in the works from Korean animation studioStudio Mir.[12]Writer Beau DeMayo explained that the team chose to make the film animated rather than live-action because it presented them with some "exciting" storytelling possibilities.[13]The film uses a mix of both traditional and computer-generated animation. When designing Vesemir, animation director Han Kwang Il believed he "shouldn't be too handsome, but he had to be quite good-looking and appealing because he's the main character".[14]For a majority of the character designs, the team aimed for a "European/American style", with the exception of Tetra, whose design fell in more closely with a "Japanese style".[15]
During the virtual WitcherCon event in July 2021, a "Date Announcement" teaser was released.[16][17]A teaser trailer was released on July 21,[18]followed by the full trailer on August 9.[19]The film was released on August 23, 2021.[6][20]

Studio Mir Co., Ltd.(Korean:주식회사 스튜디오 미르;RR:Jusikhoesa Seutyudio Mireu) is a South Koreananimation studiobased inSeoul. Among other works, the studio animated most of the American TV seriesThe Legend of Korra, thefourth seasonofThe Boondocks,Voltron: Legendary Defender,Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Dota: Dragon's Blood,Skull Island,My Adventures with SupermanandX-Men '97, and films likeBig Fish & Begonia,Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's RevengeandThe Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf.
Studio Mir was founded in 2010 by Jae-Myung Yu, together with executive director Kwang-il Han and head of business development Seung-wook Lee. Yu had previously worked for 20 years in animation, including as an animation director for the seriesAvatar: The Last Airbender. He chose the studio's name after the Soviet space stationMir, which inspired him for its "scientific breakthrough and collaborative spirit".[1]
The studio began work with 20 animators on its first project, theNickelodeonanimated series andAvatarsequelThe Legend of Korra– an unusually significant contract for a new studio, which it obtained thanks to Yu's long working relationship with the creators of both series,Bryan KonietzkoandMichael Dante DiMartino. Apart from the animation itself, Mir worked withNickelodeon Animation Studioto contribute inKorra's pre-production and storyboarding, including its elaborate martial arts choreography. Sometime after the conclusion ofThe Legend of Korra, former Nickelodeon vice president Mark Taylor worked with Studio Mir to create the animation for the sci-fi animated seriesVoltron: Legendary Defenderwith some of the creative team fromKorra.[1]
Very little of the animation Mir contributed to has aired in South Korea – only the first season ofKorrahad a "very quiet release". Because of this, the studio is little-known domestically, and, as a consequence, the company is focused on international collaborations.[1]
The studio is working on their first original series titledKojiand looking for investors for the project.[2]
In February 2023, Studio Mir officially became listed onKOSDAQas apublic company.[3]
Some titles are listed on the company's online portfolio.[4]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
