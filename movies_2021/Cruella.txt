In 1964 England, Estella Miller is a creative child with a talent forfashion, but is ostracized for herblack and white hairand develops a nefarious streak. Her mother, Catherine, uses the name "Cruella" for her nefarious streak and encourages her to be nicer. After Estella got expelled from school, Catherine decides to move them toLondon, stopping at a party at Hellman Hall, a mansion on theSuffolkcoast to ask the host for money. Sneaking inside, Estella loses her mother's necklace while being chased by the host'sDalmatian dogs, which push Catherine off a cliffside balcony to her death. Orphaned, Estella runs away to London and befriends street urchins Jasper and Horace.
The three become great friends; Estella practices thievery andgriftswith Jasper and Horace, honing her fashion skills by designing their disguises, alongside their dogs, Buddy and Wink. For her birthday in 1977, Jasper gets her a job at theLiberty department store, but Estella is made a janitor and denied the chance to use her talents. She drunkenly redecorates thewindow displayand impresses Baroness von Hellman, a renowned but authoritarianhaute couturedesigner who offers her a coveted job at her fashion house. Estella gains Baroness' confidence but notices her wearing Catherine's necklace, which she claims is a family heirloom that an employee once stole. Estella asks Jasper and Horace to help retrieve it during Baroness von Hellman's Black and White Ball, suspecting that Baroness is lying.
To conceal her identity, Estella creates an alter-ego, "Cruella", letting her natural hair show rather than wearing her usual wig and wearing one of Baroness von Hellman's old designs from a vintage clothing store owned by the flamboyant Artie. At the ball, Cruella steals the spotlight as Jasper and Horace break into von Hellman's vault, but they realize that the Baroness is already wearing the necklace. Jasper improvises and releases rats into the party, allowing Estella to swipe the necklace. Baroness summons her Dalmatians with a dog whistle, leading Estella to realize that von Hellman was responsible for Catherine's death. In the ensuing chaos, a Dalmatian swallows the necklace. Seeking revenge, Estella orders Jasper and Horace to kidnap the Dalmatians, and recovers the necklace. She then upstages von Hellman at various events in extravagant fashions, gaining notoriety via society columnist Anita Darling, Estella's childhood friend who has agreed to continue writing articles about her. Furious, Baroness fires her lawyer, Roger Dearly, while Cruella's increasingly haughty behavior discomforts Jasper.
Estella designs and sews an elaborately beaded dress, secretly disguising moth cocoons as beads, as the signature piece for Baroness' spring collection. The night of the spring show, Baroness opens the vault to find that the collection has been destroyed by the moths. After seeing this, Baroness realizes Estella and Cruella are the same person. Having wrecked Baroness' show, Cruella stages her own rock music fashion show outside inRegent's Park, wearing a faux Dalmatian-fur coat to trick Baroness into thinking she killed her dogs. Returning home, Estella is confronted by Baroness and her men, who have captured Jasper and Horace. Setting fire to the building, Baroness leaves Estella to die, and has Jasper and Horace sent to prison for her murder. Estella is saved by John, Baroness' valet, who reveals that the necklace unlocks a box containing Estella's birth records; Baroness is her biological mother. She told the Baron von Hellman the baby died, and secretly ordered John to murder the infant Estella so the Baroness could focus on her career and keep her husband's inheritance; the heartbroken Baron died soon after that. Instead, John gave the baby to Catherine, one of von Hellman's maids, who raised Estella in secret.
Estella breaks Jasper and Horace out of prison and reveals the truth, recruiting them, Artie, and John for her final scheme to expose the Baroness. The quintet sneaks into Baroness' charity gala, having arranged for all the guests to dress in black and white, in honour of Cruella. On the balcony, Estella confronts her mother, who feigns an embrace before pushing her over the cliff, unwittingly witnessed by her guests. Estella secretly survives with a hidden parachute and, now legally dead, adopts her Cruella persona for good. Baroness is arrested, swearing revenge on Estella. Before "dying", Estella willed her inheritance to Cruella, including the manor which she renames from Hellman Hall to "Hell Hall", moving in with her accomplices at the end of the film.
In amid-credits scene, Cruella sends Dalmatian puppies to both Anita and Roger –– the latter now works as a musician —- respectively namedPerdita and Pongo. Roger is smitten with Pongo, and begins to write asong about Cruellaon his piano.

Writing forVariety, Peter Debruge said:
The director, who brought a wicked edge to pop-culture reduxI, Tonyaa few years back, has rescuedCruellafrom the predictability of the earlier101 Dalmatiansremakes and created a stylish new franchise of its own in which a one-time villain has been reborn as the unlikeliest of role models.[4]
A. O. ScottofThe New York Timescalled the film "easy enough to watch but hard to care much about", complimenting the film's visual style while also finding that "[the film's] main purpose is to remind you that other movies exist".[72]Peter Travers, reviewing the film forABC News, wrote:
If looks really were everything,Cruellawould be flying high on the dazzling costumes that two-time Oscar winner Jenny Beavan has designed for star Emma Stone to swan around in as this iconic villain of page and screen. But looks alone won't cut it when the plot points are so hit and miss.[73][74]
Justin ChangofLos Angeles Timesremarked the movie as "dazzling fun" and lauded the performances of Stone and Thompson, of which he described the rivalry of the performances as "hard to resist on-screen", and hailed Beavan's costume design on the film as one of her best works sinceMad Max: Fury Road, while drawing parallels of the film's moral ambiguities and Stone's portrayal of the titular character to her previous performance asAbigail HillinThe Favourite.[75]
Alonso DuraldeofTheWrapwrote:
Placing these characters in the '60s and '70s allows director Craig Gillespie and screenwriters Dana Fox and Tony McNamara to place the characters into an exciting moment of fashion history... Costumer Jenny Beavan, art director Martin Foley, and production designerFiona Crombie, and their respective departments, all seem to be enjoying and making the most of the film's period demands.[76]
In addition, Duralde also lauded the performances of Stone, Hauser, and Thompson, drawing comparisons of the characterizations of the latter's portrayal of the Baroness toMiranda PriestlyinThe Devil Wears Pradaand Reynolds Woodcock inPhantom Thread.[76]Peter BradshawofThe Guardianawarded the film four out of five stars, describing it as "entertaining" and an "outrageous punk", as well as praising the performances and dynamic between Stone and Thompson. Furthermore, Bradshaw also complimented the tone of the film's soundtrack toMichael Jacksonand similarly praised the film's mid-70s costume and production designs of Beavan and Crombie as "top-notch".[77]Chicago Sun-Times'sRichard Roeperrated the film with 3/4 stars, and highlighted Gillespie's direction for being "clever" and "devilishly offbeat" while praising the performances of Stone and Thompson as "appropriately over-the-top and wildly entertaining", drawing its comparisons toThe Devil Wears Pradaand also commended the costumes, makeup, and the production values of which he referred to as "spectacular", "dazzling" and a "visual feast", comparing its style toPhantom Threadand noting the similarities of the vibe and tone of the film's soundtrack toGoodfellas,Kingsman: The Secret Service, andBaby Driver.[78]
The Daily Telegraph'sRobbie Collinscored the film four out of five, similarly praised the film, which he described as a "rollicking tale" and an "acid-tipped wackiness", and lauded the film for its different approach in the Disney live-action adaptations as well as the previous101 Dalmatiansversions and its interpretation of the central character in a new context. He also similarly praised the performances (particularly Stone and Thompson) as well as the supporting cast, which he referred to as "zany", while specifically remarking of Stone's performance of Cruella De Vil as "sharp-angled, hyper-expressive" and that Thompson's portrayal of the Baroness "stalks the fine line between threatening and ludicrous with stiletto-heel precision". In addition, Collin also praised the film's visual style and Beavan's costume design as "eyeball-popping" and "a garden-hose-blast to the eyeballs of pure sartorial flair and exuberance".[79]K. Austin Collins ofRolling Stonerated the film with three out of five stars, praising Stone's success in embodying the titular character, and describing her performance as "vampy, stylish, and cruel" while comparing the film's style of storytelling toI, Tonya, of which he noted a similarinternalizedvictim-likestory perspective ofTonya Hardingto Cruella de Vil and even pointed out on the similar "plausibly two-sided" depiction of Stone's Cruella to Andrea "Andy" Sachs fromThe Devil Wears Prada, but with a twisted spin. He also commended the supporting performances, particularly Thompson and Hauser, referring the film as "a battle of wits and knits", "entertaining", and "fun".[80]Jamie Jirak from ComicBook.com called the film as "raising the bar when it comes to their [Disney's] live-action catalog", praising the art department, the performances and nostalgic elements.[81]Debopriyaa Dutta fromScreen Rantopined that the film told a "masterfully nuanced origin" and praised the performances of Stone and Hauser.[82]The Hollywood Outsider's Morgan Lanier described the film as "taking place in the 70's with a lot of camp to lighten the mood", praising Stone for giving Cruella "a twist of vulnerability" and giving the longstanding Disney villain a "fun glimmer". Lanier also praised Thompson's performance saying "Thompson gives the baroness the ability to chill a room." Lanier concluded that the movie was "joyous, campy, great costumes [...] amplified by a killer soundtrack".[83]Kate Erbland ofIndieWiregave the film a "B−", and labelling the film as "exciting" and "fun" and a "colorful, loud, and unexpected look" on the origin story of Cruella De Vil while Erbland singled out the praises on the casting and the performances of Stone, Thompson, Fry, Hauser, and the costumes, but found fault at the film's runtime of which she referred it as "bloated".[84]
The Washington Post'sAnn Hornadaydescribed the film as "tedious, transgressive, chaotic and inert". While praising the performances of Stone, Thompson, Fry, and Hauser, as well as the costumes; she criticized the film, writing, and the runtime of which she found it as "overstuffed", "overlong", and "miserably misanthropic".[85]Mick LaSalleof theSan Francisco Chroniclethought the film was misbegotten and felt that it favors more on style over substance. Though he praised Thompson's performance, the costume design and the soundtrack, he chided the film's writing as "lazy" and "careless".[86]Matt Zoller Seitz ofRogerEbert.comgave the film 2/4 stars, and said: "There's no denying thatCruellais stylish and kinetic, with a nasty edge that's unusual for a recent Disney live-action feature. But it's also exhausting, disorganized, and frustratingly inert, considering how hard it works to assure you that it's thrilling and cheeky."[87]Jacobin's Eileen Jones labelled the film as a "dopey, uninspired, and tedious mess", specifically criticizing the script as "basically rotten" and describing the transformation of Cruella's character as "the complete mangling of one of the greatest Disney villains of all time." Jones took issue with the absence of the "implied critique [...] of Cruella's wealthy entitlement and mad consumer obsession" as shown in101 Dalmatians, and the attempt to make a "legendary dalmatian-skinning villain" into a "scrappy, likable hero". Jones complimented the film's costume design, specifically emphasizing the "trash gown" shown at the Baroness fashion show, and describing it as "sufficiently cool that costume designer Jenny Beavan may win another Oscar".[88]
In May 2021, both Stone and Thompson stated that they would like to do a secondCruellafilm as both a sequel and prequel in the style ofThe Godfather Part II.[122]In June 2021, Disney announced that a sequel was officially in the early stages of development, with Gillespie and McNamara expected to return as director and writer, respectively.[123]In August 2021, Stone closed a deal to reprise her role in the sequel.[124]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey.

In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
