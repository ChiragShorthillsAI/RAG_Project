Eternalsis a 2021 Americansuperhero filmbased on theMarvel Comicsrace theEternals. Produced byMarvel Studiosand distributed byWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it isthe 26th filmin theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU). The film was directed byChloé Zhao, who wrote the screenplay withPatrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, andKaz Firpo. It stars anensemble castincludingGemma Chan,Richard Madden,Kumail Nanjiani,Lia McHugh,Brian Tyree Henry,Lauren Ridloff,Barry Keoghan,Don Lee,Kit Harington,Salma Hayek, andAngelina Jolie. In the film, the Eternals are immortal beings who emerge from hiding after thousands of years to protect Earth from their ancient counterparts, theDeviants.
In April 2018, Marvel Studios presidentKevin Feigeannounced that a film based on the Eternals was in development and would explore the group asancient aliensliving throughout human history. Ryan and Kaz Firpo were hired to write the script, and Zhao was set to direct in September. She was given significant creative freedom to rewrite the script, taking particular inspiration fromTerrence Malick's films, and to use more locations and natural lighting than previous MCU films had. Casting began in early 2019 and Burleigh joined to work on the script ahead ofprincipal photography, which took place from July 2019 to February 2020 atPinewood Studiosand on location in England and theCanary Islands.
Eternalspremiered at theDolby TheatreinLos Angeleson October 18, 2021, and was released in the United States on November 5 as part ofPhase Fourof the MCU. The film grossed $402 million worldwide and received some awards and nominations, but it also became the first MCU film to not receive generally positive reviews. Particular criticism went to the screenplay and pacing, with commentators feeling it did not live up to Zhao's previous work or to previous MCU films. It received some praise for its themes and visuals.
In 5000 BC, ten superpowered beings known asEternals—Ajak,Sersi,Ikaris,Kingo,Sprite,Phastos,Makkari,Druig,Gilgamesh, andThena—are sent to Earth byArishem, aCelestial, on thestarshipDomo. They are charged with exterminating invasive entities known as theDeviants. After the last Deviants are killed in 1521, the group's opinions differ over their continued relationship with humankind. Over the next 500 years, they mostly live apart, waiting for Arishem's orders.
In the present, Sersi and Sprite live together inLondon. After Sersi's partner Ikaris left her without explanation centuries earlier, she is now in a relationship with humanDane Whitmanwho works at theNatural History Museum. When the trio is attacked by the DeviantKro, Ikaris arrives and chases the creature away. The three Eternals travel to South Dakota to reunite with their leader, Ajak, only to find her dead. Sersi is posthumously chosen by Ajak as her successor, granting her the ability to communicate with Arishem.
Sersi learns that the Eternals' mission was actually to prepare Earth for theEmergenceof a new Celestial. Arishem explains that, for millions of years, he has been planting Celestial seeds inside planets where the energy from large populations allows new Celestials to be born. The Deviants were sent to destroy theapex predatorsof each planet to ensure the development of intelligent life, but when they evolved and began hunting the planets' native populations, Arishem created the Eternals to counter them. With the recent end ofthe Bliprestoring Earth's population,[b]humankind has reached the necessary size to allow the CelestialTiamutto be born, which will result in Earth's destruction.
Hoping to delay the Emergence, the Eternals reunite. At Druig's residence in theAmazon rainforest, they are attacked by the Deviants. They kill them all except for Kro, who kills Gilgamesh before fleeing. Phastos proposes they use the Uni-Mind, a connection between all the Eternals that would give Druig enough power to put Tiamut to sleep with hismind-controlabilities. However, Ikaris is loyal to Arishem and refuses to help stop the Emergence. He reveals that Ajak wanted to stop the Emergence and save humanity, so he led her to the Deviants and allowed them to kill her. Sprite joins Ikaris due to her unrequited love for him while Kingo chooses to leave.
Makkari locates the place of the Emergence, anactive volcanoin the Indian Ocean, where Ikaris and Sprite attempt to stop them. Druig knocks out Sprite, and Phastos restrains Ikaris. Kro arrives and is killed by Thena. Druig is unable to put Tiamut to sleep, and Sersi instead attempts to turn him into marble. Ikaris breaks free of his restraints and goes to kill Sersi, but is unable to due to his love for her. Both he and Sprite join with the others in the Uni-Mind, and Sersi gains enough power to turn Tiamut into marble. Guilt-ridden, Ikaris flies into the Sun. Sersi uses the remaining Uni-Mind energy to turn Sprite into a human, ending herpermanent childlike state.
Thena, Druig, and Makkari depart on theDomoto warn Eternals on other planets of the Emergences. Whitman professes his love for Sersi and is about to reveal a secret about his family history when she, Phastos, and Kingo are lifted into space by Arishem. Displeased with their treason, Arishem says he will spare humanity if the Eternals' memories show that humans are worthy of living. He vows to return for judgment and takes the trio into a singularity.
In amid-credits scene, Thena, Makkari, and Druig meet the EternalErosand his assistantPip the Troll. In a post-credits scene, an unseen person[c]questions whether Whitman is ready to wield theEbony Blade.

In April 2015,Marvel Televisionwas working with screenwriterJohn Ridleyto craft a new television series forABC, "reinventing" an existing Marvel character or property,[27]which was revealed years later to be theEternals.[28]Through its development, which ultimately had eventually been abandoned during the folding of Marvel Television in December 2019,[29][28]Ridley stated that he was trying to make a superhero television series that viewers had not necessarily seen before, with hopes that it could occupy "a space that [was] not currently being filled" by Marvel.[30]His approach to the characters would have been "a really weird story", though he stated the characters are "a really hard property" to adapt while conceding that while he believed his series would have been good it may not have been entertaining for everyone.[28]
Marvel StudiospresidentKevin Feigesaid in April 2018 that the studio was actively developing a film based on theMarvel ComicsseriesEternals, created byJack Kirby, to be released as part of theirPhase Fourslate of films. Marvel Studios had met with multiple screenwriters and was believed to be focusing on the characterSersiin the film.[31]Marvel set Ryan andKaz Firpoto write the script a month later,[32]with their outline including a love story between the characters Sersi andIkaris.[33]In June, Feige said Marvel was interested in exploring the "ancient alienskind of sci-fi trope" by having the Eternals be the inspiration for myths and legends throughout the history of theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU).[34]
During late August, Marvel's director search forEternalsnarrowed to a shortlist that includedChloé Zhao—who had also been in the running to direct Marvel'sBlack Widow(2021)—Nicole Kassell,Travis Knight, and the pair ofCristina GallegoandCiro Guerra.[33]Zhao approached Marvel Studios about making the film as she had been a fan of the MCU. She wanted to work with the studio to bring her own take andworld-buildingto the franchise,[35]and impressed them with a presentation that Feige described as fascinating, with "reams of visuals".[36]Zhao worked with producerNate Mooreto develop herpitch.[37]The presentation left Marvel concerned that she might take on a different big-studio project instead ofEternals, forcing them to move quickly to secure her, and Zhao was hired as director in September.[33][38]Zhao hoped to push the scope of the film further than Marvel'sAvengers: Endgame(2019),[36]but also wanted it to have intimacy.[39]Zhao described the film as a melting pot of influences, from Kirby's original work,Neil Gaiman's2006 run, previous MCU projects, Zhao's fandom of the MCU, and her love of science fiction and fantasy films andmanga.[37]Speaking specifically to her love of manga, she hoped those influences would create a "marriage of East and West".[36]Zhao cited the TV seriesAncient Aliens, theFinal Fantasyvideo game series, the concepts fromYuval Noah Harari's bookSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, and the films ofTerrence Malickas her inspirations for the film.[40]
Marvel consideredEternalsto be a perfect transition into its next phase of films along with projects such asCaptain Marvel(2019),[38]allowing the studio to cast a diverse group of actors to portray the various Eternals.[33]Moore's initial planning documents for the project including the swapping of genders, sexualities, and ethnicities of some characters from the comic books, with Zhao further advocating for this approach.[10]In February 2019, Feige reiterated that Marvel was interested in the Eternals due to Kirby's epic, century-spanning story,[41]with the film version spanning 7,000 years and exploring humanity's place in the cosmos.[37]Zhao noted that the Eternals "have lived among us for so long, [they have] the same struggles like identity, purpose, faith, personal freedom versus greater good — all the duality and flaws that make us human". When trying to develop a story that spanned so many years, Marvel realized that the characters would likely be a family unit, with a friendship that would "turn into frenemies, and then turn into enemies, and then come back to friendship". Zhao also looked to the Earth as an eleventh character in the film, chronicling its journey alongside the Eternal characters.[9]Marvel also wanted to create more ensemble films that were not crossover films, likeGuardians of the Galaxy(2014), while introducing relatively unknown characters to audiences as they did withthat film's title charactersand theAvengers.[41]
"I wanted it to reflect the world we live in. But also I wanted to put a cast together that feels like a group of misfits. I didn't want the jocks. I want you to walk away at the end of the movie not thinking, 'This person is this ethnicity, that person is that nationality.' No. I want you to walk away thinking, 'That's a family.' You don't think about what they represent."
Throughout early 2019, Zhao began working on a draft of the script, building upon the multiple drafts submitted by the Firpos. Approximately four months ahead of filming, the script was not finalized, so Moore introducedPatrick Burleigh, who had been part of Marvel's writers program, to Zhao in the hopes he could assist with the writing. Zhao hired him to work on the screenplay, which he did for about three months ahead of filming. Burleigh believed Zhao needed to write on the film as well as direct to "process the film through her own filter", and noted her draft showed she was "trying to make the Terrence Malick version of a Marvel film"; Zhao citing his filmThe Tree of Life(2011) as an inspiration. Burleigh called his work with Zhao on the script mostly "structural" to find "the flow of the film", likening the story to aroad trip film.[42]
Angelina Joliejoined the cast in March 2019, reportedly as Sersi,[43][44]withKumail NanjianiandDon Leecast in undisclosed roles the next month.[44][45]At that time, the film was expected to feature Marvel Studios' first gay superhero.[46]In May,Richard Maddenentered negotiations for the role of Ikaris,[47]andSalma Hayekhad entered early negotiations for an undisclosed role the following month.[48]In July,Varietyreported that the cast included Jolie, Madden, andMillie Bobby Brown, but Brown denied that she had been cast.[49][50]
At the 2019San Diego Comic-Con, Feige officially announcedThe Eternalswith a release date of November 6, 2020. He officially announced the casting of Jolie asThena, Nanjiani asKingo, Lee asGilgamesh, Madden as Ikaris, and Hayek asAjak, along withLauren RidloffasMakkari,Brian Tyree HenryasPhastos, andLia McHughasSprite.[51]Zhao looked for actors for each role that could "find a bit of themselves in their character".[9]Feige added that one of these actors was portraying an LGBTQ character,[52]with actorHaaz Sleimanlater revealing that Phastos is depicted as gay in the film. Sleiman portrays the character's husband, and the pair have a child in the film. Sleiman felt it was important to depict "how loving and beautiful a queer family can be" rather than the "sexual or rebellious" depiction in some previous media.[18]Feige said the relationship was "always sort of inherent in the story" and he felt it was "extremely well done" in the film,[36]while Sleiman said it was a "thoughtful" depiction.[53]
Eternalsis set around eight months after the events ofAvengers: Endgame,[54]and addresses why the Eternals did not interfere in any previous conflicts in the MCU. Both Feige and Moore said the film would have "major ripple effects" on the future of the MCU, and at times, it was "a challenge" to balance the grounded nature of the MCU with the "mythic grandeur" of the Eternals property.[9]
By the time of the film's official announcement in July 2019,principal photographyhad begun atPinewood StudiosinBuckinghamshire, England.[55][56]Ben Davisserved as director of photography, after doing so on several previous MCU films.[10][57]Zhao said Marvel Studios allowed her creative freedom to shoot the film on location, "exactly the way [she] wanted to shoot" it. She was able to use a similar style to her previous films, including 360° shots and working with the same camera and rigs as were used for her filmNomadland(2020),[36]which Zhao was set to completeback-to-backwithEternals.[37]Zhao felt that she "got lucky in that Marvel wants to take risks and do something different."[36]Zhao citedThe Revenant(2015) as a primary influence when composing the film's action sequences.[58]
Gemma ChanandBarry Keoghanwere in talks to join the cast in August 2019.[59][60]Chan previously portrayedMinn-ErvainCaptain Marvel, but reports noted that she was potentially being looked at by Marvel to play a separate character in this film.[59]Since Minn-Erva dies in that film, Chan had felt that it was unlikely she would return to the MCU, but after working on the film she was told by Feige that the studio wanted to "make better use" of her in a future project. This led to Chan auditioning for Sersi, one of the last actresses to be considered for the role. Chan later described Sersi as the most difficult role for the film to cast.[61]Chan and Keoghan were confirmed to be cast in the film at theD23 Expoin August, in the roles of Sersi andDruig, respectively, along withKit HaringtonasDane Whitman.[62]Chan said she and Marvel Studios were surprised by how soon afterCaptain Marvelher new MCU role came, with both assuming that it would have been a project further in the future.[61]Harish Patelwas cast at the end of August asKarun, Kingo's manager,[63][64]and filmed his role from September 2019 until January 2020.[63]
By early November, filming had taken place in theCanary Islands. The cast and crew, including Jolie and Madden, had to be evacuated from a shooting location on the island ofFuerteventurawhen an explosive device, thought to be a remnant armament from a Nazi base, was found there.[65]Later that month,Zain Al Rafeeajoined the cast.[25][66]In early January 2020, filming took place outside theOxford University Museum of Natural HistoryinOxford, England,[67]as well asHampstead Heathand inCamdenin London,[68][69]under theworking titleSack Lunch.[69][70]Chan said the filming process felt very different from what she experienced onCaptain Marvel, explaining thatEternalsshot more on location and utilized natural light whileCaptain Marvelhad more studio work and bluescreens.[61]Filmingwrappedon February 4, 2020.[71]
In March 2020,Scanline VFX, one of the companies working on the film's visual effects, confirmed that they would be working remotely due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[72]Industrial Light & Magic,Luma Pictures,RISE, andWeta Digitalalso worked on the film's visual effects.[73]In early April, Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the pandemic, movingThe Eternals'release date to February 12, 2021.[74]In August, the film's title was officially shortened fromThe EternalstoEternals,[75]and the next month, the release date was pushed back to November 5, 2021.[76]Reshoots had taken place by mid-November 2020.[77]
Additional filming occurred inLos Angelesin early February, also under the working titleSack Lunch.[78]Dylan TichenorandCraig Woodserve as co-editors of the film.[37]Tichenor said Zhao usually edits her own films and has "strong opinions", but onEternalsshe was relying on Tichenor and Wood due to the size of the production and the ongoing awards season forNomadland. Tichenor added that Zhao respected the pair's editing experience and point of view, and they made their first cut of the film without much input from her. They began adjusting the film based on Zhao's feedback and were still working on the editing in April 2021.[79]At the end of the month, Zhao said editing for the film was in its "final stretch",[37]and Jashaun St. John was revealed to appear in the film, after previously starring in Zhao's filmSongs My Brothers Taught Me(2015).[80]
At the end of May 2021, with the release of the first teaser trailer and poster for the film, the official writing credits were revealed: Zhao was credited as the screenwriter, both as a solo contributor and as part of a writing team with Burleigh, while Ryan and Kaz Firpo received story credit.[1][81]Additionally,Gil Birminghamwas revealed to have been cast in the film,[82]although he was absent in the final film.[citation needed]In July 2021,Writers Guild of America Westpresented the film's final writing credits, awarding Ryan and Kaz Firpo screenplay credit along with Zhao and the team of Zhao and Burleigh, in addition to their story credit.[2][42]Moore believed the studio had "bit off as much as we could chew" with the film, creating one that "felt urgent and present and had [a fast] pace, but also took time to reflect back over the centuries".[9]
At the film's world premiere, Matt Donnelly ofVarietytweeted thatHarry Stylesmade an appearance in apost-credits sceneasEros,Thanos' brother in the comics, which was not shown in early press screenings of the film.[83]Zhao later revealed that she "kept tabs on [Styles]" since his appearance inDunkirk(2017), believing that he "makes me think of Eros as a character".[84]WWEwrestlerBecky Lynchhad a role in the film for a planned post-credits scene that was intended to set up a future project. The scene was removed for being reportedly "too depressing".[85]
Ramin Djawadicomposed the score for the film, after previously doing so for Marvel'sIron Man(2008).[86]Two songs from the film's soundtrack, "Across the Oceans of Time" and "Eternals Theme", were released assingleson October 22, 2021, while the full album was released on November 3.[87][88]
The first footage of the film was released in May 2021, as part of a promotional video from Marvel Studios celebrating their films and a return to theaters in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.[89][90]Though the footage was limited and "vague", Hoai-Tran Bui at/Filmstill felt it was "very exciting".[91]Chaim Gartenberg ofThe Vergefelt one of the biggest moments of the footage was seeing Jolie wielding a sword made of light. He was also encouraged thatEternalsappeared to be one of Marvel's first films to "deliver on [their] years-long promise of creating films with more diverse casts".[89]Nerdist'sMichael Arbeiter said the footage was quick, but felt that it "manages an air of wonderment".[90]
The first teaser for the film was released on May 24, 2021. Gartenberg felt the teaser was light on plot elements, with it instead focusing on the "civilization-spanning scope of the superhero team and its members throughout human history". He also believed the film was "a big swing" from Marvel Studios to entice audiences with a lesser-known comics property, but believed that it would succeed due to its diverse cast of well-known actors and Zhao's status as "one of the most exciting directors around".[92]io9'sCharlies Pulliam-Moore felt the trailer was a "multiple millennia-spanning recap of Earth's history", and said it was unclear how much the larger MCU would impact on the film outside of a brief reference to the Avengers at the end of the trailer.[93]Writing forEntertainment Weekly, Nick Romano felt the teaser was a combination of "thrilling, goosebump-inducing moments" and some jokes.[94]Erik Adams ofThe A.V. Clubfelt the spot teased some fresh angles for the MCU in a similar way toThor: Ragnarok(2017) andGuardians of the Galaxy(2014), and he enjoyed the images of Kingo's Bollywood dance, Sprite performing karaoke, and the end scene of the Eternals eating together and joking about the Avengers.[95]After seeing the teaser,Variety'sAdam B. Vary described the film as "unquestionably a Chloé Zhao movie", but wished more action set pieces were featured in the teaser to see how Zhao would approach them in the film.[1]Adele Ankers ofIGNdiscussed the poster that was released at the same time as the trailer, highlighting how the Eternals appear in silhouette against a sunlit background which she described as "another taste of Chloé Zhao's signature filming style and the use of natural light to illuminate a frame" that would be seen in the film.[96]Upon release, the teaser quickly became the number one trending video onYouTubeand amassed 77 million global views in its first 24 hours.[97]Disney's president of marketing Asad Ayaz said the teaser was designed to just be an introduction to the characters and tone and not give much of the film away, adding the marketing team would be "very judicious" on when more material would be revealed, while also using the releases ofBlack WidowandShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten RingsbeforeEternalsto help expose audiences to the characters.[98]
The final trailer was released in August 2021, with Ethan Shanfeld and Manori Ravindran ofVarietyfeeling it was "more serious in tone" than the teaser with the Eternals "grappling with the prospect of emerging after centuries living apart in order to help humans".[99]Entertainment Weekly'sDevan Coggan felt that the trailer was the "best glimpse yet" of the film and gave a "sense of the vast scale and scope of the film", while answering "one important question" about the absence of the Eternals during the conflict againstThanosinAvengers: Infinity WarandAvengers: Endgame.[100]Aaron Couch atThe Hollywood Reportersaid the trailer "reveals much of [the film's] plot as well as its characters' powers, teasing the answers to key questions about who the Eternals answer to, their relationship to Earth and why they ultimately didn't intervene" in the conflict against Thanos.[101]
In October 2021,Lexusreleased a commercial promoting the film and itsLexus IS 500sports sedan starring Nanjiani as Kingo, with frequent MCU directorsJoe and Anthony Russoguiding its development andFramestoreworking on the visual effects.[102]Lexus created tenconcept carsbased on the ten Eternals characters from the film.[103]TheLS 500handNXare featured in the film.[102]Beginning on November 20, 2021, select costumes from the film were part of theFuturesexhibit at theSmithsonian Institution'sArts and Industries Building, which ran through July 2022. Behind-the-scenes content looking at the evolution of the film's visuals as well as an augmented reality experience were also included in the exhibit.[104]
Eternalshad its world premiere at theDolby TheatreinHollywood, Los Angeles, on October 18, 2021,[105]and was screened at theRome Film Festivalon October 24.[106]The film was released theatrically in many European countries on November 3, and in the United States and the United Kingdom on November 5 inRealD 3Dand4DX.[106]In September 2021, Disney announced that the film would have an exclusive theatrical release for a minimum of 45 days.[107]Eternalswas previously set for release on November 6, 2020,[108]before it was shifted to February 12, 2021,[74]and then to the November 2021 date, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[76]It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[109]
In May 2021, a Chinese state media report excludedEternals, as well asShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, from its list of upcoming MCU films releasing, whichVarietynoted "added to rumors" that the films would not be released in China, especially since Zhao had become "an unexpectedpersona non grata" in the country after she was scrutinized by Chinesenetizensover her remarks in a 2013 interview withFilmmakermagazine in which she described China as "a place where there are lies everywhere".[110][111][112]By September 2021,Deadline Hollywoodreported it remained "an open question" if the Chinese government or Zhao would attempt to "rehabilitate" the situation, but it "seems likely" the film would not be released in China following the country's response toNomadlandas well asShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Ringslikely not being released in the country either following backlash to comments made by starSimu Liuin 2017.[113]
The film was not released inSaudi Arabia,Kuwait,Qatar,BahrainandOmandue to the depiction of a gay couple. Theaters in theUnited Arab Emirates,Jordan,Lebanon, andEgyptwere set to show an edited version of the film which is missing all the love scenes.[114]Angelina Jolie criticized the countries' decision to ban the film, saying: "I'm sad for [those audiences]. And I'm proud of Marvel for refusing to cut those scenes out. I still don't understand how we live in a world today where there's still [people who] would not see the family Phastos has and the beauty of that relationship and that love. How anybody is angry about it, threatened by it, doesn't approve or appreciate it is ignorant."[115]Lebanese actorHaaz Sleiman, who played Phastos' husband Ben in the film, also voiced the same reaction towards the matter: "They stood their ground and said, 'Nope, we are not going to compromise the integrity of our film.' It made these Arab countries looks [sic] so ignorant and pathetic. I have no respect for those governments. They have displayed to the world that they are not only a disgrace to humanity, but to God. Hopefully this will inspire the Saudi people, the Kuwaiti people and the people in Qatar to fight back."[116]Marvel later agreed to cut any kind of love scenes, including the gay couple kiss for the film's release inIndonesia, which received praise from the IndonesianFilm Censorship Board(LSF).[117]

Thereview aggregatorRotten Tomatoesreports an approval rating of 47% based on 417 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "An ambitious superhero epic that soars as often as it strains,Eternalstakes the MCU in intriguing—and occasionally confounding—new directions."[141]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[142]Upon release, it became the lowest-rated MCU film on both websites and the first installment to be classified as "rotten" on Rotten Tomatoes.[143]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest grade for an MCU film at the time of its release, andPostTrakreported 78% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it.[128]
Charlotte O'Sullivan of theEvening Standarddescribed the film as "lavish" and "ambitious", and praised the fight sequences as "astounding, beautifully paced and crammed with detail".[144]Robert Abele ofTheWrapcommended the cinematography and felt "an earnestness to the operatic stakes".[145]Oliver Jones of theObservercalled it "full of wonder and romance and fueled by an agenda and audacity all its own".[146]Owen Gleibermanwas disappointed over Zhao's missing filmmaking style that shaped her filmsThe Rider(2017) andNomadland(2020) to "embrace the straight-up expository conventionality of Marvel filmmaking", but felt that the film was a "squarely fun and gratifying watch".[147]Moira Macdonald ofThe Seattle Timesthought "it's got some pretty slow spots midfilm and it's desperately in need of a bit more wit ... what it does have is a palpable, artful mood; this is a movie full of superheroes who spend time thinking and feeling, and of special effects that aren't just zippy but often delicately elegant".[148]
Linda Marric ofThe Jewish Chronicledescribed it as "a mishmash of well-meaning, yet jarringly verbose and bafflingly incoherent nonsense which is only just about saved by some half decent performances";[149]Nicholas Barber ofBBC Culturecalled Zhao's direction "workmanlike";[150]and Clarisse Loughrey ofThe Independentsaid that it "strives for the same expansive soulfulness" asNomadland"but discovers there's room enough only for the occasional burst of it".[151]Brian Truitt ofUSA Todaypraised Zhao's "penchant for naturalistic environments", but wrote that the narrative "struggles to juggle its many subplots and tries to do too much".[152]Mark Kennedy of theAssociated Presscriticized the dialogue and fight scenes, but praised the visual effects and Nanjiani's performance.[153]Shirley Li ofThe Atlanticfelt that "Zhao's delicate examination of her characters outshinesEternals'duller and more convoluted moments".[154]
Robbie Collinwrote the film was "constantly engaged in a kind of grit-toothed authenticity theatre, going out of its way to show you it's doing all the things proper cinema does, even though none of them bring any discernible benefit";[155]Kevin Maherfelt "a strange self-sabotaging energy at the heart";[156]and Steve Rose ofThe Guardianmissed "the breezy wit of Marvel's best movies ... like coming intoAvengers: Endgamecold without having seen any of the preceding installments".[157]K. Austin Collins ofRolling Stonefelt that the film was "good at telling us where to look, at impressing us with its manufactured sense of grandeur", but lacked "any credible sense of what's actually worth seeing".[158]Justin Changof theLos Angeles Timeshad a "depressing realization that you've just seen one of the more interesting movies Marvel will ever make, and hopefully the least interesting one Chloé Zhao will ever make".[159]Brian Lowry ofCNNthought "the movie's structural flaws offset its stunning visuals and strong performances".[160]Kyle SmithofNational Reviewwas harsher, describing it as "one of the dumbest, cheesiest, most trite, and least human" of the MCU films.[161]
The mixed reception surprised some commentators, given the MCU's positive track record and the acclaim of Zhao's previous work. Richard Newby ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote that "much of the criticism of Kirby's work", which was divisive for its subject matter and relationship to the widerMarvel Universe, "has followed Zhao in her adaptation." He compared the divisive response to that of Zack Snyder'sDC Extended UniversefilmsMan of SteelandBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016), writing that they andEternalsshare "a deconstructive approach to superheroes and force them to question their purpose in the world, through meditative and melancholy narrative beats, and a tragic yet hopeful ending." This approach, he felt, subverted critics and audiences' expectations, which made them review the film more harshly.[162]Zhao addressed some of the criticisms of the film, believing some of the divisiveness came from everyone "having an existential crisis" because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the film being an "existential crisis, both for humanity and God". She also felt the reactions to how the film incorporated her filmmaking sensibilities with Marvel's were "a testament to how much we had merged with each other; how uncomfortable that might make people feel".[163]
The film was given the Seal of Authentic Representation from theRuderman Family Foundationfor Ridloff's role as Makkari. The seal is given to films and series that feature actors with disabilities who have at least five lines of dialogue.[164]Eternalswas also one of 28 films that receivedthe ReFrame Stampfor 2021, awarded by the gender equity coalitionReFramefor films that are proven to have gender-balanced hiring.[165]
In February 2021, the documentary seriesMarvel Studios: Assembledwas announced.[179]The special on this film, "The Making ofEternals", was released on Disney+ on February 16, 2022.[180]
In October 2021, Zhao said she was open to making a sequel.[181]The next month, Kaz and Ryan Firpo expressed interest in making a prequel series for Disney+ that would focus on one Eternal in a different time period each episode, such as an episode about Thena in Ancient Greece and one about Kingo in 1890s Mumbai where he balances his life as a film star withMahatma Gandhi'scampaign for India's independencefromBritish rule. They also felt there were opportunities to continue the film's story by further exploring Dane Whitman and showing the Eternals confronting the Celestials.[182]
Chan said in January 2022 that she would reprise the role of Sersi in the future.[183]Feige was asked about Styles's future in the MCU that July and said Marvel Studios was excited to further explore the characters Eros and Pip as part of the MCU's more cosmic stories.[184]A month later, Oswalt said a sequel had been confirmed by Marvel Studios and Zhao was returning to direct. He hoped it would further explore Eros and Pip, and expressed interest in a spin-off film for the characters.[185]In October, Moore said Marvel intended to bring back the Eternals characters in the future of the MCU.[186]Nanjiani said the following month that he was unaware of a sequel and believed Oswalt was mistaken, but expressed interest in reprising his role as Kingo.[187]Don Lee's talent agency indicated in December that he would reprise his role as Gilgamesh in anEternalssequel.[188]Oswalt clarified his statements in February 2023, saying a sequel was not in development at that time and that he had been misled.[189]In July 2024, Feige said there were no plans for a sequel at the time.[190]

During what is known as Marvel's "Timely era",Captain Americawas licensed out toRepublic Picturesfora 1944 serial filmonly for the free advertising. Timely failed to provide any drawing of Captain America withhis shieldor any further background, and Republic created a whole new background for the character and portrayed the character using a gun.[11]From the late 1970s through the early 1990s,Marvel Comics GroupandMarvel Entertainment Group(MEG) sold options to studios to produce films based onMarvel Comics characters. One of Marvel's superheroes,Spider-Man, was optioned in the late 1970s, and rights reverted to Marvel without a film having been produced within the allocated time frame. From 1986 to 1996, most of Marvel's major characters were optioned, including theFantastic Four,X-Men,Daredevil, theHulk,Silver Surfer, andIron Man.[12]Marvel's first big-screen adaptation of one of its properties was the 1986 filmHoward the Duck,[13]which was abox-office bomb.[14]MEG was purchased byNew World Entertainmentin November 1986[15]and moved to produce films based on the Marvel characters. It releasedThe Punisher(1989) before MEG was sold toRonald Perelman'sAndrews Group. Two other films were produced:Captain America(1990) released in the United Kingdom on screens and direct to video in the United States, andThe Fantastic Four(1994), not intended for release.[16]
After MEG acquiredToyBizin 1993,Avi Aradof ToyBiz was named president and chief executive officer (CEO) of both the Marvel Films division andNew World Family Filmworks, aNew World Entertainmentsubsidiary. New World was MEG's former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group.[17][18]Marvel ProductionsbecameNew World Animationby 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films, includingMarvel Films Animation.[17][19][20]Marvel Films Animation sharedTom Tataranowiczwith New World Animation as head of development and production.[21]New World Animation (The Incredible Hulk),Saban(X-Men: The Animated Series) and Marvel Films Animation (Spider-Man) each produced a Marvel series for television for the 1996–1997 season.[22][20][23]By the end of 1993, Arad and20th Century Foxstruck a deal to make a film based on theX-Men.[24]In August 1996, New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation were sold along with the rest of New World by the Andrews Group toNews Corporationand theFox Entertainment Group. As part of the deal, Marvel licensed the rights to Captain America, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer to be on theFox Kids Networkand produced by Saban. New World Animation continued producing a second season ofThe Incredible HulkforUPN.[22][25]
On August 7, 1996, Marvel Studios was created by Marvel. Filing with theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionto raise money to finance the new corporation, Marvel,Isaac Perlmutter's Zib, Inc. and Avi Arad sold ToyBiz stocks.[12][26]ToyBiz filed an offering of 7.5 million shares with a closing price of $20.125 at the time, making the offering worth approximately $150 million. ToyBiz sought to sell 1 million shares.[27]Jerry Calabrese, the president of Marvel Entertainment Group, and Avi Arad, head of Marvel Films and a director of ToyBiz, were assigned tandem control of Marvel Studios. Under Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to controlpre-productionby commissioning scripts, hiring directors, and casting characters, providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution. Arad said of the goal for control, "When you get into business with a big studio, they are developing a hundred or 500 projects; you get totally lost. That isn't working for us. We're just not going to do it anymore. Period."[12]Marvel Studios arranged a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox to cover markets in the United States and internationally.[28]
In December 1996, Marvel Entertainment Group underwent aChapter 11 bankruptcyreorganization plan, including Marvel Studios as part of its strategic investment.[29]By 1997, Marvel Studios was actively pursuing various film productions based on Marvel characters, including the eventual filmsX-Men(2000),Daredevil(2003),Elektra(2005), andFantastic Four(2005). Unproduced projects includedPrince Namor, based on the characterNamorand to be directed byPhilip Kaufman, andMort the Dead Teenager, based on the comic book of the same name and written by John Payson andMortcreatorLarry Hama.[30]Marvel's Captain America animated series with Saban Entertainment for Fox Kids Network was set to premiere in late 1998. However, due to the bankruptcy, the series was canceled after only character designs and a one-minute promotional reel were made.[31][32][33]
The first film packaged and licensed by Marvel Studios wasBlade(1998), based on the vampire hunterBlade. The film was directed byStephen Norringtonand starredWesley SnipesasBlade. It was released on August 21, 1998, grossing $70,087,718 in the United States and Canada and $131,183,530 worldwide.[34]Bladewas followed byX-Men, which was directed byBryan Singerand was released on July 14, 2000.X-Mengrossed $157,299,717 in the United States and Canada and $296,250,053 worldwide.[35]BladeandX-Mendemonstrated that widely popular films could be made out of comic book characters not familiar to the general public.[36]Leading up toX-Men'srelease, Marvel Studios negotiated a deal with then-functionalArtisan Entertainment, successful with the low-budgetThe Blair Witch Project, for a co-production joint venture that included rights to 15 Marvel characters including Captain America,Thor(as a television series),Black Panther(with Snipes attached to produce and star),Deadpool,Iron Fist,Morbius, the Living Vampire,Longshot,Power Pack,Mort the Dead Teenager,Ant-Man,[37]and thePunisher.[38]Artisan would finance and distribute while Marvel would develop licensing and merchandising tie-ins. The resulting production library, which would also include television series, direct-to-video films, and internet projects, would be co-owned.[37]By 2001, the success of Marvel Entertainment'sUltimate Marvelimprint comics created leverage in Hollywood for Marvel Studios, pushing more properties into development.[39]
The next film licensed from Marvel Studios wasSpider-Man(2002) byColumbia Pictures, directed bySam Raimiand starringTobey MaguireasSpider-Man. The film was released on May 3, 2002, grossing $403,706,375 in the United States and Canada and $821,708,551 worldwide.[42]The early success ofSpider-Manled the film's studio to issue a seven-figure advance for a sequel. Arad spoke of the deal, "Movies make sequels. Therefore, it's a big economic luxury to know that a movie's going to get a second and third. This is a business of precedence."[43]According to aLehman Brothersanalysis, Marvel Studios made only $62 million for the first twoSpider-Manfilms.[44]Marvel was making more from half the consumer product licensing fees while making relatively little from the films, but it was enough for Marvel to regain its financial footing.[41]In October 2002, Marvel Studios announced deals for the Sub-Mariner andPrimewithUniversal Pictures.[45]
In contrast to the original storylines ofDC Comics'SupermanandBatmanfilms, Marvel films often emphasized more fidelity to its comics, applying set pieces, scenes, plots, and dialogue drawn from them.[36]In 2003,David Maiselapproached Arad about earning Marvel more for its films. Maisel, Arad, and Perlmutter met, leading to Maisel being hired as president andchief operating officer(COO). The studio's office was small onSanta Monica Boulevard, with around a dozen staff members.Kevin Feige, who later became the president of Marvel Studios, was then a junior executive generating script notes for the licensed studios.[41]In January 2003, Marvel, theSci-Fi Channel, andReveille Productionsagreed to develop two pilot films based onBrother VoodooandStrikeforce: Morituri.[46]In December 2003,Lionsgatepurchased Artisan Entertainment and they decided to let all of the character rights Artisan held, except Punisher, revert to Marvel.[47][48]: 279Marvel Studios partnered with Lionsgate in 2004 to produce eight animated films, calledMarvel Animated Features, for the direct-to-DVD market withLionsgate Home Entertainmenthandling distribution.[49][50]The line was a proof of concept for Maisel's later plan.[41]Eric Rollman was hired by Marvel as Executive Vice President of home entertainment & TV production for Marvel Studios to oversee the deal with Lionsgate.[51]
Maisel was hired in 2004 as president and chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self-finance its films.[40][41]Marvel entered into anon-recourse debtstructure withMerrill Lynchthat was collateralized by certainfilm rightsto a total of ten characters from Marvel's vast vault. Marvel received $525 million to make a maximum of ten films based on the company's properties over eight years, according to the parameters of the original deal. Those characters wereAnt-Man,the Avengers, Black Panther, Captain America,Cloak & Dagger,Doctor Strange,Hawkeye,Nick Fury,Power Pack, andShang-Chi.[52]Ambacinsured the films would succeed or they would pay the interest payment on the debt and get the film rights as collateral.[44]Initially, Marvel Studios was in talks with Universal Pictures as a possible distributor, because Universal owned the film rights to both the Hulk and Namor during that time.[53][54]Negotiations dragged on, so the studio began talks withParamount Pictures. In the second quarter of 2005, Merrill attempted to back out of full financing of each film, demanding that Marvel finance one-third of the budget. Marvel took back rights in five foreign territories from Paramount for pre-sell to meet that demand.[41]In September 2005, Marvel announced the Merrill Lynch financing deal with Paramount was on as marketer and distributor. Marvel Studios' parent company Marvel Enterprises, Inc. then changed its name toMarvel Entertainment, Inc.to reflect the change to self-production.[52]
The studio moved to a new location over aMercedes-Benzdealership inBeverly Hills, California. Maisel was also named vice-chairman of the studio, but reported to Marvel Entertainment CEOIsaac Perlmutter.[41]In November 2005,Michael Helfantjoined the studio as president and chief operating officer.[55]Also that month, Marvel gained the film rights to Iron Man fromNew Line Cinema. Marvel then revealed that it had regained the film rights to the Hulk from Universal in February 2006,[56]in exchange for letting Universal own the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulk(2008) and the right of first refusal to pick up the distribution rights to any future Marvel Studios-producedHulkfilms.[57]In April 2006, Thor was announced to be a Marvel Studios production,[58]while Lions Gate Entertainment subsequently dropped theBlack Widowfilm it had in development since 2004 and returned the rights to Marvel.[59]
Maisel and Arad fought over the rate of film releases and the strength of characters in the film lineup. Perlmutter supported Maisel and thus, in May 2006, Arad quit as studio chair and CEO.[40][60]In March 2007, Helfant was "forced out" of the studio while Maisel was named chairman and Kevin Feige was named president of production to replace Helfant asIron Man(2008) began filming.[61][62]In January 2008,Marvel Animationwas incorporated to direct Marvel's efforts in animation and home entertainment markets including then animation efforts with Lionsgate andNickelodeon.[51]In March, the company agreed to a five-picture basic cable distribution withFXfor the filmsIron ManandThe Incredible Hulk, with additional films to be named later.[63]Following the successful opening weekend ofIron Manin May 2008, Maisel had his contract extended through 2010 and Feige was promoted to president of Marvel Studios.[64]In November, Marvel Studios signed a lease withRaleigh Studiosto host its headquarters and production offices and film the next four films on the studios' slate, includingIron Man 2(2010) andThor(2011), at itsManhattan Beach Studios Media Campusfacilities.[65]By September 2008, Paramount added five additional Marvel films' foreign distribution to its domestic film distribution contract.[66]
In 2009, producer Stephen Broussard was tasked with forming a writers program for the studio. The writers were hired for a year to be on call to do emergency script polishes for films in production,[48]: 165as well as develop scripts based on some lesser-known properties, such as Black Panther,Cable, Iron Fist,Nighthawk, andVision.[48]: 165[67]Writers included: Edward Ricourt, who was encouraged to write a script forLuke Cageas it was of high interest to the studio;[48]: 165Nicole Perlman, who chose to write a script based on the2008 Guardians of the Galaxy team;[48]: 167Christopher Yost, who was asked to pitch a Black Panther film for his interview,[48]: 166and took interest in writing scripts about theThunderbolts,Power Pack, andBrian Braddock / Captain Britain;[48]: 173Joe Robert Cole, who initially pitched aWar Machinefilm before joining the writers program where he created scripts for theInhumans;[48]: 169andEric Pearson, who was asked to pitch aCloak and Daggerfilm and also worked to rewrite a Luke Cage script.[48]: 171After Broussard moved on to the production ofCaptain America: The First Avenger(2011), Marvel Studios hired Nate Moore to oversee the writers program, who at times was assisted by the also newly hired executive Jodi Hildebrand. Particular properties Feige was interested in having screenplays for were Black Panther, Iron Fist, and Blade.[48]: 167–168, 171The program was shut down in 2014 before being revived in 2016.[48]: 172In early 2009,Sonyreturned all Spider-Man television rights (including live-action) in exchange for an adjustment to the film rights.[68]
On August 31, 2009,the Walt Disney Companyannounced that it had reached a deal to acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion.[69]The deal was completed on December 31, with Marvel Entertainment becoming a subsidiary of Disney.[70]Both Marvel and Disney stated that the merger would not affect any pre-existing deals with other film studios for the time being,[71]although Disney said they would distribute future Marvel projects withits own studioonce the deals expired.[72]Maisel stepped down from the studio following the sale to Disney.[73]In April 2010, rumors circulated that Marvel was looking to create $20–40 million films based on properties such as Doctor Strange,Ka-Zar, Luke Cage,Dazzler, and Power Pack.[74]Feige responded by saying, while budgets are generally never discussed early in development, Marvel was considering films for all characters mentioned in the rumor, except Dazzler, whose rights were at Fox.[75]
In June 2010, Marvel Entertainment set up a television division within Marvel Studios calledMarvel Televisionto be headed up byJeph Loebas Executive Vice President,[76]under which Marvel Animation would be operated.[77]In October,Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesacquired the distribution rights forThe Avengers(2012) andIron Man 3(2013) from Paramount Pictures[78]with Paramount's logo and credit remaining on those films.[79]In August 2011, at Disney's behest, the studio dismissed most of its marketing department, including EVP of Worldwide Marketing Dana Precious, VP of Worldwide Marketing Jeffrey Stewart, and Manager of Worldwide Marketing Jodi Miller. Disney subsequently began marketing Marvel's films.[80]In April 2012, the Walt Disney Company China, Marvel Studios, andDMG Entertainmentannounced an agreement to co-produceIron Man 3in China. DMG partly financed, produced in China with Marvel, and handled co-production matters. DMG also distributed the film in China in tandem with Disney.[81]
In April 2013, Marvel Studios moved its executive production offices from the Manhattan Beach Studios Media Campus tothe Walt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California.[82]In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights toIron Man,Iron Man 2,Thor, andCaptain America: The First Avengerfrom Paramount.[83][84]In September 2014,TNTacquired the cable rights forAvengers: Age of Ultron(2015),Captain America: Civil War(2016), and three other films, to air on the network two years after their theatrical releases. The films had previously aired on FX since 2008.[85]
In August 2015, Marvel Studios was placed intoWalt Disney Studios, with Feige reporting directly to Walt Disney Studios chairmanAlan F. Horninstead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter. Marvel Television and subsidiary Marvel Animation were left under Marvel Entertainment and Perlmutter's control.[86][87]As of April 2017, Marvel Studios was housed on the second floor of theFrank G. Wells Buildingat the Disney studio lot.[1][2]Fast Companyranked Marvel Studios number eleven on its 2018 World's Most Innovative Companies list.[88]
In September 2018, it was reported that Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for the streaming serviceDisney+, to be centered on "second tier" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films. Characters being considered for series includedLokiandScarlet Witch, with the actors who portrayed the characters in the films expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes, with a "hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a "hands-on role" in each series' development.[89]In October 2019, Feige was given the title ofChief Creative Officer, Marvel, and would oversee the creative direction of Marvel Television andMarvel Family Entertainment, with both being returned to being under the Marvel Studios banner.[90]Two months later, Marvel Television was folded into Marvel Studios, with Marvel Studios overseeing development of all the Marvel Television series in production at the time of its closing.Karim Zreik, Marvel Television's senior vice president of current programming and production, would join Marvel Studios alongside his team to oversee the production of the Marvel Television series inherited by Marvel Studios.[91]
In May 2022, Marvel Studios signed a 20-year licensing deal with Stan Lee Universe to license the name and likeness of Lee for use in future films, television series, Disney theme parks and cruises, various "experiences", and merchandising. A digitally recreated Lee was not expected to make cameo appearances in future projects, rather the deal allows Marvel to use Lee's name, voice, likeness, signature, and existing images and archival material.[92]In June 2023, the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulkreverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.[93]
By October 2023, Marvel Studios was planning to hire dedicated executives to focus on its television efforts, as part of a larger plan tochange its approach to its television series.[94]Production and development executive Richie Palmer was serving as a television executive by January 2024.[95]In May 2024, Marvel Studios revealed that its live-action Disney+ series would be released under a new "Marvel Television" banner, separate from the previous company of the same name, starting withAgatha All Alonglater in 2024.[96]
In June 2021, ahead of Marvel Studios' first solely produced animated seriesWhat If...?, executive vice president of film productionVictoria Alonsonoted that the studio was creating an "animation branch and mini-studio" to focus on more animated content beyondWhat If...?.[97]Marvel Studios outsources the animation for its animated series to third-party animation studios, though executive Brad Winderbaum indicated Marvel would work with fellow Disney studiosPixarandWalt Disney Animation Studios"under the right circumstances".[98]In September 2021, Alonso was promoted to President of Physical, Post Production, VFX and Animation.[99]In November 2021, Marvel Studios announced the animated seriesX-Men '97(2024–present), arevivalofX-Men: The Animated Series(1992–1997) that is set in that series' continuity.[100]The animation branch of Marvel Studios and "mini-studio" is known as Marvel Studios Animation.[7]By April 2022, Marvel Studios had taken over production of the preschool animated seriesSpidey and His Amazing Friends, starting from its second season; the first season was produced under the Marvel Entertainment banner.[101]The "Marvel Animation" name and banner was used for the division's projects by May 2024.[96]
In March 2023, Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios by a group includingDisney Entertainmentco-chairmanAlan Bergmanand Disney's human resources and legal departments for serving as a producer on theAmazon StudiosfilmArgentina, 1985(2022); this was a breach of a 2018 agreement between Alonso and Disney which stated employees would not work for a competing studio.[102][103]Alonso reportedly did not seek permission to work on the film, and was asked by Disney to stop working on the film, as well as not to promote or publicize it, with the situation "deemed serious enough" that Disney requested a new agreement be signed. Despite this, Alonso continued to promote the film following its September 2022 premiere, and was consistently reminded of her agreement and breach of contract, ultimately leading to her firing.[102]Alonso's lawyers refuted this claim, stating Disney was aware of, and agreed to, Alonso's work onArgentina, 1985, and that she was instead "silenced[... and] was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible";[104]this incident was reported to be a disagreement with a Disney executive over the censoring ofgay pride elementsinAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania(2023) to release the film in Kuwait and comply withits restrictive anti-LGBTQ laws.[105][106]A Disney spokesperson reiterated the notion that she was fired due to "an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy" among other "key factors".[104]Disney and Alonso reached a multimillion-dollar compensation settlement in April.[107]
Also at the time of Alonso's firing, criticism from VFX workers was noted,[103]who had raised complaints of Marvel's "demanding post-production schedules". Alonso was described by some as a "kingmaker",[103][7]and "challenging to work with",[105]with Chris Lee atVulturereporting that Alonso was "singularly responsible for Marvel's toxic work environment" with VFX workers.[108][7]Alonso reportedly took days off to produceArgentina, 1985instead of her post-production commitments for the various MCU projects, which in turn resulted in the need to delay several projects in 2022 and 2023.[105]However, Alonso was also described as the "epitome of professional" and supportive on set, with Joanna Robinson ofThe Ringerdescribing the reports as a "gross mischaracterization" and the opposite of Alonso's work.[103][109]Following Alonso's firing, visual effects vendors for the various MCU projects were working with producer Jen Underdahl, the vice president of visual effects and stereo.[102][110]
In August 2023, a group of 52 on-set VFX workers at Marvel Studios filed a petition with theNational Labor Relations Boardfor an election to join theInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees(IATSE) labor union theVFX Union. This was the first time any workers in the visual effects industry had petitioned for union recognition. Lee believed if this group of workers were able to secure union recognition, it "would stand as proof of concept for the overall viability of an industry-wide unionization push", particularly at the post-production effect houses.[111]All of the workers who participated in the election vote that concluded in early September voted unanimously to form a union with IATSE, with the union then set to enter into collective bargaining negotiations with Marvel, beginning at an unspecified date.[112]
Marvel had licensed out the film rights to many of its characters to other studios in the 1990s, starting with theX-Men,[24]theFantastic Four,Spider-Man, andDaredevil, which were followed byCaptain America,Iron Man,Thor, theHulk,Ant-Manand theWasp,Black Widow,Luke Cage, thePunisher,Blade,Ghost Rider,Man-Thing,Black Panther,Deadpool, andPrime, among others.[45][113]
In February 2015, Marvel Studios andSony Pictures Entertainmentannounced that Spider-Man would appear in the MCU, with the character appearing inCaptain America: Civil War(2016) and Sony releasingSpider-Man: Homecoming, produced by Feige andAmy Pascal, in July 2017. As part of the deal, Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films.[114]In June 2015, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal did not allow Spider-Man to appear in any of theMCU television series, as it was "very specific... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed."[115]In September 2019, it was announced that Disney and Sony had reached a new agreement allowing for Spider-Man to appear in athird standalone film(produced by Marvel Studios and Feige) and a future Marvel Studios film.[116]Disney was reported to be co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of the film's profits in the new agreement, while retaining the merchandising rights to the character.[116][117]In November 2021, Pascal announced plans for a fourthSpider-Manfilm set in the MCU, in addition to long-term plans for a new trilogy of films with Marvel Studios, with said film entering active development the following month.[118][119]Sony's agreement specifies that production has to start on a film within three years and nine months of the previous one, and release within five years and nine months, otherwise the rights revert to Marvel.[48]: 295Sony has access to 856 characters within its agreement,[48]: 297includingKingpin, who is able to be used by both Sony and Marvel Studios.[120]
In March 2023,Citigroupfinancial analystJason Bazinet felt Disney may try to include the distribution rights to the Hulk and Namor in any potential sale of the streaming serviceHulutoComcast, the owner ofUniversal PicturesthroughNBCUniversal.[121]In June 2023, the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulkreverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.[93]
The following table details the rights that have returned to Marvel along with the studios from which they returned and the year in which they returned.
The "Marvel Studios Parliament", otherwise known as "The Parliament", is the creative decision-making committee at Marvel Studios and a "brain trust" of long-time executives who help to elevate each other's projects where possible.[150][151][152][94]The following executives are members of the Parliament:[153]
A number of other executives serve as lead producers on films and television series, working on each project from their inception through their release as managers alongside other executives,[152][162]as part of the Production and Development group. Some of these executives include:[153]
The Visual Development group is an in-house group of artists who work on a film from its start to provide a consistent look for the studio.[157][additional citation(s) needed]
In addition to Meinerding, the group includesAndy Park, Director of Visual Development and Production Illustrator[172][173]
Additionally,Sarah Halley Finnhas served as a frequent casting director for several MCU films and television series.[179]
Starting with the release ofSpider-Manin 2002, Marvel Studios introduced its "flipbook"production logo, created by Imaginary Forces.[191]This logo was accompanied by music from the film's score, sound effects or a song, to lead into the beginning of the film. This was the logo seen in front of all of the studio's films until 2013, when the logo was updated with the release ofThor: The Dark World, again created by Imaginary Forces. Feige stated that since Marvel was now its own entity within the Walt Disney Company, it "felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features" instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel's studio or distribution partners' logos. Feige added that they "didn't want to re-invent the wheel [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel."[192]Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002. They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, and ultimately chose 120 that were "universal and not specific to one character" and created a narrative "where each image spoke to the one before it and after."[191]The new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within theMarvel Cinematic UniversethroughCaptain America: Civil War. With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed byBrian Tyler, who wrote the scores toIron Man 3,Thor: The Dark World, andAvengers: Age of Ultron.[192]It was featured on the filmsThor: The Dark World,Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014), andGuardians of the Galaxy(2014).
In July 2016, another new logo and opening were introduced, featuring an updated fanfare, composed this time byMichael Giacchino, who first worked with Marvel Studios on the score toDoctor Strange(2016). The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.[193]It was first seen in front ofDoctor Strange.[194]The updated logo was created byPerception, which was first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update its logo. Feige specifically requested Perception "to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image, showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo." The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed "How to Build a Universe", which "was designed to pay tribute to [the filmmaking] process by touching on" how a film's origins are inspired by the comics, which then results in a script, followed by concept art, resulting in the final film. Perception looked to the initial "flipbook" logo for inspiration, and paid tribute to it in the new opening, as it opens identically to the flipbook logo. Next, the opening includes "various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays", with Perception picking "both iconic fan-favorites, as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe." To add in the concept art images, Perception looked "through a massive archive of concept art and "The Art Of..." books, to select the most iconic images for each beloved character. Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves, the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch. The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them." Finally, over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had been released at that time were included, with Perception arranging them in a way they called the "vault" "where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the "Marvel" logotype."[195]
A modified version of Perception's logo was introduced at the 2017D23Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU.[196]The logo debuted withAvengers: Infinity Waron April 26, 2018, and was used again inAnt-Man and the Wasp(2018). With the release ofCaptain Marvel, the current Perception logo was altered at Marvel Studios' behest in honor ofStan Lee; Lee died on November 12, 2018, just a few months before the release of the film.[197]The logo was altered, replacing the characters with Stan Lee's MCU cameos and other public appearances related to the MCU, accompanied by a black screen reading "Thank You Stan".[198]Similarly, the logo was retroactively modified for theDisney+version ofBlack Panther(2018) in honor ofChadwick Boseman, who died on August 28, 2020. The logo was altered, replacing the characters with images and footage ofT'Challaand Boseman. The logo premiered on November 29, 2020, which would have been Boseman's 44th birthday.[199][200]Additional modifications include having the characters who disappeared in the Blip removed forAvengers: Endgame; an additional Boseman tribute one forBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever(2022); and an all-Guardians of the Galaxy opening forGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3(2023). A shortened sequence opening was used for the Disney+ seriesSecret Invasion(2023).[201]"What If... Strange Supreme Intervened?" (2023), theWhat If...?season twofinale, replaced the live-action footage of the logo with animated images fromWhat If...?.[202]Captain America: Brave New World(2025) was the first Marvel Studios film to not feature the studio's logo animation sequence.[203]
Television specialsfrom Marvel Studios, which are marketed as "Marvel Studios Special Presentation", feature a special multicolored intro with bongo drum music, reminiscent of theCBS Special Presentationtheme featured before animated holiday specials of the 1980s and 1990s.[204][205]The intro was also designed by Perception,[206]with Giacchino (who directed and composed for the specialWerewolf by Night) once again creating the music.[205]Jamie Lovett atComicBook.comcalled the Marvel Studios Special Presentation intro "more colorful" and its fanfare "more playful" than the normal Marvel Studios intro.[207]
Marvel Knights was a production arm of Marvel Studios intended to produce some of Marvel's darker and lesser-known titles. The name originated from the "Marvel Knights" imprint ofMarvel Comics. The first film produced under the Marvel Knights banner wasPunisher: War Zone(2008), which served as arebootof thePunisherfranchise. This was followed byGhost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance(2011), which was the second and final title to be released under the Marvel Knights banner.[210]

Throughout her filmography, Zhao carries relatively the same styles and techniques.Frances McDormandtoldRolling Stoneabout Zhao's process, saying "she's basically like a journalist...she gets to know your story, and she creates a character from that" and that she "draws a razor-sharp line between sentiment and sentimentality".[71]AFilmmakerarticle quoted Zhao as saying "I want to find new ways to place the camera to evoke more of a feeling. My goal is to put the camera inside of [the character]".[28]An example of her process can be found inEternalswhen she saw the connection between actorsLauren RidloffandBarry Keoghanwho playMakkariandDruigin the film.[72]The article wrote that Zhao saw them interacting and thought "Okay, we've got to write more moments", stating "It's the same as I did withNomadlandandThe Rider. I would see how they interact and I would write that into the film".[72]She believes that everyone wants to feel a connection, that filmmakers tell their stories because they don't want to feel alone, which is why she focuses on the themes of authenticity and places an emphasis on real stories.[73]In an interview with Brut America, Zhao touched upon her feeling on the importance of directing from the perspective of the female gaze. "For me, there is a yin and yang in all of us, feminine and masculine strength and I think often in our society in our industry, the masculine strength is being celebrated, and that's a painful way to exist both for women and men."[74]Zhao, known primarily for her feature films which depict the lives and struggles of real people from diverse backgrounds, such asThe Rider,Songs My Brother Taught Me, andNomadland, is now taking on projects that depict various characters from broader universes, for instance the Marvel film, Eternals. On directing this myriad of characters from the female perspective she says "I always try to find a way to give them a chance to be in touch with their feminine side" "We must also allow our male characters to access their softer side, I think that's the true female gaze."
Zhao citesWong Kar-wai's romanceHappy Togetheras the "film that made me want to make films". She was also influenced bySpike Lee, who was her film professor while she studied at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.[75][76]She citedAng Leeas an influence as well, saying, "Ang Lee's career has been very inspiring to me — how he's able to bring where he comes from to all the films that he makes". She also has mentionedWerner HerzogandTerrence Malickas key influences.[77][78]
Zhao stated her early introductions to American cinema wereThe Terminator,GhostandSister Act.[75]
After Zhao became the second woman to win aGolden Globe Award for Best Director(forNomadland), many Chinese viewers, as well as state media in China, celebrated her win and "sought to claim Zhao's glory for China".[79]Shortly afterward, however, some Chinese internet users began to question Zhao's citizenship and debated "whether it is appropriate to claim Zhao's victory as China's", withVarietycalling the claim "a common move by state-backed outlets to drum upnationalism".[79]Much of the controversy hinged around two sets of remarks: a 2013Filmmakermagazine interview in which Zhao described China as "a place where there are lies everywhere",[80]and a late 2020 interview in which Zhao was mis-quoted as saying "The US is now my country" (she had actually said "The US is not my country," and the error was corrected about two months later).[81][79][82]References to Zhao in Chinese media were censored following her Oscar win.[83][84]
Zhao resides inOjai, Californiawith her partner and cinematographerJoshua James Richards.[9][85]Richards and Zhao met while Zhao was researching for her first feature filmSongs My Brother Taught Meand Richards was still a film student at New York University. He has been her cinematographer for her next two films and served as camera operator onEternals.[86]In anEllearticle, Richards stated that Zhao was "gnarly and extreme", someone he wanted to find at film school.[18]

Lauren Teruel was born on April 6, 1978, inChicago, Illinois, in the United States.[1]She was born deaf to hearing parents, a Mexican-American father and an African-American mother.[2]Her father Hugo was a counselor atUniversity of Illinois at Chicago.[3]He was also a musician, and Ridloff's mother was an artist. Ridloff grew up in the Chicago neighborhood ofHyde Park.[4]Her parents thought their infant had a developmental delay, but by the time she was two years old, they learned that she was deaf. They learned sign language with her and enrolled her in Catholic school with hearing children. She performed well in school. When she was 13 years old, she stopped using her voice so people would stop judging her intelligence based on her vocal intelligibility. Following Catholic school, she attended theModel Secondary School for the DeafinWashington, D.C., where she was among deaf and hard-of-hearing peers. She began exploring the arts, starting with ceramics and becoming involved with drama. In a school production ofThe Wiz, she playedDorothy. She was also on the cheerleading team and became one of the first deaf American cheerleaders to compete internationally.[2]
Ridloff chose to attendCalifornia State University, Northridge, a university with a large deaf and hard-of-hearing student population, because of itsNational Center on Deafness.[3]She majored in English with an emphasis in creative writing, completing her degree in 2001.[5]While in college, she joined a local deaf performing group and took up hip-hop dancing.[3]After she graduated in May 2000, she began working at the NCOD, where she was involved in a program to improve post-secondary school education for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. Later in the year, she decided to compete in theNational Association of the Deaf's Miss Deaf America competition, having been inspired by the competition she saw two years prior.

He asked her to substitute at aread-throughearly on, and based on her performance, he offered her the role as Sarah Norman. The cast had an initial run at the Berkshire Theatre Group inStockbridge, Massachusetts. One of the most challenging aspects of her role was using her voice, which she had not used since she was 13 years old.The New York Timeswrote, "Ms. Ridloff compares the experience of using her voice during the play to a crotch shot, saying that at first she felt exposed, and vulnerable, and ugly." After a year with the role and with a vocal coach, she found greater ease. She explained, "It feels empowering to me—like finally I own every part of myself, [but] I don't see myself ever using my voice on a conversational level—that's just not who I am."  The revival premiered on Broadway in April 2018, andThe New York Timeswrote, "Critics were underwhelmed by the production, but mesmerized by Ms. Ridloff."

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
