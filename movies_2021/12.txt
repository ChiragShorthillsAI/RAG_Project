Tick, Tick... Boom!(also stylized astick, tick... BOOM!) is a 2021 Americanbiographicalmusical filmdirected byLin-Manuel Mirandain his feature directorial debut. Written bySteven Levenson, who also serves as an executive producer, it is based on thestage musical of the same namebyJonathan Larson, a semi-autobiographical story about Larson writing a musical to enter into the theater industry. The film starsAndrew Garfieldas Larson, alongsideRobin de Jesús,Alexandra Shipp,Joshua Henry,Judith Light, andVanessa Hudgens.
Tick, Tick... Boom!had its world premiere at theAFI Feston November 10, 2021, and began alimited theatrical releasetwo days later, before streaming onNetflixon November 19. The film received positive reviews for Garfield's performance, the editing, and Miranda's direction. It was named one of the best films of 2021 by theAmerican Film Institute, and was nominated forBest Motion Picture - Musical or Comedyat the79th Golden Globe Awards, andBest Pictureat the27th Critics' Choice Awards. For his performance, Garfield earned numerous awards, including theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, and a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Actor.
In 1992,Jonathan Larsonperforms his rock monologueTick, Tick... Boom!atNew York Theatre Workshop, accompanied by friendsRogerand Karessa. He describes a constant ticking noise he hears in his head and begins to tell the story of the events leading to his 30th birthday. An unseen narrator explains the film is the true story of Larson, "except for the parts Jonathan made up."
In early 1990, Jonathan juggles work at theMoondance DinerinSoHowhile preparing for a workshop of his musical and passion projectSuperbia. He feels pressure to be successful before he turns 30: with his birthday just over a week away, he sees the workshop as his last chance ("30/90").
Jonathan has a party at home with friends, including his former roommate Michael, his girlfriend Susan, and fellow waiters Freddy and Carolyn ("Boho Days"). Susan tells Jonathan about a teaching job atJacob's Pillowand asks him to come. Michael, who previously left theater for a lucrative advertising career ("No More"), sees Susan's offer as an opportunity for Jonathan to consider a serious future and invites Jonathan to join an advertising focus group at his company.
Jonathan's producerIraasks him to write a new song forSuperbiabecause the story needs it. This troubles him, as his idolStephen Sondheimtold him the same at a composing workshop some years ago ("LCD Readout"), but he can't come up with anything, and he only has a week.
Jonathan's anxieties over the workshop and Michael and Susan's offers ("Johnny Can't Decide") are compounded when he learns from Carolyn that Freddy, who isHIV-positive, has been hospitalized ("Sunday"). He chooses to prioritize the workshop ("Sextet Montage"), which leads to trouble in his personal life: Susan, frustrated by Jonathan's indecisiveness and obsession with his career, breaks up with him ("Therapy"), and he angers Michael when he deliberately sabotages the focus group. Michael accuses him of wasting the privilege to have a life with the person he loves—something Michael cannot do as a gay man in theAIDS crisis—for the sake of a financially unstable theater career.
After receiving an encouraging call from his agent, Rosa, Jonathan tries to write the new song the night before the workshop, but his power gets cut off. He heads to a swimming pool to vent his frustrations before finally coming up with the new song ("Swimming"). At the workshop are friends, family, and industry professionals, including Sondheim ("Come to Your Senses"). Jonathan receives praise but no offers to produceSuperbia. Rosa gives him a reality check that it will likely never be produced due to the content and production needs, so he must try again with a completely different show and hope something will stick, urging him to write about what he knows.
Discouraged, Jonathan begs Michael for a corporate job, but Michael, having changed his mind after seeing the workshop, urges Jonathan to continue in musical theater, revealing he is HIV-positive ("Real Life"). Realizing that his career obsession has cost him Susan and harmed his friendship with Michael, Jonathan wanders through New York before finding himself at theDelacorte Theater. He finds a piano and reflects on his friendship with Michael and the sacrifices he must make for his career ("Why"). He and Michael reconcile.
On the morning of Jonathan's 30th birthday, Sondheim calls, congratulating him and wanting to talk more aboutSuperbia,lifting his spirits. Holding his birthday party at the Moondance Diner, he is relieved to hear Freddy will be discharged from the hospital. Susan gifts him a blank sheet music book to help in his career, and they part on amicable terms. She narrates that his next project wasTick, Tick... Boom!before he returned to working on a previous project, which becameRent.
Susan's narration reveals that Larson died of a suddenaortic dissectionthe night beforeRentbegan previews Off-Broadway. She laments that thoughRentbrought the success Larson desired, he never got to experience it for himself, nor did he get to say everything he wanted to in his writing. In 1992, Jonathan performs the final song fromTick, Tick... Boom!as he optimistically looks to the future ("Louder Than Words").
New York Theatre Workshop artistic directorJames C. NicolaandRoger Bartmake credited appearances as "featured diners" at the Moondance Diner in the background of the opening scene. Both knew and worked with the real Larson: Nicola was in charge of New York Theatre Workshop at the time of the film's events and helped programRent, while Bart was a close friend and frequent collaborator who contributed backing vocals to the original rock-monologue version ofTick, Tick... Boom!. The character "Roger", played by Joshua Henry, is loosely inspired by Bart.[8][5]
The song "Sunday" features cameos fromAndré De Shields,Bebe Neuwirth,Beth Malone,Brian Stokes Mitchell,Chita Rivera,Chuck Cooper,Howard McGillin,Joel Grey,Renée Elise Goldsberry,Phillipa Soo,Phylicia Rashad, andBernadette Peters. It also prominently featuresAdam Pascal,Daphne Rubin-Vega, andWilson Jermaine Herediaas homeless bums: all three were original cast members of the Broadway production ofRent, which was also written by Larson.[8]Rubin-Vega's costume includes a pair of shoes she wore onstage in the original production ofRent, and a black hoodie which once belonged to Larson.[9]Director Miranda also cameos as a cook at the Moondance Diner during the scene.[8]
The musical theater workshop scene includes cameos by various established theater composers and lyricists as "aspiring composers and lyricists", includingAlex Lacamoire,Amanda Green,Chad Beguelin, Jaime Lozano,Dave Malloy,Eisa Davis,Georgia Stitt,Grace McLean,Helen Park,Jason Robert Brown,Jeanine Tesori,Joe Iconis,Marc Shaiman,Matthew Sklar,Nick Blaemire,Quiara Alegría Hudes,Shaina Taub,Stephen Schwartz,Stephen Trask, screenwriter Steven Levenson, andTom Kitt.[8]Blaemire previously portrayed Jonathan Larson in the 2016 Off-Broadway revival ofTick, Tick... Boom!.[8]Green, Beguelin, Malloy, Iconis, Sklar, and Taub are all previous recipients of the Jonathan Larson Grant for aspiring composers.[10]
Several members of Miranda's hip-hop improv groupFreestyle Love Supremehave roles throughout the film: besides Aneesa Folds andUtkarsh Ambudkar,Shockwaveand Andrew "JellyDonut" Bancroft appear in "No More", andChristopher Jacksonappears as a patron at the New York Theatre Workshop performance ofTick, Tick... Boom!.[11][8]Miranda's fatherLuis A. Miranda Jr.cameos as a building concierge in "No More."[8]Additionally,Janet Dacal, Kenita Miller, Eddy Lee and Jared Loftin appear as performers in theSuperbiaworkshop. Although Whitford portrays Sondheim onscreen, Sondheim voices himself when he leaves a message on Jonathan's voicemail, as he does in the original musical.[8]Miranda's wife Vanessa Nadal voices "Deborah", Susan's friend who calls Jonathan towards the beginning of the film about equipment for Susan's dance show.[12]Anna Louizos, who designed the set for the 2001 Off-Broadway run ofTick, Tick... Boom!, and her wife Robyn Goodman, who co-produced the run and was friends with the real Larson, play Michelle and Gay respectively, Jonathan's neighbors who attend his party.[12][7]Among the audience members in the final scene are Scott Schwartz, the director of the 2001 Off-Broadway production ofTick, Tick... Boom!, and Julie Larson, Larson's sister.[8]
Anthony Rapp,Idina Menzel, andFredi Walker-Browneappear via archive footage of the original production ofRent. Archival footage of the Japanese and Cuban productions are also used, the latter sourced from the 2019 documentaryRevolution Rent.
A prop playbill for the workshop mentionsJace Alexander,Michael Lindsay, andMarin Mazzieas members of the cast.[13]All three knew and worked with the real Larson, Alexander through theNaked Angels, Lindsay from their days atAdelphi Universityand at severalSuperbiaworkshops, and Mazzie as aSuperbiacast member and collaborator on her and Larson's cabaret act "J. Glitz."[14]It is not clear, however, if any of the performers in the onscreen workshop are actually meant to be these actors. These mentions could be considered memorials; by the time this movie was filmed, Mazzie and Lindsay had died, and though Alexander was still alive, he had not had a professional career since pleading guilty to charges relating to child pornography.[15]
Tick, Tick... Boom!began as a rock monologue titled30/90and laterBoho Daysthat Larson wrote between 1989 and 1990 and first performed atSecond Stage Theaterfrom September 6–9, 1990.[16]Boho Dayswas a semi-autobiographical work following a musical theater composer named "Jon" who tries to figure out his next project after a failed workshop of his musicalSuperbia, based on Larson's own experience in trying to getSuperbiastaged.[4]Larson later rewrote it intoTick, Tick... Boom!which he performed at theVillage Gatein November 1991, and later at New York Theatre Workshop's "O Solo Mio" Festivals in 1992 and 1993 before turning his attention toRent.[17]The piece changed significantly in this period, as it was written in response to events in Larson's life: the character of Susan notably changed with each iteration based on Larson's relationship with his real girlfriend Janet Charleston. Larson's friend and producer Victoria Leacock Hoffman recalled the work became increasingly pessimistic with Larson's increasing frustrations with his career.[4]
Following Larson's death, Leacock Hoffman and Robyn Goodman recruited playwrightDavid Auburnto transform the solo piece into a three person musical. Auburn reworked both the story and structure ofTick, Tick... Boom!while still attempting to preserve Larson's writing. Besides the addition of dialogue, one of Auburn's most significant contributions was theSuperbiaworkshop plot (in all of Larson's versions of the script, theSuperbiaworkshop took place before the events of the show). This change, besides giving a sense of plot progression, also provided the opportunity to include the previously-unreleased song "Come to Your Senses", which was originally written forSuperbia.[4]J. Collis, the author of the oral historyBoho Days: The Wider Works of Jonathan Larson, describes Auburn's changes as giving the musical a better dramaturgical structure, changing the show from a story about the artist's struggle—something which Larson's mentor Sondheim criticized the original rock monologue for being, feeling such a story was overdone—to one about making adult choices and dealing with the consequences.[4]This production ran Off-Broadway at theJane Street Theatrein 2001 and is arguably the version most familiar to audiences.[4]
Producer Julie Oh was first inspired to bringTick, Tick... Boom!to the screen after seeingLin-Manuel Mirandastar in the 2014 production atNew York City Centeras part ofEncores!. After viewing aNew York Timesarticle by Miranda about howTick, Tick... Boom!inspired him when he saw the Off-Broadway production in 2001, she felt it was important for the story to become a film. Oh felt the only director who would be able to do so was Miranda, who immediately expressed interest after she reached out to him. Oh and Miranda began formal discussions about the film while he was in London filmingMary Poppins Returns.[18]
The film was announced in July 2018 with the news that Miranda would make his directorial debut with the musical adaptation, withImagine Entertainmentand Julie Oh producing andDear Evan Hansen'sSteven Levensonpenning the script.[19]Miranda, Levenson, and Oh treated the process like creating a musical, including holding a secret workshop at theUnited Palacein Washington Heights on July 16, 2018. It was during this stage thatAndrew Garfieldjoined the process, having finished his run in the Broadway revival ofAngels in Americathe day before. The team set a production start date of March 2020, in order to give Miranda and Levenson time to conduct research, and for Garfield to take formal vocal and piano training.[18][20]
By June 2019,Netflixhad acquired the film, withAndrew Garfieldthe top choice to star.[21]In January 2020, it was also announced that choreographerRyan Heffingtonwould be working on the film.[22]
In order to adapt the musical for film, Miranda and Levenson conducted a significant amount of their own research. This included interviews with friends, family and colleagues such as Charleston,Roger Bart, Matt O'Grady (whom Michael is based on), and Ira Weitzman. Both Weitzman and Bart became characters in the film, played byJonathan Marc ShermanandJoshua Henryrespectively, as a direct result of these conversations.[5][23]Larson's sister Julie, who was a producer on the film, discouraged Miranda and Levenson from sanitizing Larson's image, telling them to "get all the warts. Get all of that good stuff." Bart recalled that Larson could be "a pain in the ass" when his work was not being received the way he wanted, but he was generous to his collaborators once in the rehearsal room. This insight heavily influenced Larson's portrayal in the finished film.[24]
Miranda and Levenson also accessed the Jonathan Larson Papers at theLibrary of Congress, in which the original scripts and demo tapes forSuperbia,30/90,Boho Days, andTick, Tick... Boom!exist.[25]Scenes from these scripts were used to create new scenes for the film: for example, a section where Larson recalled receiving feedback from a man named "Robert Rimer" at a musical theater workshop was adapted for the film, with "Rimer" replaced by the man's real name, Stephen Sondheim. In one early draft, Larson wrote that Susan's green dress was a commission made by a fashion designer/fellow waiter at the Moondance Diner named Carolyn: this led to the creation of the character Carolyn, played by Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, for the film.[26]
The screenplay features a framing device loosely inspired by the Auburn script of Larson performing the monologue with two other performers, in this case Roger and Karessa, the former of whom is inspired by Roger Bart's role as background vocalist for performances ofBoho DaysandTick, Tick... Boom!. As a result of this device, certain songs that are sung in the Auburn script by characters in the narrative are instead sung by Jonathan, Roger, and Karessa, interwoven with the drama onscreen.[4][12]According to Levenson, Larson is telling the story to an audience, with most of the film taking place within his mind.[27]"Come to Your Senses" is an example of a song that changed because of this device. In the 2001 production it was performed by the actress who plays both Susan and Karessa, while in the film it was turned into a duet between Karessa and Susan for dramatic purposes.[25]
Two songs present in the 2001 Auburn script were cut during the writing process: "Sugar", which Jonathan and Karessa sing while bonding over their love ofTwinkies, and "See Her Smile", a song sung by Jonathan about his relationship with Susan.[28]However, Jonathan sings a riff of "Sugar" to Ira Weitzman at one point in the finished film.[27][25]A third song, "Green Green Dress", was filmed but cut during post-production, and was later uploaded to Netflix's YouTube channel.[29]
Miranda and Levenson also added three songs that were in previous versions ofTick, Tick... Boom!but not included in the Auburn script: "Boho Days", "Play Game", and "Swimming".[29]In the latter's case, the song had been cut by Larson himself after the show's 1990 performances and had not been heard by the public in thirty years.[30]"Boho Days" was the original opening number ofBoho Daysand was previously only available as a bonus track on the 2001 Off-Broadway cast recording, extracted from a demo tape recorded by Larson himself.[31]Like Auburn had in 2001 by including "Come to Your Senses", Miranda and Levenson used the film as an opportunity to release more of theSuperbiasoundtrack, specifically a song titled "Sextet" as the lyrics "Everyone will be there" thematically fit with Larson's anxieties about the workshop.[28]
Garfield was confirmed to star in October withAlexandra Shipp,Vanessa Hudgens, andRobin de Jesúsjoining in November 2019.[32][33]Joshua Henry,Judith Light, andBradley Whitfordwould join in January 2020.[34]
Jordan Fisher, who had starred inRent: Live, was meant to appear in the film as a character named "Simon" but due to the film's delays his wedding was scheduled on the same day his scene was to be shot, so he was replaced byNoah Robbins.[35][36]However, the scene was ultimately cut from the film.[37]Fisher's name had been listed on the film's casting announcements, and press reports continued to list both him and Robbins as members of the cast even after the film's release.[36][38][35]
In preparation for his role as Sondheim, Whitford studied interviews with him from around the time the film takes place. He noted his performance is somewhat dialed back, as he described Sondheim as almost an "orangutan" in his physicality in interviews. To simplify his performance, he would think "Crooked smile on an unmade bed" before cameras started rolling, which he felt was the key element of physicality he needed.[39]
Principal photographybegan as scheduled in March 2020.[40][41]However, the production only filmed for eight days before theCOVID-19 pandemicforced a shutdown, with the last day of filming taking place on March 12, 2020 outside of Larson's real apartment at 508 Greenwich Street.[18][42]During the hiatus the cast, crew, and producers held weekly meetings onZoom, which were colloquially referred to as "Tick, Tick... Zooms!".[43]Production resumed in September 2020 under strict COVID protocols,[44]and wrapped in November 2020.[45]Location shoots included theDelacorte Theaterin Central Park for "Why", the Underground Theater at the Abrons Arts Center (part of theHenry Street Settlement) for the musical theater workshop scene, Teatro LATEA at theClemente Soto Velez Cultural and Educational Centerfor Susan's dance recital, and the dance studios atHunter Collegefor theSuperbiaworkshop.[46][47]
The singing in the finished film is a mix of actors lip-syncing to pre-recorded tracks, re-recording their vocals in post-production, and singing live on set, with the choice to use one or the others dependent on the environment and tone of the scene. In the case of "Why", Garfield felt the emotions in the pre-recorded playback track were insufficient, and so sang the song live during filming at the Delacorte Theater in March.[46]This flexibility had to be limited after production resumed under COVID protocols, with the team limiting live singing to only certain moments. Miranda recalled one incident where Garfield spontaneously sang live on an impulse during one of the first days of shooting under the new protocols, leading Miranda to be scolded by the film's COVID Compliance Monitor.[46]"Boho Days" was one of the few musical numbers filmed with live singing during this period: all of the actors in the scene had to quarantine for 14 days in order to film it.[46]
The film includes a number of references, both visual and auditory, to Larson's later workRent: besides Pascal, Rubin-Vega, and Heredia's cameos, Jonathan calls Michael "pookie" in several scenes, the Cat Scratch Club appears in the background of "Play Game", and Jonathan plays "One Song Glory" on his keyboard at one point.[48]The team had hoped to include more locations associated withRent, such asTompkins Square Parkand the Life Cafe in the East Village, but COVID restrictions resulted in most of these scenes being moved to the diner.[49]The film'sSuperbiaworkshop montage consists of footage of the actors lip-syncing to a playlist compiled by Miranda, including songs fromAmerican IdiotandHair: the last song on the playlist was "Seasons of Love".[50]
During filming in late 2020, rumors leaked that Garfield was to make a return appearance asSpider-Man/Peter Parkerin the then-unnamedupcoming Spider-Man film. Miranda approached Garfield on-set to ask if he was in it, to which a flustered Garfield gave an unconvincing denial. Miranda walked away from the conversation thinking Garfield would need to get better at lying: Garfield later became well known for his repeated denials that he was inSpider-Man: No Way Homeduring the press tour forTick, Tick... Boom!.[51]
The film's production designers painstakingly recreated both the Moondance Diner and Larson's former apartment at 508 Greenwich Street. In the latter case, the team had access to footage of the apartment shot by Larson himself for insurance purposes, a mere two weeks before his death. This footage allowed them to identify the exact positions of objects, some of which were actually sourced to decorate the set.[43]OriginalRentstarsAdam Pascal,Daphne Rubin-Vega, andWilson Jermaine Herediavisited the apartment set while filming their cameos for "Sunday" at Miranda's invitation. They described it as a surreal experience, as all three had gathered at the real apartment duringRent's development. Heredia described the set as feeling "haunted", noting "...it wasn't [Jonathan Larson's] apartment; he was never in that place—but they spared no detail in order to make it look like his place."[52]
The team also had access to eight years ofBetacamfootage shot by Larson's friend Victoria Leacock Hoffman, who was the daughter of a documentary filmmaker and filmed Larson's performances and his life.[43]This footage was recreated in the film using an actual Betacam when attempts at recreating the look through visual effects did not work.[43]The minor character Donna, played byLauren Marcus, is based on Hoffman and is usually seen in the film following Jonathan around with a camera.[7]The team was mindful of the roleNew York Theatre Workshopplayed in Larson's development as an artist, and initially planned to recreate the interior on a soundstage à la the Moondance Diner and 508 Greenwich, as the real theater was booked during the initial production period. However, because of the pandemic the theater was available when production restarted, allowing them to film on the same stage Jonathan Larson had performedTick, Tick... Boom!30 years earlier.[53]
In directing the film's musical sequences, Miranda borrowed heavily from his experience working withJon M. Chuon thefilm adaptationof his musicalIn the Heights, namely balancing out a realistic approach versus allowing the musical sequences to exist in Jonathan's head.[46]Cinematographer Alice Brooks highlighted "Sunday" and "Swimming" as two particularly challenging sequences, as the two exist in Larson's head more so than other songs in the film. The scenes were conceptualized between Miranda, Brooks, Levenson, the assistant director, the storyboard artist, and the production designer in a collaborative process akin to theater, based on making discoveries at each step. For "Swimming", Miranda came up with the idea for the "30" at the bottom of the swimming pool to turn into a treble clef, and thus the pool floor becoming sheet music, during a scouting visit to the pool with Brooks.[43]The pool, which is located at the Tony Dapolito Recreation Center in the West Village, was chosen due to its resemblance to that described in the lyrics of "Swimming": it was only during filming that the designers and creative team learned this was the actual swimming pool Larson frequented.[54]Although David Armstrong is credited as Andrew Garfield's swimming double, Garfield performed all of the swimming in the film himself: his father Richard Garfield is the head coach of theGuildfordCity Swimming Club and had trained him in the past. Miranda recalled that Armstrong turned to him after watching Garfield's swimming and declared, "I can't swim that fast." The elder Garfield was originally supposed to cameo as the man whom Jonathan tries to overtake in the pool, but he was unable to come to New York for the shoot due to the film's COVID delays.[12][30]
For "Sunday," which parodies the Act 1 finale of the same name from Sondheim'sSunday in the Park with George, the team set up the sequence as a deliberate contrast to the look of the rest of the film, as it is Larson's "wildest dream." This included the idea to turn the Moondance Diner into a proscenium stage by having the front come down, and overexposing the footage to resemble a painting, especially with the transition to apointillistlook at the very end of the song.[43]The song had only ever been performed by Larson himself during his lifetime, so Miranda wanted to depict Larson's "dream choir" for the pivotal sequence.[55]This included the actors who inspired him, particularly Peters for her role inSunday in the Park with George, but also his future collaborators in Pascal, Rubin-Vega, and Heredia, as well as cast members from shows that Miranda considers "direct descendants" of Larson's work: Malone appears dressed as Big Alison fromFun Home, while Goldsberry and Soo wear the colors and strike the pose of the Schuyler sisters from Miranda's ownHamilton.[52]Miranda also recruitedMichael Starobin, who orchestratedSunday in the Park with George, to achieve the sound of the Sondheim parody.[56]The scene was shot under heavy COVID protocols, particularly for some of the older actors. Miranda's cameo in the scene was written forChip ZienandJoanna Gleason, who starred in the original Broadway cast of Sondheim'sInto the Woods, but COVID restrictions prevented them from appearing.[55]
Andrew Weisblumserved as the initial editor of the film up to the first development screening. Due to the film's COVID delays, he had to leave to work onDarren Aronofsky'sThe Whaleand was replaced by Myron Kerstein. Miranda's original assembly cut ran 2 hours and 20 minutes, whereas he preferred the film to run less than two hours.[29]
The film originally opened with a sequence focusing on Jonathan pacing anxiously backstage before theTick, Tick... Boom!performance. This was mostly cut because it was decided the opening of the film needed to be about who Larson was, rather than the character Jonathan's anxieties. Footage from this deleted opening is present in the film's initial teaser trailer.[57]The first scene at the diner during "30/90" was originally a different scene with Michael and Jonathan packing up Michael's things at their apartment. During preparation for reshoots, Kerstein pitched the scene at the diner so the sequence could introduce the characters of Freddy and Carolyn, minimizing time needed later in the film: he was alarmed when Levenson and Miranda shot a four-page scene in response, though he was relieved to learn they were open to cutting dialogue if needed.[57]
A question that arose during post-production was how to address the real Jonathan Larson's death.David Auburnhad intentionally avoided doing so for the 2001 production, feeling that such a move would cheapen the effect of the story onstage. He had even gone so far as to remove lines Larson wrote about feeling like his heart would explode, as he felt it would serve to distract audience members whom he assumed knew the circumstances of Larson's death.[4]However, Miranda, Weisblum, and Kerstein realized that, with the passage of time, there were more audience members unfamiliar with Larson who would need to get on the same page as the filmmakers about his "ticking clock".[58]Likewise, they would need the context of not just Larson's death, but his legacy through his most well-known show,Rent. Miranda did not want this information conveyed through onscreen text at the end, despite Kerstein joking this is traditional with even critically-acclaimed biopics. Miranda argued such a method was too obvious, and that the information needed to be incorporated into the film in a natural way. The team eventually settled on documentary-style bookends that combine narration, archival footage, and recreated Betacam footage, which Kerstein described as bringing the film "full circle" and thus allowing the information to be an effective part of the film's storytelling.[57]
Sondheim's vocal cameo (a concept that carries over from productions of the original musical) came about when he asked to rewrite his voicemail message after viewing the film, as he felt he would not say what had originally been written. However, at this point in production Whitford was not available to re-record the line, so Sondheim offered to record it himself.[59]The cameo was Sondheim's last film appearance before his death on November 26, 2021.[citation needed]
One of the film's more controversial cuts was the removal of the "Green Green Dress" musical number.[60]In the stage version, the song is a duet between Jonathan and Susan singing about their love for one another by way of the green dress that Susan wears, whereas in the film it plays as an R&B cover performed by Joshua Henry over a scene of the two making love. The song was filmed as a fully choreographed number, but Miranda found that it slowed the pace of the film. Though reluctant to cut it, he felt it was necessary to remove it as it was the only song where no story occurs. Miranda did not want to completely lose the song, hence the presence of the cover, and Garfield and Shipp's version was included in the end credits and on the soundtrack.[29]Following fan demand, the deleted scene was released on social media on March 17, 2022 to celebrateSaint Patrick's Day.[61]
Margaret Hall, writing forTheaterMania, observed that most of the songs in the film are presented asdiegetic music, a part of the world of the film, whereas "Green Green Dress" is one of the few numbers that is non-diegetic, where the characters do not necessarily know they are singing. While the final cut does include non-diegetic numbers such as "No More" and "Swimming", unlike those songs "Green Green Dress" does not offer new information about the characters singing it, nor does it offer much more insight into Jonathan and Susan's relationship than what is already presented. One of the film's major plot elements is that Jonathan is so focused on his career he is unable to stay on the same page as Susan, which is achieved by Susan not getting a solo for the majority of the film: one of her duets with Jonathan, "Therapy", instead becomes a diegetic performance by Jonathan and Karessa that contrasts with the couple's real-life argument. Removing "Green Green Dress" serves to finalize this disconnect, with Susan never singing a solo on a song until "Come to Your Senses", and in this case it is purely in Jonathan's head. Hall concluded that removing "Green Green Dress" was an example of one of the many changes toTick, Tick... Boom!that showed the production team's ability to engage with film as a medium rather than produce a straightforward stage-to-screen adaptation.[60]
The originalTick, Tick... Boom!rock monologue is a semi-autobiographical work: it derives from Larson's life but the events described are partially fictionalized. While the film affirms the "Jon" character as Jonathan Larson (only loosely confirmed in the original musical) and includes significant additional research done by Levenson and Miranda, the script alludes to the fact that there are parts of the story that "Jonathan made up."[12]
TheTick, Tick... Boom!soundtrack was released for streaming/digital on November 12, 2021, by Masterworks Broadway on the same day as the film's theatrical release. A physical CD was released on December 3, 2021. All Jonathan Larson songs in the film were produced byAlex Lacamoire,Bill Sherman, and Kurt Crowley (who cameos in the film as the rehearsal pianist forSuperbia, Francis).  The songs were mixed byGreg Wells, and music supervised by Steven Gizicki.[65]"30/90" was released via streaming on October 5, 2021.[66]"Louder Than Words" was also released as a single along with the album's pre-order date on October 22, 2021.[67]
Levenson and Miranda felt it was important for the film to play with the credit "score by Jonathan Larson" and so sourced many songs from the Library of Congress archives, including several that had never received an official release.[29][68]This includes three songs fromSuperbianot included in the soundtrack: "Ever After" (used to underscore the focus group meeting), "LCD Readout", and "Sextet".[12]Kurt Crowley released a solo arrangement of the latter featuringJoshua Henryduring the COVID-induced break in the film's production.[69]After considerable fan demand, the newly titled "Sextet Montage" was released as a single on February 4, 2022 in honor of what would have been Larson's 62nd birthday.[70]
A song called "Debtor Club" underscores the scene of Jonathan inviting various industry professionals to his reading.[12]This was a song originally written forBoho Days, described as a "Tears-for-Fears-esquetrack" which was replaced with "No More".[4]The film also includes three stand-alone songs by Larson: "Rhapsody", which plays in the background of Susan's dance recital and over the film's credits; "Out of My Dreams" covered byVeronica Vazquez, which can be heard when Jonathan meets Susan on the roof; and "It Only Takes a Few", covered byThe Mountain Goats, which plays over the credits.[12]Of these, only "Out of My Dreams" and "It Only Takes a Few" were released on the film's soundtrack.[65]Additionally, a rejected CNN jingle that Larson wrote plays in the background of Jonathan and Michael's car ride.[68]The cut song "Sugar" is referenced when Jonathan sings a riff from it to Ira Weitzman.[27]
As an easter egg, Jonathan plays the opening melody of "One Song Glory" fromRentat one point in the film.[71]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 217 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Tick, Tick... BOOM!makes musical magic out of a story focused on the creative process—an impressive feat for debuting director Lin-Manuel Miranda."[75]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[76]
The film was universally praised for its adaptation of the original musical, withVulture's Jackson McHenry highlighting the expanded cast and depiction of the world of the show.[77]Garfield and de Jesús's performances were particularly praised, due to Garfield's surprising musical ability and de Jesús's starring turn in a film after largely working in theater. Jessica Derschowitz ofEntertainment Weeklydubbed the film a "totem for the thrills and trials of making art, with all the sacrifices and empathy it requires", also praising it as a tribute to Larson.[78]Miranda's directing debut was also praised, particularly due to the challenge of adapting the material.Variety's Peter Debruge noted that despite Miranda's own personal connection to Larson's story, his direction seemed devoid of ego and purely focused on centering Larson.[79]
The film's choice to contextualize Larson's career and legacy through the documentary-style bookends was criticized even by positive reviewers. McHenry noted it reduced Larson to his most successful work and the film was stronger when the character was telling his story.[77]McHenry also noted that likeRent,Tick, Tick... Boom!views the AIDS crisis from the perspective of a straight male who did not contract the disease, and though the film adaptation expands its view on the crisis, the gesture feels incomplete.[77]
FilmmakerRob Marshall, who worked with Miranda on theDisneyfilmsMary Poppins Returns(2018) andThe Little Mermaid(2023), praised the film, calling it an "astonishing directorial debut" and saying that he was "struck by how authentic, original and deeply personal the film is. Clearly Lin connects intensely with the urgency, frustration, passion, struggle and heartbreak of Jonathan Larson’s creative process. You feel it in every frame."[80]
In 2023, it ranked number 38 onTime Out's list of "The 40 Best Musical Movies of All Time," writing that while not for everyone, the film is "an ideal entry point for sceptics."[81]It also ranked number 15 onScreen Rant's list of "The 35 Best Musicals of All Time."[82]Paraderanked it at number 36 on its list of the "67 Best Movie Musicals of All Time," calling it the "most invigorating snapshot of the all-consuming struggle of a creative sinceBrad Bird's layered masterpieceRatatouille."[83]
Julia Delbel, writing forComingSoon.net, observed that in a year of musical movie releases that saw films such asIn the Heights,Dear Evan Hansen, andWest Side Story,Tick, Tick... Boom!stood out for generating considerable buzz, whereas the other films struggled at the box office. She suggested thecontinued effect of the pandemic on movie theater attendancewas to blame, noting the popularity of Miranda'sEncantofollowing its release onDisney+after underperforming at the box office, withTick, Tick... Boom!'s status as a streaming release making it more easily accessible to its audience.[84]Between its release and June 2023, the film totaled 1.4 million hours watched.[85]

Imagine Entertainment, formerlyImagine Films Entertainment, also known simply asImagine(stylized asIMAGINE), is an Americanfilmandtelevisionproduction companyfounded in November 1985 by producerBrian Grazerand directorRon Howard.
Brian Grazer and Ron Howard met in 1982 onNight Shift, with Howard directing and Grazer co-producing. They followed it up by working on 1984'sSplash.[8]
The company was originally founded in November 1985, following the success of the motion pictureSplash. It was originated from a merger of two production companies,Ron Howard's Major H Productions andBrian Grazer's self-titled production company Brian Grazer Productions.[9]The company went public the following year. At first, the company set a deal withTri-Star Picturesto produce feature films and television shows. Imagine granted Tri-Star the right of first refusal to syndicate their off-network shows produced by Imagine. Its offering was sold toAllen & Co.for 1,667,000 units for common stock and warrant it to purchase additional one-third of its stock. The net proceeds were used for development and production of theatrical films, television series, mini-series and made for television movies, although "the company does not presently intend to develop game shows or daytime soap operas." Imagine however has its prospectus having negotiations withParamount Televisionfor a commitment withABCfor a half-hour pilot and five episodes based on the comedy filmGung Ho.[10]
Later the same year, Imagine had a five-year deal withShowtime/The Movie Channel, Inc.and it was able to develop projects for the channelsShowtimeandThe Movie Channel. The agreement would kick-off with 1989 pay television availabilities and include pay-per view exhibition rights to all Imagine-produced films and about 30 motion pictures and "an unspecified number of original products" are also covered by the agreement. "There was the option of developing "long-form dramas" or series as part of the original material to be developed and aired exclusively onShowtime, adding that it could also acquire the syndication rights to these films and original products.[11][12]
In April 1987, producers Philip and Mary Ann Hobel had inked a pact with Imagine Films Entertainment to develop and produce theatrical fare for the company through Hobel Productions, and expected to serve as the eyes and ears of Imagine of New York, and will be backed by a development fund for the purchase of books, plays, scripts and ideas to be developed as film projects, and plans to do both comedy and drama projects with a concentration on contempo themes and issues through a first-look agreement.[13]
On July 29, 1987,Tri-Star Picturesand Imagine Films Entertainment announced the termination of obligations by Imagine to offer Tri-Star distribution rights for all of its television programming and feature films. Imagine, which received more than $1.7 million from Tri-Star, made a $1.3 million payment to Tri-Star, the companies said and advances from Tri-Star were eliminated. The companies said they "intend[ed] to work together on a project-by-project basis" and that projects already in development were not affected. Imagine said the modified agreement "provide[d] it with the flexibility to pursue certain financing and distribution opportunities which were not anticipated when the companies entered the original agreement."[14]
In November 1987, Imagine Films Entertainment announced its plans to move its financial and administrative activities fromNew YorktoLos Angeles, and Neil Braun, who was president and chief-executive officer of the company would not be part of the move, and instead would leave the company and is expected to reveal of his plans shortly and his personal commitments would keep him from making the shift, but he called the consolidation "the right decision for the company" while expressing his disappointment at not being able to stay on.[15]
On December 1, 1987, the company sealed a production and distribution deal withUniversal Picturesvia a "long-term multiple picture agreement" that they distributed Imagine's films for three to five films a year and the agreement "contemplates the possibility" that Universal acquired a 20% share in Imagine[16][8]and it ran through November 1992 for financing 50% of 30 films. Imagine had an IPO in 1986 at $8 for a package of one share and one warrant. Shares rose to $19.25 before falling in the stock market crash in 1987 to $2.25. In the summer of next year, Imagine struck a deal withMCA TVto handle distribution of its television material. MCA and Imagine had a joint television venture which MCA had the exclusive network and home video distribution rights. Imagine retained domestic distribution rights for now and was banking on those rights becoming more valuable in the future as its theatrical and television programs gained exposure. Imagine's television division focused on half-hour comedies, whereas MCA focused on one-hour programs for the networks.[17][18]
In September 1988, Robert Harris who was employee ofMCA, and president ofUniversal Television Groupjoined the company as president of motion pictures and television. Harris said the studio was also taking original feature cable projects withShowtime,HBO,TNT,USAandMTV Network(which includesNickelodeonandVH-1, in addition to projects with on-air networks).[18]
On May 29, 1989, Imagine andCentral Independent Televisionsigned a deal to make television films for the worldwide business. Under the deal, the new joint venture would produce between four and six television films and mini-series a year.MCAwho owned about 20% of Imagine and had worldwide distribution rights to its television series as well as to its long-form programs on a project-by-project basis would also have first consideration on international distribution rights to the joint venture's programs. Imagine andCentralretained rights in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively. The Imagine-Central joint venture was separate from MCA's own ongoing exploration of a joint venture with a European company for Europe-based long-form co-production. The company was in discussions with two or three potential partners, but a deal was not expected soon. Its projects required U.S. and UK presales to go forward, although the venture intended to seek U.S. buyers going beyond the three big commercial networks to includeFox, as well as cable networksTNT,USA Network,ShowtimeandHBO. The deal also allowed for theatrical distribution, although such co-productions were not in the planning.[19]
Imagine andSecond Citysigned a joint venture deal in May 1989. In September 1989, Imagine is entering syndication production business and signed a long-term co-production deal with Second City Entertainment, for a late night talk/comedy strip that was distributed by MCA TV. It used the ready talent pool of Second City comedians. The result wasMy Talk Show, which aired in the 1990–91 season.[18]As HA!: The Comedy Network is ready to air in 1990, they stuck deals with Imagine Films Entertainment, for series featuring the Second City Repertory Company, as well asMTM Enterprises.[20]
In 1990, Imagine Films Entertainment launched a brand new family film label Imagine Family Films, designed to compete with Disney for a family film audience, in order to produce G-rated and PG-rated feature films, and has plans to produce three family films per year, with an eye on the holiday release schedule. The first film planned to be developed for the branding was a remake of the 1963 family feature filmFlipper, and an adaptation of the book seriesCurious George. Both MCA/Universal and Imagine agreed to an extension that Universal would handle theatrical distribution, network, foreign and home video rights, whileUniversal Studios Floridahandled the theme park rights to the properties that were proposed by Imagine Family Films. The new Imagine Family Films banner was intended to model on the success of Disney, and decided to extend on the natural extension of the wholesome wide appeal fare the company has been using since its founding.[21]
In 1991, Imagine Films Entertainment shut down its original Imagine Television division, and terminating its exclusive production partnership with MCA, Inc., and it laid off 30 of its 80 employees of its company. It came when the seriesMy Talk Show, andParenthoodflopped. Andrew Suskind, Joyce Brotman, Todd Bergesen, Richard Pierson, Judy Ranam and Lisa Bloom left the company.[22]
By May 1992, 48% of the stock was public traded and worth $9.375. The duo agreed to a new six-picture deal with Universal while concurrently offering $9 a share to buy the company's public outstanding share to start a new company with its assets. If not, they planned to leave the company at their contract expiration in November to start the new company anyway. Universal was providing the cash for a buyout of an equity stake in the new company.[12]By January 21, 1993, it approved a $9 share offer made by its founders and co-chief executives, and IFE Acquisition Co. could render the offer for the deal.[23]
In early 1997, Imagine Entertainment reopened its television division and signed a deal withDisneyfor the development of television series, which would expire at the end of 2000. Its film contract remained withUniversal. It boosted up their access to Disney's television production slate. Imagine was exclusive for development and production of television projects, including half-hour comedy series, one-hour dramas, motion pictures for television and miniseries.[24][25]They hiredTony Krantzto be co-chairman of its television division, and it shared a stake in the television division with its founders Brian Grazer and Ron Howard, while overseeing the television division's day-to-day operations.[26]
In 2000, the partnership teamed up with20th Century Fox Televisionfor development of television series, an agreement which was set to expire at the end of 2016.[8]In 2011, the company had three weak box office performers withThe Dilemma,Cowboys & AliensandTower Heist. Because of their weak financial pact renewal with Universal in January 2012, Imagine laid off 5 employees, including production executive Jeremy Steckler.[27]This also moved Imagine from exclusive to afirst-look deal. By 2013, Imagine was considering other funding methods for the company's films including crowdfunding for aFriday Night Lightsfilm.[28]
In November 2013, Michael Rosenberg was promoted to co-chairman followed in December 2013, with Erica Huggins being promoted to his previous position as president.[29]Industry insiders indicated in late January 2016 that a deal with Raine Group was in the works that would have Raine become a partner of the production company while contributing $100 million.[8]The deal was then confirmed on February 8, 2016.[30]
On April 5, 2017, Imagine signed a six-picture deal withWarner Bros.and Australian visual effects/animation studioAnimal Logicto develop, finance, and produce six animated/live-action films.[31][32]At the end of July 2017, the company struck a four-year first look co-financing and television production deal withCBS Corporation, which saw the former producing content for the company'sCBSandShowtimetelevision networks andCBS All AccessSVOD streaming service.

“It was the LGBTQ community that inspired me to be the kind of person I wanted to be. I wanted to be authentic and courageous, and for so long I wasn't. When I began doing a lot of advocacy work in the early '80s for HIV and AIDS, I saw the community and the way the community was operating against all odds, against a world and a culture and country that gave them nothing and denigrated them. ... I looked at this community and said, 'This is breathtaking. This is the kind of world and people I want to be around. These are the kind of people I want to be working with."[51]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
