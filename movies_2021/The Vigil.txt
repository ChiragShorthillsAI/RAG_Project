The Vigilis a 2019 Americansupernatural horror filmwritten and directed byKeith Thomasin his featuredirectorial debut.[3]It starsDave Davis, Menashe Lustig, Malky Goldman,Fred MelamedandLynn Cohen, and follows a young man who is tasked withkeeping vigilover a deceased member of his formerOrthodox Jewishcommunity, only to be targeted by amalevolent spiritknown as aMazzik(Hebrewfound in theTalmud: מזיקין).[3][7]Jason Blumserves as an executive producer through hisBlumhouse Productionsbanner.
The Vigilpremiered at the2019 Toronto International Film Festivalon September 9, 2019.[3]The film received a limited theatrical release in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and New Zealand in July 2020, before being released internationally on August 5, 2020. It was released in the United States on February 26, 2021, byIFC Midnight.
The film opens with an unidentified boy forced by a man in a blackNaziuniform to shoot a young woman in a forest, as a strange figure approaches them in the background.
The film then cuts to Yakov Ronen, a man who has left the Orthodox Jewish community inBrooklyn. He is struggling to deal with an unspecified traumatic event in his past and to pay his rent due to not having a job. He is approached by Reb Shulem, a member of his former Orthodox Jewish community, to keep vigil over Rubin Litvak, aHolocaustsurvivor who had died recently. Shulem had previously hired aShomer, but that individual had left due to being "afraid", and Ronen had prior experience with keeping vigil. Ronen accepts the job after negotiating a higher fee. That night, Ronen and Shulem meet with Litvak's widow, who is suffering fromAlzheimer's diseaseand reluctantly accepts Ronen as a Shomer, and Shulem informs Ronen that the mortuary men will arrive in five hours.
Ronen begins his vigil then he starts to hear strange noises and sees a shadowy figure in the house's dining room. He finds a photo of Litvak and his family with a similar shadowy figure behind them, before briefly going to sleep; he has a nightmare about his younger brother being tormented by some older men. Upon waking up, Ronen experiences additional strange events, such as the lights flickering while texting his friend Sarah, and finds a video on his phone sent by an unknown number. The video shows Mrs. Litvak approaching Ronen and touching his face while he is asleep; the video file vanishes from his phone a few seconds later.
Ronen has a conversation with Mrs. Litvak, who explains that she drove their children away. Ronen then finds a television in the basement, playing a video recording of Litvak and his wife. In the recording, Litvak explains that he was haunted by aMazzik, a malevolent spirit, since his time inBuchenwald, that it latches onto a "broken person" and that its true face must be burned by dawn on the first night of its appearance to banish it. TheMazzikappears behind Ronen, and he flees from the basement. Ronen gets a call apparently from his physician, Dr. Kohlberg, and from his dead brother, who asks: "Why did you let me die?"
Ronen leaves the house to get Shulem, though Mrs. Litvak warns him that he has been in the house for too long. However, Ronen experiences cracking bones while walking down the street, and is confronted by theMazzik. Ronen hastily returns to the house, and falls down the steps after being startled by theMazzikappearing in front of the door. A flashback then reveals that Ronen's brother was killed in a car accident after escaping from the men who were tormenting him, and Ronen has felt guilty about his death ever since.
With Mrs. Litvak's assistance, Ronen confronts theMazzik, which hasshapeshiftedits true face to look like Ronen's. After initially hesitating, Ronen sets its true face on fire, and then banishes it when it begins to make Litvak's body contort loudly. A flashback reveals that Litvak was the boy forced to shoot the young woman in the opening scene; the pain Litvak felt after the shooting caused theMazzikto latch on to him.
On the next morning, the mortuary men arrive to collect Litvak's body, and Shulem asks Ronen to attend morning prayers with him; Ronen declines his offer, saying "not today". As he leaves the house, a dark figure (presumably theMazzik) is seen following Ronen out of the house and heading down the street behind him.

Variety's Dennis Harvey gave the film a mostly positive review, calling it an "effectively creepy, small-scale chiller that does a nice job eking suspense from its simple story and limited setting."[2]Eric Kohn ofIndieWiregave the film a grade of B, praising Davis's performance and writing that, "even asThe Vigilsettles into a familiar routine, it tackles that task with a polished, at times even elegant approach to a haunted house formula."[1]
Jordan Mintzer ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote that writer-directorKeith Thomas"keeps the tension high throughout most of the movie, even if some of his scare tactics can feel redundant", and that he "transformsOrthodox cultureinto gory material for a slightly elevated horror flick".[3]Phil Hoad ofThe Guardiangave the film a score of 3 stars out of 5, writing that the film "doesn’t examine risingantisemitism, so it doesn’t have the same contemporary punch asGet Outhad regardingBlack Lives Matter, orThe Invisible Manfor#MeToo", but added: "it is all the same an authentically Jewish and reasonably competent chiller."[15]Joe Lipsett ofBloody Disgustingwrote that "The Vigildoesn't exactly break the mould of demonic spirit films, though its sound design, lighting and lead performance certainly make it a solid entry."[7]
Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comgave the film a mostly negative review, writing: "Sadly, director Keith Thomas doesn't trust his own themes or visual sense, swallowing his entire film up in abrasive sound design and a reliance onjump scares."[16]Barry Hertz ofThe Globe and Maildescribed the film as "the cinematic equivalent of first-timergefilte fish", adding: "In writer-director Keith Thomas's bid to add a layer of thematic novelty to a familiar genre, he has come up with a mish-mash that will satisfy only those with extremely acquired tastes."[17]

The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
