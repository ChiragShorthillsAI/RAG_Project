It's happening right now. It's happening in Chicago. It's happening here in Los Angeles. It's happening globally.

This proved so rich that the role grew beyond even the writers' expectations.[35]Begley Jr. said about his future TV chief of surgery, "I was a huge fan of Bill Daniels. I had seen him inTwo for the Road. I had seen him inThe Graduate, and inParallax View. He was an actor I just thought the world of. He played these 'Type A' personalities quite effectively, but (in real life) he is the sweetest guy in the world." He also added: "He is an actor I just thought the world of. I had no delusions about how my character came to be. I rode on the coattails of Bill Daniels... the kind of Mutt and Jeff routine of Dr. Craig looking up and berating a 6 foot 4 doctor Victor Ehrlich. So I owe all my success on the show to Bill Daniels."[36]After the series was canceled, the two still remained friends, living not too far away from each other. In 2002, Daniels and Begley Jr., alongside other survivingSt. Elsewherecast membersStephen FurstandEric Laneuville, all appeared on an episode ofScrubs.
BeforeSt. Elsewherein the early 1980s, the struggling and unknown Begley metNorman Lloyd, who became a mentor to him while Lloyd was directing an episode ofTales of the Unexpected. The two became friends. In a 2014 interview with Jimmy Falcon of Cloverleaf Radio, he said this about Lloyd:
Not only did I enjoy working with him, but I see him fairly regularly. I just had dinner with him 4 nights ago.  We had dinner together at Sarah Nichols's house, his neighbor of mine and friend of his. We had a lovely time and reminisced – he's unbelievable. He's going to be 100 years old this year—and still very active, getting around on his own. He's a force of nature, so Norman Lloyd was somebody I idolized. When I was quite young, wow, James Dean is great and this is one and that.  Now look at Janis Joplin, what a great voice and Jim Morrison, those people left us so young, like my point of view has change somewhere, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, saying, 'No, you idolized Jimmy Stewart, Gloria Swanson.' The people that have families and happiness and a long, economy life. You know, Norman Lloyd, he wasn't much older than me, when I didSt. Elsewhere, and I went 'These are my role models, now, people had a long/happy life and continued to be creative.' Those are my role models, not the people that left us so early and I'm sorry they did, I don't mean to trifle with that, but, my role models changed from the people who had an incredible, brief spurt of creativity and life, but to people that went the distance, they became my role models at some point in my early 30s really.[37]
On November 9, 2014, along with formerSt. Elsewhereco-stars, Begley attended Lloyd's 100th birthday inLos Angeles. Begley said, "I worked with Norman Lloyd the actor, and Norman Lloyd the director, and no one informed me better on the art of storytelling than that talented man. He is a constant inspiration and my eternal friend."[38]
