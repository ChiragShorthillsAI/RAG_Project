On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 8% of 38 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "Dull and predictable,Midnight in the Switchgrasssquanders an evocative setting and some committed performances on a would-be thriller that rarely raises a sweat."[14]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 24 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[15]
Robert Kojder of Flickering Myth said that "the fact thatMidnight in the Switchgrassis an all-around terrible movie comes as no surprise, but there is a sting since for star Megan Fox, it's coming off a career-best and physically impressive performance inTill Death."[16]Jackie K. Cooper rated the film 5 out of 10 saying that "Megan Fox steals the show while Bruce Willis is missing in action."[17]
In his review forThe New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg said that "the atmosphere is thoroughly sleazy without being distinctive, and everything about the movie - the emotionless line readings, the half-baked back stories - exudes a terse functionality."[18]
Waldemar Dalenogare Netorated the film 2 out of 10 and stated that it is one of the "most generic thrillers of the year (...) I really don't know yet what the purpose of this film is other than the fact that it tries to profit from Megan Fox's image and Bruce Willis."[19]In a positive review for theSan Jose Mercury News, Randy Myers said that "it's worth a watch if you like serial killer thrillers but don't expect to see anything revolutionary going on."[20]
Jesse Hassenger was less complimentary in his review forPaste Magazineby saying that it looks like the filmmakers are trying to punish Megan Fox for her performance inTill Death, and he concluded, "It's entirely because of Fox thatSwitchgrassstays compelling far longer than it should, raising vain hopes that she'll be able to work it into something pulpier and more defined. Despite the eventual disappointment, I hope she sticks with genre fare a bit longer, and finds some more shackles to break."[21]

Randall Ives Emmett(born March 25, 1971) is an American film producer and television personality. He is the chairman and co-founder of production companyEmmett/Furla Oasis Films.
Emmett is best known for pioneering thegeezer teaser, a genre of low-budget action movies "teased" as staring a "geezer"[a]to quickly garner international financial backing, before producing a low-quality movie with the advertised "geezer" barely appearing.[1]
He also appeared in the eighth and ninth seasons of theBravoreality television seriesVanderpump Rules, as the partner of Lala Kent.
Born to a family inMiami, Florida, according to Emmett, a "distant cousin", through his mother, ofJerry Bruckheimer,[2]and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from theSchool of Visual Artsin New York City.[3]In 1996 Emmett moved toLos Angelesand worked as an assistant atInternational Creative Management.[1]
In 1995, Emmett began his Hollywood career as a personal assistant toMark Wahlberg.[3][1]Emmett is the basis for the character Turtle from theHBOshowEntourage.[1]Emmett approached Wahlberg about the possibility of him producing movies but was turned down.[1]Later he met George Furla, ahedge fundmanager who agreed to finance his dream of being a producer, with whom he co-founded Emmett/Furla Films in 1998.[3][1]
Emmett would receive a crash-course in producing byAvi Lernerand through him was introduced toMichael Oblowitzand pitched a low-budget, direct to video movie staringSteven Seagalwho was just finished acting in the highly troubled production ofThe Foreigner.[1]Mostly through Lerner's vouching Oblowitz agreed to let Emmett produce 2003'sOut for a Killstaring Seagal.[1]Out for a Killcreated the "template" for a geezer teaser, as it was low quality, stared an aged Seagal, and was mostly advertised and distributed inEastern Europe.[1]Out for a Killmaking a profit made other studios like Sony and Universal to take notice in the business strategy who also began heavily investing in the direct to DVD market, while Emmett and Furla made three films in 2010 includingGunbefore being approached in March 2011 to make films financed byRemington ChaseandStepan Martirosyanwho claimed to have made their moneyin Russia.[1]However, both men had convictions related to cocaine trafficking theSECrevealed that $62 million of the $525 million they raised for Emmett was done so fraudulently, and spent on personal expenses.[1]

Lionsgatewould pressure EFO to hireScott Mannto direct and "handle" Emmett during the production ofHeist, however, Emmett would do everything in his power as producer to make Mann's life difficult, including last minute script changes and slashing filming time.[1]However, when reviews came in forHeistit was noted that Mann and his directing was "battling a preposterous plot and second-tier performances."[1]Heisthad over-performed its expectations in the box office, and allowed Emmett to continue making low-quality movies.[1]
Emmett has credits in 110 films, most of them are so bad thatVulturestated they deserve a category of their own.[1]That category is theGeezer teaser, films notable for spending the vast majority of their budget for a day or two of work from aged action stars, and then advertising the film as staring said star in foreign markets before the film is even made, cashing in on investor funds to churn out low quality "bleak" films.[1]Often times the advertised "star" of a Geezer teaser are only in the film for upwards of 10 minutes being compared to the low qualityCannon Groupfilms.[1]Vulturealso described Emmett as "Hollywoodâ€™s worst filmmaker" for, besides the poor quality of his films, his efforts to cut out union employees at every turn, from script-writers to stunt doubles, while filming wherever the tax-credit is the highest.[1]
In 2017 Emmett and EFO was sued byJonathan Bakerwho co-produced their filmInconceivablealleging that Emmett and Furla paid themselves $650,000 more in producer fees than had been agreed upon and failed to disclose it.[1]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdwardÂ VIIIsold in 2021 for Â£1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (FullÂ list...)
AmÃ©lie of Leuchtenberg(1812â€“1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor PedroÂ I. She was the fourth child ofEugÃ¨ne de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with AmÃ©lie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria AmÃ©liawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and AmÃ©lie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of AmÃ©lie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich DÃ¼rck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
