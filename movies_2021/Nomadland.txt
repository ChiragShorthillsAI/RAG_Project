In 2011, Fern loses her job after the closure of theUS Gypsumplant inEmpire, Nevada; she had worked there for years along with her husband, who recently died. Fern sells most of her belongings and purchases a van to live in and travel the country searching for work. She takes a seasonal job at anAmazonfulfillment centerthrough the winter.
Linda, a friend and co-worker, invites Fern to visit adesert rendezvousinArizonaorganized byBob Wells, which provides a support system and community for fellow nomads. Fern initially declines, but changes her mind as the weather turns cold and she struggles to find work in the area. There, she meets fellow nomads and learns basic survival and self-sufficiency skills for the road.
When Fern's van blows a tire, she visits the van of a nearby nomad, Swankie, to ask for a ride into town to buy a spare. Swankie chastises Fern for not being prepared and invites her to learn road survival skills; they become friends. Swankie tells Fern about her cancer diagnosis and shortened life expectancy and her plan to make good memories on the road rather than waste away in a hospital. They eventually part ways.
Fern takes a job as a camp host at the Cedar Pass Campgrounds inBadlands National ParkinSouth Dakota. Also working there is Dave, another nomad she met and danced with at the desert community. When he falls ill withdiverticulitis, she visits him at the hospital where he has had emergency surgery. They take restaurant jobs atWall Drugin South Dakota. One night, Dave's son visits the restaurant looking for him, telling him that his wife is pregnant and asking him to meet his grandchild. He is hesitant, but Fern encourages him to go. Dave suggests that she come with him, but she declines.
Fern takes a new job at asugar beetprocessing plant, but her van breaks down, and she cannot afford the repairs. Unable to borrow money, she visits her sister's family at their home inCalifornia. Fern's sister lends her the money to get the van fixed. She questions why Fern was never around in their lives and why she stayed in Empire after her husband died, but she tells Fern that she is brave to be so independent. Fern later visits Dave and his son's family inPoint Arena, California, learning that Dave has decided to stay with them long-term. He admits to having feelings for her and invites her to stay with him permanently in a guest house, but she decides to leave after only a few days, heading to the ocean.
Fern returns to her seasonal Amazon job and later revisits the Arizona rendezvous. There, she learns that Swankie has died, and she and the other nomads pay tribute to her life by tossing stones into the campfire. Fern opens up to Bob about her loving relationship with her late husband, and he shares the story of his son's suicide. Bob espouses the view that goodbyes are not final in the nomad community as its members always promise to see each other again "down the road".
Fern returns to the nearly abandoned town of Empire to dispose of the belongings she has been keeping in a storage unit. She visits the factory and the home she shared with her husband before returning to the road.

Review aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoesreports that 93% of 442 critic reviews were positive, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "A poetic character study on the forgotten and downtrodden,Nomadlandbeautifully captures the restlessness left in the wake of theGreat Recession."[36]According toMetacritic, which assigned it a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on 55 critics, the film received "universal acclaim".[37]
Writing forThe Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called the film a "powerful character study", and added, "Like Zhao's earlier work,Nomadlandis an unassuming film, its aptly meandering, unhurried non-narrative layering impressions rather than building a story with the standard markers. But the cumulative effect of its many quiet, seemingly inconsequential encounters and moments of solitary contemplation is a unique portrait of outsider existence."[1]Adrian Horton ofThe Guardiangave the film a positive review, stating, "Nomadlandhas garnered industry praise as a likely frontrunner for the best picture Oscar ... The word of mouth is warranted."[38]A.O. ScottofThe New York Timessimilarly gave a positive review, writing "It's like discovering a new country, one you may want to visit more than once."[39]Eric Kohn ofIndieWiregave the film an "A−" and said, "director Chloé Zhao works magic with McDormand's face and the real world around it, delivering a profound rumination on the impulse to leave society in the dust."[40]Some reviewers felt the film idealized financial despair. Critic Tim Brayton called it "108 minutes of poverty tourism",[41]whileWBUR's Sean Burns wrote "Zhao has madeThe Grapes of Wrathwithout the wrath".[42]
FilmmakerBarry Jenkinspraised Zhao's direction, saying "There’s a meticulousness to her craft, and yet it also feels kind of free. I think people watch her work, and they first assume, “Oh, they just showed up and things just happened.” But I know what it takes to get this framing and that framing. I think there’s this idea of things just happening, but there’s also the craft involved in knowing a place, getting there, understanding the light, and then creating an environment for your actors to just do this wonderful thing they do."[43]
IndieWire's poll of 231 critics includedNomadlandin its Best Movies of 2020.[44]According to Metacritic, the film was ranked the best of 2020 by critics more often than any other.[45]In 2021, it was included onForbes's list of "The Top 150 Greatest Films Of The 21st Century."[46]In 2022, it ranked number 10 onTime Out's list of "The 100 Best Movies of the 21st century So Far," saying that the film "expertly stitches together realism, moments of sheer transcendence and a lightly-worn radicalism in a way that feels nothing but unpatronizing and empathetic."[47]In August 2023,Colliderranked the film at number 13 on its list of "The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far," calling it "a moving portrayal of the American nomadic lifestyle" and praised the lead character of Fern as "endearing ... because of her self-confidence, but it never feels like she’s attempting to impose her choice of lifestyle on anyone else."[48]
McDormand loudly howled toward the ceiling when accepting the Oscar for Best Picture, which drew confusion from many audience members and press outlets. She went on to explain this was done to honor the film's Sound Mixer, Michael "Wolf" Snyder, who had died shortly before the release of the film.[49]
Zhao and the film's success prior to and leading up to theGolden Globesand the Oscars were initially praised on Chinese social media outlets, as well as official state-controlled news media.[50][51][52]
After the Golden Globes, Zhao was scrutinized by Chinesenetizensover her remarks in a 2013 interview forFilmmakermagazine, in which she described China as "a place where there are lies everywhere". In response to the controversy,Nomadlandwas pulled from theatrical release by Disney China, and the93rd Academy Awardswere censored by Chinese media outlets along with all mention of Zhao or the film on social media.[53][54]

Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners.

The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

Hulu began an advertising campaign during NBC's broadcast ofSuper Bowl XLIIIwith an initial ad starringAlec Baldwintitled "Alec in Huluwood."[16]Advertisements have since aired featuringEliza Dushku,Seth MacFarlane,Denis Leary, andWill Arnett.[citation needed]
In July 2007,Providence Equity, the owner ofNewport Television, became one of the earliest "outside" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 millionequity investment,[17]before the company was known as "Hulu."[18]With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an "independent voice on the board."[18]In April 2009,the Walt Disney Companyjoined the Hulu consortium as a stakeholder, with plans to offer content fromABC,ESPNandDisney Channel.[19][20][21][22]
Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

Comcast, the only other shareholder, announced on May 14, 2019, that it had agreed to cede its control to Disney, and reached an agreement for Disney to purchase its 33% stake in the company as early as 2024.[38]
On May 14, 2019, Comcast relinquished its control in Hulu to Disney effective immediately. As a result, the streaming service became a division ofWalt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International(DTCI) with Comcast effectively becoming asilent partner. Under the agreement, Comcast's 33% stake can be sold to Disney atfair market valueas early as 2024. The fair market value will be determined at that time, but Disney guaranteed a minimum valuation of the entire company at $27.5 billion (valuing the Comcast stake as worth at least $9.075 billion).[39]Randy Freer would report to Disney executiveKevin Mayer.[39]
Disney stated that its control of Hulu was the third major component of its direct-to-consumer strategy, complementing its sports streaming serviceESPN+, and its then-forthcomingDisney+.

In September 2022, Chapek indicated that Disney is considering merging Hulu into Disney+ because the model had been successful outside the United States without any content friction.[53]To accelerate the plan, he said that Disney would love to buy out Comcast's 33.3% stake in Hulu earlier than their previously agreed 2024 timeline. However, Comcast had not offered reasonable terms for an early buyout[54]and had instead expressed interest in buying Hulu themselves if it were for sale.[53]

During the event, they hinted at their future project together.[49]It premiered at theVenice Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim and won theGolden Lionaward,[50]and subsequently played at the2020 Toronto International Film Festival, where it won thePeople's Choice Award.[51]The film was released on 19 February 2021, bySearchlight Pictures.[52]Zhao won theGolden Globe Award for Best DirectorforNomadland, making her the first woman of Asian descent honored,[53]and only the second woman to win a Golden Globe for directing sinceBarbra Streisandin1984.[6]In April 2021, Zhao won theAcademy Award for Best Director, becoming the second woman to do so (Kathryn Bigelowbeing the first).

In September 2018,Marvel Studioshired her to directEternals, based on the comic book charactersof the same name.[55]The film follows the events of the 2019 Marvel movieAvengers: Endgame,featuring a new team of superheroes that must reunite in order to fight an ancient enemy of the human race, the Deviants.[56]Zhao was heavily influenced byRidley Scott'sPrometheus(2012) andNick Cassavetes'The Notebook(2004) in crafting the MCU film.[57]It was released on November 5, 2021. Zhao is both the director and one of the four writers of the film, the others beingPatrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, andKaz Firpo.[58]Eternalsreceived mixed reviews.The New Yorkerstated that Zhao's style of directing dialogue scenes "reveals the absurdity of the script," saying "it might as well have been done via green screen, for the little tangibility and texture that it offers the characters and viewers alike."[59]The article also claimed that the film has reportedly been banned in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait due to the relationship between two male characters,Phastosand Ben.[60]In spite of negative reviews, it still made $161.7 million during its opening weekend and became No. 1 at the box office.[61]
On 15 February 2021,Varietyreported that with "34 awards season trophies for directing, 13 for screenplay and nine for editing, Chloe Zhao has surpassedAlexander Payne(Sideways) as the most awarded person in a single awards season in the modern era."[62][needs update]In 2021, she appeared on theTime100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[63]

In February 2025, it was announced that Zhao would be directing the pilot episode for a revival ofBuffy the Vampire SlayeronHulu.
Throughout her filmography, Zhao carries relatively the same styles and techniques.Frances McDormandtoldRolling Stoneabout Zhao's process, saying "she's basically like a journalist...she gets to know your story, and she creates a character from that" and that she "draws a razor-sharp line between sentiment and sentimentality".[71]AFilmmakerarticle quoted Zhao as saying "I want to find new ways to place the camera to evoke more of a feeling. My goal is to put the camera inside of [the character]".[28]An example of her process can be found inEternalswhen she saw the connection between actorsLauren RidloffandBarry Keoghanwho playMakkariandDruigin the film.[72]The article wrote that Zhao saw them interacting and thought "Okay, we've got to write more moments", stating "It's the same as I did withNomadlandandThe Rider. I would see how they interact and I would write that into the film".[72]She believes that everyone wants to feel a connection, that filmmakers tell their stories because they don't want to feel alone, which is why she focuses on the themes of authenticity and places an emphasis on real stories.[73]In an interview with Brut America, Zhao touched upon her feeling on the importance of directing from the perspective of the female gaze. "For me, there is a yin and yang in all of us, feminine and masculine strength and I think often in our society in our industry, the masculine strength is being celebrated, and that's a painful way to exist both for women and men."[74]Zhao, known primarily for her feature films which depict the lives and struggles of real people from diverse backgrounds, such asThe Rider,Songs My Brother Taught Me, andNomadland, is now taking on projects that depict various characters from broader universes, for instance the Marvel film, Eternals. On directing this myriad of characters from the female perspective she says "I always try to find a way to give them a chance to be in touch with their feminine side" "We must also allow our male characters to access their softer side, I think that's the true female gaze."
Zhao citesWong Kar-wai's romanceHappy Togetheras the "film that made me want to make films". She was also influenced bySpike Lee, who was her film professor while she studied at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.[75][76]She citedAng Leeas an influence as well, saying, "Ang Lee's career has been very inspiring to me — how he's able to bring where he comes from to all the films that he makes". She also has mentionedWerner HerzogandTerrence Malickas key influences.[77][78]
Zhao stated her early introductions to American cinema wereThe Terminator,GhostandSister Act.[75]
After Zhao became the second woman to win aGolden Globe Award for Best Director(forNomadland), many Chinese viewers, as well as state media in China, celebrated her win and "sought to claim Zhao's glory for China".[79]Shortly afterward, however, some Chinese internet users began to question Zhao's citizenship and debated "whether it is appropriate to claim Zhao's victory as China's", withVarietycalling the claim "a common move by state-backed outlets to drum upnationalism".[79]Much of the controversy hinged around two sets of remarks: a 2013Filmmakermagazine interview in which Zhao described China as "a place where there are lies everywhere",[80]and a late 2020 interview in which Zhao was mis-quoted as saying "The US is now my country" (she had actually said "The US is not my country," and the error was corrected about two months later).[81][79][82]References to Zhao in Chinese media were censored following her Oscar win.[83][84]
Zhao resides inOjai, Californiawith her partner and cinematographerJoshua James Richards.[9][85]Richards and Zhao met while Zhao was researching for her first feature filmSongs My Brother Taught Meand Richards was still a film student at New York University. He has been her cinematographer for her next two films and served as camera operator onEternals.[86]In anEllearticle, Richards stated that Zhao was "gnarly and extreme", someone he wanted to find at film school.[18]

Wells's father, who worked as a union clerk at aSafewayinAnchorage, Alaska, died two years after reaching retirement. Finding himself employed in the same store—and wanting to avoid his father's inability to enjoy retirement—Wells moved into abox vanin 1995[3]purchased with his last $1,500 after working for 20 years at the store.[4]The experience, which occurred during the aftermath of a difficult divorce with two children,[1]left Wells crying himself to sleep.[5][6]After six years, he remarried, moved into a house,[1]and relocated with his wife toNorth Carolina, but eventually went back to living in a vehicle full-time.[6]After he and his second wife divorced, Wells began living in atruck camper, followed by a work van[6]and a four-wheel-drive ambulance.[7]
In 2005, after seeing a mother and her three children sleeping in a car, Wells created the websitecheaprvliving.com, to provide tips, resources and strategies for living in a vehicle. He portrayed himself in the2020 film adaptationof the bookNomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century.[7][8]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
