In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel.

After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]

The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24.

"We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren‚Äôt going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith‚Äôs twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it‚Äôs relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That‚Äôs why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017‚Äì2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015‚Äì2017),Euphoria(2019‚Äìpresent),Hazbin Hotel(2024‚Äìpresent),I'm Sorry(2017‚Äì2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022‚Äìpresent),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019‚Äì2022), andZiwe(2021‚Äì2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films ‚Äî and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]

Auteur filmmakers Aster‚Äîdirector/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)‚Äîand Eggers‚Äîdirector/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)‚Äîare both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]

In 2022, Kilmer reprised his role as Iceman inTop Gun: Maverick(2022).
In 2015, Kilmer was diagnosed withthroat cancer; he had a procedure on histracheathat damaged his vocal cords to the point where he had extreme difficulty speaking. He also underwentchemotherapyand twotracheotomies.[2][3][4][5]In 2020, he published his memoir, titledI'm Your Huckleberry: A Memoir.[6]The 2021 documentary filmValdocuments his health issues and career. It premiered at theCannes Film Festivalto critical acclaim.[7]He was one of the best-paid actors of the 1990s; films featuring him have grossed over $3.5 billion at the worldwide box-office.[8]In 1992, criticRoger Ebertwrote, "if there is an award for the most unsung leading man of his generation, Kilmer should get it".[9]
Kilmer was born December 31, 1959, in Los Angeles, California,[1]the second of three sons to Gladys Swanette (n√©eEkstadt)[10]and Eugene Dorris Kilmer.[11]His mother was of Swedish descent.[12]His other ancestry includes Irish, German andCherokee roots.[13]His parents divorced in 1968 when he was 8 years old. His mother later married William Bernard Leach in 1970. Kilmer's grandfather was a gold miner inNew Mexico, near the border withArizona.[14]In 1977, Kilmer's younger brother Wesley, who had epilepsy, drowned in a jacuzzi at age 15.[15][16]
He attendedChatsworth High SchoolwithKevin Spacey.[1]His high school girlfriend wasMare Winningham.[17]He became the youngest person at the time to be accepted into theJuilliard School's Drama Division, where he was a member ofGroup 10.[18]
Kilmer declined a role inFrancis Ford Coppola's 1983 filmThe Outsiders, as he had prior theater commitments.[19]In 1983, he appeared off Broadway inThe Slab BoyswithKevin Bacon,Sean Penn, andJackie Earle Haley. That same year, his first off-stage acting role (excluding television commercials) came in the form of an episode ofABC Afterschool SpecialcalledOne Too Many, which was an educational drama on drinking and driving;[20]it also starred a youngMichelle Pfeiffer. Also in 1983, Kilmer self-published a collection of his own poetry entitledMy Edens After Burns,that included poems inspired by his time with Pfeiffer. The book of poems is difficult to obtain and expensive; known second-hand copies cost $300 and up.[21][22][23]
His big break came when he received top billing in the comedy spoof of spy moviesTop Secret!, in which he played an American rock and roll star. Kilmer sang all the songs in the film and released an album under the film character's name, "Nick Rivers".[24]
During a brief hiatus, he backpacked throughout Europe before going on to play the lead character in the 1985 comedyReal Genius. He turned down a role inDavid Lynch'sBlue Velvet[25]before being cast as naval aviator "Iceman" in the action filmTop GunalongsideTom Cruise.Top Gungrossed a total of over $344 million worldwide and made Kilmer a major star.[26]Following roles in the television filmsThe Murders in the Rue MorgueandThe Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains,Kilmer portrayed Madmartigan in the fantasyWillow;he met his future wife, co-starJoanne Whalley, on the film's set. Kilmer starred in theColorado Shakespeare Festivalproduction ofHamletin 1988. In 1989, Kilmer played the lead in bothKill Me Again, again opposite Whalley, and inTNT'sBilly the Kid.
After several delays, directorOliver Stonefinally started production on the filmThe Doors, based on the story ofthe band of the same name.[27]Kilmer spoke with Oliver Stone early on, concerned about what he might want to do with the story because Kilmer did not believe in or want to promote substance abuse. Kilmer sawJim Morrisonas having picked the wrong heroes, who had different issues, which were not part of the creativity or inspiration. Kilmer saw Morrison's story as one that could be told "a thousand different ways" and did not want to tell it by playing the role in the style of drugs, with which Oliver Stone agreed.[citation needed]Kilmer memorized the lyrics to all of lead singer Morrison's songs prior to his audition and sent a video of himself performing some Doors songs to director Stone.[28]Stone was not impressed with the tape, butPaul A. Rothchild(the original producer of the Doors) said "I was shaken by it" and suggested they record Kilmer in the studio. After Kilmer was cast as Morrison, he prepared for the role by attending Doors tribute concerts and reading Morrison's poetry.[29]
He spent close to a year before production dressing in Morrison-like clothes, and spent time at Morrison's old hangouts along theSunset Strip. His portrayal of Morrison was praised and members of the Doors noted that Kilmer did such a convincing job that they had trouble distinguishing his voice from Morrison's.[27]Paul Rothchild played Kilmer's version of "The End" for the band's guitarist,Robby Krieger, who told him, "I'm really glad they got 'The End'. We never got a recording of that live with Jim and now we've got it." However, Doors keyboardistRay Manzarekwas less than enthusiastic with how Morrison was portrayed in Stone's interpretation.[30]
In the early 1990s, Kilmer starred in the mystery thrillerThunderheart, the action comedyThe Real McCoy, and again teamed withTop GundirectorTony Scottto playElvis PresleyinTrue Romance, which was written byQuentin Tarantino. In 1993, Kilmer playedDoc Hollidayin the westernTombstonealongsideKurt Russell. In the film, Doc Holliday performsChopin'sNocturne in E minor, Op.72, No. 1; however, Kilmer does not play the piano and he practiced that one piece for months in preparation.[31]In 1995, Kilmer starred inWings of Courage, a 3DIMAXfilm, and that same year, he starred oppositeAl PacinoandRobert De NiroinHeat, which is now considered one of the best crime/drama films of the 1990s.[32]
In December 1993Batman ForeverdirectorJoel Schumacherhad seenTombstoneand was most impressed with Kilmer's performance asDoc Holliday. Schumacher felt him to be perfect for the role ofBatman, though at the time, the role was stillMichael Keaton's.[33]In July 1994, Keaton decided not to return for a third Batman film after 1992'sBatman Returns,[34]due to "creative differences".[33]William Baldwin(who previously worked with Schumacher onFlatliners) was reported to be a top contender, though just days after Keaton dropped out, Kilmer was cast.[34]Kilmer took the role without even knowing who the new director was and without reading the script.[33]
Released in June 1995,Batman Foreverwas a success at the box office,[35]despite receiving mixed reviews from critics.[36]There was debate about Kilmer's performance: some critics, likeThe New York Times'Janet Maslin, thought Kilmer was a poor successor to Keaton in the part;[37]while others, such asRoger Ebert, had kind words for Kilmer.[38]Batmanco-creatorBob Kanesaid in aCinescapeinterview that of all the actors to have played Batman up to that point, he felt Kilmer had given the best interpretation. Film criticLeonard Maltin(who criticized the dark tone contained inBatman Returns) complimented Kilmer's portrayal when he reviewed the film for his expanding collection of film reviews.[39]Defenders ofBatman Foreverpraised the film for portraying Batman as a more heroic, less ruthless, and more human character than in the Tim Burton films. The film also brought the film interpretation of Bruce Wayne more into line with his comic book counterpart, showing him as a socialite and a very public figure rather than the neurotic recluse of the previous films.
In February 1996, Kilmer decided not to return for another Batman feature film, feeling that Batman was being marginalized in favor of the villains[40]and because of scheduling problems withThe Saint.George Clooneyreplaced Kilmer as Batman in 1997'sBatman & Robin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full¬†list...)
Am√©lie of Leuchtenberg(1812‚Äì1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro¬†I. She was the fourth child ofEug√®ne de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Am√©lie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Am√©liawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Am√©lie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Am√©lie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich D√ºrck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
