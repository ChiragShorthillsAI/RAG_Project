Waltz was born on 4 October 1956 inVienna,[4]the son of Johannes Waltz, a German set designer, and Elisabeth Urbancic, an Austrian costume designer of Austrian and Slovenian descent.[5][6][7]Waltz comes from a family of theatrical heritage: his maternal grandmother wasBurgtheaterand silent film actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather, Emmerich Reimers, and his great-grandfather, Georg Reimers, were both stage actors who also appeared in silent films.[6][8]Waltz's maternal grandfather,Rudolf von Urban, was a psychiatrist ofSlovenedescent[5][a]and a student ofSigmund Freud.[11]Waltz's father died when he was seven years old[6]and his mother later married composer and conductor Alexander Steinbrecher.[12][13]Steinbrecher was previously married to the mother of directorMichael Haneke; as a result, Waltz and Haneke shared the same stepfather.[14]
Waltz had a passion for opera as a youth, having seen his first opera (TurandotwithBirgit Nilssonin the title role) at around the age of ten. As a teenager, Waltz would visit the opera twice a week.[13]He was uninterested in theatre[6]and wished to become an opera singer.[11]After graduating from Vienna'sTheresianum,[6]Waltz went to study acting at the renownedMax Reinhardt Seminar.[15]At the same time, he also studied singing and opera at theUniversity of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, but eventually decided that his voice was not good enough for an opera career.[8][16]In the late 1970s, Waltz spent some time in New York City where he trained withLee StrasbergandStella Adler. He studied script interpretation under Adler and credits his analytical approach to her teaching.[8]
On his return to Europe, Waltz found work as a stage actor, making his debut at theSchauspielhaus Zürich.[17]He also performed in Vienna,Salzburg,CologneandHamburg.[8][11]He became a prolific television actor in the years 1980 to 2000.

InQuentin Tarantino's 2009 filmInglourious Basterds, Waltz portrayedSS-StandartenführerHans Landa, also known as "The Jew Hunter". Clever, courteous, multilingual—but also self-serving, implacable and murderous—the character of Landa was such that Tarantino feared he "might have written a part that was un-playable".[21]Waltz received theBest Actor Awardfor the performance at the2009 Cannes Film Festivaland received acclaim from critics and the public. In 2009, he began sweeping critics' awards circuits, receiving awards for Best Supporting Actor from theNew York Film Critics Circle, theBoston Society of Film Critics,[22]Los Angeles Film Critics Association,[22]as well as Best Supporting Actor awards at theGolden Globesand theScreen Actors Guild Awards.
The following month, he won theBAFTA for Best Supporting Actor,[23]and won theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[24][25]Tarantino acknowledged the importance of Waltz to his film by stating: "I think that Landa is one of the best characters I've ever written and ever will write, and Christoph played it to a tee. It's true that if I couldn't have found someone as good as Christoph I might not have madeInglourious Basterds".[26]
Waltz played gangster Benjamin Chudnofsky inThe Green Hornet(2011); that same year, he starred inWater for ElephantsandRoman Polanski'sCarnage. He played German bounty hunter King Schultz in Quentin Tarantino'sDjango Unchained(2012), a role Tarantino wrote specifically for Waltz.[27]During a training accident prior to filming, Waltz injured his pelvis, though it did not impact his role in the film.[28]His role garnered him acclaim once again, with Waltz winning the Golden Globe, the BAFTA, and ultimately the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Waltz was born in Vienna to an Austrian mother and German father. Upon his birth his German father only requested a citizenship certificate of Germany. Being born to an Austrian mother, Waltz was Austrian by birthright, and formally requested his Austrian citizenship certificate in 2010, thus holding citizenships of both Austria and Germany, but considers the fact that he also has a German passport a "legal, citizenship law banality".[3]Asked whether he felt Viennese, he responded: "I was born in Vienna, grew up in Vienna, went to school in Vienna, graduated in Vienna, studied in Vienna, started acting in Vienna — and there would be a few further Viennese links. How much more Austrian do you want it?"[42]He received American citizenship by naturalization in 2020 noting that he strongly believed "in this old dictum of no taxation without representation" as he was living in Los Angeles since 2010.[43]
Waltz has three children with his former wife, Jacqueline (néeRauch), a dance therapist originally from New York.[44]The two lived in London and their marriage lasted 17 years.[7][8]Waltz married his second wife, German costume designer Judith Holste, with whom he has a daughter.

…There is a quality about Vanessa that makes me feel as if she resides in a netherworld of mystery that eludes the rest of us mortals. Her voice seems to come from some deep place that knows all suffering and all secrets. Watching her work is like seeing through layers of glass, each layer painted in mythic watercolour images, layer after layer, until it becomes dark, but even then you know you haven't come to the bottom of it ... The only other time I had experienced this with an actor was with Marlon Brando ... Like Vanessa, he always seemed to be in another reality, working off some secret, magnetic, inner rhythm.[9]
When Redgrave was nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actressin 1977 for her role inJulia, members of theJewish Defense League(JDL), led by RabbiMeir Kahane, burned effigies of Redgrave and picketed the Academy Awards ceremony to protest against what they saw as her support for thePalestine Liberation Organization.[10][11][12]

In his biography of Redgrave, Dan Callahan wrote, "The scandal of her awards speech and the negative press it occasioned had a destructive effect on her acting opportunities that would last for years to come".[16]

In 1977, Redgrave produced and starred in a controversial[14]documentary film,The Palestinian, about the activities of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).[44]She funded the documentary by selling her house.[11]TheAnti-Defamation League's honorary chairman criticised the film, highlighting that some of the responses of the people she interviews were not translated from Arabic, that the film showed children training with guns and that the phrase, "Kill the enemy!" kept being repeated.[14]The president of Actors Equity in the United States criticised the film's interview with the chairman of the PLO,Yasser Arafat, in which he said that the only solution to the Middle East problem is the liquidation of theState of Israel, and Redgrave responded with, "Certainly".[45]In June 1978, at one theatre showing the film, a bomb exploded, causing damage to property, but screening of the film resumed the following day.[45]Two months later, aJewish Defence Leaguemember was convicted of the bombing and sentenced to a three-month "thorough psychological examination" with the California Youth Authority.[46]In a 2018 interview, Redgrave stood by her acceptance speech (which included the "Zionist hoodlums" remark) during the 1978 Academy Awards ceremony.[47]

In 1980, Redgrave made her American TV debut asconcentration campsurvivorFania Fénelonin theArthur Miller-scripted TV moviePlaying for Time, a part for which she won anEmmyas Outstanding Lead Actress in 1981. The decision to cast Redgrave as Fénelon was, however, a source of controversy. In light of Redgrave's support for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO),[48]Fénelon herself and the Jewish groups theSimon Wiesenthal Center, theAnti-Defamation League, and theAmerican Jewish Congressobjected to Redgrave's casting. RabbiMarvin Hierof the Simon Wiesenthal Center wrote in a telegram that, "Your selection shows utter callous disregard of the tens of thousands of survivors for whom Miss Redgrave's portrayal would desecrate the memory of the martyred millions. Your decision could only be compared to selecting J. Edgar Hoover to portray Martin Luther King Jr." ProducerDavid L. Wolperin a telephone interview compared it to letting the head of theKu Klux Klanplay a sympathetic white man inRoots, a miniseries about the slave trade.[49]Arthur Miller said "She's a Marxist; this is a political matter. Turning her down because of her ideas was unacceptable to me; after all I suffered theblacklistmyself".[16]
In 1984, Redgrave sued theBoston Symphony Orchestra, claiming that the orchestra had fired her from a 1982 performance[50]because of her support of the PLO.[51]Lillian Hellmantestified in court on Redgrave's behalf.[52]Redgrave won on a count ofbreach of contract, but did not win on the claim that the Boston orchestra had violated her civil rights by firing her.[52]

At a press conference, Redgrave said she feared for Zakayev's safety if he were extradited to Russia on terrorism charges. He would "die of a heart attack" or some other mysterious explanation offered by Russia, she said.[53]On 13 November 2003, a London court rejected the Russian government's request for Zakayev's extradition. Instead, the court accepted a plea by lawyers for Zakayev that he would not get a fair trial, and could even face torture, in Russia. "It would be unjust and oppressive to return Mr Zakayev to Russia," Judge Timothy Workman ruled.[54]Due to her support of Zakayev and Chechen independence, she was awarded the Order of Friendship by theChechen government in exilein 2024.[55]
In 2004, Vanessa Redgrave and her brotherCorin Redgravelaunched thePeace and Progress Party, which campaigned against theIraq Warand for human rights.[56]Redgrave left the party in 2005.[citation needed]
Redgrave has been an outspoken critic of the "war on terrorism".[57][58]During a June 2005 interview onLarry King Live, Redgrave was challenged on this criticism and on her political views. In response she questioned whether there can be true democracy if the political leadership of the United States and Britain does not "uphold the values for which my father's generation fought the Nazis, [and] millions of people gave their lives against theSoviet Union's regime. [Such sacrifice was made] because of democracy and what democracy meant: no torture, no camps, no detention forever or without trial.... [Such] techniques are not just alleged [against the governments of the U.S. and Britain], they have actually been written about by theFBI. I don't think it's being 'far left'...to uphold the rule of law."[59]
In March 2006, Redgrave remarked in an interview with US broadcast journalistAmy Goodman: "I don't know of a single government that actually abides by international human rights law, not one, including my own. In fact, [they] violate these laws in the most despicable and obscene way, I would say." Goodman's interview with Redgrave took place in the actress's West London home on the evening of 7 March, and covered a range of subjects, particularly the cancellation by theNew York Theatre Workshopof theAlan RickmanproductionMy Name is Rachel Corrie. Such a development, said Redgrave, was an "act of catastrophic cowardice" as "the essence of life and the essence of theatre is to communicate about lives, either lives that have ended or lives that are still alive, [and about] beliefs, and what is in those beliefs."[60]
In June 2006, she was awarded a lifetime achievement award from theTransilvania International Film Festival, one of whose sponsors is a mining company namedGabriel Resources. She dedicated the award to a community organisation fromRoşia Montană, Romania, which is campaigning against agold minethat Gabriel Resources was seeking to build near the village.

In December 2007, Redgrave was named as one of the possible suretors who paid the £50,000 bail forJamil al-Banna, one of three British residents arrested after landing back in the UK following four years' captivity atGuantanamo Bay. Redgrave has declined to be specific about her financial involvement but said she was "very happy" to be of "some small assistance for Jamil and his wife", adding, "It is a profound honour and I am glad to be alive to be able to do this. Guantanamo Bay is a concentration camp."[62]
In 2009, Redgrave together with artistJulian Schnabeland playwrightMartin Shermanopposed the cultural boycott of Israel in the Toronto Film Festival.[63][64]
In March 2014, Redgrave took part in a protest outsidePentonville Prisonin North London after new prison regulations were introduced which forbade sending books to prisoners.[65]She and fellow actorSamuel West, playwrightDavid HareandPoet LaureateCarol Ann Duffytook turns reading poetry and making speeches. Redgrave stated that the ban was "vicious and deplorable...Literature is something that stirs us beyond our immediate problems, it can help us to learn better our own problems, our own faults or to have a goal to live for, an aspiration."[66]The ban was overturned by theMinistry of Justicethe following December.[67]
In 2017, Redgrave made her directorial debut with the movieSea Sorrow, a documentary about theEuropean migrant crisisand the plight of migrants encamped outsideCalais, France, trying to reach Britain.[19]She has heavily criticised the exclusionary policy of the British government towards refugees, stating that the British Government "... has violated these principles (of theDeclaration of Human Rights), and it continues to do so, which I find deeply shameful. The UN signed the Declaration of Human Rights, and now we have to employ lawyers to take the government to court to force them to obey the law. Just thinking about that makes my mind go berserk."[19]
Redgrave has received anAcademy Award, aBAFTA Award, twoEmmy Awards, aOlivier Award, twoGolden Globe Awards, aScreen Actors Guild Award, and aTony Award.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
