Jeff and Pam McKenzie are trying to sell their house, but have not told their children, Abby and Chris. Jeff has lost his job and Pam's salary is not enough to keep their home. To make matters worse, Jeff's obnoxious and successful brother Hunter, his wife, Mei, and their son Ollie have decided to stay with them for Christmas.
During an open house, Max Mercer and his mother Carol stop by to use the restroom. Max has a brief exchange with Jeff, during which the latter reveals a box of old dolls, including a malformed one with an upside down face. Carol explains to Jeff that dolls with unusual deformities are rare and worth a lot of money. As Max and Carol return home, the whole family is preparing to leave forTokyo, Japan, for the holidays, with Carol leaving earlier than the rest. Max, annoyed with the fuss, settles in the garage-parked car to watch cartoons and accidentally falls asleep. Unfortunately, Max's family do not realize that their son was sleeping in the car parked in the garage and left him at home, thinking he was in another vehicle with one of the rest of the members.
Concerned about losing their home, Jeff goes to get the doll only to find it is missing. Believing that Max stole it, he locates the Mercer household the next day only to find the whole family hastily leaving. During the commotion, he overhears the security code and sees where the house key is hidden. Telling Pam about it, they agree to get the doll back at night.
Meanwhile, Max discovers the whole family has left and initially has fun, though he quickly grows bored and misses them. Meanwhile, Jeff and Pam arrive at the Mercer's and get inside. Overhearing them talk about getting an "ugly little boy", Max assumes they are talking about kidnapping and selling him. He attempts to scare them away by calling the police. Officer Buzz McCallister (The same Buzz from the first and second films) arrives, but Pam diverts him. Max fears if Officer McCallister realizes he is home alone, his parents may get arrested.
Carol discovers Max was left behind and buys a ticket to head back. The McKenzies go to church the next day and run into their realtor. He tells them there is a buyer, but they must decide by the end of the year, which puts extensive pressure on them. Max arrives and unknowingly converses with Jeff and Pam's son Chris who sympathetically gives him his water gun. The couple spot Max talking with someone and assume she is his grandmother. They resolve to break into the house once again while their family is still at church.
Sneaking around the back of the house, Jeff and Pam end up in the neighbor's backyard instead. Max overhears them once again, with Jeff agreeing to arrive dressed as Santa in an effort to fool him. Max responds by booby-trapping the house to cause difficulty and prevent them from getting close to himself while Jeff and Pam wait for their family to fall asleep on Christmas Eve. The couple fall into Max's traps, during which they discover that Max did not steal the doll, but instead a can of soda. They clear up the misunderstanding, but learn Max is home alone and agree to let him stay with them until his mother returns.
As they explain the whole situation to their family, it turns out that Ollie stole the doll and managed to safely retrieve it, thus ensuring that the McKenzies can stay. Carol arrives to pick up Max. Having moved into their house only two months ago, Carol finds friends in the McKenzies and thanks them for taking care of Max.
One year later, the Mercers and McKenzies have Christmas dinner together. Jeff has gotten a new job and willingly gives Max the soda he craved the year prior.

The site's critical consensus reads, "Nobody'sHome."[18]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[19]
Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiangave the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: "Home Sweet Home Aloneis a surprisingly entertaining, if wholly unnecessary, sequel, a tangerine where we expected to find a lump of coal."[20]Jennifer Green ofCommon Sense Mediaalso gave it 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: "By this point, after no fewer than five previous features in the franchise,Home Sweet Home Alonemight not have much new to offer. But the characters here have a wholesomeness to them that was missing in some of the earlier films."[21]Aditya Mani Jha ofFirstpostrated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: "Overall,Home Sweet Home Aloneis a competently mounted but unambitious film. At times, it plays like a showreel from its source material, and the makers are okay with it being that way. This makes it efficient in the blockbuster sense, but even its keenest backers will find it difficult to remember too many of the film’s all-new scenarios or one-liners after the end credits roll."[22]Adam Graham ofThe Detroit Newsgave it a grade of B− and wrote: "Home Sweet Home Aloneholds its own, a new spin on an old tale that keeps the spirit of the original alive."[23]
CNN's Brian Lowry wrote that the film "is a very odd duck -- a movie that basically replicates the three-decades-old "Home Alone" template, but in a way that feels slightly weird and ill-conceived."[24]Tim Robey ofThe Daily Telegraphgave the film 2 out of 5 stars, writing: "Don't expect a Christmas miracle, then: it's more like a box of Quality Street that got heavily plundered before the wrapping went on."[25]Clarisse Loughrey ofThe Independentgave the film 1 out of 5 stars, writing: "Home Sweet Home Alonedecides, somewhat arbitrarily, to switch everything up – the kid is now an utter arsehole while the burglars are sympathetic, which results in the audience rooting for criminals while really just hoping that everyone would quit it and go to sleep."[26]Kevin MaherofThe Timesalso gave the film 1 out of 5 stars, writing that "everything that happens before the mayhem — the burglary begins after a full hour of padding — is excruciatingly forced."[27]Jake Wilson ofThe Agealso gave 1 out of 5 stars, writing: "This is less an actual movie than a lazy approximation, half-heartedly monkeying with formula while showing no understanding of why that formula ever worked at all."[28]
Chris Columbus, the original director of the first twoHome Alonefilms was also critical of the decision to make a sixth movie, prior to the release of the film.[29]On the topic of movie remakes, he said, "In this version of Hollywood that we live in, everybody is remaking everything, and rebooting everything. I mean, there's aHome Alonereboot coming out... What's the point? The movie exists, let's just live with the movie that existed. There's no point in any of us remakingThe Wizard of Oz, there's no point in any of us remaking the classic films. Make something original, because we need more original material."[30][31]
Mikey Day andStreeter Seidellwere among the screenwriters honored during theMill Valley Film Festivalfor their contribution to the film.[32][33]
In December 2024, during a Q&A event, whenMacaulay Culkinwas asked if he would ever appear in anotherHome Alonesequel, he stated that he'd needed to get a good script, but joked that there's no way any potential script could be worse than the one for this film.[34]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
