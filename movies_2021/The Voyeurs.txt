Greg Gilreath and Adam Hendricks serve as producers under theirDivide/Conquerbanner.

A young couple, Pippa and Thomas, move into their first apartment together inMontreal. They soon realize they can look directly into the apartment across the street, where a man with a professional studio is taking photographs of a woman. Pippa and Thomas watch as the couple have sex. They jokingly give their neighbors pseudonyms, Margot and Brent.
Pippa, who works as a trainee optometrist at L'Optique, receives abird feederfrom her boss as a housewarming gift. Pippa buys a pair of binoculars so she and Thomas can watch the couple. They often see "Brent" having sex with models while "Margot" is out.
Pippa expresses interest in knowing what the neighbors are saying and learns that Thomas knowsa wayto listen in on another room using alaser pointer; the process requires a reflective surface to send the laser beam back to them. When "Brent" and "Margot" throw a Halloween costume party in their apartment, Pippa and Thomas sneak in by posing as guests. Pippa plants a mirror in the apartment, later allowing her and Thomas to listen in on their conversations. They are unsettled to hear "Margot" confront "Brent" about his adultery; "Brent" assaults "Margot" and rebukes her for her suspicions.
The next day, "Margot", whose real name is Julia, visits L'Optique, where she receives an eye exam from Pippa and orders a new set of glasses recommended by her. Julia invites Pippa to hang out. Pippa wants to warn Julia about "Brent's" adultery, but Thomas insists that she stop spying on them. Later, Pippa and Julia meet at a spa; Julia reveals that her husband is named Sebastian, or Seb, and is a well-known photographer.
Pippa observes Seb having a threesome and throwing a condom away afterwards. She later discovers how to access Julia and Seb's wireless printer, which she uses to anonymously expose Seb's infidelities to Julia, mentioning the condom as proof. Thomas angrily confronts Pippa about being so invested in Julia's and Seb's lives. The next morning, Pippa apologizes to Thomas and promises to stop watching the neighbors. However, they see Seb discover Julia's body in the bathroom after she seemingly slit her own throat. Thomas blames Pippa for Julia's death, breaks up with her, and leaves.
Though heartbroken, Pippa continues to watch Seb and one evening follows him to a nearby pub. Seb sits by Pippa and they talk. He persuades her to pose nude for him at his apartment and they have sex. Upon returning home, Thomas consumes part of a drink Pippa left in the refrigerator and pours the rest into her bird feeder. He notices Pippa having sex with Seb across the street. The next morning, a horrified Pippa finds Thomas dead in their apartment, having apparently hanged himself.
Pippa and her friend Ari attend Seb's exhibition, which turns out to be a collaboration with Julia, who is alive. Pippa and Thomas are revealed to be the subjects of the exhibition. Seb and Julia divulge that they own the apartment rented by Pippa and Thomas (whose lease included a clause stating that they consented to be photographed) and knew they were being watched. Distressed, Pippa storms off, finds Seb's studio above her apartment, and trashes it. As she moves out, she notices dead birds on a grate just below her bird feeder.
Following an interview promoting their exhibition, Seb and Julia return home to find a congratulatory bottle of wine by their door. As they drink the wine, Pippa sends a message to their printer saying she knows they killed Thomas. They see her spying on them from the rooftop and chase her into L'Optique, where she tells them she deduced that while she was having sex with Seb, Julia drugged Thomas's drink and staged his suicide. Pippa also reveals that she spiked their wine, causing Julia and Seb to faint. Pippa places the two under aLASIKmachine, using it to burn their corneas.
A new couple, two men, have moved into Pippa and Thomas's former apartment. They observe Seb and Julia in their apartment, both of whom are now blind. Pippa watches Seb and Julia from the rooftop before leaving her binoculars behind.

The Voyeurswas released on September 10, 2021, on theAmazon Prime Videostreaming service.[5]This film's streaming performance had exceeded Amazon Studios' expectations.[6]
The film received mixed reviews from critics, who compared it unfavorably to its forebears in the voyeuristic thriller genre, such asRear Window(1954) andBody Double(1984). OnRotten Tomatoes,The Voyeursholds a 45% approval rating based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10.[7]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[8]
In a negative review for theChicago Sun-Times,Richard RoeperdescribedThe Voyeursas a "salacious and wildly implausible story that holds our interest for a while before flying off the cliff and into an abyss of creepy, ludicrous and ultimately ridiculous twists and turns".[9]Nick Schager ofVarietywas also critical of the film, which he found "plays like rehashed leftovers cooked up for young viewers who've never seen any of its superior inspirations", such as Hitchcock'sRear Window(1954).[10]In theSan Francisco Chronicle, G. Allen Johnson felt Michael Mohan's script was "pedestrian" and unfavorably compared his direction to that ofDavid LynchandBrian De Palma. "One suspects they would have a bit more fun and taken us further down the moral rabbit hole," Johnson explained, "And the sex would have been better too."[11]
On the other hand, Charles Bramesco ofThe Guardianwas more appreciative ofThe Voyeurs. In a four-out-of-five star review, he wrote that the film was "the real deal, an ideal cocktail of funny, diabolical and perverted", and a timely update ofRear Window. "At last, an homage that dares to ask," Bramesco quipped, "what ifGrace Kellyhad been able to give the wheelchair-boundJimmy Stewarta hand job the first time they both looked in on his neighbours across the way?"[12]
