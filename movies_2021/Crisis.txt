Teenage drug runner Cedric Beauville is captured and arrested by theRoyal Canadian Mounted Policeon theCanadaâ€“United States borderin possession of large quantities of illegalfentanylpills.
Everett University research scientist Dr. Tyrone Brower is contracted by Northlight Pharmaceuticals to carry out a study in support of their newest product, Klaralon. The drug is being touted as the first non-addictive painkiller and is due to be released shortly as a replacement forOxycodone. The study uncovers concerning results; Klaralon initially presents as non-addictive when taken daily for the first 7 days (parameters specified by Northlight), however after 7 days it becomes almost three times more addictive than Oxycodone. Realising the public health implications, Brower recommends to Northlight they delay Klaralon's release for further testing, which they object to. Board member Dr. Bill Simons tries to tempt Brower into changing his mind by offering a large research grant, but Brower refuses. With Northlight being one of the university's main donors, Brower finds himself under pressure from department head Greg Talbot to approve the study, but again is reluctant. Northlight begins leaking information to discredit his reputation, and Everett University revokes histenure. Desperate, Brower contacts theFDA, being put in contact with investigator Ben Walker.
DetroitbasedDEAagent Jake Kelly has managed to infiltrate two large scale drug cartels runningfentanyl. One is run by theArmenian Mafiawho operatepill millsacross the US. The other is based inMontreal, Quebeccontrolled by drug kingpin Claude 'Mother' Veroche, who operates out of a nondescript restaurant called La Marina. Kelly intends to convince the two cartels to enter into business, so both leaders can be arrested at once when they meet. Kelly has personal motivation for bringing them down, due to his younger sister suffering from cripplingheroinaddiction. Kelly's relationship with Mother becomes strained when news of Cedric's capture comes to light, with Mother becoming concerned there is aninformantin his organisation. Due to funding concerns, Kelly's superior agent Garrett gives him a reduced timescale to organise the meet. Mother has Cedric killed in custody for his silence, and executes his second in command Guy Broussard after discovering he has been speaking with the authorities.
Architect and recovering Oxycodone addict Claire Reimann becomes concerned when her 16-year-old son David does not return home from hockey practice. He is later found dead as a result of a fentanyl overdose, shocking Claire who is convinced he never took drugs. Although theDetroit Police Departmenttreats it as an accidental death, she hires aprivate investigatorwho determines David was forced to take the fentanyl and was murdered. Through her son'ssocial mediaaccounts, she tracks down one of his friends, who confesses several teenagers from the hockey team (from both Detroit andMontreal) work for Mother as drug runners, although David had only done it once. Claire crosses theAmbassador Bridgeand travels to Montreal where she hires another private investigator, who provides her with information on Mother and aprivately made firearm. She threatens another drug runner, Derrick Millebran, who believes that Mother is killing them to tie up loose ends after Cedric's arrest. Kelly becomes aware of Claire's activities through investigation of Cedric's associates, and intercepts her outside La Marina. He does not arrest her, but instead unloads her gun and urges her to leave for her own good.
The meeting between the two cartels goes ahead, covertly monitored by a jointDEA-RCMPtaskforce. However, an RCMP surveillance officer accidentally gives away his position, resulting in a shootout that kills Kelly's partner, Special Agent Stanley Foster. Mother also escapes, believed to have fled toAlgeria. Given the seizure of the drugs at the meet, both US and Canadian agencies decide to disband the continued search for Mother and the Armenians. Outraged, Kelly goes against orders and travels to La Marina, where he threatens an employee who tells him Mother is still in Canada but is planning to escape viaseaplanethat evening from thePort of Montreal. Claire is also given this information by her private investigator. Kelly arrives at the port, but has been beaten there by Claire, who opens fire and kills Mother. His bodyguard shoots her in the arm, but is swiftly shot by Kelly. He then replaces the men's weapons with Claire's privately made firearm and his own unregistered back up gun, to make it appear they shot each other. He treats her gunshot wound, and tells her he does not intend to arrest her.
A last-ditch effort by Northlight, CEO Dr. Meg Holmes also fails to convince Brower to come on board, and the company is subjected to an FDA hearing. To Brower's shock, the agency does not revoke Northlight's permissions for Klaralon's release, noting that the potential benefits to the public outweigh the dangers highlighted by his study. Walker is also reassigned as a retaliatory measure. Despite the legal risk, Brower breaks hisnon-disclosureagreement and goes to the press. He is later hired by theUniversity of Michigan, and is seen giving an introductory lecture to a crowded auditorium.

The film divided critics and audiences and has generated controversy surrounding its reviews.
Critics rated the film less positively at first, although with time its score has risen. On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 66% of 166 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "With its serious-minded story,Crisisaims higher than many crime thrillers -- but uneven acting and a spotty script mean the end result falls short of its goals."[16]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 41 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[17]
Advance reviews for the film were very positive.Variety's Marc Malkin wrote that the film is "intense and timely [...] with exceptional performances, fine storytelling, and master craftsmanship."KTLA's Scott Mantz wrote that the film is "riveting, gripping, and provocative. A terrific thriller with superb performances across the board," while WOR's Joe Neumaier described the film as "a multilayered dramatic thriller that tackles every vicious part of the opioid emergency. Gary Oldman, Armie Hammer, and Evangeline Lilly deliver urgent, powerful turns in this finely crafted film that is impressively up-to-the-minute."
After the release of these quotes, one of the film's lead actors, Armie Hammer, was publicly embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal.[18]
Upon general release, much sentiment for the film outside of some major outlets likeVarietyandDeadlinewas markedly negative. Peter DeBruge ofVarietygave the film a positive review, noting thatCrisiswas "compelling, relevant filmmaking... [with] no shortage of engaging and/or wrenching material..." while Pete Hammond ofDeadlinewrote that "Crisiscomes along at the right time... Oldman and Lily are excellent, and Hammer is very fine as well."
Many other critics were negative, noting the film's similarity toSteven Soderbergh'sTraffic, with John DeFore ofThe Hollywood Reporterdescribing the film as "Well-meaning but underwhelming."[19]
Jeffrey Wells ofHollywood Elsewheresuggested that critics were attacking the film as "easy pickings" because of Hammer's personal controversy. In the column, Wells wrote: "In a fair and just world [...]Crisis[...] would have cruised through to, say, an 82% score. IsCrisisas good as Steven Soderbergh'sTraffic? No, but it's smart and well-assembled [...] It's Armie Hammer. I know it's Armie Hammer. The bastards are figuring 'okay, the industry is giving him the temporary boot so I can trash this all I want and nobody will say anything.'"[20]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (FullÂ list...)
AmÃ©lie of Leuchtenberg(1812â€“1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor PedroÂ I. She was the fourth child ofEugÃ¨ne de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with AmÃ©lie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria AmÃ©liawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and AmÃ©lie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of AmÃ©lie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich DÃ¼rck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
