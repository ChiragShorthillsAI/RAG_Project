It received a limited theatrical release in the United States on February 12, 2021, byLionsgate.
17-year-old Rain Burroughs suffers from early on-set schizophrenia and is admitted to hospital following a psychotic episode. She later reveals to her therapist that she has not been taking her medication as it interferes with her ability to paint.
Her mother Michelle and father John are both very supportive, but when Rain returns to school, she is disowned by her friends who make fun of her mental illness. However a new boy, Caleb, notices her and they begin hanging out.
One night while having a bad dream, Rain sees a vision of her teacher Ms McConnell (also her next-door neighbour) dancing with a small child. She wakes up and looks through her bedroom window into her attic window, and sees the girl quickly snatched from view. The next morning, Rain and John visit Ms McConnell's and she allows them to search the attic. They find nothing but dolls and mannequins that she claims belonged to her late grandmother. Rain tells Caleb what she saw and he believes her. They later break into her home to find the girl, but they are unsuccessful.
Rain and Caleb search for missing children online and find a missing girl called Malia who Rain says looks just like the girl she saw in the attic. He later learns of Rain's illness and she opens up to him. Michelle starts to question if Caleb is real, or if he is a figment of Rain's imagination.
Rain and Caleb attempt to search Ms McConnell's home again but she hears them break a window and calls the police. When John finds out, he gets angry and confronts Rain, insisting she take a dose of her meds. She taunts him by shoving several of her pills in her mouth. When he tries to force her to spit them out, she bites his finger, and he slaps her.
The following evening, Rain and Caleb kiss for the first time in her living room. Michelle surprises them, confirming to Rain that he is real, but then he leaves abruptly. The next day at school, she sees Caleb is absent and believes she actually invented him in her mind. Rain goes to see her therapist but she is not in her office. She then returns home where she suffers a mental breakdown. Michelle tries to comfort her but Rain lashes out. John then reveals Michelle died three years ago and her presence since then has been Rain's imagination.
Hysterical, Rain breaks into Ms McConnell’s home again and makes a further investigation of the attic. She has a vision of her mother and converses with her spirit. Ms McConnell arrives home and sits down to eat dinner. As Rain tries to sneak out, she sees that the basement door is now locked, but she is able to steal the keys and unlock the door.
Rain finds Malia locked in a cage in the basement. When they hear Ms McConnell come down to investigate, she hides in the cage with the little girl. Ms McConnell tells Rain she wants to help her, will not report her to the police, and that Malia is not real. Rain does not know what to believe, but at that moment, Caleb appears and subdues Ms McConnell, giving the girls a chance to escape.
John arrives and confirms to Rain that Malia is real, and that she was right all along. Caleb then emerges from the garage and is also confirmed to be real.
Weeks later, Rain is recovering; new medication is working and she has stopped having as many hallucinations. She and John visit Michelle's grave. Later, as Rain is falling asleep in her room, a vision of Michelle sleeps beside her, reassuring her that her mother is forever with her in her memory.
Principal photography began in April 2019 inTampa, Florida, andSt. Petersburg, Florida.[3][4][5]In November 2019, it was announced that the film was in post-production.[6]
It was filmed under the titleI Saw a Man with Yellow Eyes.[7]
The film was released on February 12, 2021, in selected theaters and digitally. It grossed at least $170,000 domestically after three weekends, after playing at 120 theaters.[8][9]
It was released on DVD on February 16, 2021.[10][11]
The film has an approval rating of 50% onRotten Tomatoesbased on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10.[12]
Cath Clarke, writing forThe Guardian, gave the film a score of 3 stars out of 5, saying that it, "combin[es] a well-intentioned drama about teenage mental illness with a lurid potboiler," though praisedEugenie Bondurant's performance, describing it as "creepy" and "the highlight of the film." She concluded, "Fear of Rainwon’t be winning any awards for mental health awareness with its silly hash of psychology, packaging up illness to fit the schlock’n’shock of the story. But there are a couple of ludicrous twists at the end that make it very watchable."[13]
Noel Murray, writing for theLos Angeles Times, praised the cast performances and said that Rain is "legitimately characterized as a person with schizophrenia, persistently plagued by voices and visions," but wrote, "Landon struggles to generate much tension from her plot, which frequently feels contrived. The story jerks its protagonist (and its audience) through several dark and heartbreaking moments, before inevitably landing on a final confrontation with an outcome that’s not too hard to predict". He concluded: "This is ultimately a nuanced character study, awkwardly wedged into a run-of-the-mill genre picture."[14]
David Robb ofSlant Magazinegave the film a score of 1 star out of 4, saying that the film portraysmental illness"with all the nuance and insight ofJared LetoinSuicide Squad," and described its approach as being "too cloying and condescending to even be enjoyed as exploitation."[15]

In 2005, Heigl was cast in what would become her highest-profile role to date, as medical internDr. Isobel "Izzie" Stevenson theABCmedical dramaGrey's Anatomy. The show, initially amid-season replacement, became a huge ratings success and one of the highest-rated series on broadcast TV.

A year later, Heigl was nominated for theGolden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries, or Television Filmfor her work onGrey's Anatomy.
Heigl also starred inZyzzyx Road; filmed in 2004 and not released until 2006; it has been cited as the lowest-grossing feature film of all time.[20]
In 2007, Heigl had her high-profile film breakthrough withKnocked Up(2007), a comedy from writer/directorJudd Apatow, oppositeSeth Rogen,Paul Rudd, and Apatow's wife,Leslie Mann. Upon its June 2007 theatrical release, the film received generally positive reviews from critics and proved to be a box office success and a summer romcom hit. The fees Heigl commanded increased after the film's success. The movie grossed $148,761,765 in the U.S., for which she earned a salary of US$300,000.[21]Heigl's role in the film transformed her into Hollywood's new "It girl" according toVanity Fair.[22]
On September 16, 2007, Heigl won thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Seriesfor her role as Izzie Stevens onGrey's Anatomy. In her acceptance speech, she said that even her mother didn't think she would win. When her name was called for the award, her exclamation of "Shit!" wascensored.[23]
Heigl starred withJames Marsdenin the film27 Dresses, for which she received US$6 million.[21]TheNew York Postexpressed some disappointment with the mismatch of Heigl's talent and the film's "chick-flick" triviality, suggesting Heigl might be more compatible "with female directors such asKimberly Peirce(Boys Don't Cry) orTamara Jenkins(The Savages)...".[24]Heigl was announced the Most Desirable Woman of 2008, according toAskMen.[25]Anne Fletcher, the director of27 Dressesdescribed her as having the "‘It’ factor". She explained further, "You can't buy it; you can't learn it; you can't create it; it just is. We haven't had one of her in many years.Julia Roberts,Sandra Bullock,Meg Ryan— those have been our go-to girls for romantic comedy for a very long time, but we haven't had a new one. Katie has beauty, vulnerability, identifiability. She's funny, charming, lovely to watch. Her slightest eye movement is captivating; you know instantly what's going on."[22]
In a highly publicizedVanity Fairinterview, Heigl admitted that though she enjoyed working with Apatow and Rogen when she starred inKnocked Up, she had a hard time enjoying the film itself. She called the film "a little sexist", claiming that the film "paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys."[26]Apatow and Rogen were reportedly not pleased with Heigl's interview, as Rogen said that he enjoyed working with Heigl and was stung by her comments.[27][28]Heigl's comments generated a widespread reaction in the media.[29][30]In an interview withPeoplemagazine, Heigl said:
My motive was to encourage other women like myself to not take that element of the movie too seriously, and to remember that it's a broad comedy"; and added, "Although I stand behind my opinion, I'm disheartened that it has become the focus of my experience with the movie."[31]
There was some speculation that Heigl might be leavingGrey's Anatomyafter the end of itsfifth season. This speculation revolved around her refusal to submit her name for Emmy consideration for the previous season.[32]Heigl had disagreements with the character's direction in the fourth season, deeming the storyline involving Izzie's affair with George a "ratings ploy" that served to be "shocking"[26]and others speculated she would leave due to the time devotion in producing a film version ofCarolyn Jessop's bookEscape.[33][34][35][36]Heigl said publicly that she'd opted out of the Emmy race that year because she felt the material she'd received didn't warrant Emmy consideration.[37]The comment reportedly angered the show's producers and writers, who interpreted it as a slight on their work.Grey'sshowrunnerShonda Rhimessaid she was not insulted by Heigl's Emmy withdrawal, and noted that Heigl's character was downplayed during the season because Heigl had asked for a lighter work schedule.[38]Despite Heigl's reported displeasure with the previous season, and persistent rumors that her character had died, ABC confirmed that Heigl would return for the sixth season ofGrey's.[39][40][41][42]
Heigl starred withGerard ButlerinThe Ugly Truth(2009).[43]The film was made on a budget of $38 million and earned $205 million at the worldwide box office.[44]
Speculation as to whether Heigl would leaveGrey's Anatomypersisted through most of season six.[45]On March 11, 2010, Heigl reportedly did not show up for work on the show, and Heigl and series creatorShonda Rhimessubsequently reached an agreement to immediately release Heigl from her contract. As a result, Heigl's appearance on the January 21 episode ofGrey's Anatomywas her final appearance of that season and, thus far, in the series. Heigl said that she left the show to focus not on her film career, but on her family.[46][47][48]The backlash over Heigl's comments onKnocked UpandGrey's Anatomyhas given Heigl a reputation of being difficult to work with which was seen to have damaged her career.[27]
In June 2010, Heigl starred in the Lionsgate comedy-thrillerKillers, withAshton Kutcher. She next starred in and produced the big-screen dramaLife As We Know It, directed byGreg Berlanti, which revolved around a woman and a man whose respective best friends die in a car accident. Following the deaths, they begin to share in caring for their late friends' orphaned daughter. Heigl received $12 million for both films.[49]
In 2011, Heigl appeared in the ensemble romantic comedyNew Year's Eve, directed byGarry Marshall. Despite being a commercial success, grossing over $142 million worldwide,[50]the film received generally negative reviews.[51]Heigl next had the lead role inOne for the Money(2012). Based on a series of novels[52]byJanet Evanovich, the film's lead character is Stephanie Plum, a bounty hunter working for a bonding company. The film was a financial failure, grossing just over $36 million worldwide against its production budget of $40 million.[53]For her performance, Heigl received aGolden Raspberry Awardnomination for Worst Actress.[54]
In January 2012, Heigl disclosed her enthusiastic desires to reprise her role onGrey's Anatomyand wrap up Izzie's storyline, conceiving an idea of her success in another hospital after floundering in the fictional Seattle Grace hospital where she was 'one step behind the eight ball'. She admitted to regretting leaving the show.[55][56]She complimented the great work environment and family dynamic of the cast but also stated, "I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of storylines going on there."[57]
In 2013, she appeared alongsideRobert De Niro,Susan SarandonandDiane KeatoninThe Big Wedding, a comedy about an estranged family reuniting for a ceremony. A very poor critical and commercial reception greeted the film upon its release—it holds a 7% rating on film review aggregatorRotten Tomatoesand only made US$7.5 million in its opening weekend[58][59]—and for her role, Heigl was nominated for Worst Supporting Actress at the34th Golden Raspberry Awards. In June 2013, she began appearing in a television commercial for Vicks'ZzzQuil.[60]
In 2014, Heigl admitted toMarie Clairemagazine that while she loves romantic comedies and was "so stoked to be doing them", she "hit it a little too hard," professing "I couldn't say no. There's nothing wrong with them, but maybe I overloaded my audience. I should have done a superhero movie or a psychological thriller."[61]During this period of time, Heigl broke away from her conventional romcom roles, pursuing romantic dramas, doing voiceover work, dark comedies and returning to dramatic television.
Heigl starred in the romantic dramaJackie & Ryan(2014), oppositeBen Barnes, portraying a recent single mom battling to hold onto her daughter and the love interest of a modern-day train hopper. The film was released in alimited releaseand throughvideo on demandbyEntertainment Onein the United States.[62]She also voice-acted the squirrel Andie in the animated filmThe Nut Job[63]which was released on January 17, 2014. She reprised her role in its 2017 sequel,The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Naturewhich was released theatrically on August 11, 2017.[64]
She next starred as a rejected and jealous housewife in the dark comedyHome Sweet Hell(2015), alongsidePatrick WilsonandJordana Brewster. Released for VOD and a limited theatrical run in North America, the film received largely negative reviews.[65]Varietywrote in its verdict: "Considering how often [Heigl] has been slammed for not being just another docile, eager-to-please female celebrity, it's hard not to suspect that she might have relished the chance to play an unapologetically ball-busting shrew—a grotesquely exaggerated version of a stereotype she's been assigned many times over. Indeed, Heigl's performance as a coolly murderous model housewife is the only real reason to even consider watchingHome Sweet Hell,an otherwise flailing and risible tale of adultery, extortion and suburban malaise that suggests a poor woman'sGone Girl".[66]She received aGolden Raspberry Awardnomination forWorst Actress.
In 2015, Heigl starred as the titular role in the independent filmJenny's Wedding, about a woman who finally decides to get married, but her choice of partner tears her conventional family apart. AnIndiegogocampaign was later launched to help raise money for post-production costs, and like Heigl's previous few projects, the film was distributed for a VOD and limited release in certain parts of the United States only.[67]
She starred oppositeRosario DawsonandGeoff Stultsin the erotic thrillerUnforgettable(2017), portraying a divorcée who torments the new fiancée of her ex-husband. The film was her firstwide releasein three years; it garnered mediocre reviews and grossed a paltry US$4.7 million in its opening weekend.[68]Nevertheless,The Globe and Mailremarked that "Heigl works overtime to humanize the resentful mom—her face is like an old-fashioned cash register with the prices popping up—but she's more fun to watch as the story grows ugly and violent, and she unleashes the demon within".[69]
Heigl's lead roles in the 2014–15NBCpolitical drama seriesState of Affairs[70][71]andCBS2017 legal dramaDoubtwere both cancelled after one season.[72]However, unlikeState of Affairs,Doubtpremiered to what was described as "tepid" ratings byThe Hollywood Reporter, and CBS announced its cancellation after just two episodes, later burning out its episodes.[73]
Heigl returned to form when she was cast in theUSA Networklegal dramaseriesSuits, playing the role of Samantha Wheeler, a new partner at the fictional law firm of Zane Specter Litt.[74]Heigl remained on the show for its final two seasons.
Heigl was later cast in the leading role oppositeSarah ChalkeandBen Lawsonfor the Netflix showFirefly Lane, released in 2021. Heigl is also executive producer. The series was a success and renewed for a second season. Also that year, Heigl co-starred inFear of Rain, a psychological thriller written and directed by Castille Landon.[75]Harry Connick Jr.,Madison IsemanandIsrael Broussardcompleted the cast. In December 2020, it was announced that Heigl will star and executive produce again with the limited seriesWoodhull. She is set to portray the first female candidate for the presidency of the United States,Victoria Woodhull.[76]
In January 2021, Heigl declared in an interview withThe Washington PostpromotingFirefly Lanethat she was "done apologizing" for her past reputation and criticized being labelled as "difficult" in the late 2000s and early 2010s. She also acknowledged how it may have impacted her career. Her27 Dressesco-starJames Marsdendefended the actress' "courage" and "strong convictions" and remarked unsurprise at her career expanding role in executive production.[77]In September 2021, she endorsed theIATSEstrike and remarked heavy criticism for speaking up about the harsh working conditions on the set ofGrey's Anatomythat the crew endured, while also commenting on health and safety failures in long-hour productions.[78]In 2022, her former co-starEllen Pompeostated in a podcast that Heigl would have been branded a "hero" today for her 2009 remarks about their 17-hour workday. She further stated, "But she’s ahead of her time, made a statement about our crazy hours and of course, [it was like] ‘Let’s slam a woman and call her ungrateful.'"[79]
In the summer of 2023, Heigl and her former co-star Ellen Pompeo reunited atVariety Studio: Actors on Actors, where they talked about their time on Grey's Anatomy and Heigl's departure from the show, among other things. Heigl said: “I was so naive. I got on my soapbox, and I had some things to say, and I felt really passionate about this stuff. I felt really strong. I felt so strongly that I also got a megaphone out on my soapbox. There was no part of me that imagined a bad reaction. I felt really justified in how I felt about it and where I was coming from. I've spent most of my life — I think most women do — being in that people-pleasing mode. It's really disconcerting when you feel like you have really displeased everybody. It was not my intention to do so, but I had some things to say, and I didn’t think I was going to get such a strong reaction.” Pompeo responded: “You know what I love? There are two roles women fit into, victim or villain. And the women who are victims are only victims because they don't have the guts to be the villain."[80]
In January 2024, Heigl joined her former Grey's Anatomy colleaguesEllen Pompeo,Chandra Wilson,Justin ChambersandJames Pickens Jr.at the75th Primetime Emmy Awardsto present the award forOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.[81]

In June 2006, Heigl became engaged to singerJosh Kelley, whom she had met a year earlier on the set of his music video for "Only You".[83]They chose not to live together before they were married, with Heigl later explaining, "I think I just wanted to save something for the actual marriage... I wanted there to be something to make the actual marriage different than the dating or the courtship."[84]They were married on December 23, 2007, inPark City, Utah. They live with their children inOakley, Utah.[85]
In September 2009, the couple adopted a daughter from South Korea, the birthplace of Heigl's sister Meg.[86]She was born with a heart defect and underwent open-heart surgery before leaving South Korea.[87]In April 2012, Kelley and Heigl adopted a second daughter from the U.S.[88][89]In June 2016, the couple announced that they were expecting their third child.[90][91]Heigl gave birth to a son on December 20, 2016.[92]

She gave a grant to Best Friends to fund a year of the program.[93]Heigl and her mother, Nancy, started Heigl's Hounds of Hope, which operates as part of the Jason Debus Heigl Foundation.
