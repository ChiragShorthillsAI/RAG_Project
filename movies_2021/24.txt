When Mirabel learns that the family is losing their magic, she sets out to find out why and save the family and house.
Encantopremiered at theEl Capitan TheatreinHollywood, Los Angeles, on November 3, 2021, and was released in the United States on November 24 over a 30-day theatrical run. It was also released inRealD 3D,Dolby Cinema, 2D andD-BOXformats. Despite underperformance at the box office, grossing $261.3 million worldwide against a $120–150 million budget, it was a ratings success after its release onDisney+on December 24, 2021. The film received acclaim for its characterization, music, animation, voice acting, emotional depth, and cultural fidelity; reviews namedmagic realismandtransgenerational traumaas the film's core concepts. Publications have describedEncantoas a cultural phenomenon, and executives had begun referring to it as a "franchise" within a year of release.[6]The film was nominated for three awards at the94th Academy Awards, winningBest Animated Feature, and receivednumerous other accolades, including theGolden Globe Award for Best Animated Featureand theBAFTA Award for Best Animated Film.
The film's associated merchandise has seen significant success, and itssoundtrackbecame a breakout sensation, reaching number one on the USBillboard200and UKCompilation Albumscharts; "We Don't Talk About Bruno" and "Surface Pressure" were its two most successful songs, with the former topping both the USBillboardHot 100andUK Singles Chartfor multiple consecutive weeks. A theme park attraction based on the film is set to open atDisney's Animal Kingdomin 2027.[7]
An armed conflict forces young couple Pedro and Alma Madrigal to flee their home village inColombiawith their infant triplets, Julieta, Pepa, andBruno. Pedro is killed, but the candle Alma carries gains a magical power that repels the attackers and creates Casita, a sentient house located in a magical realm bordered by mountains.
Fifty years later, a new village thrives under the candle's protection, which grants "gifts" to each Madrigal descendant when they turn five, which they use to serve the villagers. Bruno, who was vilified and scapegoated for hisprecognition, disappeared ten years earlier. Julieta's youngest daughter, 15-year-oldMirabel, inexplicably did not receive a gift.
On his fifth birthday, Pepa's youngest son, Antonio, is granted the ability to communicate with animals. During the celebration, the other Madrigals unwittingly exclude Mirabel from being in a family photo. Mirabel sees Casita cracking and the candle's flame flickering and alerts her family, but Casita repairs itself, causing them not to believe Mirabel. Later that night, Mirabel resolves to restore Casita's magic herself. Her 19-year-old sister Luisa, who possessessuperhuman strength, confesses to Mirabel that she feels overwhelmed by her constant obligation to help the villagers using her strength, which has been faltering. She suggests to Mirabel that Bruno's room, located inside a forbidden tower in Casita, may hold the secret to the fading magic.
Mirabel discovers a cave in Bruno's room that holds pieces of opaque emerald. Alma and the family warn Mirabel not to investigate further, but Mirabel reassembles the pieces and sees herself with Casita cracking behind her. Mirabel's father Agustín enters and accidentally discovers Mirabel, so he warns her to keep the discovery a secret, but both of them are overheard by Pepa's daughter Dolores, who possesses supernatural hearing. Mirabel's 21-year-old sisterIsabela, who can make plants and flowers instantly grow at will, is scheduled to be engaged to the Madrigals' neighbor Mariano Guzmán. Amidst Mariano's proposal, an awkward dinner, and Dolores indirectly telling everyone about Mirabel's discovery, Casita begins to crack again, and everyone loses control of their gifts.
Mirabel follows rats carrying the pieces of opaque emerald to a secret passage behind a portrait, where she finds Bruno, who reveals he never left Casita, and his visions alternate between Mirabel saving Casita and destroying it, leading him to believe she is the key to the fate of Casita's magic. Not wanting Mirabel to be hurt, he destroyed the vision and isolated himself. At Mirabel's insistence, Bruno conjures another vision that depicts Mirabel and Isabela, who have a strained relationship, hugging, which strengthens the candle.
Mirabel attempts to apologize to Isabela, who confesses she is burdened by her image of perfection and does not want to marry Mariano. Mirabel helps Isabela use her powers more freely and they hug. Alma arrives and furiously pins the blame on Mirabel for causing the family's misfortunes out of spite for not having a gift. Mirabel finally denounces Alma's behavior and asserts that her harmful expectations for her family are the true cause of Casita dying, which horrifies Alma. In the ensuing argument, Casita is demolished as the candle finally extinguishes, leaving the Madrigals powerless. Distraught, Mirabel feels like a total failure and runs away.
Alma finds Mirabel tearfully sitting beside the river where Pedro was killed and where the miracle has begun. Alma realizes that her obsession with preserving the magic made her oblivious to how her expectations and pressure were harming the family. She expresses remorse, reconciles with Mirabel, and reunites with Bruno. The three return to the village and assemble the other Madrigals to rebuild Casita, and the townspeople join in, restoring the family's gifts and reviving Casita. The Madrigals celebrate and take another family photo, this time including Mirabel and Bruno.

During a November 2016 publicity tour forMoana, Miranda revealed that early-stage work had begun on an animated project thatJohn Lasseter, then the chief creative officer of Disney Animation, had presented to him and Howard.[20]Howard and Bush subsequently revealed that after finishingZootopia(2016), they knew they wanted their next project to be a musical[21]—which turned into a Latin American musical after Miranda came on board.[22][23]Howard and Bush had already worked onbuddy films"where two characters go out into the world and learn about each other" and wanted to try something "completely different".[23]The three men discussed their common experience of having largeextended families, and decided to make a musical film about a large extended family with a dozen main characters.[23][24]
During the five years it took to develop the film, Howard and Bush's "true north" was the theme of perspective, "about how you see the other people in your family and how you're seen".[23]They began by brainstorming ideas on awhiteboard.[25]Early on, they made "three important discoveries" about families which became the basis of the film's story: "1)mostof us don't feel truly seen by our families, 2)mostof us carry burdens we never let our families see, and 3)mostof us are oblivious that nearlyall of us, especially within our own families, feel the exact same way".[26]: 8In turn, it was Miranda who suggested that the "vibrant, broad spectrum" ofLatin American musiccould "best capture" the complexity of family relationships.[26]: 8
Early in development, the production team spoke with many therapists and psychologists. All were asked who would be treated best by the parents in a four-person family; every answer differed. Bush concluded: "It's about how you perceive yourself in the family."[27]The crew also consulted family members and Disney Animation people.[28]
Howard and Bush started to discussLatin American cultureat length with Juan Rendon and Natalie Osma, who had previously worked with them on the making-of documentaryImagining Zootopia.[21][23]Rendon and Osma both happened to be from Colombia and repeatedly drew upon their personal experiences withColombian culturein their discussions, which caused Howard, Bush, and Miranda to focus their research on that country.[21]Rendon and Osma became the first two of several cultural experts hired by Disney Animation as consultants on the film,[21]who collectively formed what Disney called the "Colombian Cultural Trust".[23][29]
In 2018, Rendon and Osma accompanied Howard, Bush, and Miranda on a research trip to Colombia.[21]During their two weeks in the country,[23]they met with architects, chefs, and artisans to immerse themselves in the country's culture.[29]They also visited theGabriel García Márquezfoundation.[29]They visited big cities likeBogotáandCartagena, but they found inspiration in small towns such asSalento(terrain) andBarichara(architecture).[29]Bush noticed that "every town we went to had a very specific personality", because of how the country's mountainous terrain divides and isolates them.[23]
According to Disney fan club publicationDisney twenty-three,this isolation became the key to placing the Madrigals' residence in a "remote 'encanto'—that is, a place that's 'charmed', or spiritually blessed, a domain where magic and reality merge".[23]As Colombian tourist guide Alejandra Espinosa Uribe explained, Colombians are surrounded by "sacred lands that feel magical, and we coexist with them, not questioning their existence".[26]: 30
In Barichara, they befriended Espinosa Uribe, who showed them around the town, and later hired her to consult on the film's historical and cultural authenticity.[30]Espinosa Uribe was an inspiration for several aspects of the film's protagonist Mirabel, including her curly black hair, large eyeglasses, and gestures.[30]The design of Mirabel's skirt was inspired by traditional skirts woven in theVélezarea.[30]
The final version of the film is deliberately vague as to the timeframe in which it is set, but drew inspiration from early-20th-century Colombia.[30]After exploring the 1950s, the directors decided to shift the look of the film to the early 1900s and to use a "folkloric Colombian aesthetic".[26]: 22At the beginning of the 20th century, the country endured theThousand Days' War, which resulted in the populations of entire villagesfleeing to save themselvesas depicted in the film.[30]
As the film steadily became more complex, with an entire family to develop, multiple songs, and a rich cultural setting with a deep tradition ofmagical realism, Howard and Bush realized they needed a second screenwriter to help write the screenplay.[23]They selected Charise Castro Smith for her strong background in magical realism and experience with handling "real-world family dynamics".[23]Bush described her as a "godsend", as she provided "a foundation of heart, vulnerability and authenticity". Castro Smith sought to create a distinct, imperfect, and completely human character in Mirabel, one that spoke to the lives of many Latinas while also being relatable to viewers globally.[31]
From working onMoana, Miranda knew that film's protagonist,Moana, originally had eight brothers before they were removed to streamline the film's plot.[24]As Miranda had expected from that experience, Disney Animation initially resisted moving forward with a dozen main characters forEncanto.[24]Miranda deliberately wrote the film's opening number, "The Family Madrigal", to prove to Disney Animation that it was possible to efficiently introduce such a large family and its internal dynamics to the audience.[24]Because of the film's 90-minute runtime, the filmmakers struggled to make the center family feel genuine, fleshed out, and human, and to give them arcs.[28]
The crew worked hard to developEncantoupon instantly identifiable familyarchetypes. The team focused on pushing past the archetypes and showing that family members are more complicated than the "masks" imposed on them.[21]Each member of the Madrigal family is inspired by a common family archetype if it were exaggerated and made magical; for example, Isabela and Luisa are based on that of thegolden childand rock, respectively.[32]Bush explained that this method prevented each gift from feeling arbitrary, instead being prescribed by emotions and personality.[26]: 26
Like most Disney Animation films,Encantowent through "many different versions" in its development, as various story ideas were explored and discarded.[26]: 17The ideas discarded along the way include:
After the film's release, Bush revealed via Twitter several more ideas which had been discussed and set aside: Alma gave birth to the triplets at the river, at the moment of Pedro's death; Isabela and Mirabel's mutual hostility culminated in a fistfight; and Mirabel celebrated herquinceañera.[25]According to Howard, as the plot evolved over several years, "the core of the whole film" was always the relationship between Mirabel and Alma.[23][26]: 116
Disney cast several actors with Colombian heritage, includingStephanie Beatriz, whose father is Colombian;John Leguizamo, who was born inBogotá; andWilmer Valderrama, who spent his childhood in Colombia, where his mother is from.[33]
Though no obvious roles which he could voice existed, due to the Madrigals' Colombian nationality and Mirabel's lack of an animal sidekick,Alan Tudyk—considered Disney's "good luck charm"—makes acameoas Pico, a toucan.[34][35]When he first came into the recording studio, Tudyk informed the crew that theirscratch vocalsfor Pico were not actually those of toucans, but instead were parrots. He spent many hours doing imitations of various toucans. The team would speak to him in English, and Tudyk would respond using toucan noises.[36]
Encantowas the "hardest film" to date for heads of animation Renato dos Anjos and Kira Lehtomaki because they were asked to fully develop a dozen characters, as opposed to other animated films which primarily feature two or three characters out of a large cast.[37]Accordingly, the characters required a degree of complexity that Disney Animation had previously never achieved.[38]Journalist Edna Liliana Valencia Murillo was theAfro-Caribbeanconsultant and contributed greatly towards Félix, Dolores, and Antonio's designs.[39]According to Howard, certain characters'Afro-Latinhairstyles were essential.[40]Disney veterans Ian Gooding and Lorelay Bové were hired as production designers for the film. Lorelay and her sister, costume design lead Neysa Bové, hoped to represent the film's various communities well. Neysa requested Colombian consultants, which included ananthropologistand botanist.[39]
Instead of fabrics similar toneoprenethat are often depicted in films, the characters' costumes are generally loose. The clothes are meant to appear as though they are from Colombia. The designers emphasized embroidery, texture, and movement; each costume—except Isabela's—is asymmetric, with a handmade feeling.[39]InEncanto, personalities and family ties are represented through color. For example, Pepa and Félix's side of the family wear warm tones of orange, yellow, and red—an homage to his Caribbean ancestry.[26]: 29
By contrast, Julieta and Agustín's side wear cool tones of blues, purples, and greens. Alma "sits in the middle", with darker hues, such as purple, black, and brown.[26]: 29Each Madrigal has a symbol on their clothing that denotes their gift, such as barbells on Luisa's skirt and Pepa's sun earrings. Due to her lack of a gift, Mirabel has symbols of the other family members' gifts embroidered across her skirt,[41]in addition to her face and name.[42]
The residents of theEncantodress in neutral tones; thus, the main family are distinguished by their vivid colors.[26]: 29They needed to be distinctive while not standing out, which visual development artist Jin Kim said occasionally made them harder to design than the main cast.[26]: 148Disney used simple silhouettes for the villagers' clothes to make them seem and feel similar to typical residents from the Colombian coffee region. They incorporated depictions of theSombrero vueltiaofrom theZenúIndigenous Community and the Sombrero Aguadeño from the Aguadas Community.[26]: 149
The animators were challenged by the directors to make Mirabel distinctively different from all prior Disney heroines; she had to be both capable and imperfect, but not merely just clumsy.[37]The Casita was inspired not only by traditional Colombian homes but films in which houses come alive, especiallyBeetlejuice(1988).[37]
The production team learned in their research that music, dance, and rhythm are core elements of everyday life in Colombia.[43]As a result,Encantowas the first Disney Animation film to have choreographers involved in the development process from start to finish, meaning they worked closely with the production team to develop songs, characters, and story.[37][43]
This is in contrast to older films where the story was already in place by the time a choreographer was hired to consult on specific scenes.[43]ForEncanto, Disney Animation initially hired African-American choreographerJamal Sims, who insisted on immediately hiring Colombian-American dancer Kai Martinez as the film's animation reference consultant.[37][43]They worked together with a team of dancers to prepare choreography reference footage for each scene, and then gave feedback to the animators on scenes as they were animated.[37][43]They developed different dance styles for different characters; Luisa's style isreggaeton, while Mirabel's style isCalisalsa.[43]
For selection and animation of the plants and flowers that Isabela could make grow, the production team consulted with Colombian botanist Felipe Zapata. His advice allowed appropriate plants to be selected and then shown in accurate detail. The river ofjacarandasandstrangler figsand the cascade ofsundewthat Isabela produces are all based on this input. Plants in the background scenery are also realistic. These included the iconic, but now vulnerablewax palmand dramaticCecropiatrees. Economically important plants, likecoffee, also appear.[44]
Over 800 people, 108 of them animators, were involved in the production ofEncanto.[45]Disney Animation was planning to send many of its animators to Colombia starting on March 15, 2020, in preparation for the film's transition from development to production. This second research trip had to be cancelled after the onset of theCOVID-19 pandemic. The studio's animators ended up having towork remotelywith the Colombian Cultural Trust; for example, Espinosa Uribe gave the animators avirtual tourof Colombia with the help of her cell phone.[30]Diane Guerrero sent the studio's designers photographs of Colombian food taken by her relatives in Colombia.[25]
On June 22, 2020, Miranda confirmed onGood Morning Americathat he and Bush were working on an animated Disney film set in Colombia, with Bush and Byron Howard directing, and Charise Castro Smith co-directing.[46]
On June 18, 2020, the tentative title was revealed to beEncanto. The project was also confirmed to be the film Miranda was involved in, and it was reported to be about a girl in a magical family. On December 10, 2020, the project was officially confirmed at a Disney Investor Day meeting, where a clip was shown, a fall 2021 release was announced, and magical realism was referenced.[47]According to Bush, development of the film's scriptwrappedin August 2021, and production on the film wrapped a month later.[25]Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many crew members worked together remotely for over a year and did not meet each other in person until Disney put on a socially distanced outdoor screening of the final version of the film.[45]
Encantois the first Disney Animation film sinceTangled(2010) to employ a tallframe, a decision made to "get closer to the characters". Thislayoutwas supplemented byromanticlighting.[26]: 168According to Howard,romantic(meaning heightened in spirit) is the film's key word in terms of the approach towards cinematography and lighting. The latter was also inspired by magical realism, due to the genre's heavy influence on the writing and characters.[40]
The directors aimed to use the film's optics to portray strong emotions. Alessandro Jacomini and Daniel Rice—directors of cinematography and lighting, respectively—stated this use "would amplify, exaggerate, and distort perception, which is very in line with Mirabel's point of view as a narrator". Her feelings of being left out were also shown using emotive lighting. The directors frequently reminded the crew of the emotional subtext of every scene as well as the intricacies of the individual parts. That subtext was applied by Warner, Jacomini, and Rice in elaborate sequences, such as the song "Surface Pressure".[26]: 168
In June 2020, Miranda publicly revealed that he had begun to write the film's music, which would have eight original songs in both Spanish and English.[48]After the film's premiere, he disclosed that he had been writing songs for the film from the very beginning.[22]On September 8, 2021,Germaine Franco, co-composer of the songs forCoco(2017), began to score the film.[10][49][50]
Encantowas released on November 19, 2021. A huge commercial success alike the film, the soundtrack reached number one on the USBillboard200, becoming the first Disney soundtrack sincethat ofFrozen II(2019) to top the chart.[51]The track "We Don't Talk About Bruno" broke various records and became one of Disney's most successful songs of all time. It topped the USBillboardHot 100and theUK Singles Chart, and marked Disney's first number-one song on the former in the 21st century and its first ever on the latter,[52][53]makingEncantothe first Disney film to produce a number-one song and a number-one album.[54]
The first look of the film was shown on December 10, 2020, during Disney's Investor Day.[55]The teaser trailer was released on July 8, 2021,[56]which garnered acclaim from internet users due to Luisa's physical appearance, especially her muscles; she was dubbed the "Buff Lady".[57][58]The official trailer was released on September 29, 2021.[59]For its opening weekend at the box office, Disney spent $14 million on television advertisements to promote the film, generating 1.26 billion impressions.Deadline Hollywoodsaid the marketing failed to distinguish the film from other Disney properties, causing audience members to believe that it would be similar toCoco.[60]/Filmwas critical of Disney's merchandising, most of which featured Mirabel and Isabela. Many members of the Madrigal family could only be bought in more costly merchandise of the entire family. Since Isabela is considered the perfect and beautiful sister, the website stated the merchandise reinforces the idea that beauty is the most effective marketing tactic for young girls.[57]
Disney held the film'sworld premiereat theEl Capitan TheatreinHollywood, Los Angeles, on November 3, 2021,[61]and also held a Colombia premiere at theTeatro ColóninBogotá, Colombia on November 23, 2021.[62]The film was theatrically released in the United States on November 24. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it had an exclusive 30-day theatrical run before being released onDisney+on December 24.[63]The film was paired with the short filmFar from the Tree.[64][65]Encantowas released in China on January 7, 2022.[66]On February 16, 2022, the film was re-released in cinemas after its success on Disney+ and Academy Award nominations.[67]As part of Disney's 100th anniversary,Encantowas re-released inHeliostheaters across Poland on October 28, 2023.[68]
Encantowas released on Disney+ on December 24, 2021, and was released byWalt Disney Studios Home EntertainmentonDVD,Blu-ray, andUltra HD Blu-rayon February 8, 2022.

Since its Disney+ release,Encantohas consistently toppedNielsen's weekly streaming chart, most recently with 1.224 billion total minutes of viewing.[71]Nielsen estimated thatEncantowas the most-watched film of 2022 with 27.4 billion minutes viewed; approximately 269 million complete showings. It was more than double the second-place film on the end of year listTurning Red(11.43 billion minutes).[72]
Encantogrossed $96.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $160.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $256.5 million.[4][5]Encantowas 2021's highest-grossing animated film before it was surpassed bySing 2.[73][74]Factoring in both the film's production budget and marketing expenses, along with the theaters' share of revenues,Encantowas estimated to need to gross at least $300 million worldwide tobreak even.[75]Nevertheless, the film went viral over the 2021holiday seasonand achieved wider commercial success after its digital release to Disney+ on December 24, 2021.[76][77][78]

It went on to make $40.6 million in its first five days.[80]Of the 3.7 million moviegoers who saw it, 52% were Latino and Hispanic, 51% were families, and 62% were female. Though its five-day opening gross was lower than Pixar'sThe Good Dinosaur(2015) ($55.4 million), which failed at the box office in 2015,Encantohad the best opening weekend for an animated film during the COVID-19 pandemic.[81]
In its second weekend, it made $13.1 million, less than the second-weekend results ofThe Good Dinosaur($15.3 million) andTangled(2010) ($21.6 million) but higher thanThe Princess and the Frog(2009) ($12.1 million).[82][83]It went on to finish in second place in its third and fourth weekends, earning $10 million and $6.5 million, respectively.[84][85]In its fifth weekend, it made $1.8 million and dropped to ninth place at the box office.[86][87]In its sixth weekend, it finished in tenth place with $1.08 million.[88]It dropped out of the box office top ten in its seventh weekend, finishing eleventh with $613,501.[89]

[T]he general consensus onEncantois that, if you tend to enjoy most modern Disney movies, you'll probably enjoyEncanto, as it has a lot in common with them. However, you might just find something truly special within that tried and true formula.
Encantoreceived critical acclaim.[b]News channelCNBCreported reviewers considered it among Walt Disney Animation's best films.[104]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 92% of 210 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's consensus reads, "Encanto'ssetting and cultural perspective are new for Disney, but the end result is the same – enchanting, beautifully animated fun for the whole family."[105]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 75 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[106]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale,[107]while those atPostTrakgave it an 88% positive score, with 70% saying they would definitely recommend it.[60]
The film's animation, which journalists considered beautiful,[108]was a source of plaudits.[104]RogerEbert.comcritic Monica Castillo thought the musical sequences and characters' rooms allowed animation more artistic and abstract than that of previous Disney films.[109]Writing forGood Morning America,Peter Traversdeemed the visuals ofEncantomiraculous,[110]while Shreemayee Das ofFirstpostdescribed the animation as having spellbinding intricacy.[111]Variety'sOwen Gleiberman gave acclaim, saying "Encantohas been visualized with a vivacious naturalistic glow (swirling flower petals, eye-candy pastels) that, at moments, is nearly psychedelic".[112]David Rooney fromThe Hollywood Reporterhighlighted the film's colors and the designs of the costumes, natural settings, and Casita for particular praise.[113]ForIndieWire, Kristen Lopez lauded the visuals as stunning and life-like.IGN'sAndrea Towers called the animation beautiful.[114]The Daily Telegraphfilm criticRobbie Collinwas particularly amazed: "Encanto'sanimation is dazzling in all sorts of ways, with technical effects and flights of creative fancy that would have been unimaginable even a year ago, particularly during the musical numbers."[115]
Critics found the film's songs "spellbinding".[104]According to Ben Travis ofEmpire, the songs once again demonstrate Miranda's abundant skills for enchanting, wondrous melodies and lyrics.[116]ForChicago Sun-Timesand theDaily Herald, respectively, Richard Roeper and Dann Gire described the music as "infectious and instantly memorable", and "emotionally distilled [and] verbally nimble";[117][118]The Detroit Newswriter Adam Graham agreed, commenting that the songs "lift [Encanto] to the sky".[119]Similarly,The Arizona Republic'sBill Goodykoontz regarded them as the film's peak.[120]CNNwriter Brian Lowry shared a similar view.[121]Nevertheless, many journalists found fault with the music, such asNational Review'sKyle Smith, who called it "thuddingly mediocre".[122]Though he found the songs "breezy and fun", Christian Holub ofEntertainment Weeklydeemed them unmemorable.[123]Writing forBleeding Cool, Kaitlyn Booth believed the music was "[no]thing particularly special" and that a lack of songs would have benefited the film.[124]
[Encanto] is about a lot more than just representation. The happiness portrayed inEncantoisn't justescapism, it's defiance. It's about challenging that notion that we Colombians have to be miserable forever. ... It's about the miracle of thriving when you seem almost cosmically predisposed to suffer ad infinitum. Because that's what Colombia is: a country of people trying their best to thrive in spite of themselves.
Reviewers singled outEncanto'srepresentation and diversity for particular praise.[126]Writing forThe Guardian, Simran Hans found the awareness of culturally uniquegenerational traumaand displacement intriguing and surprising.[127]Despite being critical of a perceived disguise of cultural representation, Rafael Matomayor ofThe New York Observerstated that "when the film dives into the specificity of its portrayal of Colombia[,] ... it becomes an exciting, nuanced, complex magical realist adventure" that propels Disney into "a new era".[128]The Independent'sClarissa Loughgrey highlighted that the cultural specificity was more than simple aesthetic or linguistic references, commending the incorporation of magical realism and various skin tones.[129]Whelan Barzel ofTime Outsummarized the film as a "genuine love letter to the diversity of Latin America".[130]
Reviews with regards to the film's portrayal of family dynamics deemed the aspect one of its strengths.[126]According toSlant Magazine'sDerek Smith,Encantothrives in expressing not only the typical message of the value of family but also the concept that even the best families require much effort to stay intact.[131]Preston Barra ofDenton Record-Chroniclenamed the message of family a contributing factor to the film becoming a "must-see family event";[132]fellow journalist Matt Goldberg, who writes forCollider,commended the message of "[being] enough because family is enough".[133]Polygon'sPetrana Radulovic found the familial interactions stunningly realistic and strengthened by magical metaphors.[134]Many critics also acclaimedEncanto'semotional depth.The A.V. Club'sCaroline Siede lauded the depiction of intergenerational trauma.[135]According toScreen Internationalcritic Tim Greierson, when the directors concentrate on the script's underlying emotions, the film is extremely moving.[136]Writing forCinemaBlend, Dirk Libbey opined that every audience member would eventually cry once they discovered which character they identified with most.[137]MovieWebsingled out Mirabel's search for acceptance and a purpose, stating "[b]uckets of tears are going to be shed".[138]
Regarding "Disney's regular formula",Encantodivided reviewers; some thought that it departed from the formula well.[99]Forbes'sScott Mendelson called the film "terrifically unconventional",[139]whileWorldcritic Collin Garbarino highlighted several aspects that he recognized as deviating from the formula; such as a lack of princesses and villains, as well as the focus on community.[140]Vulture'sBilge Ebiri attributed the film's enchanting qualities to the "smaller-scale narrative". He explained that when the Madrigals' inner journey is combined with the typical "Disney spectacle", it becomes an unexpected, "downrightSirkianpower".[141]Others found it too similar to other Disney films. ForPittsburgh Magazine, Sean Collier felt the film was "just another by-the-numbers Disney flick",[142]whilePeter BradshawfromThe Guardianthought that the story "wants to have its metaphorical cake and eat it", deeming it contrived.[143]/Film'sJosh Spiegel thoughtEncantoincluded a mixture of formulaic aspects from many of the previous Disney and Pixar films, and failed to make them unnoticeable.[144]
Some critics found the story unfocused. TheIrish Independent'sPaul Whittington considered the plot "too aimless, to satisfy anyone for long".[145]Alice Forman ofMashableconcurred and felt several parts of Mirabel's journey were arbitrary; she had a particularly negative opinion of the film's middle section, which she called tedious.[146]The Globe and Mailwriter Aparita Bhandari asserted the internal, rather than external, source of conflict and several unanswered questions confused her, preventing her from immersing herself in the film.[147]FromUSA Today, Brian Truitt expressed his disappointment in thethird act, which he said missesEncanto'sfocal point.[148]David Lynch, writing forKENS, agreed, and stated the act was weak due to an underdeveloped relationship between Mirabel and Alma, as well as clumsy writing.[149]Multiple critics also cited the film's lack of villains as a detractor.[150][151]
Metacritic reported thatEncantoappeared in five critic top-ten lists, includingCNNandNew YorkDaily News'snon-ranked lists, andPittsburgh Post-Gazette'sranking (ninth).[152]The film has also appeared on several lists of the best animated films of 2021, including those byPaste(tenth),[153]Rotten Tomatoes (sixth),[154]Screen Rant(non-ranked),[155]MovieWeb(fifth),[156]Vulture(non-ranked),[157]andComic Book Resources(sixth).[158]Variety,IndieWire,Gold Derby,Entertainment Weekly,The Hollywood Reporter,Den of Geek, and theLos Angeles Timesnamed the film the most likely to win theAcademy AwardforBest Animated Feature,[c]which was ultimately the case.[166]
The Denver Postjournalist John Wenzel wrote, withEncantoalongside other 2021 films likeWest Side StoryandBeing the Ricardos, "Latino voices are having a moment in U.S. cinema, injecting a diverse set of cultures long ignored by TV, books, movies, video games, stage shows and news media."[167]Pamila Avila, writing forUSA Today,underscored thatEncantois Disney's first feature with an all-Latin Americancast, capturing "the complicated tug and pull between older and younger generations inHispanicfamilies."[168]Roughly 25% of viewership comes from Hispanic households, while 40% of viewers are between the ages of 2 and 11.[169]
Billboardwriter Leila Cobo said, following the success of Colombian musicians likeShakira,MalumaandJ Balvinin the U.S., Colombia is "finally seen and not just heard" viaEncanto. Cobo praised the film for not homogenizing all of theLatin Americancountries in the manner U.S. media has generally been, instead accurately depicting the culture unique to Colombia: "from accents to outfits to minute details like the hand-painted tableware, the embroidered dresses, the food, the many colors of our skin, even the animals – including the ubiquitoustoucanand the yellow butterflies that are synonymous withGarcía Márquez."[170]
Johanna Ferreira ofPopSugarwrote that the success of bothEncantoand its soundtrack speaks to "not just the importance and significance of this type of representation in animated films, but also how movies like this are really changing how Latino stories are being told." She statedEncantocelebrates the importance of family and respect forLatin American culture, featuring "animated stories about Latinos written by Latinos, with characters voiced by Latinos, and a storyline that actually celebrates Latino communities rather thanstereotype [Latino]."[171]
Mikael Wood ofLos Angeles TimesstatedEncantobecame "2022's first widespread cultural phenomenon", bolstered by its unique direction and music.[172]Far Outjournalist Tyler Posen called the effect "Encanto-mania".[173]Various social media trends surroundingEncantohad "people posting videos of their children recognizing themselves for perhaps the first time in the movie's characters."[172]Luisa's physical appearance has been praised for representing muscular women—a departure from Disney's conventionally "feminine" depiction of female protagonists as "small and skinny".[174]As of January 23, 2022, the videos tagged with the hashtag "#encanto" have collectively amassed more than 11.5 billion views onTikTok.[175][176]
The film's characters and their dynamics have fueled a discourse amongmental healthspecialists, many of whom reported that their clients, especiallyfirst-generation children of immigrants, "see themselves reflected" in the story ofEncantoand use the film to communicate "about things that otherwise might go unsaid." Mirabel, Isabela, Luisa, Alma and Bruno have been the most discussed characters, with Bruno being associated withneurodivergentfamily members. Speaking toCNN,psychotherapistKadesha Adelakun stated "there are so many layers" toEncanto, portraying issues "many families are going through."[177][178]
At the94th Academy Awards,Encantoreceived nominations forBest Original ScoreandBest Original Song, and wonBest Animated Feature.[166]The film won three awards at the65th Annual Grammy Awardsin the visual media categories:Best Score Soundtrack,Best Compilation Soundtrack, andBest Song("We Don't Talk About Bruno").[179]Encanto'sother nominations include nineAnnie Awards(winning three),[180]aBritish Academy Film Award(which it won),[181]twoCritics' Choice Movie Awards,[182]and threeGolden Globe Awards(winning one).[183]It also won theNational Board of Review Award for Best Animated Film.[184]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle. Its first film appearance was with the release ofStrange World.[60]The logo received widespread praise from critics and audiences and won Gold in the "Theatrical | Film: Design" medium at the 2023Clio Entertainment Awardsin November 2023. The standard version of the logo premiered theatrically withThe Beach Boys.[61]

"We Don't Talk About Bruno" is a song fromDisney's 2021 animatedmusicalfilmEncanto, with music and lyrics written byLin-Manuel Miranda. It was released byWalt Disney Recordsas part ofthe film's soundtrackon November 19, 2021. The song is an ensemble number performed by some of the film's voice cast members: mainlyCarolina Gaitán,Mauro Castillo[es],Adassa,Rhenzy Feliz,Diane GuerreroandStephanie Beatriz, and a few others in minor roles. A viral sensation, "We Don't Talk About Bruno" has been described as one of the best Disney songs and the studio's biggestcrossoversuccess.
Consisting of gossip and anecdotes aboutMirabel Madrigal's ostracized uncle,Bruno, whose gift ofseeing the futurehas been associated with misfortune and has left him estranged from the rest of the Madrigal family, "We Don't Talk About Bruno" sees some of the family members and the townsfolk explain to Mirabel why they fear his prophecies. The song suggests that Bruno is villainous, but sheds the narrative styles of conventional Disney villain songs by listing other characters' perspectives of the villain.
Musically, "We Don't Talk About Bruno" is amidtempotune blendingLatin musicstyles such assalsaandguajirawithpop,hip hop,danceandBroadwayelements, propelled bycha-cha-chábeats, sung by an ensemble, and climaxing in apolyphonicoutro.
"We Don't Talk About Bruno" was met with acclaim from music critics, who praised Miranda's craftsmanship and the song's mystery element, catchyrhythm, versatile composition, ensemble of singers, and lyrical personality. A commercial success, "We Don't Talk About Bruno" spent several weeks at number one in Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States, and peaked in the top five in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. "We Don't Talk About Bruno" is the longest-reigning chart-topper for Disney in theUSBillboardHot 100history, as well as the studio's first-ever original song to top theUK Singles Chart. It broke the all-time record for the most credited artists (seven) on a Hot 100 chart-topper.
"We Don't Talk About Bruno" is a song from 2021 American animatedmusicalfilm,Encanto, byWalt Disney Animation Studios; it is the studio's 60th film. The song is featured as the fourth track onthe film's soundtrack, which has been released in 46 languages. It was written and composed by American singer-songwriterLin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the seven other songs of the soundtrack, and previously worked on Disney's 2016 animated film,Moana[1]and Sony Pictures'Vivo. The song is mainly performed by six of the film's cast members in full verses: Colombian actress and singerCarolina Gaitán(Pepa), Colombian musicianMauro Castillo(Félix), American singer-songwriterAdassa(Dolores), American actorRhenzy Feliz(Camilo), American actressesDiane Guerrero(Isabela), andStephanie Beatriz(Mirabel), in the order of their appearances in the song; Juan Castano (Osvaldo) andOlga Merediz(Alma "Abuela" Madrigal) contribute minor vocals.[2][note 1]
Miranda pitched the song as anensemblebecause he wanted to create musical themes to represent every family member, especially "those who do not necessarily get their solo".[3]He said he looked to "A Weekend in the Country" fromA Little Night Musicand "Christmas Bells" fromRent.[4]He described "We Don't Talk About Bruno" as a "gossip" number because there are things family members do not talk about in front of each other. The first verse is about who is telling the story—Mirabel's aunt Pepa and uncle Félix, who Miranda based on his father,Luis Miranda.[5]Miranda said "everyone sings the samechord progressionwith a totally different rhythm and a totally different cadence".[6]During the film's early development, the song's subject—Bruno—was originally named Oscar. Miranda chose the name Bruno so he could work the lyric "Bruno, no, no, no" into the song.[7][unreliable source]Driven bycha-cha-chábeats, "We Don't Talk About Bruno" has been described as aLatin pop[8]andsalsasong.[9][10]It is heavily rooted inguajiraand draws fromCuban folk, hip hop, anddance music.[11]Each section of the song features a different musical style unique to each of the characters.[12]The hooks and the verses by Pepa and Félix are driven by a classic Cubanpiano montuno; Dolores's verse consists ofASMR-influenced[citation needed]vocals over softelectronicbeats; Camilo's lines exhibit a "spooky" delivery; and later followed by pluckedpizzicatostringsbelow Isabela's bright voice.[13]
The song describes theEncantocharacterBruno Madrigalfrom the perspectives of his family members and the local townsfolk. Bruno is one of a set of triplets born to Alma and Pedro Madrigal, alongside his sisters Julieta and Pepa.[7][14]Like the rest of his family, he has a magical ability; his is the ability tosee the future.Encanto's first song, "The Family Madrigal", establishes that Bruno has not been seen for years, and that he is not to be discussed.[15]Bruno's nieceMirabel, the only member of the family without a magical gift, believes one of Bruno's prophecies might reveal the cause of cracks that have been appearing in the structure of their house, and in "We Don't Talk About Bruno" she seeks information about her missing uncle.
The song illustrates how Bruno often foresaw negative events and then was blamed by those affected by them. Bruno's sister Pepa and her husband Félix tell Mirabel how Bruno's warning of rain ruined their wedding day. Pepa and Félix's daughter Dolores explains that Bruno's prophecies frightened and confused the family, and her brother Camilo portrays Bruno as a fearsome figure who "feasts on your screams". Three of the townsfolk relate various misfortunes that Bruno foretold for them. While Mirabel's sister Isabela claims Bruno predicted that her life would be perfect, Dolores laments a prediction that the man she loved would be "betrothed to another". As the family prepares for an engagement dinner party for Isabela and her boyfriend Mariano, Mirabel reassembles the shattered pieces of the last prophecy Bruno made before he disappeared, discovering as the song ends that it shows Mirabel herself at the center of the cracks in the house.[7][unreliable source][16][failed verification]
"We Don't Talk About Bruno" received widespread acclaim frommusicandfilm critics.[17][18][19]Its genre-blending composition and mysterious topic were often praised in its reviews.[11]
Romper's Jamie Kenney called "We Don't Talk About Bruno" the stand-out fromEncanto, "one that, above all others, has delightfully ear-wormed into our brains and lived there rent-free since we watched the movie with our kids over holiday break".[20]/Film's Caroline Cao ranked the song as the best on theEncantosoundtrack, calling it humorous and nuanced, further stating: "'We Don't Talk About Bruno' bursts with the Madrigals' vibrant personalities, from Adassa's speedy whispering as cousin Dolores to the way Rhenzy Feliz relishes telling a story as the over-imaginative cousin Camilo". Cao deemed it a "perfect ensemble piece that illuminates each character, sheds light on the story's overarching themes, and offers an unparalleled amount of insight into the world ofEncanto".[21]Screen Rant's Kristen Brown also called it the film's best song.[15]
Ashley Spencer ofThe New York Timeswrote, unlike most of Disney's breakout hits, "We Don't Talk About Bruno" is not a "wistful hero's solo or a third-actpower ballad", but rather "aBroadway-style ensemble track that revels in gossip about a middle-age man".[3]Slatecritic Chris White attributed the song'sLatin musicrhythm,Broadwayinfluence, "catchy and tight" melodies, distinct verses, dramatic climax, and mysterious lyrics to its viral success.[13]Tyler Posen ofFar Outcalled it an "incessantly catchy" Latin-pop song with a "stylistically diverse" composition and "exposition-heavy" lyrics that has not prevented it from "achieving the kind of crossover success that 'Let It Go' or 'Beauty and the Beast' couldn't".[12]Chris Molanphy ofSlateargued that "We Don't Talk About Bruno" is a great song not only because it is catchy, but because it boasts versatility in sound and lyrics throughout its length, accentuated by the "sense of mystery" behind its titular character that is "enveloping, even if you haven't seen the movie", and its refreshing melodies and composition departing from the formulaic production of Disney songs.[13]
Mic's Ian Kumamoto called Bruno's situation a "poignant" reminder of how mental illness is treated in familiesof color, analyzing his rejection from his own family as "not just unfair, but sinister", as Kumamoto interprets the character as having a borderline mental illness orneurodivergence. Kumamoto said that is where the importance of "We Don't Talk About Bruno" comes in: "When you listen to the song closely, the members of the family aren't actually complaining about anything that Bruno has done wrong — they simply don't know what to do with him".[22]Bonnie Jean Feldkamp ofSharon Heraldalso said it could be argued that Bruno suffers from mental illness, as he exhibits "tics of 'knock-knock-knock on wood' among others".[23]
The song sees various members of Bruno's family sharing their memories of his prophecies and his strange traits.Romper's Jamie Kenney summarized Bruno's fate as a prophet: "it's great when they tell you something you want to hear, but when it's bad news? Well, it's easier to demonize the bearer of that news than accept it".[20]Caroline Cao of/Filmshared that sentiment: "The real villain is the family's insecurities, their shame, and their inability to talk out their troubles. In denying these truths, the Madrigals shut out a loved one who was only trying to help".[21]
When the song is performed in the film, a figure resembling Bruno is visible scurrying around in the background. George Chrysostomou ofScreen Rantinterpreted this as a reflection of where Bruno has been: "While it may seem like a cinematic to add to the musical number, it's actually foreshadowing that Bruno never really left, but instead went into hiding inside his home".[24]Bill Bradley of the same website later argued that since Bruno's eyes were glowing, which only happens when he is making a prophecy, this was likely Camilo (who canshapeshift).[25]The character Dolores, who has the gift of super hearing, reveals at the end of the film that she could hear Bruno in the house the entire time, which she mentions in "We Don't Talk About Bruno" with lines such as "I can hear him now".[24]
"We Don't Talk About Bruno" was an international success.[3]Within a week afterEncantobecame available to stream onDisney+,[26]the song reached number one on USSpotify, while the music and lyric videos garnered over 30 million views and 10 million views in its first week, respectively.  Up to January 7, 2022, it remained the top trending music video onYouTubesince its release on December 28, and became a viral sound on the video-sharing appTikTok.[1][26]It reached number one on theBillboardGlobal 200chart dated February 12, 2022.
"We Don't Talk About Bruno" topped theBillboardHot 100, becoming the second number-one song from a Disney animated film, after "A Whole New World" (fromAladdin) byPeabo BrysonandRegina Bellein March 1993.[27]"We Don't Talk About Bruno" was at the number-one spot for five weeks, marking the first-ever song from a Disney film (irrespective of animation or live-action) to top the chart for so many weeks, surpassing "All for Love" (1993) byBryan Adams,Rod StewartandSting, fromThe Three Musketeers. The single stayed at the top of the chart for five consecutive weeks until it was surpassed by "Heat Waves" byGlass Animalsin the issue dated March 12, 2022.[28]
On the Hot 100 chart dated January 8, 2022, the song was the top new entry at number 50 with 12.4 million streams,[29]along with anotherEncantosong, "Surface Pressure", at number 54.[30]The following week, "We Don't Talk About Bruno" surged to number five, with 25.2 million streams, earning all of its six credited artists their first top 10 entries on the chart. Miranda also garnered his first top 10 writing credit; he previously reached number 20 in October 2017 as both an artist and writer with "Almost Like Praying", a charity single.[31]The next week, it rose to number four, surpassingFrozen's"Let It Go" (2013) to become the highest-charting song from a Disney film since "Colors of the Wind" from the 1995 filmPocahontas.[32][33]
When the song topped the Hot 100 chart dated February 5, 2022, it dethronedAdele's "Easy On Me" (2021) from the top spot with over 34 million streams and 12,000 digital downloads sold.[27]The song set the record for the most credited recording artists ever (six) on a number-one on the chart.[27]The song also became the first Hot 100 No. 1 entry forWalt Disney Recordsand the second forDisney Music Group.[34]The moment further marked the first time a soundtrack of a Disney animated movie and one of its songs simultaneously topped theBillboard200and Hot 100, respectively.[27]They also marked the first soundtrack and corresponding song to have led the two charts simultaneously for multiple weeks, sincethe soundtrack of8 Mile(2002) and its track "Lose Yourself" byEminemin 2003. Additionally, "We Don't Talk About Bruno" is the first soundtrack song to top the Hot 100 for multiple weeks sinceWiz Khalifa's "See You Again" featuringCharlie Puth, fromFurious 7: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, in 2015.[35]
The song charted in various European countries. In the United Kingdom, "We Don't Talk About Bruno" topped theUK Singles Chartfor seven weeks.[36]It skyrocketed from number 66 to number four in its second week on the chart,[37]and reached number one in its fourth charting week.[38]The song became the first-ever original Disney song to top the chart; otherwise, it is the first Disney song to top the chart sinceGareth Gates'scover version of "Suspicious Minds"fromLilo & Stitch: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrackin 2002.[39]"We Don't Talk About Bruno" also became the longest-reigning number-one single of 2022 in the UK (as of March 2022[update]).[36]The French version of the song, "Ne parlons pas de Bruno", charted in France at number 166.[40]
"We Don't Talk About Bruno" was a viral sensation on the internet, regarded by journalists as apop culturephenomenon. Critics and audiences have described it as one of the best original songs by Disney. Various reporters andmusicologistspublished articles "trying to explain how a Broadway-style ensemble song from an animated feature, sung by mostly Colombian vocalists with no hitmaking experience, managed to scale the charts".[13]"We Don't Talk About Bruno" is Disney's biggestcrossoversuccess in their history.[12]The Timesjournalist Harriet Walker called "We Don't Talk About Bruno" a "medical-grade" catchy "cultural moment".[41]The Atlanticcritic Spencer Kornhaber wrote the song has all of the features that appeals toTikTok: "theatricality, specificity, humor, surprise, and an invitation to roleplay."[10]
Vox'sAja Romano said the song relies heavily on its musical's context, which differentiates it from "typical Disney chart-toppers" such as "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" (1994) and "Colors of the Wind" (1995) that "were intentionally generic in order to serve as marketable hits for their films."[9]Clayton Davis ofVarietyquestioned why the song was not submitted for anAcademy Awardnomination forBest Original Song, attributing it to Disney not expecting the positive reaction to the song; the Academy's deadline for song submissions was November 1. Instead, "Dos Oruguitas" was submitted forEncanto,[note 2]which Davis said may have been "the safer bet" for award strategists, due to it resonating emotionally with audiences.[1]
"We Don't Talk About Bruno" topped theBillboardHot 100 in its fifth week of charting and did so with negligible airplay and did not have a pop radio version like many other Disney songs have had in the past, propelled by its Internet popularity.[42][43]
On March 16, 2022,Varietyreported that "We Don't Talk About Bruno" would be performed live for the first time at the94th Academy Awards, despite not being nominated. The film's cast performed the song withBecky G,Luis Fonsi,Sheila E., andMegan Thee Stallion.[44]It has been regarded as the "biggest production number of the ceremony"; the show's producerWill Packerstated: "If there is a song that unites people this year (it is this one), and that is kind of the epitome to me of what movies can do, because people of all stripes, ethnicities, ages, color, background, around the world (are singing it) ad nauseum [sic], and we are going to help them out so they sing it a little bit more. Our apologies to the parents."[45][46]
"We Don't Talk About Bruno" received a nomination forBest International Songat the2023 Brit Awards,[47]and wonBest Song Written for Visual Mediaat the65th Annual Grammy Awards.[48]
"Weird Al" Yankovicbriefly covered the song for his 2024 polka medley "Polkamania!".
The song's segment in the film was uploaded on DisneyMusicVEVOYouTubechannel throughVevoon December 29, 2021, serving as the music video for the song. As of November 2022[update], it had accumulated just over 530 million views.[citation needed]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
