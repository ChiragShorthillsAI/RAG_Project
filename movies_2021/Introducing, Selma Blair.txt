Discovery+(pronounced "Discovery Plus"; stylized asdiscovery+) is an American multinationalsubscription video on-demandover-the-topstreamingservice owned byWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD).[1]The service focuses onfactualprogramming drawn from the libraries of Discovery's main channel brands, as well as original series (includingspin-offsof programs from Discovery's television networks), and content fromA&E Networks,NBCUniversal,ABS-CBN Studios, and Discovery+’s corporate siblingCNN.
It was first launched in India on March 23, 2020. It launched in the United States on January 4, 2021, and replaced Discovery'sDplayandEurosportPlayer services in Europe the next day. As of April 1, 2022,[update]Discovery+ has 24 million subscribers.[2]
Discovery+ became a sister service toWarnerMedia's HBO Max following their merger in April 2022. HBO Max was relaunched asMaxthe following year, adding Discovery content to its library. While WBD originally planned to discontinue Discovery+ in favor of Max, the company elected to continue offering Discovery+ because it was still profitable.[3]
Discovery first launched Discovery+ in India on March 23, 2020, and included content from Discovery's various brands.[4]In September of the same year, Discovery announced plans to launch an international version of Discovery+ in early 2021.[5]
In October 2020, it was announced thatDplaywould be renamed Discovery+ in the United Kingdom and Ireland in the following month.[6][7]
On January 4, 2021, Discovery+ launched in the U.S. with both a paid ad-supported plan and an ad-free plan.[8][9]On January 5, 2021, Discovery+ launched in eight European territories, subsuming Dplay and theEurosportPlayer services.[10][11][12][13][14]
In an earnings call on November 3, 2021, president and CEO of Discovery Streaming and International JB Perrette discussed potential options for the service following the then-proposed spin-off and merger ofAT&T’sWarnerMediainto Discovery to formWarner Bros. Discovery. These involved a bundling and/or eventual merger of Discovery+ with WarnerMedia's streaming service HBO Max, and offering such a merged service in markets where Discovery+ has yet to launch, such as other parts of the Asia-Pacific region.[15]On March 14, 2022, after Discovery shareholders approved the merger, CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels stated that the merged company planned to pursue a merger ofHBO Maxwith Discovery+ as a long-term goal, following the process proposed by Perrette earlier.[16]Following the merger, selected Discovery library programs had begun to appear on HBO Max.[17]
In August 2022, Perrette announced that a merged service would launch in the United States "next summer", if not sooner, followed by Latin America in late-2023, HBO Max's European markets in early-2024, and additional Asia-Pacific and European markets. Perrette stated that HBO Max and Discovery+ had complimentary scopes targeting "appointment viewing" and "comfort viewing" respectively, and thus described the unified service as being "an unprecedented combination in an already crowded market."[18]In November 2022, it was announced that the new service would now launch in spring 2023.[19][20]In early-December 2022, it was reported by CNBC via inside sources that the unified platform was being developed under the codename "BEAM", and that multiple names were being considered—including simply "Max".[21][22]
In February 2023, Zaslav stated during an earnings call that WBD no longer planned to shut down Discovery+ in favor of the merged service, due to its profitability and lowchurn. He explained that its customers were "very happy with the product offering", and asked, "why would we shut that off?".[17]The Wall Street Journalhad reported earlier in the month that WBD had planned to continue operating Discovery+ in conjunction with the new service, which was expected to have a higher price than HBO Max, and would feature "most", but not all, of the content of Discovery+.[23]Max was officially unveiled on April 12, 2023, for a US launch on May 23.[24]In contrast to WBD's plans to keep Discovery+ operational in at least the United States,Warner Bros. Discovery Asia-Pacificannounced in March 2023 that Discovery+ would be discontinued in the Philippines on April 27, 2023, in favor of the localHBO Goservice; WBD had announced an Asia-Pacific launch for Max on November 19, 2024.[25][26][27][28]
In summer 2024, Max launched in 25 European countries, integrating content from Eurosport and Discovery+.[29]Consequently, countries offering both HBO Max (now Max) and Discovery+ stopped accepting new Discovery+ subscriptions and renewals, with no new content being added to the platform, redirecting existing users to Max.
Shortly after, Discovery+ permanently closed in Spain,[30]Denmark, Finland[31]and the Netherlands[32]on December 9, 2024, and ceased operations in Brazil on February 6, 2025,[33][34]and in Turkey on April 15, 2025.[35][36]
Annual subscriptions to Discovery+ in the United Kingdom, & Ireland, Germany and Italy ended on February 27, 2025.
Discovery+ will continue to wound down in European Max markets, including the United Kingdom where it will launch in early 2026.[37]
Original programming carried by Discovery+ includesspin-offsof programs from Warner Bros. Discovery's networks.
The library of Discovery+ is drawn primarily from the original programming of Warner Bros. Discovery's channel brands, including but not limited toDiscovery Channel,Animal Planet,TLC,Travel Channel,Magnolia Network,HGTV,Food Network,Investigation Discovery,CNN, and other international brands where applicable such asAsian Food Network.
In the U.S., Discovery+ has also licensed non-scripted programming fromA&E Networks—includingA&E,History, andLifetimeprograms[38]—andNBCUniversal Global Distribution—includingAmerican Ninja Warrior,The Biggest Loser,Flipping Out,Queer Eye,The Real Housewivesof Melbourne,Cheshire,Johannesburg,Top Chef Canada(which is produced for the Canadian version ofFood Network), andWAGS.[39]
In the Philippines, Discovery+ has also licensed non-scripted programming fromABS-CBN Corporation'sMetro Channel.
On August 4, 2022, WBD announced that a CNN content hub featuring a selection of its original series and documentaries would be added to the service. CNN had attempted to launch a streaming service,CNN+, during the lead-up to the WarnerMedia/Discovery merger, but it was discontinued by Perrette and new CNN headChris Lichtonly a month after its launch due to its conflicts with the merged company's OTT strategy.[40]
In selected European territories, Discovery+ offers sports content via Warner Bros. Discovery'sEurosportandTNT Sportsnetworks, subsuming Eurosport's previous streaming platformEurosport Player.[41][42]The service began to subsumeGolfTVfollowing its December 2022 shutdown.[43]
Also, in September 2023, BT Group and Warner Bros. Discovery announced that the BT Sport app and web player would close on October 12, 2023, making Discovery+ the new streaming home forTNT Sports.[44][45]
In February 2024,MotorTrend+was shut down and its content and subscribers were migrated to Discovery+.[46]
Discovery+ is available through traditional Windows/macOS web browsers, the majordigital media playerplatforms (such asAmazon Fire TV,Roku,Apple TVandChromecast),Android TV,Xbox One/Series X/Sgaming consoles, and throughAndroidandiOSapps.[47]
At the beginning of 2021 it was announced that Discovery+ would become available toVodafonecustomers in Romania, Portugal, Greece, Czech Republic, Hungary and Iceland sometime in the middle of 2022.[66]However, the plans were halted as Max was launched instead in those regions, excluding Greece and Iceland.
There was criticism of the service at launch by some viewers of the networks and industry analysts, especially concerns that existing Discovery programming is being taken away from cable and satellite viewers and is being placed behind an additionalpaywallthat may be inaccessible to viewers without robust broadband plans, or are in rural areas with little access to broadband, which in turn may imperil future carriage of those channels by Discovery's provider partners.[67][68]Other viewers have criticized Discovery'sbait-and-switchtactics in forcing them to sign up for Discovery+ to have the 'full experience' of a series, as is being done for various Discovery+ spin-offs of90 Day Fiancé, along with obtrusive Discovery+ advertising throughout the broadcast day (including alower thirdsized banner in the top-right corner during actual programming) of many Discovery networks.[68][69]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
