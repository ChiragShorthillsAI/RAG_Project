The Last Duelis a 2021historical dramafilm[6]directed byRidley Scottfrom a screenplay byNicole Holofcener,Ben Affleck, andMatt Damon, based on the 2004 bookThe Last Duel: A True Story of Crime, Scandal, and Trial by Combat in Medieval FrancebyEric Jager. Set inmedieval France, the film stars Damon asJean de Carrouges, a knight who challenges his former friend, squireJacques le Gris(Adam Driver), to ajudicial duelafter Jean's wife,Marguerite(Jodie Comer), accuses Jacques of raping her. The events leading up to the duel are divided into three distinct chapters, reflecting the contradictory perspectives of the three main characters. Affleck also stars in a supporting role as CountPierre d'Alençon.
An adaptation of Jager's book was first announced in 2015, though it was not officially greenlit until July 2019. Affleck and Damon were confirmed as stars and co-writers that month, with Comer and Driver joining the cast later that year. Filming took place in France and Ireland from February to October 2020, with a hiatus of several months due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.
The Last Duelpremiered at the78th Venice International Film Festivalon September 10, 2021, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 15, 2021, by20th Century Studios. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, and was selected by theNational Board of Reviewas one of thetop ten films of 2021. Although the filmperformed poorly at the worldwide box office, it later found financial success in post-theatrical markets.[7][8]
While the plot of the film is portrayed in three separate chapters, each telling the same story from the perspective of the three main characters, the following description summarizes all three presentations into a single narrative:
After serving in theCaroline War, French squiresJean de CarrougesandJacques le Grisswear allegiance to CountPierre d'Alençon, who has been named Jean's overlord byKing Charles VI. To improve his finances, Jean marriesMarguerite de Thibouvilleon the promise of a large dowry from Marguerite's father, Robert, that grants the rights to many valuable estates. Pierre, however, seizes the prized estate ofAunou-le-Fauconto settle Robert's back taxes and gifts it to Jacques, who has become one of Pierre's favorites. Jean takes the matter before King Charles, who dismisses the suit. Pierre retaliates by appointing Jacques to the captaincy of a Carrouges family post following the death of Jean's father.
Jean's marriage becomes strained due to the couple's failure to conceive. He and Jacques reconcile at a celebration, where Jacques becomes smitten with Marguerite after she befriends him in an attempt to win favor. Jacques misinterprets this as a reciprocation of his affections, coming to believe she actually does not love Jean.
Following his participation in a failed military campaign inScotlandthat sees him knighted but still bankrupt, Jean sets off for Paris to collect his wage. Marguerite demonstrates a talent for managing the estate in his absence. One day, when Marguerite is left alone at the chateau, Jacques visits and tricks his way in, haughtily proclaiming his love. Marguerite rejects his advances and attempts to flee, but he chases her to her room and rapes her before ordering her not to tell her husband. Upon Jean's return, Marguerite tells him of the assault; after questioning whether she is telling the truth, Jean becomes convinced that Jacques raped Marguerite to insult him specifically. Jean insists that Marguerite immediately have sex with him so that Jacques will not be "the last man that knew her."
Pierre informs Jacques that Jean is accusing him of raping Marguerite, which he denies. Despite the count's attempt to exert his authority, Jean appeals his case directly to King Charles and requests a duel to the death. Jacques accepts, having decided not to seek a favorable forum of a Catholicecclesiastical court. Marguerite's friends abandon her, believing her to be lying to cover up an affair, while Jean's mother, who was also raped as a youth but never revealed the truth, insists Marguerite drop her accusations. At Jacques' trial six months later, a now-pregnant Marguerite remains resolute that she is telling the truth, while the court implies that Jacques is the father of her child. Charles grants Jean's request for a duel to determine the case. Marguerite is also informed that she will be burned alive for perjury if her husband loses, and confronts Jean for not telling her about this. She gives birth to her son not long before the duel takes place.
The duel begins with Jean and Jacquesjoustinguntil both men lose their mounts and fight hand-to-hand. Following a lengthy struggle, Jean is stabbed in the groin but eventually manages to pin down Jacques. He demands that Jacques confess or face damnation, but Jacques claims his innocence. Jean then kills him. Jean basks in the glory of his victory while Marguerite follows quietly behind. Meanwhile, Jacques' body is stripped and hung upside down publicly whilst Pierre looks on.
An epilogue reveals Jean died fighting in theCrusadeswhile Marguerite continued managing his estate, living in peace for the remainder of her life but never remarrying.
The project was initially announced in July 2015, withFrancis Lawrenceplanning to direct the film, and Shaun Grant writing the screenplay. No further development was announced, and the film rights lapsed.[9]In July 2019,Deadline Hollywoodannounced thatRidley Scottwas planning to direct the film, withBen AffleckandMatt Damonset to star as well as write the screenplay withNicole Holofcener.[10]WithWalt Disney Studiosholding the rights to the film as a result of theDisney–Fox merger, it was unknown if the company would produce the film owing to its subject matter; however,Deadline Hollywoodadded that "every studio in town was waiting in the wings" should Disney sell the rights.[11]In September,Jodie Comerentered negotiations to join the cast[12]and was confirmed the following month, withAdam Driverentering negotiations to join the film after Affleck opted to play a different supporting role.[13]Driver was confirmed in November, with Disney stating it would distribute the film by setting a release date.[14]Harriet Walterwas added to the cast in February 2020.[15]Dr. Lorris Chevalier, at the time a PhD student and curator in Berze castle, joined the project as the historical advisor.[16]
Filming began on February 14, 2020, inDordogne, France[17][18][19]and continued until March 12, 2020, in the medieval castle ofBerzé-le-Châtel(nearMâcon),Burgundy, France (with a film crew of 300 people including 100 extras).[20][21]Several scenes were also shot at the 11th-century CistercianAbbaye de FontfroideinNarbonne, Aude, France.[22]Filming was to have taken place in  Ireland, using locations atBective Abbey, County Meath andCahir Castle, County Tipperary and various locations across Dublin andCounty Wicklowfrom March 23, 2020, to March 30, 2020.[23]On March 13, 2020, Disney announced that the studio had to delay the shoot indefinitely amid concerns for the cast and crew in light of theCOVID-19 pandemicas well as travel restrictions in Europe.[24]Filming resumed in late September 2020[25][26][27]and production concluded in Ireland on October 14, 2020.[28]
Harry Gregson-Williams composed the film score, in his third collaboration with Scott as a composer afterKingdom of Heaven(2005) andThe Martian(2015).[29]The score was released byHollywood Recordson October 15, 2021, which consisted of vocal elements, from the British a cappella groupVoces8led byGrace Davidson(who performed one of the tracks) as well as orchestral elements, with the use of medieval and contemporary instrumentation indicated to highlight the three main characters and the events that led to the titular duel.[30][31]
The Last Duelwas originally scheduled to begin a limited theatrical release on December 25, 2020, before its wide release on January 8, 2021.[14]As a result of theCOVID-19 pandemic, the release date was pushed back a year to October 15, 2021.[32][33]It had its world premiere at the78th Venice International Film Festivalon September 10, 2021.[34]The film played exclusively in theaters for 45 days before it headed to digital platforms.[35]

The Last Duelbecame available for streaming onHBO Maxon January 14, 2022. According to the streaming aggregatorJustWatch,The Last Duelwas the 2nd most watched film across all platforms in the United States, during the week ending January 16, 2022.[37]
The Last Duelgrossed $10.9 million in the United States and Canada and $19.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $30.6million.[4][5]
In the United States and Canada,The Last Duelwas initially projected to gross around $10 million from 3,065 theaters in its opening weekend.[38]After making $1.8 million on its first day, including $350,000 from Thursday night previews, estimates were lowered to $5 million. It ended up debuting to $4.8 million, finishing fifth at the box office and marking the worst opening of Scott's career.[3]Deadline Hollywoodattributed the underperformance to the two-and-a-half-hour runtime limiting the number of showings, the subject matter being hard to market, the 45+ age demo not fully returning to theaters yet, and competition fromHalloween KillsandNo Time to Die.[39]Several publications labeled the film a box-office bomb, and noted that 20th Century would likely lose millions on it.[3][40][41]It fell 55% in its second weekend to $2.1 million, falling to seventh.[42]The third weekend saw a drop of 78% to $558,000, for a domestic gross of around $10 million.[43]
During an interview on the podcastWTF with Marc Maronin November 2021, Scott blamed the film's box-office failure onmillennials, saying: "I think what it boils down to — what we've got today [are] the audiences who were brought up on these fucking cell phones. The millennian do not ever want to be taught anything unless you are told it on the cell phone".[44]Ben Affleck, who co-wrote the film with co-lead Matt Damon and Nicole Holofcener, was more measured in his assessment of the film's financial failure:
I've had bad movies that didn't work and I didn't blink. I know why people didn't go–because they weren't good. But I liked what we did. I like what we had to say. I'm really proud of it. So I was really confused. And then to see that it did well on streaming, I thought, "Well, there you go. That's where the audience is."[45]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 85% of 287 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "The Last Duel's critique of systemic misogyny isn't as effective as it might have been, but it remains a well-acted and thought-provoking drama infused with epic grandeur."[46]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100 based on 50 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[47]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it a 72% positive score.[39]
Owen GleibermanofVarietyconsidered the film "intriguing but overcooked", writing: "Despite a brief action interlude here or there,The Last Duelturns out to be a lavishly convoluted and, at times, rather interesting medieval soap opera."[48]Reviewing the film forTheWrap, Asher Luberto praised the performances and cinematography while criticizing the screenplay, writing: "Adapting Eric Jager's 2004 non-fiction book with screenwriters Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Nicole Holofcener, Scott spins a medieval yarn that is by turns gruesome, grotesque, gorgeous and inconsistent."[49]
Ben Croll ofIndieWire, who gave the film a "B+" grade, praised it as "something all too rare on the current Hollywood field of battle: an intelligent and genuinely daring big budget melee that is — above all else — the product of recognizable artistic collaboration."[50]Kyle SmithofNational Reviewwrote that the film was "absolutely soaked in fascinating strangeness", adding: "It works because it doesn’t try to retrofit the facts of the past to fit the assumptions of the present."[51]
Linda Marric ofThe Jewish Chroniclegave the film a score of five out of five stars, describing it as "a true return to form for Scott and a brilliant testament to Affleck and Damon's unparalleled screenwriting expertise."[52]Deborah Ross ofThe Spectatordescribed the film as "bleak, brutal and bloody with little respite – aside from Affleck's Count Pierre, who is nicely bitchy."[53]Kevin MaherofThe Timesgave the film a score of four out of five, describing it as "a medieval epic that is perhaps [Scott's] most modern movie yet".[54]
Reviewers fromNPR'sFresh Air,[55]The Atlantic,[56]The A.V. Club,[57]andCNN[58]all comparedThe Last DueltoAkira Kurosawa's filmRashomon(1950).Mark KermodeofThe Observergave the film a score of three out of five stars, saying that it "plays like an armour-clad reimagining ofRashomoncrossed with a#MeToo-inflected remake ofStraw Dogs." He added that the film "has a tendency to mirror its central battle's attempts to address complex issues with the blunt tool of rabble-rousing spectacle."[59]
Charlotte O'Sullivan of theEvening Standardgave the film three out of five stars, describing it as "a handsome, well-researched drama that's by turns earnest, amusing and unintentionally funny."[60]Joe MorgensternofThe Wall Street Journalpraised the film's production values, performances and primary theme, but wrote: "the narrative is cluttered with court intrigue against a background of repetitive battles, and the storytelling structure is exhausting."[61]Brian Lowry ofCNNwrote that the film "is muddy, bloody and grim but too drawn out in filtering 14th-century feudal norms through a modern prism."[62]David Fear ofRolling Stonesaid that the film "ends up perching so close to parody at times that you'd swear the full title wasMonty Python's The Last Duel."[63]

My mum brought three boys up: my dad was in the army and so he was frequently away. Duringthe warand post-war, we tended to travel following him around so my mum was the boss. She laid down the law and the law was God. We just said, "Yup, okay" – we didn't argue. I think that's where the respect has come from, because she was tough.
Scott was born on 30 November 1937 inSouth Shields, to Francis ("Frank") Percy Scott, a partner in a commercial shipping business based in Newcastle who would serve as aColonelin theRoyal Engineersduring theSecond World War, and Elizabeth, née Williams, a miner's daughter.[12][13]His grand-uncle Dixon Scott was a pioneer of the cinema chain and opened many cinemas aroundTyneside. One of his cinemas,Tyneside Cinema, is still operating inNewcastleand is the last remainingnewsreelcinema in the UK.[14]
Born two years before theSecond World Warbegan, Scott was brought up in a military family. His father, as a senior officer in the Royal Engineers, was absent for most of his early life. His elder brother, Frank, joined theMerchant Navywhen he was still young and the pair had little contact.[15]During this time the family moved around; they lived inCumberlandas well as other areas in England, in addition toWalesand Germany, where Colonel Scott was part of the post-warAllied Control Council.[12]After the war, the Scott family moved back toCounty Durhamand eventually settled onTeesside.[citation needed]
His interest in science fiction began by reading the novels ofH. G. Wellsas a child.[16]He was also influenced by science-fiction films such asIt! The Terror from Beyond Space,The Day the Earth Stood Still, andThem!He said these films "kind of got [him] going a little" but his attention was not fully caught until he sawStanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odyssey, about which he said, "Once I saw that, I knew what I could do."[16]He went toGrangefield Grammar SchoolinStockton on Teesand obtained a diploma in design atWest Hartlepool College of Art.[17]The industrial landscape in West Hartlepool would later inspire visuals inBlade Runner, with Scott stating, "There were steelworks adjacent to West Hartlepool, so every day I'd be going through them, and thinking they're kind of magnificent, beautiful, winter or summer, and the darker and more ominous it got, the more interesting it got."[18]
I use everything I learned every day at art school. It's all about white sheets of paper, pens and drawing.
Scott went on to study at theRoyal College of Artin London, contributing to the college magazineARKand helping to establish the college film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film,Boy and Bicycle, starring both his younger brother and his father (the film was later released on the "Extras" section ofThe DuellistsDVD). In February 1963, Scott was named in the title credits as "Designer" for the BBC television programmeTonight.
After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police seriesZ-Carsand science fiction seriesOut of the Unknown. He was originally assigned to design the secondDoctor Whoserial,The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the serial'seponymous alien creatures. Shortly before he was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant he was replaced byRaymond Cusick.[20]In 1965, he began directing episodes of television series for the BBC, only one of which, an episode ofAdam Adamant Lives!, is available commercially.[21]
In 1968, Ridley and his younger brotherTony Scott– who would also go on to become a film director[22]– founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.[23]Working alongsideAlan Parker,Hugh Hudsonand cinematographerHugh Johnson, Ridley Scott made many commercials at RSA during the 1970s, including a 1973Hovisbread advertisement, "Bike Round" (underscored by the slow movement ofDvořák's "New World" symphonyrearranged for brass), filmed inGold Hill, Shaftesbury, Dorset.[1][24]A nostalgia themed television advert that captured the public imagination, it was voted the UK's favourite commercial in a 2006 poll.[25][26]In the 1970s theChanel No. 5brand needed revitalisation having run the risk of being labelled as mass market and passé.[27]Directed by Scott in the 1970s and 1980s, Chanel television commercials were inventive mini-films with production values of surreal fantasy and seduction, which "played on the same visual imagery, with the same silhouette of the bottle."[27]
Five members of the Scott family are directors, and all have worked for RSA.[28]His brother Tony was a successful film director whose career spanned more than two decades; his sonsJakeandLukeare both acclaimed directors of commercials, as is his daughter,Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles; Luke is based in London. In 1995,Shepperton Studioswas purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds.[29]
The Duellists(1977) marked Ridley Scott's first feature film as director. Shot in continental Europe, it was nominated for the main prize at theCannes Film Festival, and won an award for Best Debut Film.The Duellistshad limited commercial impact internationally. Based onJoseph Conrad's short story "The Duel" and set during theNapoleonic Wars, it follows two FrenchHussarofficers, D'Hubert and Feraud (Keith CarradineandHarvey Keitel) whose quarrel over an initially minor incident turns into a bitter extended feud spanning fifteen years, interwoven with the larger conflict that provides its backdrop. The film has been acclaimed for providing a historically authentic portrayal of Napoleonic uniforms and military conduct.[30][31]The 2013 release of the film on Blu-ray coincided with the publication of an essay on the film in a collection of scholarly essays on Scott.[32]
Scott had originally planned next to adapt a version ofTristan and Iseult, but after seeingStar Wars, he became convinced of the potential of large scale, effects-driven films. He accepted the job of directingAlien, the 1979 horror/science-fiction film that would win him international success. Scott made the decision to switchEllen Ripleyfrom the standard male action hero to aheroine.[33]Ripley (played bySigourney Weaver), who appeared in the first fourAlienfilms, would become a cinematic icon.[33]The final scene ofJohn Hurt's character has been named by a number of publications as one of the most memorable in cinematic history.[34]Filmed atShepperton Studiosin England,Alienwas thesixth highest-grossing film of 1979, earning over $104 million worldwide.[35]Scott was involved in the 2003 restoration and re-release of the original film. In promotional interviews at the time, Scott indicated he had been in discussions to make a fifth film in theAlienfranchise. However, in a 2006 interview, Scott remarked that he had been unhappy aboutAlien: The Director's Cut, feeling that the original was "pretty flawless" and that the additions were merely a marketing tool.[36]Scott later returned toAlien-related projects when he directedPrometheusandAlien: Covenantthree decades after the original film's release.[37]
OutsideStar Wars, no sci-fi universe has been etched into cinematic consciousness more thoroughly thanBlade Runner. Ridley Scott's definitive 1982 neo-noir offered an immersive dystopia of rain-soaked windows and shadowy buildings adorned with animated neon billboards, where flying cars hum through the endless night.
After a year working on the film adaptation ofDune, and following the sudden death of his brother Frank, Scott signed to direct the film version ofPhilip K. Dick's novelDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?Re-titledBlade Runnerand starringHarrison Ford, the film was a commercial disappointment in cinemas in 1982, and was criticised by Pauline Kael in theNew Yorkerwho wrote "...Scott doesn't seem to have a grasp of how to use words as part of the way a movie moves. "Blade Runner" is a suspenseless thriller; it appears to be a victim of its own imaginative use of hardware and miniatures and mattes. At some point, Scott and the others must have decided that the story was unimportant; maybe the booming, lewd and sultry score by Chariots-for-Hire Vangelis that seems to come out of the smoke convinced them that the audience would be moved even if vital parts of the story were trimmed."[39]
In response to the review, Scott said: "...It was four pages of destruction. I never met her. I was so offended. I framed those pages and they've been in my office for 30 years to remind me there's only one critic that counts and that's you. I haven't read critiques ever since. Because if it's a good one, you can get a swollen head and forget yourself. And if it's a bad one, you're so depressed that it's debilitating."[40]The movie is now widely regarded as a classic.[41][42]In 1991, Scott's notes were used byWarner Bros.to create a rusheddirector's cutwhich removed the main character's voiceover and made a number of other small changes, including to the ending. Later Scott personally supervised a digital restoration ofBlade Runnerand approved what was calledThe Final Cut. This version was released in Los Angeles, New York City andTorontocinemas on 5 October 2007, and as an elaborate DVD release in December 2007.[43]
Today,Blade Runneris ranked by many critics as one of the most important and influential science fiction films ever made,[44]partly thanks to its much imitated portraits of a future cityscape.[45]It is often discussed along withWilliam Gibson's novelNeuromanceras initiating thecyberpunkgenre. Stephen Minger, stem cell biologist at King's College London, states, "It was so far ahead of its time and the whole premise of the story – what is it to be human and who are we, where we come from? It's the age-old questions."[46]Scott has describedBlade Runneras his "most complete and personal film".[47]
In 1985, Scott directedLegend, a fantasy film produced byArnon Milchan. Scott decided to create a "once upon a time" tale set in a world of princesses, unicorns and goblins, filming almost entirely inside the studio. Scott castTom Cruiseas the film's hero, Jack;Mia Saraas Princess Lili; andTim Curryas theSatan-horned Lord of Darkness.[48]Scott had a forest set built on the007 StageatPinewood Studiosin Buckinghamshire, with trees 60 feet high and trunks 30 feet in diameter.[49]In the final stages of filming, the forest set was destroyed by fire;Jerry Goldsmith's original score was used for European release, but replaced in North America with a score byTangerine Dream. Rob Bottin provided the film's Academy Award-nominated make-up effects, most notably Curry's red-coloured Satan figure. Despite a major commercial failure on release, the film has gone on to become acult classic. The 2002 Director's Cut restored Goldsmith's original score.[50]
Scott madeSomeone to Watch Over Me, a romantic thriller starringTom BerengerandMimi Rogersin 1987, andBlack Rain(1989), a police drama starringMichael DouglasandAndy García, shot partially in Japan. The latter was very well received at the box office.Black Rainwas the first of Scott's six collaborations with the composerHans Zimmer.[51][52]
In 1984, Scott directed a big-budget ($900,000) television commercial, "1984", to launchApple Computer'sMacintoshcomputer.[53]Scott filmed the advertisement in England for about $370,000;[54]which was given a showcase airing in the US on 22 January 1984, duringSuper Bowl XVIII, alongside screenings in cinemas.[55]Some consider this advertisement a "watershed event" in advertising[56]and a "masterpiece".[57]Advertising Ageplaced it top of its list of the 50 greatest commercials.[58]
Set in a dystopian future modelled afterGeorge Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Four, Scott's advertisement used its hero (portrayed by English athleteAnya Major) to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by her whitetank topadorned with a picture of the Apple Macintosh computer) as a means of saving humanity from "conformity" (Big Brother), an allusion toIBM, at that time the dominant force in computing.[59]
The road filmThelma & Louise(1991) starringGeena Davisas Thelma,Susan Sarandonas Louise, in addition to the breakthrough role forBrad Pittas J.D, proved to be one of Scott's biggest critical successes, helping revive the director's reputation and receiving his first nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Director.[60][61]His next project, independently funded historical epic1492: Conquest of Paradise, was a box office failure. The film recounts the expeditions to the Americas byChristopher Columbus(French starGérard Depardieu). Scott did not release another film for four years.
In 1995, Ridley and his brother Tony formed a production company,Scott Free Productions, in Los Angeles. All Ridley's subsequent feature films, starting withWhite Squall(starringJeff Bridges) andG.I. Jane(starringDemi Moore), have been produced under theScott Freebanner. In 1995 the two brothers purchased a controlling interest in the British film studioShepperton Studios. In 2001, Shepperton merged withPinewood Studiosto becomeThe Pinewood Studios Group, which is headquartered in Buckinghamshire, England.[62]
Scott's historical dramaGladiator(2000) proved to be one of his biggest critical and commercial successes. It won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for the film's starRussell Crowe, and saw Scott nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Director.[2]Scott worked with British visual effects companyThe Millfor the film's computer-generated imagery, and the film was dedicated toOliver Reedwho died during filming – The Mill created a digital body double for Reed's remaining scenes.[63][64]Some have creditedGladiatorwith reviving the nearly defunct "sword and sandal" historical genre. The film was named the fifth best action film of all time in theABCspecialBest in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time.[65]
Scott directedHannibal(2001) starringAnthony Hopkinsas Hannibal Lecter. The film was commercially successful despite receiving mixed reviews. Scott's next film,Black Hawk Down(2001), featuringTom Hardyin his film debut, was based on a group of stranded US soldiers fighting for their lives inSomalia; Scott was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director.[2]In 2003, Scott directed a smaller scale project,Matchstick Men, adapted from the novel byEric Garciaand starringNicolas Cage,Sam RockwellandAlison Lohman. It received mostly positive reviews but performed moderately at the box office.
In 2005, he made the modestly successfulKingdom of Heaven, a film about theCrusades. The film starredOrlando Bloom, and marked Scott's first collaboration with the composerHarry Gregson-Williams.[66]The Moroccan government sent the Moroccan cavalry as extras for some battle scenes.[67]Unhappy with the theatrical version ofKingdom of Heaven(which he blamed on paying too much attention to the opinions of preview audiences in addition to relenting when Fox wanted 45 minutes shaved off), Scott supervised a director's cut of the film, the true version of what he wanted, which was released on DVD in 2006.[68]The director's cut ofKingdom of Heavenhas been met with critical acclaim, withEmpiremagazine calling the film an "epic", adding: "The added 45 minutes in the director's cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle."[69]"This is the one that should have gone out" reflected Scott.[69]Asked if he was against previewing in general in 2006, Scott stated: "It depends who's in the driving seat. If you've got a lunatic doing my job, then you need to preview. But a good director should be experienced enough to judge what he thinks is the correct version to go out into the cinema."[70]
Scott teamed up again withGladiatorstarRussell CroweforA Good Year, based on the best-selling book byPeter Mayleabout an investment banker who finds a new life inProvence. The film was released on 10 November 2006. A few days laterRupert Murdoch, chairman of studio20th Century Fox(who backed the film) dismissedA Good Yearas "a flop" at a shareholders' meeting.[71]
Scott's next film wasAmerican Gangster, based on the story of real-life drug kingpinFrank Lucas. Scott took over the project in early 2006 and had screenwriterSteven Zaillianrewrite his script to focus on the dynamic between Frank Lucas andRichie Roberts.Denzel Washingtonsigned on to the project as Lucas, with Russell Crowe co-starring as Roberts.

Scott directedThe Counselor(2013), with a screenplay by authorCormac McCarthy.[80][81]On 25 October 2013,Indiewirereported that "Before McCarthy sold his first spec script for Scott's (The Counselor) film, the director was heavily involved in developing an adaptation of the author's 1985 novelBlood Meridianwith screenwriterBill Monahan(The Departed). But as Scott said in aTime Outinterview, '[Studios] didn't want to make it. The book is so uncompromising, which is what's great about it.' Described as an 'anti-western'..."[82]Scott directed thebiblically inspiredepic filmExodus: Gods and Kings, released in December 2014 which received negative reviews from critics (particularly for the casting of white actors asMiddle Easterncharacters) and grossed $268 million worldwide on a $140 million budget, making it afinancial disappointment.

We cannot let one person's action affect the good work of all these other people. It's that simple."[100]Scott began re-shooting Spacey's scenes with Plummer on 20 November, which included filming atElveden Hallin west Suffolk, England.[100]With a release date of 25 December 2017, the film studio had its doubts that Scott would manage it, saying: "They were like, 'You'll never do it.

Scott's first television directing role in 50 years,Raised by Wolves, was released onHBO Maxin 2020.[130][131]Scott said his "tendency was to think, 'I don't want to go down that road of androids again'", but decided to take on the project after he read the script and liked it.[131]The show revolves around androids Mother and Father, who attempt to save humankind on planet Kepler-22b after earth is demolished by war between the Mithraic, who follow a god called Sol, and militant atheists.[132]

Scott later married advertising executive Sandy Watson in 1979, with whom he had a daughter,Jordan Scott, also a director, and divorced in 1989.[135]In 2015 he married actressGiannina Facio,[136]whom he has cast in all his films sinceWhite SquallexceptAmerican GangsterandThe Martian.[137]He divides his time between homes in London, France, and Los Angeles.[83]

In 2013, Scott stated that he is anatheist.[143]Although when asked by theBBCin a September 2014 interview if he believes in God, Scott replied:
I'm not sure. I think there's all kinds of questions raised... that's such an exotic question. If we looked at the whole thing practically speaking, the Big Bang occurred and then we go through this evolution of millions, billions of years where, by coincidence, all the right biological accidents came out the right way. To an extent, that doesn't make sense unless there was a controlling decider or mediator in all of that. So who was that? Or what was that? Are we one big grand experiment in the basic overall blink of the universe, or the galaxy? In which case, who is behind it?[144]
Scott's frequent collaboratorRussell Crowecommented, "I like being on Ridley's set because actors can perform [...] and the focus is on the performers."[145]Paul M. Sammon, in his bookFuture Noir: The Making ofBlade Runner, commented in an interview with Brmovie.com that Scott's relationship with his actors has improved considerably over the years.[146]More recently during the filming of Scott's 2012 film,Prometheus,Charlize Theronpraised the director's willingness to listen to suggestions from the cast for improvements in the way their characters are portrayed on screen. Theron worked alongside the writers and Scott to give more depth to her character during filming.[147]When working on epics, Scott states, "there's always the danger that the characters can get swamped" on a large canvas, before adding, "My model isDavid Lean, whose characters never got lost in the proscenium."[148]
Scott's work is identified for its striking visuals, withheroinesalso a common theme.[2][11][149][150]Los Angeles Timesfilm editor Joshua Rothkopf wrote "Scott may be the movies' most consistent stealth feminist".[109]His visual style, incorporating a detailed approach to production design and innovative, atmospheric lighting, has been influential on a subsequent generation of filmmakers.[2][3]James Cameroncommented, "I love Ridley's films and I love his filmmaking, I love the beauty of the photography, I love the visceral sense that you're there, that you're present."[151]Scott commonly uses slow pacing until the action sequences. Examples includeAlienandBlade Runner; theLos Angeles Timescritic Sheila Benson, for example, would call the latter "Blade Crawler" "because it's so damn slow". Scott claims to have aneidetic memory, which he says aids him in visualising and storyboarding the scenes in his films.[152]
Scott has developed a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: "I like working, always, with a minimum of three cameras. [...] So those 50 set-ups [a day] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up. So you're finished. I mean, if you take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and – whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up – then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on."[145]
Artificial intelligenceis a theme that appears in several of Scott's films, includingBlade Runner,Alien, andPrometheus.[153]The 2013 bookThe Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scottidentifies pioneering computer scientistAlan Turingand the philosopherJohn Searleas presenting relevant models of testing artificial intelligence known as theTuring testand theChinese RoomThought Experiment, respectively, in the chapter titled "What's Wrong with Building Replicants", which has been a recurring theme for many of Scott's films.[154]The chapter titled "Artificial Intelligence inBlade Runner,Alien, andPrometheus," concludes by citing the writings ofJohn Stuart Millin the context of Scott's Nexus-6 Replicants inBlade Runner(Rutger Hauer), the androidAsh(Ian Holm) inAlien, and the androidDavid 8(Michael Fassbender) inPrometheus, where Mill is applied to assert that measures and tests of intelligence must also assess actions and moral behaviour in androids to effectively address the themes which Scott explores in these films.[155]
Scott providesaudio commentariesand interviews for all his films where possible. In the July 2006 issue ofTotal Filmmagazine, he stated: "After all the work we go through, to have it run in the cinema and then disappear forever is a great pity. To give the film added life is really cool for both those who missed it and those who really loved it."[70]
The positive reaction to theBlade RunnerDirector's Cutencouraged Scott to re-cut several movies that were a disappointment at the time of their release (includingLegendandKingdom of Heaven), which have been met with acclaim.[69]Today the practice of alternative cuts is more commonplace, though often as a way to make a film stand out in the DVD marketplace by adding new material.
Scott wasknightedin the2003 New Year Honoursfor services to the British film industry.[156]He received his accolade fromQueen Elizabeth IIat an investiture ceremony atBuckingham Palaceon 8 July 2003.[5]Scott admitted feeling "stunned and truly humbled" after the ceremony, saying, "As a boy growing up inSouth Shields, I could never have imagined that I would receive such a special recognition. I am truly humbled to receive this treasured award and believe it also further recognises the excellence of the British film industry."[157]He was appointed aKnight Grand CrossbyKing Charles IIIin 2024.[158]
He has been nominated for threeAcademy Awards for Directing—Thelma & Louise,GladiatorandBlack Hawk Down—as well as threeBritish Academy Film Awardsfor Best Director, fourGolden Globe Awardsfor Best Director, and twoPrimetime Emmy Awards. In 1995, Ridley and his brotherTonyreceived theBAFTAforOutstanding British Contribution To Cinema.[7]In 2018 he received the highest accolade from BAFTA, theBAFTA Fellowship, for lifetime achievement.[4][7]
Scott was inducted into theScience Fiction Hall of Famein 2007.[159]In 2017 the German newspaperFAZcompared Scott's influence on the science fiction film genre to SirAlfred Hitchcock's onthrillersandJohn Ford's onWesterns.[160]In 2011, he received astaron theHollywood Walk of Fame.[161]
Scott has received threeHugo Awardsin the category ofBest Dramatic PresentationforAlien,Blade RunnerandThe Martian.[162][163]In 2012, Scott was among the British cultural icons selected by artist SirPeter Blaketo appear in a new version of his most famous artwork, theBeatles'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Bandalbum cover, to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires to mark his 80th birthday.[164]On 3 July 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by theRoyal College of Artin a ceremony at theRoyal Albert Hallin London at which he described how he still keeps on his office wall his school report placing him 31st out of 31 in his class, and how his teacher encouraged him to pursue what became his passion at art school.[165][166]

Joffe, who moved the family to Hollywood.
Since her stepfather producedWoody Allen's films, Holofcener spent enough time on Allen's sets to be an extra inTake the Money and RunandSleeper.[9]Joffe was responsible for Holofcener's first "real" job in the movie industry: a production assistant on Woody Allen'sA Midsummer Night's Sex Comedyin 1982. She moved up to apprentice editor forHannah and Her Sisters(1986).
Holofcener's first experiences with film as a child left her either frightened or sad; she recalled her fright atJerry Lewis'sThe Nutty Professor. Holofcener originally wanted to become an artist like her father, but felt she wasn't as talented as others in her classes atSonoma State University.[10]From there, she gravitated into taking film courses.[9]She studied film at theTisch School of the ArtsatNew York Universityand atColumbia University, and made two shorts titledAngry[11]andIt's Richard I Love.[12]While at Columbia, she was taught byMartin Scorsese.[13]

Holofcener made her feature film writing and directing debut in 1996 withWalking and Talking, which starredCatherine Keener,Anne Heche,Todd Field,Liev Schreiber, andKevin Corrigan.[12][21]The film was critically acclaimed.[22]Her understanding of modern, professional women made her an ideal choice to direct female-centric television shows likeSex and the City,Leap of FaithandGilmore Girls.[12]Holofcener also worked on an episode of the U.S. adaptation ofCold Feet.[17]
She followed in 2001 with her second feature,Lovely and Amazing.[23]Featuring performances by Catherine Keener,Brenda Blethyn,Emily Mortimerand newcomerRaven Goodwin, the film was not only critically acclaimed[12]but did well at the box office.[citation needed]

In 2015, it was announced that Holofcener was set to direct an adaptation ofLee Israel's memoirCan You Ever Forgive Me?, withJulianne Moorein the lead role.[30]However, later that year, Moore was fired by Holofcener, who would later leave her directing role.[31]EventuallyMelissa McCarthywas selected for the lead role.[31]The film, ultimately directed byMarielle Heller, was well-received by critics and garnered Holofcener a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and aWriters Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.[31]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
