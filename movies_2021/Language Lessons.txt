Language Lessonsis a 2021 Americanscreenlifedrama filmdirected byNatalie Morales(in her directorial debut) and written by Morales andMark Duplass. The film stars Morales, Duplass andDesean Terry.[4]
The film follows the unexpected friendship that develops between Adam, a man whose husband surprises him with online Spanish lessons, and his teacher, Cariño.
The film had its worldwide premiere at the71st Berlin International Film Festivalon March 1, 2021.[5]It was released on September 10, 2021, byShout! Studios.
Spanish instructor Cariño logs on for an online lesson with a student and is surprised to discover her student, Adam, was unaware of the lesson. To their surprise they learn that Adam's husband Will, who was raised in various countries in Latin America, purchased the lesson as a surprise to help him brush up on his Spanish.
Adam is further surprised to learn that Will signed him up for 100 lessons. Despite some awkwardness, he goes along with the lesson. Cariño learns that, through his marriage to Will, Adam is extremely wealthy. He decides to continue with the lessons, promising to return in a week.
Cariño logs on for their second lesson and finds Adam still in bed. He reveals that Will died the night before, having been hit by a car while jogging; Adam has not told anyone else about what happened. When Adam begins to panic Cariño helps to calm him down by showing him the gardens near where she lives, eventually lulling him to sleep. Cariño continues to reach out, sending video messages and offering a homework assignment and self-care tips. At first, Adam declines the assignment as he is still in grief but gradually he takes it up and resolves to continue learning.
For their third lesson, Cariño’s video appears not to be working due to poor Internet reception. They chat about Will’s passing and Adam reveals that, prior to their relationship, he had been married to a woman and in denial about being gay. During their discussion, Cariño accidentally turns her camera on, revealing her badly bruised face. She claims the bruises came from falling off her bike and becomes offended when Adam offers to buy her a new one. He later records a message, apologizing for making her uncomfortable but also revealing that he knows her bike story is a lie.
At the start of their fourth lesson, Adam asks how Cariño is doing, but she gets straight into the lesson, wanting to work on his grammar. Adam prefers that they talk candidly as they have in the past, but Cariño insists, wanting to maintain a professional relationship. He asks why she didn’t respond to his earlier messages, and she defensively replies that she just forgot to.
Adam later gets a call from a drunken Cariño at 2:30 AM; she plays him guitar and sings him happy birthday. He asks how she knew it was his birthday, and she admits she stalked his social media as she wanted to know more about him. As they talk, Cariño reveals that she isn’t actually certified to teach Spanish and is recently divorced. The next morning, Cariño records a message apologizing for the late call and canceling their future lessons as she is dealing with personal issues; however, she deletes it without sending it.
During their next call, Cariño again tries to maintain a professional distance, but he presses her, asking directly if her ex-husband beat her and offering to help. After Adam tells Cariño he loves her, she mocks him for making assumptions about her personal life. She tells him that she hasn't seen her ex in years and the bruises came from a bar fight. Still sensing there is something wrong, Adam asks Cariño what is happening with her. She reveals she suspects she has cancer as she found a lump and both her mother and maternal grandmother died of the disease. Adam offers to support her, but Cariño says it would be best if they ceased all contact and logs off.
Adam sends Cariño a video message, offering to fly her toOaklandand help her with medical bills. If she doesn’t want to, he still thanks her for her friendship and helping him through Will’s death. He sends another message later, apologizing if he offended her and admitting he misses her and just wants to talk. As he records the message, Cariño appears behind him, suitcases in hand, having decided to accept his offer; they meet for the first time in person and embrace.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
