Ron's Gone Wrongis the first feature film fromLocksmith Animation,[6]and was animated byDNEG Animation. Animation and voice acting for the film were all done remotely during theCOVID-19 pandemic.
The film had its world premiere at the 2021BFI London Film Festivalon October 9, 2021, and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on October 15, 2021, and in the United States on October 22, 2021, by20th Century Studios. It is the first animated feature film to be theatrically released under the studio's new name, 20th Century Studios, following theacquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney. The film grossed $60.7 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics.
Tech giantBubble unveils their latest creation: the Bubble Bot (or B-bot for short), created by Bubble'sCEOMarc Wydell with the intent to make a robot buddy that is designed to help make friends viaalgorithm. In the town of Nonsuch,California, middle schooler Barney Pudowski, whose mother passed away, is the only kid in his class who does not have a B-bot. His former childhood friends, Savannah Meades, Rich Belcher, Noah, and Ava have all become absorbed by their individual B-bots. On Barney's birthday, his father, Graham, and his 78-year-old Bulgarian grandmother, Donka, come to realize that he does not have any friends. They hastily go to a Bubble store, but it closes for the day, leading them to take a slightly damaged one that fell from a delivery van.
Barney receives the B-bot as his late-birthday gift, but upon activating it, he quickly learns that it is defective and glitchy. Not wanting to upset his father, Barney decides to take it back to the Bubble store to get it fixed, but ends up running into Rich and his friends, who taunt and try to humiliate Barney. The B-bot begins to fight back as his safety functions have been disabled, with him and Barney happily running off. However, Rich calls the police and they, along with Graham and Donka, are taken to the Bubble store so that the B-bot can be recycled. Not wanting to see him go, Barney secretly rescues him and names him Ron Bintscatsco, after his model number; R0NB1NT5CAT5CO.
When Barney and Ron's actions are reported, Marc is happy to see Ron go against his programming while his fellow executive Andrew Morris views it as bad publicity, believing Ron must be destroyed for the issue to be resolved. Barney teaches Ron how to be a good friend and, while hanging out, runs into Savannah, who shows Ron that his purpose is to help Barney get friends. Despite Barney telling Savannah not to, she posts Ron's actions online, alerting Bubble. The next day, Ron gets out of the house and tries to get "friends" for Barney, bringing a series of random people to school. After Barney gets in trouble, Rich discovers Ron's unlocked function and downloads it, causing all the other B-bots to have their safety features turned off. The B-bots run wild, prompting a patch update to be sent to them, but not before Savannah is publicly humiliated.
Barney is kicked out from school and tells Ron off, but upon returning home, realizes that Ron was just trying to be a friend exactly the way he was taught.  He decides to run away with Ron when Bubble employees come for them. They briefly run into Savannah, still upset over her incident, and tells her that he's going to hide in the woods. Meanwhile, while Andrew warns Marc about the ramifications of the B-bot, Marc sneaks away so that he can meet Ron while Bubble uses their resources to take control of all the B-bots to go looking for Ron and Barney in the woods. Due to the cold weather and Barney'sasthma, he becomes weak and Ron brings him back to civilization just outside the school where Savannah, Rich, Noah, and Ava rush out to help him.
Barney is taken to the hospital and recuperates before meeting Marc, who has patched Ron to make him like every other B-Bot. Barney demands that Marc access the cloud to get Ron's original personality, but Andrew has since taken over the company and locked Marc out. Through an elaborate plan in which Barney, Graham, Donka and Marc break into Bubble HQ, Barney manages to make it to the Bubble database, finds Ron's original data and uploads him back into his body, restoring him back to his original code. Seeing that Bubble has direct access to everyone's B-bot and realizing that Savannah, Rich, Noah, and Ava are just as lonely as he was, Barney suggests upgrading all the B-bots to have Ron's flaws. However, this means that Ron will be dispersed. Barney reluctantly says goodbye to Ron as his programming is spread to everyone, mixing Marc's friendship algorithm with Ron's code. MarcblackmailsAndrew into giving his position of CEO back after secretly recording him admitting that the B-botsspy on their ownersfor profit.
Three months later, everyone has a faulty B-bot, but are happy with their weird and wild personalities. Barney (who is now allowed back in school) no longer has one, but has become much more sociable and has gotten close with his former friends (which includes deleting the humiliating video of Savannah). As they hang out at recess, a giant Bubble tower that overlooks Nonsuch produces Ron's face, implying that he is still alive.
After foundingLocksmith Animation,Sarah Smithwanted to create a film that observed the impact of the internet on children's relationships and self-esteem, which she realised could be made into a film after watchingHer(2013), commenting "we have to make that film for kids, to [help] them evaluate those experiences".[7]Smith approachedPeter Baynhamwith one paragraph of story where a robot learns through imitation, Smith said that Baynham asked "what if it was an idiot and it was annoying?"[8]Despite creating a British animated film, a creative decision was made to set it in a United States suburb. Locksmith co-founder Julie Lockhart explained, "From a design perspective, the fact that all the big tech companies are in California made it feel that’s where it should be. We're also making films for a global audience that may not specifically be about British culture."[9]
Locksmith had a troubled history in securing a distributor for the project. In May 2016, the studio formed a production deal withParamount Picturesin which they would distribute Locksmith's films under theirParamount Animationbanner.[10]However, the following year Paramount abandoned the deal when Paramount chairman and CEOBrad Greywas replaced byJim Gianopulos.[11]In September 2017, Locksmith formed a multi-year production deal with20th Century Fox, which would distribute their films under the20th Century Fox Animationlabel with Locksmith aiming to theatrically release a film every 12–18 months.[11][12]Theacquisition of 20th Century Fox by Disneyled to concern that the distribution deal would be lost again.[13]Smith said the resulting acquisition was "terrifying", and described the prospect of promoting the project to Disney executives as "carrying coals to Newcastle", but ultimately they were supportive of the project.[14]After production began on the film, Locksmith moved toWarner Bros. Picturesfor its three films (Bad Fairies,The Lunar ChroniclesandWed Wabbit).[15]
On October 12, 2017, it was announced that the project would be titledRon's Gone Wrong, and will serve as the first animated feature film from Locksmith Animation.Alessandro Carloniand Jean-Phillipe Vine were announced to serve as the film's co-directors with Octavio E. Rodriguez. The visual effects companyDNEG Animationwas on board as a digital production partner to provide the film's computer animation (being credited under "Feature Animation byDNEG").[16]Also, Baynham, who previously worked with Smith onArthur Christmas(2011), andElisabeth Murdochwere announced to executive produce the film with Smith.[17]
In test screenings, Smith was surprised to find that Donka was a popular character with children. The scene where Donka dances on a table with Ron was a favorite scene for children, and Smith viewed this as "comedy there that they haven't seen before".[14]
Grazer first began recording lines for the role of Barney in 2017 when he was 13 and did not finalize his role until early 2021 by the time he was 18. Grazer said that it became difficult to maintain his 13-year-old prepubescent voice throughout the years of recording.[18]He was originally introduced as atest voicefor earlyanimatics, but Smith kept him on after being astounded by the emotional range of his performance.[19]
Galifianakis was instructed to perform much of his lines for the role of Ron in a deadpan voice, to convey that Ron is run by an algorithm and is not very emotional. He commented that this was challenging and unusual, because he had never had directors in the past ask for "less" emotion. Smith praised Helms' performance in the role of Graham for skillfully improvising lines and contributing additional "touches" to the film, saying "You give him the lines and he’ll do six versions of his own and he’s hilarious".[14]
The character of Ron was designed to be aesthetically reminiscent of "stripped-down" computer software, with the pixelated interfaces of theMS-DOSoperating system being a source of inspiration. Emphasis was placed on allowing Ron's animated performance to be versatile within the constraints of his design, which demanded precise control over his motion graphicsskinthat deliver his facial expressions.[20]This included allowing his face slide all across his body, such as his eyeballs appearing between his legs when picked up.[21]Baynham explained "he doesn't have a face that you can do all the classic things with, but somehow he does... like the way his eye might slip a little bit... that speaks to his simple clownishness."[22]Vine referred to Ron's behaviour as being alike to theClippypersonal assistant, describing him "cheerfully and annoyingly helpful all the time".[23]Locksmith consulted with the toy designerSpheroto investigate what would be a realistic design for a social media robot.[24]Vine said, "we wanted the movie to feel like it’s set right around now so the bot needs to feel tangible".[8]Animation director Eric Leighton explained that it was important to track the emotional state of Ron to determine his range of behaviour. The scene where Ron physically attacks children is where he is "the most broken that a robot could possibly be", and the scene where he is reprogrammed is at his most benign. The whole movie was shot out of sequence in favor of doing scenes across his degrees of "brokenness".[20]The character design of Barney was distinguished through coordinated color palettes; Barney's clothes are patterned in "earth tones" to indicate his love of nature, and his home is vibrant in contrast to the muted colors of other homes in the town he lives in.[20]
DNEG had to develop a new "shot-based" animation process for creating the film, in changeover from previously specializing invisual effectsfor live-action cinema. The animation softwarePixar RenderManwas used for the film, and theUniversal Scene Descriptionfile format was adopted a third of the way during production.[25]
Production was impacted by theCOVID-19 pandemicin 2020. Animation for the film was done remotely with crew members working from home, which included digital modelling, rigging, and lighting. Editors faced difficulty assembling footage with temporarily out-of-sync audio, which impaired judgement over the timing of edits. Voice acting was also done remotely, and involved makeshift home recording setups where blankets were used for soundproofing. A voice actor even had to ask family members sharing an internet connection to come offline, in order to free bandwidth for a recording session.[26][27][7]
A labor dispute arose over DNEG announcing 20%-25% pay cuts to employees earning more than£35,000 per year, which it said was due to business disruption caused byCOVID-19. This led to 169 employees signing a collective grievance statement. The move was later partially reversed; DNEG was forced to reach deals with its business partners, this included Locksmith who agreed to offer a salary top-up and completion bonus to employees working on the film. The trade unionBECTUcondemned DNEG for its refusal to communicate with the union, and said its response to the collective grievance was deliberately indirect.[28][29]The film took approximately five years to complete.[20]
Henry Jackmancomposed the film score.[32]Speaking about the score, Jackman said that "it has its own identity, similar toWreck-It RalphorBig Hero 6" having the "same musical landscape and color in this film",[33]and also had enjoyed working in the film, calling the scoring sessions as "enormous fun".[34]Vine and Smith expressed gratitude to Jackman on how his score elevated the film. Smith wanted the score to have a "contemporaryJohn Hughesfeel along with a classic 'high school movie' vibe and the orchestral scale and emotion ofE.T.on top".[35]The score was recorded atAbbey Road StudiosandAir StudiosinLondon, England.
Jackman composed most of the tracks, with two songs in collaboration withDave Bayleyof the indie-pop bandGlass Animals.[36]Liam Payneperformed an original song titled "Sunshine" and its music video was released on August 27, 2021.[30][31]The soundtrack was released digitally on October 15, 2021, byWalt Disney Recordsand in physical formats on October 22 as the first20th Century Studiossoundtrack film to be released under the mainWalt Disney Recordslabel.[37]
In October 2017,Ron's Gone Wrongwas scheduled for a theatrical release on November 6, 2020.[38]In November 2019, the film was moved to February 26, 2021.[39]In May 2020, the film was moved to April 23, 2021, as a result of theCOVID-19 pandemic.[40][41]On January 22, 2021, the film was then delayed further to October 22, 2021, inRealD 3Doriginally.[42]The film also had its world premiere as the headlining act of the 2021BFI London Film Festivalon October 9, 2021, making it a Special BFI Presentation.[43][3]On the same date, the film premiered at the 36thGuadalajara International Film Festival's Guadalajara opening celebration event.[43]The film was premiered in United Kingdom on October 15, 2021. The film also held a special surprise screening premiere at theEl Capitan Theatreon the day of its USA theatrical release date of October 22, 2021.[44]The film played exclusively in theaters for 45 days before heading to digital platforms.[45]
The film is also the only film under Locksmith's deal with20th Century Studios, as the animation studio's next film,That Christmas, is set to be released onNetflix. Following this, Locksmith had also struck a new deal withWarner Bros. Picturesto distribute three films (Bad Fairies,The Lunar ChroniclesandWed Wabbit) underWarner Bros.

James Mottram ofThe South China Morning Postwrote: "sweet, heart-warming and frighteningly prescient,Ron's Gone Wrongis one of the best animated films in recent memory".[54]Tim Robey ofThe Daily Telegraphgave the film four out of five and said that the film is "visualised with verve" and that "it's a zingy and mercilessly funny satire on how devices, with their ever-so-friendly interfaces, have in fact become our despots".[55]Ben Kenigsberg ofThe New York Timessaid "As family entertainment, it's fine."[56]Peter BradshawofThe Guardiangave the film three out of five, saying that the film was "entertaining, though composed with algorithmic precision", adding that "it winds up suspiciously neutral about whether kids really should abandon digital enslavement in favour of real-life human friends."[57]Pat Padua ofThe Washington Postgave the film three out of four, writing that it "has plenty of slapstick and potty humor for kids. But adults will also be intrigued by its frequently scathing (albeit somewhat conflicted) critique of consumerism."[58]Mark Kermodesaid that the film was "really good fun and a real surprise".[59]
Anna SmithofDeadline Hollywood Dailywrote that the film was "one for all the family - just put your cellphones away first". Brandon Zachary ofCBRwrote "What starts as a movie you'd expect to know every twist to transcends into something far more interesting."[60]Charles Bramesco ofThe A.V. Clubwrote: "As in the curiously similarThe Mitchells vs. the Machines, the misadventures transmit a light-hearted commentary on the wonders and hazards of our screen-saturated culture."[61]Wendy Ide ofScreen Internationalsaid that the film "transcends the familiarity of the story with deft writing, appealing animation and a big heart crammed into a small malfunctioning robot".[62]Angie Han ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote "What the animated feature lacks in daring imagination, it makes up for with endearing good humor, thoughtful cultural critique and one heck of a cute robot."[63]Mark Kennedy of theAssociated Presswas more critical of the film, describing it as "a derivative tale about a middle schooler and his quirky computer sidekick" and writing that it "seems to want to preach we should all disconnect from our devices and restore human contact. But then what will the filmmakers do with all that adorable merch?"[64]Michael Ordoña ofThe Los Angeles Timeswrote that the film "dots its primer on friendship with chase scenes and warnings about Big Tech with only mixed success".[65]Yolanda Machando ofTheWrapwrote that the film "offers partially realized messaging about social media while populating the story with elementary sight gags, too many overused "fish out of water" tropes and attractive merchandise options".[66]
According toNielsen ratings,Ron's Gone Wrongwas the third most streamed feature film worldwide across all major platforms between December 13 and December 19, 2021.[67]Screen Rantreported that within the United States it was the most viewed feature film on Disney+ after two days of appearing on the service on December 15.[68]

He reflected, "I'm small and would basically float around inside the suit like a confusedfoetus, trying to pick up spanners and operate awalkie-talkie".[4]Baynham is qualified to navigate asupertanker.[5]After five years, he was made redundant due to government cuts in defence.

He earned around £20 (GBP) per gig, and made £4,500 in his first year. To additionally support himself, he wrote sketches for the topical radio comedyWeek Ending. He earned £18 for each minute of material, and contributed around two minutes of material each week. After four years he felt his stand-up career was not progressing, and decided to commit to radio.[1]He became cast for the comedy sketch radio seriesFist of Fun.[6][7]
Aiming to break into television, Baynham wrote one-liner jokes for a Friday night show presented byTerry Wogan. He was unimpressed by Wogan's delivery of the jokes.[1]Baynham, working at theBBCoffices, encounteredArmando Iannucciwhile looking for photocopier paper. Iannucci would introduce him toChris Morris, who was creating the news satireThe Day Today. Although Morris was not interested in accepting more writers for the project, he was made a writer after Morris was impressed by a sketch he wrote that involved horses infesting theLondon Underground.[2]He also appears in a sketch as a reporter named Colin Poppshed who presented "Gay News", where he farcically announces the gayness of various "roads, periodic table elements, cars, and walls".[8]He also became a guest and contributor for the radio seriesThe Chris Morris Music Show; he was suspended by the BBC for two weeks for conceiving a joke where Morris falsely implies on air thatMichael Heseltinehad died. Baynham stated that Morris technically did not announce his death, and had only said "if there is any news of Michael Heseltine's death in the next hour, we'll let you know".[2]Other radio work included being cast forLee and Herring.[5]
Baynham became a writer for the sitcomI'm Alan Partridge, a spin-off of the comedy characterAlan Partridgeas performed bySteve CooganinThe Day Today, an incompetent sports reporter progressed as a tactless and self-satisfied television personality. He thought that Alan Partridge was underdeveloped because the format ofThe Day Todaymade him "bracketed and contained within presenting to [the] camera". Here he would realise Alan Partridge as a "three-dimensional" character. He, with the writing team, appliedworldbuilding, such as establishing the geography of Alan Partridge's residence of "Linton Travel Tavern".[9]Coogan credited Baynham for making Alan Partridge more human and sympathetic.[2]Baynham described his work onI'm Alan Partridgeas a highly productive and enjoyable period of his career, saying "It's my happiest, most fun writing experience ever really, it was just so exciting".[9]
In the same period,Fist of Funtransferred to television where Baynham makes an on-screen appearance of his character "Peter", a "stinking 32-year-old Welsh virgin".[3][10]He also served as writer and host of theArmisticenews review shows.[1][3][11]Baynham created and performed the character "Terry fromPontypridd" in a popular television advertising campaign forPot Noodle, promoted with the catchphrase "they're too gorgeous". The campaign propelled him to unexpected fame; he reported that strangers would shout "gorgeous" at him in public, and that a university student threw a Pot Noodle at him on stage while touring withLee and Herring.[1][12][13][14]Other television work includeBrass Eyewith Morris, notably as writer for the controversial special "Paedogeddon!" that attracted widespread media attention for its comedic portrayal ofpaedophilia.[2][15]Other credits include writer for episodes ofBob and Margaret,[16]and writing additional material for the sketch showBig Train.[17]He served as writer for the radio seriesBlue Jam, which transferred to television asJam.[5]He also became a guest for the radio comedy game showThe 99p Challenge.[5]
He became writer for the animated sketch comedyMonkey Dust.[5][16]He created the animated black comedyI am Not an Animal, which follows a group of intelligent talking animals who escape avivisectionlaboratory.[5][16]
Baynham felt uncertain about his future in television afterI Am Not an Animalwas poorly received by BBC executives, one of whom told him, "I won't be paying a return visit to this". Meanwhile, he received a phone call fromSacha Baron Cohenwho asked him if he could help continue his faltering feature film project he had been working on based on the comedy characterBorat. Baynham replied that he was not interested because he was working on creating his own sitcom, but then changed his mind and phoned Baron Cohen later that day expressing interest, and became writer for the 2006 filmBorat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.[2]After the success ofBorat, he continued his collaboration with Baron Cohen and became writer for the 2009 filmBrüno.[18]
Under directorJason Winerhe became writer for the 2011 filmArthur, a recreation ofthe 1981 filmstarringRussell Brand.[19]
Earlier, in 2005, Baynham conceived of a Christmas story whereSanta Claushas an "impractical and useless" son, and collaborated withSarah SmithatAardman Animationsto write a screenplay for the 2011 filmArthur Christmas.[20]The story deals with Santa's global operation to deliver presents to every child, which Baynham said he considered with "pedantic" detail, such as what would be mathematically possible in 12 hours with one million elves and a mile wide spaceship.[21]
Under directorGenndy Tartakovskyhe became writer for the 2012 animated filmHotel Transylvania.[22]
Baynham collaborated with Iannucci and Coogan again to create a feature film based on Alan Partridge, and became writer for the 2013 filmAlan Partridge: Alpha Papa.[13]
With Baron Cohen again he became writer for the 2016 filmGrimsby,[23]and continued this collaboration as writer for the 2020 filmBorat Subsequent Moviefilm, a sequel to the previousBoratfilm.[2]
In 2021, Baynham - along with close friend and long-time collaborator Jeremy Simmonds - launched the surreal comedy podcastBrain Cigar. This has so far run to six episodes and a 'Christmas special'.[24]
James Rampton writing forThe Independentdescribed him as "an anonymous foot-soldier in Armando Iannucci's all-conquering comedy army".[3]Brendon Connelley writing for/Filmsaid, "Baynham isn't exactly comedy royalty in the UK — more like a secret power behind the thrones".[19]Baynham himself reflected, "It feels quite cool, in a mad way, to be someone who skulks about in the shadows".[15]Kathryn Williams forWalesOnlineargued that he "revolutionised both topical satire and character comedy in the 1990s", along with Iannucci, Coogan, and Morris.[11]
Baynham settled inLos Angelesafter completingBorat.[2]He is a citizen of the United States.[25]

Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
