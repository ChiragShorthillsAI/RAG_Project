Trollhunters: Rise of the Titansis a 2021 American animatedscience fantasyaction filmdirected by Johane Matte, Francisco Ruiz Velasco, and Andrew Schmidt, and written byGuillermo del Toro,Marc GuggenheimandDan and Kevin Hageman(who also produced the film). It is the finale of theTales of Arcadiafranchise byGuillermo del Toro, which features the television seriesTrollhunters,3BelowandWizards. A year after the events ofWizards, the Guardians of Arcadia reunite for the final time as they battle the nefarious Arcane Order, who have reawakened the primordial Titans.
It was released on Netflix on July 21, 2021. While critical reception was positive, fan reception was mixed.
Following the events ofWizards, master wizard Hisirdoux "Douxie" Casperan and former Arcane Order member Nari lure their pursuers Belloc and Skrael onto a moving subway train in Metro City where they launch a surprise attack with former Trollhunter Jim Lake Jr. and his girlfriend Claire Nunez. Jim is wounded during the fight while his best friend Toby Domzaski accidentally snaps the train’s brakes, causing the train to be unable to stop, and complicating things for Prince Krel Taron, Steve Palchuck and Stuart as they are tasked to use 'trifurcate radiation' to negate the wizards' magic. The subway then breaks out of the station and almost collides into a shop in the city’s square, narrowly avoiding the crowd. Then, Belloc and Skreal start a fire, with innocent civilians at risk. They threaten the lives of the bystanders unless Nari comes with them. Douxie has a genius idea, and swaps his mind with Nari's. It ultimately ends in the Arcane Order capturing Nari, unaware that Douxie swapped minds with her prior to her capture, the group being detained by the police before they escape.
Jim recovers in a newly rebuilt Camelot while learning his mother Barbara is engaged to his former teacher and principal, the changeling Strickler. The group are then joined by Queen Aja Tarron and matured Eli Pepperjack, Steven unknowingly made himself pregnant when he kissed Aja for the seventh time. Blinky Galadrigal relays what he learned to reveal the Order's plan to awakening the Titans and have them converge at Arcadia Oaks, the center of the universe, to unite and recreate the world by destroying the current one. At that time, the Order discovers Douxie’s spell and reverts the two back to their normal bodies, but not before Nari alerts Jim, "Trollhunter make the ninth configuration, Krohnisfere will make right". The heroes enter the Round Table and discover that the Arcane Order is already preparing a ritual to break the Genesis Seals. The heroes fail to prevent the ritual from carried out with each member of the order piloting their respective titan.
The heroes split up: Claire, Blinky, Douxie’s familiar Archie, and Archie’s father Charlemagne head to theHong KongTrollmarket in Hong Kong to acquire the Krohnisfere from the TrollDragon Zong-Shi; Krel leads Stuart, Steve, and Eli to retrieveExcalibur, while the rest split into two teams in an attempt to stop the titans of Skreal and a brainwashed Nari. Nomura's team goes to tropicalBrazilwhile Strickler's team heads to icyGreenland. But it ends with Strickler and his fellow changeling Nomura killed in battle while Claire’s team manages to acquire the Krohnisfere, but are forced to leave Archie and his father behind when Belloc's titan destroys the bridge while defeating Varvatos Vex in a gigantic robotic suit of the fictional Gun Robot. The heroes reunite and Douxie restores Nari’s freewill. When asked of the Krohnisfere, Nari tells Jim that "Time unfolds differently, like a flower. Only the Trollhunter will know" before using her Titan to battle and kill Skrael in his Titan, killing herself as well.
As Belloc's titan continues its advance, Blinky realizes the Titans are meant to join with a Heartstone and that the union of Trollmarket's Heartstone and Bellroc's Titan will cause the world to be reborn in fire. The group arrive ahead of Belloc while Jim realizes that the ninth configuration is meant to represent him and his friends, enabling Jim to finally pull Excalibur out of the stone. The heroes come face to face with Bellroc, who proves to be too powerful for them to handle. As Jim is left alone to face Bellroc, he comes to accept that the amulet never made him a hero and he already was one. Jim’s newly improved amulet (created with Akiridion technology, from the original blueprints from which Merlin had used when he first built the amulet and the hilt stone from Excalibur) begins to respond to Jim and flies towards him, giving him a magic/Akiridion armor which can empower Excalibur with greater power. Toby, after remembering the anti-magic radiation generator from their first encounter with the Arcane Order, uses it on Bellroc, giving Jim the opportunity to strike Bellroc with Excalibur. Jim finds a fatally hurt Toby, who has been crushed by debris and thanks his friends in his final moments with remaining eight heroes left to mourn him.
Remembering Nari's words and realizing that the Krohnisfere is meant for him totravel back in timeand prevent any tragic events that happened to him and his dearest of friends, Jim decides to use to return to when he first became the Trollhunter. He gives an emotional farewell and travels back to the morning where he found the mystical amulet, making his first change to the timeline by having Toby find Merlin's amulet under the canals.
While planning the ending of theNetflix/DreamWorks AnimationsagaTales of Arcadia, the producers, wanting it to finish with anAvengers-style crossover,[1]debated whether to conclude it with additionalWizardsepisodes or a feature film, and eventually made a film because a cinematic format allowed them to "tell this story on the scope that [they] wanted and have the story be as big as [they] aspired it to be".[2]Aware that audiences watching the film would not necessarily be familiar with the rest of the saga, a recap prologue was written for the start of the film.[2]The film was also influenced byMarvel Studios'Avengersfilms, the filmmakers having taken a similar approach so audiences unfamiliar with the franchise could nevertheless enjoy the film's story.[1]According to writerMarc Guggenheim, early production on the film happened while the studio was working onWizards, which he felt gave the producers time to determine how to finish the saga's story.[2]The writers included references to executive-producerGuillermo del Toro'sPacific Rim, though they were careful to not to overload the film withPacific Rimeaster eggs.[2]
On August 7, 2020, it was revealed that Netflix and DreamWorks Animation were developing theTales of Arcadiafinale film,Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans, with Johane Matte, Francisco Ruiz Velasco, and Andrew Schmidt directing,Guillermo del Toro,Marc Guggenheimand theDan and Kevin Hagemanwriting and producing the film, with Chad Hammes andTales of ArcadiacreatorGuillermo del Toroexecutive-producing.[3][4]Emile Hirsch, Lexi Medrano,Charlie Saxton,Kelsey Grammer,Alfred Molina,Steven Yeun,Nick Frost,Colin O'Donoghue,Diego Luna,Tatiana Maslany,Cole Sand,Nick Offerman,Fred Tatasciore,Brian Blessed, Kay Bess, Piotr Michael,James Hong,Tom Kenny, Angel Lin,Amy Landecker,Jonathan Hyde,Bebe Wood,Laraine Newman, andCheryl Hineswere confirmed to be part of the cast of the film.[3]
The film was produced with a higher production budget than previous entries on the franchise and was provided by 88 Pictures,CGCG, Inc., and Original Force.[2]The filmmakers choose to start the film with a high speed chase sequence as a way to showcase the higher budget and animation quality to the audience.[2]
Jeff Danna, who previously composed3BelowandWizards, andScott Kirklandcomposed the score for the film.[5]Dana and Kirkland composed new themes exclusive to the film, while also including themes from the previousTales of Arcadiaseries in the score.[5]
On August 7, 2020, the film was confirmed to be released in 2021.[3][6]On April 27, 2021, the release date was revealed to be July 21, 2021.[7][8]The project marked the first DreamWorks Animation film to be released directly on a streaming service.[2]The movie was released on Netflix on July 21, 2021.[9]
OnRotten Tomatoesit has a 88% rating with an average rating of 6.90/10, based on reviews from 8 critics.[10]Caroline Cao ofDen of Geeksaid that no one apart from Jim receives "a culminating development," and argued that the film "bellows the epicness of a finale" with characters reaffirming "Trollhunters mantras" and praised the film for "notching the stakes and challenging the comfort of our characters," visual effects, imagination, and humor, However, Cao criticized the film for "the sudden insertion of a Chinese-based troll society" with hard-to-overlook "shades ofsinophobia" and says that the conclusion of the film goes against other possibilities and questions "all the emotional investment" made across the previous six seasons.[9]Jennifer Green ofCommon Sense Mediagave the film three out of five stars, pointed to "potentially upsetting violence" in the film, including apparent deaths of some characters, and others sacrificing themselves, but praised the film for having heroes which "show courage and teamwork to save the day" and said that fans would be "delighted" by the film.[11]Sarah Moran ofScreen Rantsaid that the film "delivers a strong finale...that doesn't limit the possibility of more to come" and delivers "a dramatic but happy ending...with a unexpected twist."[12][13]
Rafael Motamayor ofIGNsaid the film "delivers heavy emotions and grand-scale action" while praising it for ending Jim's story in a satisfying way and for huge action scenes. He also criticized it for not giving the huge cast enough time to explore all of their "major developments" by focusing solely on one character (Jim), and says that while the film can be strong for challenging the ideas of destiny and heroism, it has a finale which "may feel like a cop-out conclusion to some."[14]Zachary Guida ofScreen Rantargued that it failed to provide "an actual conclusion" to the story of Jim and his friends, inferring that Jim'stime travelmeans that theTales of Arcadiaseries are "officially...non-canon".[15]Renaldo Matadeen ofCBRargued that the children that Steve has during the film appear to be "nothing more than expendable cogs in a shock factor arc".[16]

Del Toro is close friends with fellow Mexican filmmakersAlfonso CuarónandAlejandro G. Iñárritu, and they are collectively known as "The Three Amigos of Mexican Cinema".[6]He has receivedseveral awardsincluding threeAcademy Awards, threeBAFTA Awards, twoGolden Globe Awards, aDaytime Emmy Award, and aGolden Lion. He was included inTimemagazine's list ofthe 100 most influential people in the worldin 2018,[7]and he received amotion picture staron theHollywood Walk of Famein 2019.[8]
Guillermo del Toro Gómez[9]was born inGuadalajaraon 9 October 1964, the son of Guadalupe Gómez Camberos and automotive entrepreneur Federico del Toro Torres.[10]Del Toro is ofSpanish,Irish, andGermandescent.[11]Raised in a strictCatholichousehold,[12]he attended theUniversity of Guadalajara's Centro de Investigación y Estudios Cinematográficos (Film Studies Center).[13]
When del Toro was about eight years old, he began experimenting with his father'sSuper 8camera, making short films withPlanet of the Apestoys and other objects. One short focused on a "serial killer potato" with ambitions of world domination; it murdered del Toro's mother and brothers before stepping outside and being crushed by a car.[14]Del Toro made about 10 short films before his first feature, including one titledMatilde, but only the last two,Doña LupeandGeometria, have been made available.[15]He wrote four episodes and directed five episodes of thecult seriesLa Hora Marcada, along with other Mexican filmmakers such asEmmanuel LubezkiandAlfonso Cuarón.[16]
His first movie was supposed to be a stop-motion sci-fi feature calledOmnivore, about a lizard-man born in a savage land where everything tries to eat everything else.[17]He and his team built sets and about 100 puppets over a three-year period prior to filming. Vandals burglarized the studio one night and destroyed the puppets and sets, which put an end to his project as del Toro decided to switch to a live-action film,Cronos.[18][19]
Del Toro studiedspecial effectsand make-up with special-effects artistDick Smith.[20]He spent 10 years as a special-effects make-up designer and formed his own company, Necropia. He also co-founded theGuadalajara International Film Festival. Later in his directing career, he formed his own production company, the Tequila Gang.[21]
In 1997, at the age of 33, Guillermo was given a $30 million budget fromMiramax Films(then owned byDisney) to shoot another film,Mimic. He was ultimately unhappy with the way Miramax treated him during production, which led to his friendJames Cameronalmost coming to blows with Miramax co-founder and ownerHarvey Weinsteinduring the70th Academy Awards.[22]
Del Toro has directed a wide variety of films, fromcomic bookadaptations (Blade II,Hellboyand its sequelHellboy II: The Golden Army) to historical fantasy andhorror films, two of which are set in Spain in the context of theSpanish Civil Warunder theauthoritarianrule ofFrancisco Franco. These two films,The Devil's BackboneandPan's Labyrinth, are among his most critically acclaimed works. They share similar settings, protagonists and themes with the 1973 Spanish filmThe Spirit of the Beehive, widely considered to be the finest Spanish film of the 1970s.[23]
I cannot pontificate about it, but by the time I'm done, I will have done one movie, and it's all the movies I want.
People say, you know, "I like your Spanish movies more than I like your English-language movies because they are not as personal," and I go "Fuck, you're wrong!"Hellboyis as personal to me asPan's Labyrinth. They're tonally different, and yes, of course you can like one more than the other—the other one may seem banal or whatever it is that you don't like. But it really is part of the same movie. You make one movie.Hitchcockdid one movie, all his life.
Del Toro views the horror genre as inherently political, explaining, "Much like fairy tales, there are two facets of horror. One is pro-institution, which is the most reprehensible type of fairy tale: Don't wander into the woods, and always obey your parents. The other type of fairy tale is completely anarchic and antiestablishment."[24]
He is close friends with two other prominent and critically praised Mexican filmmakersAlfonso CuarónandAlejandro González Iñárritu.[25]The three often influence each other's directorial decisions, and have been interviewed together byCharlie Rose. Cuarón was one of the producers ofPan's Labyrinth, while Iñárritu assisted in editing the film.

In 2012, del Toro participated in theSight & Soundfilm poll. Held every 10 years to select the greatest films of all time, contemporary directors are asked to select their 10 favorite films. Del Toro chose:[76]
Del Toro updated his list for the 2022 edition of the poll:[77]
Del Toro met and began dating Lorenza Newton, cousin of singerGuadalupe Pineda, when they were both studying at the Instituto de Ciencias in Guadalajara. They were married in 1986 and had two daughters together[78]before divorcing in September 2017.[79]In 2021, he married Kim Morgan, an American film historian who was formerly married to Canadian filmmakerGuy Maddin.[80]
Del Toro maintains homes inTorontoandLos Angeles, and returns to his nativeGuadalajaraevery six weeks to visit his family.[81]He also owns two houses devoted exclusively to his collection of books, poster artwork, and other belongings pertaining to his work. He explained, "As a kid, I dreamed of having a house with secret passages and a room where it rained 24 hours a day. The point of being over 40 is to fulfill the desires you've been harboring since you were 7."[24]
In a 2007 interview, del Toro described his political position as "a little tooliberal". He pointed out that the villains in most of his films (such as theindustrialistinCronos, theNazisinHellboy,Italian FascisminPinocchio, and theFrancoistsinPan's Labyrinth) are united by the common attribute ofauthoritarianism: "I hate structure. I'm completely anti-structural in terms of believing in institutions. I hate them. I hate any institutionalized social, religious, or economic thing."[82]
RaisedCatholic, del Toro toldCharlie Rosein a 2009 interview that his upbringing was excessively "morbid" and said, "I mercifullylapsedas a Catholic... but asBuñuelused to say, 'I'm an atheist, thank God.'" He insists that he is spiritually "not with Buñuel" and that he is "once a Catholic, always a Catholic, in a way". He concluded, "I believe in Man. I believe in mankind, as the worst and the best that has happened to this world."[83]He has also responded to the claim that he views his art as his religion: "It is. To me, art and storytelling serve primal, spiritual functions in my daily life. Whether I'm telling a bedtime story to my kids or trying to mount a movie or write a short story or a novel, I take it very seriously."[24]Nevertheless, he became a "ragingatheist" after seeing a pile of human fetuses while volunteering at a Mexican hospital.[84]He also said that he was horrified by the way the Catholic Church complied withFrancoist Spain, and even had a character in one of his films quote what actual priests would say toRepublican factionmembers in concentration camps.[85]Upon discovering the religious beliefs of English writerC. S. Lewis, del Toro stated that he could no longer relate to Lewis and his work, despite having done so beforehand.[86]He described Lewis as "too Catholic" for him, despite the fact that Lewis was never a Catholic.[87]
Del Toro is not entirely disparaging of Catholicism, and his background continues to influence his work. While discussingThe Shape of Water, he mentioned the Catholic influence on the film: "A very Catholic notion is the humble force, or the force of humility, that gets revealed as a god like figure toward the end. It's also used in fairy tales. In fairy tales, in fact, there is an entire strand of tales that would be encompassed by the title 'The Magical Fish'. And [it's] not exactly a secret that afish is a Christian symbol." In the same interview, he said, "I don't think there is life beyond death, I don't. But I do believe that we get this clarity in the last minute of our life. The titles we achieved, the honors we managed, they all vanish. You are left alone with you and your deeds and the things you didn't do. And that moment of clarity gives you either peace or the most tremendous fear, because you finally have no cover, and you finally realize exactly who you are."[88]
In an interview for his book and exhibitionGuillermo del Toro at Home with Monsters, del Toro stated in 2016, "A lot ofMexican Catholicdogma, the way it's taught, it's about existing in a state of grace, which I found impossible to reconcile with the much darker view of the world and myself, even as a child. I couldn't make sense of impulses like rage or envy and, when I was older, more complex ones, you know. I felt there was a deep cleansing allowing for imperfection through the figure of a monster. Monsters are the patron saints of imperfection."[89]
Del Toro is highly skeptical ofAI in filmmaking, telling theBritish Film Institutein September 2024, "I saw a demo of AI [being used for animation] and I thought, 'Oh, that's what people think animation is: giving prompts and the computer does it. [...] AI has demonstrated that it can dosemi-compellingscreensavers—that's essentially that. And I think the value of art is not how much it costs and how little effort it requires, it's how much you would risk to be in its presence. Are [screensavers] going to make [viewers] cry because they lost a son, a mother? Because they misspent their youth? No. [AI is] in the hands of people that don't think about it as a tool but as a solution. [...] It should be, if at all, optional."[90]
While studying at university, del Toro published his first book when he wrote a biography of English filmmakerAlfred Hitchcock, whom he has long praised and admired.[91]
In 2010, del Toro revealed that he was a fan of video games, describing them as "the comic books of our time" and "a medium that gains no respect among theintelligentsia". He referred to the video gamesIcoandShadow of the Colossusas masterpieces.[92]He later citedAsteroids,Cosmology of Kyoto,Gadget: Invention, Travel, & Adventure, andGalagaas his personal favorite games.[93]
Del Toro's favorite film monsters areFrankenstein's monster, theXenomorph,Gill-man,Godzilla, andthe Thing.[94]Frankenstein in particular has a special meaning for him, in both film and literature, as he claims he has a "Frankenstein fetish to a degree that is unhealthy". He said, "It's the most important book of my life, so you know if I get to it, whenever I get to it, it will be the right way."[95]He usually watches three films a day,[96]and listsBrazil,Nosferatu,Freaks, andBram Stoker's Draculaamong his favorite horrors.[97][98]

Del Toro is highly interested in theculture of Victorian England. He said, "I have a room of my library at home called 'The Dickens Room'.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
