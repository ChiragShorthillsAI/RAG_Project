Unable to successfully comfort or help her, Jeff reaches out to an old friend for a small job opportunity at acomic bookcompany. Jenny's babysitter, Samantha Nally, begins watching her full-time as Jeff starts his new job.
It becomes apparent that Jeff's house is haunted. He has recurring nightmares of spirits lurking around the house and enters trances where he draws frightening creatures whom the spirits bring to life. The ghosts interact with Jenny, and Jeff suspects they are being controlled by Maggie, who seeks revenge from beyond the grave.
After Jenny survives anallergic reactionto her food, Jeff decides to move upstate so she can live closer to Paul. The two men amicably resolve their custody battle, and Jeff also earns a promotion at work. However, a private investigator contacts Paul with the identity of Maggie's killer—Samantha—who then pushes Paul from the house's second story.
Jeff calls911for Paul, who is injured but alive. Samantha admits that she's in love with Jeff, and killed Maggie to protect him; she also poisoned Jenny's food, believing Jenny was keeping her from getting closer to Jeff. Jeff realizes Maggie's ghost truly has come back for revenge and is leading the other ghosts—however, her revenge is against Samantha, not Jeff. Maggie kills Samantha, and Jenny goes up to the attic to talk with Maggie. She slips and Jeff attempts to catch her, but they both free-fall from the attic window.

A. Dowd ofThe A.V. Clubgave the film a D grade, writing: "this bargain-basement thriller approaches both its jack-in-the-box scares and its domestic scenario with the negligence of an unfit parent; it will spook neither the superstitious nor the matrimonially anxious."[13]Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comgave the film 0/4 stars, calling it "a movie that fails as both a domestic drama and as a horror flick" and "a viciously misogynistic film that feels like the result of a drunk guy at a bar wondering if his ex-wife is so cruel that she would haunt him from beyond the grave."[14]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
