A semi-autobiographical take on Chung's upbringing, its plot follows a family ofSouth Korean immigrantswho move to rural Arkansas during the 1980s.[6]
Minarihad its world premiere at the2020 Sundance Film Festivalon January 26, 2020, winning both theU.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prizeand the U.S. Dramatic Audience Award.[7]It began a one-week virtual release on December 11, 2020, and was released theatrically and viavirtual cinemaon February 12, 2021, byA24.
The film received critical acclaim, with praise for Chung's direction and screenplay, Yeun's and Youn's performances, and the score. Many named it one of the best films of 2020. It earned six nominations at the93rd Academy Awards:Best Picture,Best Director,Best Original Score,Best Original Screenplay,Best Actor(Yeun), andBest Supporting Actress(Youn), with Youn winning for her performance, making her the first Korean to win an Academy Award for acting. It also won theGolden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, was nominated for theScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, and earned six nominations at the74th British Academy Film Awards, includingBest Film Not in the English Language. It has since been cited as one of the best films of the 2020s and the 21st century.[8][9][10]
In 1983, theSouth Korean immigrantYi family moves fromCaliforniato a plot of land inArkansas, where the father, Jacob, believes the soil is fertile and hopes to growKorean produceto sell to vendors inDallas. One of his first decisions is to decline the services of awater diviner; he digs a well in a spot he chooses himself. He enlists the help of Paul, an eccentricKorean Warveteran. Jacob is optimistic, but his wife, Monica, is disappointed with themobile homeand the distance from urban amenities, especially a hospital for their son David, who has a heart condition. They monitor David'sheart murmursand frequently tell him not to run. The couple worksexing chicksat a nearbyhatcheryand argue frequently while David and his sister, Anne, eavesdrop.
To watch the children during the day, Monica's mother, Soon-ja, travels from South Korea to live with them. Forced to share a room with her, David avoids her because she does not fit his idea of a grandmother. Still, Soon-ja attempts to bond with the children and adjust to life in the United States. The well Jacob dug runs dry. He is forced to pay for county water, and they eventually lose water in the home. He runs into additional difficulties when the vendor in Dallas cancels an order for their produce at the last minute. He perseveres despite Monica's desire to return to California, straining their marriage.
Soon-ja takes David to plantminariseeds by the creek. She tells him how resilient and useful the plant is and predicts plentiful growth. David finally begins to warm to her after she teaches himhwatu, bandages his wounds, and soothes his fears over his heart condition. Soon-ja also encourages him to do more physical activity, saying he is stronger than his parents think. Soon-ja then suffers astrokeovernight. She survives but is left with impaired movement and speech. Monica considers moving back to California with Soon-ja, with David going with them if his health does not improve.
The family leaves Soon-ja at home while they head toOklahoma Cityfor David's heart appointment and to meet a vendor for Jacob's produce. They learn that David's condition has dramatically improved, and he will not need surgery, and Jacob makes a deal to sell vegetables to a Korean grocer. But Jacob also indirectly admits to Monica that his crops' success is more important to him than their family's stability and, after an emotional argument over whether they can support each other only during good times, the two agree to separate.
During their absence, Soon-ja accidentally sets fire to the barn containing the produce. On arriving home, Jacob rushes in to save the crops, followed by Monica. The fire grows out of control, and they save each other, leaving the barn to burn. Distraught and confused, Soon-ja wanders off while Anne and David call for her to return. David runs to her and blocks her path, before she takes his hand, and her grandchildren lead her back home. That night, the exhausted family sleeps together on the floor.
Some time later, the water diviner guides Jacob and Monica to a spot to dig a new well, signifying their intention to stay. Jacob and David head to the creek to harvest the successfully grown minari, with Jacob noting that Soon-ja picked a good spot to plant it.
Chung had initially hoped to make an adaptation ofMy ÁntoniabyWilla Catherbut found out that Cather did not want film adaptations of her works to be made. He was inspired to make a film about his childhood instead.[12][13]
Chung wrote the screenplay forMinariin 2018 shortly before taking on an instructor position at the University of Utah Asia Campus inSongdo, South Korea.[14]He cited Cather andFyodor Dostoevskyas inspirations during the writing process, recalling the former's saying "that her life really began when she stopped admiring and started remembering".[14]In an interview withThe Los Angeles Times, Chung spoke about the challenges of drawing on his family's experiences: "It was very difficult in the sense that I know that my parents are private people. And I didn't even tell them that I was making this film until I was in the editing room with it after I had shot it, because I was just so scared about what they would say."[15]
Chung wrote the script in English. Some dialogue was translated into colloquial Korean[16]by Hong Yeo-ul, in consultation with Chung and the actors;[17]Han and Youn assisted in the translation efforts.[11]
In early 2019,Christina OhandPlan B Entertainmentsigned on as producers of the film. Oh later brought onA24to distribute it.[14][18]
In July 2019, it was announced thatSteven Yeun,Han Ye-ri,Youn Yuh-jung,Will Patton, andScott Hazehad joined the film's cast.[18]
Han initially felt she could not participate because she needed to filmNokdu Flowerand suggestedChun Woo-heeas an alternate, as she felt it was important that a Korean-born woman portray Monica.[19]Han said that, of the main characters, Monica "seemed to be the most Korean", due to her difficulties with living in the U.S., and she felt it was important an actress born in South Korea, natively speaking Korean, take the role.[19]
Principal photography began in July 2019 inTulsa, Oklahoma.[20][21]Filming lasted 25 days. In order to make a deadline forSundance,editorHarry Yoon edited the film as production took place.[22]
Youn previously lived in the U.S. and drew on that experience in her performance. Chung told her not to play Soon-ja like Chung's grandmother, a direction Youn welcomed.[23]Chung also took Youn's suggestions, including one where her character takes back money her daughter had just put into a church collection plate, even though Chung's religious background made him hesitant about that idea.[24]According to Youn, Chung intended for Soon-ja to be alive at the end of the story.[23]Han used her own mother's life as inspiration for her portrayal of Monica.[25]
The film had its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 26, 2020.[26]It screened at several other festivals, includingDeauville,[27]Valladolid,[28]Hamptons,[29]Heartland,[30]andMontclair.[31]
Initially, the film was set for a limited release on December 11, 2020, before slowly expanding to a wide release on February 12, 2021.[32]However, the theatrical release was curtailed due tothe COVID-19 pandemic. It came out in select theaters andvirtual cinemasfor one week on December 11, 2020.[33]It opened theatrically on February 12, along with virtual cinema screenings through A24's website.[34]It was released on video-on-demand on February 26, 2021.[35]
Minariwas screened at the28th Busan International Film Festivalas part of "Korean American Special Exhibition: Korean Diaspora" on October 5, 2023.[36]
As of 27 May 2021[update],Minarihad grossed $3.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $12.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide of $15.5 million.[5][4]
IndieWirereported the film likely made $150–200,000 from about 245 theaters.[37]It ended making $193,000 on its first weekend. It made an estimated $63,000 in its second weekend and $53,000 in its third, for a running total of $251,000.[38][39]The same weekend, the film placed fifth onApple TV's PVOD rental charts, sixth onFandangoNow, and eighth onGoogle Play.[40]It made $68,000 in its fourth weekend in the U.S. as well as $2.2 million in South Korea and $1 million in Australia and New Zealand, then $56,000 in its fifth weekend.[41][42]The weekend following its sixOscarnomination, the film made $306,000 from 786 theaters.[43]
OnRotten Tomatoes, 98% of 318 reviews were positive, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "Led by arresting performances from Steven Yeun and Yeri Han,Minarioffers an intimate and heart-wrenching portrait of family and assimilation in 1980s America."[44]Metacriticassigned the film a weighted average score 89 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[45]
A. O. ScottofThe New York Timesgave the film a positive review, writing: "Minariis modest, specific and thrifty, like the lives it surveys. There's nothing small about it, though, because it operates at the true scale of life."[46]Nicholas Barber at theBBCrated the film 5/5, writing, "Sensitively written and acted, beautifully shot, and with a charming, sparingly used score,Minariis so engaging that it's easy to forget how radical it is."[47]Reviewing the film for theAssociated Press, Lindsey Bahr gave the film 4/4 stars, reporting, "One of the great triumphs ofMinariis its presentation of authentic childhood. These kids are not saints or stand-ins or mouthpieces. They are their own persons."[48]
Robbie CollinofThe Telegraphrated the film 4/5, writing, "Lee Isaac Chung's tender story is a finely observed portrait of family relations and rural American values". Benjamin Lee atThe Guardianalso rated the film 4/5, writing, "The autobiographical story of a Korean American family trying to sustain a farm in rural Arkansas has deservedly become the festival's most universally loved film".[49]
FilmmakerBong Joon-hopraised the film, saying, "I think it takes a lot of courage to shoot a film about yourself or your family, since it's autobiographical. But what I appreciated more about this film is that it doesn't wallow in nostalgia. It's a story about [Chung], but there's a sense of distance too. So rather than it being about the history and story of a Korean immigrant family, the film can appeal to families all over the world or anyone who still carries the memories of their parents."[50]
Minariappeared on 68 critics' year-end top-ten lists, including first place on five year-end lists and second place on nine.[51]In 2023, it ranked ninth onCollider's list of "The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far".[52]Marie Clairealso included it on its list of "The 100 Best Movies of All Time."[53]
In 2024, the websiteLooperranked it number 34 on its list of "50 Best PG-13 Movies of All Time", writing, "Everyone has got a story to tell and the quietly powerful filmmaking ofMinariconveys this truth magnificently. That's not the only place Chung's directorial vision impresses, though, as subtly detailed instances of filming things through the points-of-view of other characters — as well as the specific details of each central family member — reflect what a masterfully conceived project this is."[54]
Minaripremiered at the 2020Sundance Film Festival, where it received theU.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prizeand the U.S. Dramatic Audience Award. It was named one of the ten best films of 2020 by theAmerican Film Institute[55]and theNational Board of Review, and received six Academy Award nominations.[56]It also received threeScreen Actors Guild Awardnominations, tenCritics' Choice Movie Awardsnominations, and sixIndependent Spirit Awardnominations.
At the78th Golden Globe Awards(given by theHollywood Foreign Press Association), the film won forBest Foreign Language Film.[57]The determination that the film would be eligible for this category rather thanBest Motion Picture – Drama, based on the Globes' rule that any film with over 50% of its dialogue not in English would be considered a foreign-language film, invited controversy.[58][59][60][61]Lulu Wang, whose filmThe Farewellwas subject to the same rule the previous year, wrote: "I have not seen a more American film than #Minari this year. It's a story about an immigrant family, IN America, pursuing the American dream. We really need to change these antiquated rules that characterize American as only English-speaking."[58]AuthorViet Thanh Nguyenwrote that the "decision speaks powerfully to the issue of what makes something—a language or a person or a culture—foreign".[62]Many other filmmakers, actors, and authors, includingDaniel Dae Kim,Simu Liu,Harry Shum Jr.,Franklin Leonard,Phil Lord,Nia DaCosta,Celeste Ng,Min Jin Lee, andPhillipa Soo, criticized the decision on similar grounds.[63]

In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
