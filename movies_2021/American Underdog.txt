A young Kurt Warner watchesSuper Bowl XIX. He then makes a lifelong commitment to becoming aSuper Bowland MVP quarterback.
Several years later, Kurt is playing his fifth year for theUniversity of Northern Iowa(UNI)Pantherswith coachTerry Allen, and nothing is going Warner's way. Allen threatens to bench him after repeatedly not heeding his coaching, which would effectively end Warner's NFL dream. After a brutal practice following the coach's orders, Kurt continues to be the starter and his numbers climb to where he could have a chance at theDraft.
Meanwhile, Kurt becomes interested in a woman he sees dancing at a country bar, so decides to learn how to dance to impress her. Brenda is a single mom with two kids and is a nursing student who is struggling financially. Even though she doesn't think it will work out, Kurt is persistent, walking three miles to her house to get her number. He finds out she was a Marine corporal. Kurt instantly bonds with her disabled son, convincing her they should be together.
With his last season of college football over, Kurt anxiously awaits the draft. He doesn't get picked and wonders why God gave him a dream that he would never obtain. Later, theGreen Bay Packersgive him the chance to try out, but it goes badly and Kurt goes home dejected. Becoming homeless, he moves into Brenda's basement. He takes a job at aHy-Veegrocery store, working nights stocking shelves. He discovers success is not found on the football field, but how one acts when confronted with disappointment.
Brenda's parents sell the house and move to another state, putting them in a tough situation, and the couple continue to struggle. At one point, their car runs out of gas and Kurt walks several miles in the snow to get gas.
Kurt gets approached byJim Foster, who offers him the quarterback position for theArena Football League'sIowa Barnstormers. Kurt agrees after discovering no one in the NFL is interested in him.
Arena football is different.  The field is smaller and the play is much more fast-paced. He loses his first game but wins the next. Kurt and Brenda's relationship is strained from the long commute, and they briefly break up. Brenda's parents are killed in a tornado and she and Kurt decide to get back together. They marry and Kurt finishes the1996 Arena Football League seasonwith theIowa BarnstormersinArenaBowl X, a heartbreaking loss when his completed pass on the last play of the game comes up one yard short of the end zone.
Kurt is invited to another tryout for theSt. Louis Rams. He doesn't think he will make it; he is having to re-adjust to normal football.  Offensive coordinatorMike Martzberates him relentlessly for every mistake. Head Coach,Dick Vermeil, believes in him and tells Kurt he made the team. When starting quarterbackTrent Greengoes down with an injury in the1999NFL preseason, Kurt eventually takes his place.
In his first game, Kurt and the Rams face a strongBaltimore Ravensdefense led by linebackerRay Lewis. After a turnover on his first drive, Kurt picks the Ravens' defense apart. With a 27–10 lead, the Rams go into victory formation, and Warner takes a knee to end the game. He immediately gives thanks to God for the opportunity and kisses Brenda in the stands.
The Rams post a 13–3 record thatseason, becoming known asThe Greatest Show on Turfdue to the high-powered, Warner-led offense. The Rams went on to defeat theTennessee TitansinSuper Bowl XXXIV. During the game, Kurt breaksJoe Montana's record for throwing the most passing yards in a Super Bowl. Doing so helped him win Super Bowl MVP and be crowned theNFL MVP, making him the first undrafted player to be named either of those in NFL history.
The credits show that he would play in two other Super Bowls,Super Bowl XXXVIandSuper Bowl XLIII. He becomes enshrined in thePro Football Hall of Famein 2017, and he and Brenda continue to live happily married, with seven children.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
