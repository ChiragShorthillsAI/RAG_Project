The film was produced byFox 2000 Picturesand was originally scheduled to be theatrically released by20th Century Foxin October 2019, but was delayed to May 2020 and subsequently sold toNetflixdue to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[5]It was released on May 14, 2021, and ranked among the best performing Netflix titles of 2021.[6]Critical reception was mixed to negative, with critics praising the performances but describing the plot as convoluted and derivative.[7]The film andthe source novelwere among the inspirations for the 2022 Netflix dark comedy seriesThe Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window, which spoofed tropes from the psychological thriller genre.[8]
Child psychologistAnna Fox lives alone in aManhattanbrownstoneafter separating from her husband Edward; he lives away with their daughter Olivia, but she talks to them on a daily basis. Anna suffers fromagoraphobiaand her housebound state leads her to observe all of her neighbors from a second-story window, including the Russell family who recently moved in across the street. She also takes a large number of medications and drinks heavily.
One afternoon, Ethan Russell, the teenage son, visits Anna and suggests his father Alistair is abusive. His mother Jane visits as well and they befriend one another. One night, Anna witnesses Jane being stabbed to death in the living room. She contacts the police but they do not believe her, claiming everyone in the family is fine. Alistair arrives along with "Jane" who, to the shock of Anna, is a different woman from the one she met. She begins spying on the Russell family.
Anna's tenant David, who lives in her basement, claims he did not hear or see anything, though she learns David was once in prison and violated his parole conditions. She receives an anonymous e-mail with a photo of her sleeping. She again contacts the detectives, who are joined by the Russells and David in Anna's house, and Anna breaks down when it is revealed by a detective that Edward and Olivia are dead as a result of a car crash that Anna accidentally caused. Anna is now agoraphobic as a result and her medication has caused her to have hallucinations and conversations with people who are not there.
Anna apologizes to the Russell family and stops pursuing her suspicions. She records a video on her cell phone, planning to take her own life by overdose. She then discovers a photograph she took of her cat and, in the reflection of a wine glass, sees the original Jane, proving she is real. Anna shows David the photo and he confesses the original Jane she met is a woman named Katie Melli, Ethan's biological mother. Katie had been stalking the Russell family, trying to get close to Ethan. David refuses to help Anna prove the truth; he is then suddenly attacked and killed by Ethan, who had been lurking inside the house.
Ethan reveals to Anna that he murdered Katie and is aserial killer, having also killed Alistair's secretary in Boston, and now intends to kill Anna. He had been letting himself into her house all week with a stolen key, and he was the one who took the photo of her sleeping. Anna flees to the roof, where they fight until she pushes Ethan through the skylight to his death.
As Anna recovers in the hospital, Detective Little visits and tells her they have arrested Alistair and Jane for helping Ethan cover up Katie's murder and that they have found Katie's body. Little admits he watched Anna's suicide video, but hands back her phone to allow her to delete it before she has to return it for evidence. He apologizes for not believing her.
Nine months later, Anna, now sober and healthy, says goodbye to her house before she moves out and on with her life, now no longer afraid of the outside world.

Principal photographybegan inNew York Cityon August 6, 2018,[18][19]andwrappedon October 30.[20]Rudin later hiredTony Gilroyto perform rewrites for reshoots, following the film's initial delay from the October 4, 2019, release date.[21]The score was originally set to be composed byTrent ReznorandAtticus Ross, but they were replaced byDanny Elfman.[22][4]
The Woman in the Windowwas originally scheduled to be theatrically released on October 4, 2019, by20th Century Fox,[23]but on July 9, 2019, it was delayed, with Fox's new ownerWalt Disney Studios Motion Picturesre-editing the film after test screenings,[24]and a new release date of May 15, 2020, was set.[25]On March 17, 2020, the film was removed from the release calendar due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, with the intent to reschedule it for later in 2020.[26]On August 3, 2020, it was announced thatNetflixwas in final talks to acquire the distribution rights to the film from20th Century Studios, which it did,[27]releasing it on its streaming service on May 14, 2021.[28][29][30]It was the final film to be released under theFox 2000label; as part of theWalt Disney Company's acquisition of 21st Century Fox, the label was shut down.[31]
According to director Joe Wright, the final product was "watered down" from its original version, resulting in the negative reviews.[32]Wright expressed an openness to adirector's cutversion in the future.[32]
The film was the twenty-ninth best performing Netflix titles of 2021.[33]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 25% of 217 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "A milquetoast and muddled thriller that drowns in its frenzied homages,The Woman in the Windowwill have audiences closing their curtains."[34]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 41 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[35]
Many critics commented that the film's release after more than a year ofCOVID-19 lockdownsironically made for timely viewing, withThe Hollywood Reportersaying the film's "homebound protagonist has become that much more understandable to audiences",[1]andDecidercalling it "the perfect post-lockdown catharsis."[36]
Adams' performance and the film's visuals were praised.[1][37]Rolling Stone's David Fear wrote, "A versatile actress who can go light (Enchanted), dark (Sharp Objects), or any shade in between…Adams has an uncanny knack for bringing a woman-next-door quality to most of her roles".[38]Christy LemireofRogerEbert.comsaid, "Director Joe Wright puts many of his showy camerawork instincts on display, making Adams' character's Manhattan brownstone feel both cavernous and claustrophobic."[39]Stephanie ZacharekofTimecalled it the film a "coolly tasteful psychological thriller."[40]GQpraised it as "acampmasterpiece" with "avant garde-ish flair."[41][42]Zacharek added, "The picture is enjoyable not so much for its twisty plot…as for its artful dedication to its own highly theatrical, drapes-drawn somberness."[40]
The excesses of the plot and its contrivances were widely panned. Fear stated viewers "will need to endure an Overlook Hotel-level maze of plot twists",[38]andA.O. ScottofThe New York Timessaid the film "resembles other psychological thrillers about women in distress…without being terribly thrilling or psychologically insightful".[43]NPR's Linda Holmes said, "Inventiveness means using the formula to do something meaningfully new, and that's where this film falls short."[44]
Owen GleibermanofVarietycriticized some of the dialogue inTracy Letts' screenplay as "weirdly stilted" and said one of the drawbacks is that the narrator is made to be "so unreliable that we can't tell where her grand delusions leave off" and where the film's objective action begins.[45]Lemire noted the film could have used more of Anna's character development, as "the underlying trauma [Anna's] working through gives the film some genuine heft."[39]She concluded the film "offers a lot of build-up, a lot of possibility. But the revelation of what's truly going on here is anticlimactic—the equivalent of closing the curtains and turning away from the window with a disappointed sigh."[39]
The film was seen as a disappointment given the level of talent involved.[43][46]Justin Changof theLos Angeles Timeswrote "the most interesting thing here may be the marshaling of so many smart people in service of a misfire that probably seemed like an intuitive showcase for their talents. In the scripts he's adapted from his own plays ('Bug,' 'Killer Joe'), Letts has demonstrated his facility for staging psychological breakdowns in close quarters. And Wright, in his own previous literary adaptations…has proven admirably willing to treat the camera as an active participant in the telling, using the formal resources of cinema to liberate his stories as much as possible from the printed page. It hasn’t always worked, but the results have never been dull."[47]Others pointed out that actors such asJulianne Moore,Gary Oldman, and the "wildly charismatic"Brian Tyree Henryfelt underused.[48][44][49][50]Holmes expressed that "if there had been a way to make the film more of a two-hander between [Adams and Henry] as she tries to convince him to believe her, it might have felt like a stronger story."[44]
Some reviewers saw the film as a positive and perceptive exploration of grief and agoraphobia.[51][52][53]s.e. smith ofBitch Mediawrote the film "explores disability in an intimate way, yet ultimately returns to a cultural status quo".[54]

This pretty, sweet-looking blonde has played a number of shy and innocent-looking women who are curious about sex; once they learn, they display wicked imaginations."  Peary added, "Leigh seems too gentle and looks too young and innocent to play the parts she has taken. Her females are either hungry for sex and/or have been psychologically affected by past sexual incidents... Her characters are vulnerable and almost always victimised, but usually they gave surprising resilience, and try to use their bad experiences to make themselves stronger."[21]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
