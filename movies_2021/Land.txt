The film premiered at the2021 Sundance Film Festivalon January 31, and was released in the United States on February 12, 2021, byFocus Features. It received generally positive reviews from critics.
After a traumatic experience, Edee Holzer tries therapy, revealing to her therapist that she tries to avoid people. She leaves the city and moves toWyomingwhere she purchases a small, remote cabin with land and resolves to live in solitude without any modern conveniences connecting her to the outside world, including telephones or cars.
Initially, Edee struggles with basic provisions, including chopping firewood and fishing. When a black bear enters her cabin, eating her food, and destroying most of the rest of her supplies while she hides in her outhouse, she reaches her breaking point. Without a fire for heat or food to eat, she tries to hunt but cannot bring herself to shoot a deer she has in her sights. Overwhelmed, she attempts to take her life by shooting herself with the hunting rifle, stopping short when she remembers her sister Emma pleading she not hurt herself.
During a violent snowstorm, the metal roof of her cabin becomes somewhat dislodged by the wind, making loud noises. She leaves the cabin to attempt repairs and is injured, but manages to get back inside. Local hunter Miguel and his nurse friend Alawa, rescue her and help her recover. As she refuses to leave, Miguel remains to look after Edee by preparing her food, replenishing her supply of firewood, and restocking the rest of her cabin.
Edee thanks Miguel for his kindness in helping her, but explains that she came to her cabin to be alone and wants to keep it that way. He understands and offers to help equip her with better survival skills, so she can have the life of solitude that she wants. He shows her how to trap in the winter and hunt in the fall to provide herself with food. Over time they develop a friendship as Miguel continues to join her to hunt, harvest crops, and explore her land.
Miguel shares that his wife and daughter died in a car accident eight years prior, while Edee simply reveals that she used to have a family. He later remarks that if she does not want to talk about her past, she ought to consider what she wants her future to be like. Edee suspects Miguel he searched her history on the internet, although he does not even know her last name, so points out it is impossible.
Miguel asks Edee to watch his dog while he goes away for a while. While he is gone, Edee retrieves a collection of old photos revealing she was married with a son, and the father and son she saw fishing earlier on had been an apparition of her family. Months pass and Miguel has not returned, so Edee packs her belongings and ventures off of her land for the first time since her arrival to find him. She makes her way into town on foot and eventually finds Alawa working at the local hospital.
Alawa takes her to see Miguel, who is bedridden and dying fromthroat cancer. On his deathbed, he confesses that he was driving the night his wife and daughter were killed and the accident happened because he wasintoxicated. Edee responds that her husband Adam and son Drew were killed in a random shooting in a concert hall. She thanks him for helping her heal and the life he gave back to her.
Departing with his phone that he gave her, she calls her sister Emma for the first time since arriving in Wyoming.

In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
