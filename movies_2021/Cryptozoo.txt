In 1960sSan Francisco, after having sex in the forest, young couple Matthew and Amber stumble across an enclosure. Climbing inside, they are shocked to discover aunicorn, which becomes provoked and stabs Matthew to death. The unicorn then trips and breaks its leg, leading Amber to bludgeon it to death with a rock. Trying to escape the next morning, Amber discovers the place is a zoo forcryptidsnamed Cryptozoo.
One of thecryptozoologiststhat works there is Lauren Grey, who has dedicated her life to rescuing cryptids from theblack marketafter aBakunamed Mariko cleansed her of nightmares when she was a child in American camps inWorld War II, and thus has spent much of her time away from Cryptozoo. While on a mission to rescue analkonostfrom peasants with the help of a lecherousfaunnamed Gustav, the alkonost is suddenly taken away by Nicholas, a veteran and cruel cryptid trafficker who sells them to theUnited States militaryasbioweaponsin theVietnam War. Lauren is rescued by the zoo's owner and her mentor, Joan, who reveals that Mariko, who had previously been trafficked to America, has appeared after fleeing, and convinces her to team up with agorgon, Phoebe, to find her, as theJohnson administrationseeks to use the Baku to devour the aspirations of thecounterculture movement. Phoebe is also engaged to a human, Jay, who knows of her identity.
The group tracks a lead toOrlando, where they find and take aheadless mannamed Pliny, along with the woman who raised him, back to Cryptozoo. Lauren shows them and Phoebe around Cryptozoo, but while Pliny loves it, Phoebe is put off by it and wishes for cryptids to be accepted everywhere. After settling in, Pliny reveals that he saw Mariko inMaysville, Kentuckywith a "black cat". Traveling there, Lauren and Phoebe discover Nicholas is also after the Baku. After unsuccessfully searching agentleman's clubcalled the Black Kitty Cat and talking with acat lady, they come to atarotshop with a black cat logo. While giving Lauren a reading, the shop owner realizes they are here for Mariko and reveals she is in a room in the back. They are about to take her, but Nicholas' men arrive and capture Lauren, Phoebe, and Mariko after being tipped off by Gustav.
Nicholas takes them to Cryptozoo, intending to use the evidence to attack and capture all the cryptids there. When they arrive, however, the cryptids have all been released from their enclosures, and they begin attacking Nicholas' men, causing the helicopter with Mariko inside to crash. In the commotion, Lauren escapes and manages to commandeer agriffin, which proceeds to knock the helicopter carrying Nicholas, Gustav, and Phoebe into thekrakenpool. Lauren rescues Phoebe, but Nicholas recaptures Mariko. Gustav successfully pleads for their lives, and the survivors flee from acamoodiinto aKarzełekcave.
There they discover Amber, accompanied by the last knownPegasusand having buried Matthew. Amber reveals that she was the one who released the cryptids, in an attempt to free them from their suffering. The cryptids proceeded to attack Amber, but the Pegasus flew her and Matthew's body to safety. Seeing Joan's office under attack, Lauren hops on the Pegasus to fly over to save her, with Gustav getting killed by Nicholas while giving her a window to escape. Lauren finds a weary Joan with her ape-like cryptid lover Vaughn, only for the camoodi to crush the office; Lauren escapes on the Pegasus. Finding Joan, Lauren mournfully concludes that they needed the cryptids more than the cryptids needed them, and Joan, unable to accept this, dies.
The Karzełek attack Nicholas and his men, allowing Amber and Phoebe to flee. Phoebe comes up with a plan to useLuz Malato escort the cryptids safely out of the park. With Pliny's help, they find them just as Nicholas escapes and finds Mariko. He tries to capture her, but Mariko feeds off his dreams, killing him. Amber and Phoebe break out the Luz Mala using the unicorn's severed horn, and the Luz Mala escort the cryptids out of the park, saving them and all the humans present. On her way out, Mariko encounters Lauren, who chooses to let her go.
Lauren chooses to become a regularveterinarian, with one of her clients being Amber, who has bought a dog in Matthew's honor. After Joan's funeral, Lauren attends Phoebe and Jay's wedding.

He also writes lyrics and plays with James Blanca in the weirdo pop bandLove Eats Brains!and has co-written and acted in various short film projects.
Shaw is the director of the animated featuresMy Entire High School Sinking into the Sea(2016) andCryptozoo(2021).
Shaw credits his father as an inspiration, saying they made comics together before he could read. His father wrote the text and Dash did the illustrations.[7]During high school, Shaw was the lead illustrator for the Richmond Times-Dispatch's teen section.[8]After they discontinued that section of the newspaper, Shaw started self-publishing mini-comics. He printed the first issue ofLove Eats Brains!during his freshman year of college.[9]Shaw studied at theSchool of Visual ArtsinManhattan,[10]graduating with a BFA in Illustration in 2005.[11]
Throughout college and since, Shaw has publishedsequential artshort stories in a variety of publications in the United States and abroad, plus numerous magazine illustrations.[12]
Shaw'sBottomless Belly Buttonwas published byFantagraphicsin June 2008.[13]HisBodyWorldwebcomic was bought byPantheon Booksand published in a single printed volume in April 2010.[14]
Bottomless, an exhibition of Shaw's original drawings, storyboards, color background overlays and a new video animation, was on display atDuke University'sJohn Hope Franklin Centerfrom September 25 through October 31, 2008.[15]
In the years following Bottomless Belly Button, Shaw published numerous short stories in comics form, and serialized the science-fiction storyBodyWorldon dashshaw.com. It received anEisner Awardnomination for Best Digital Comic in 2009.[16]
Late 2009 saw the release by Fantagraphics ofThe Unclothed Man In the 35th Century A.D., a collection of short stories that Shaw had previously published in MOME,[17]along with several pages of storyboards and other ephemera from his animated shorts for IFC.[18]
In 2010,Pantheon Booksreleased the collected chapters ofBodyWorldin the form of a graphic novel,[14]
In 2013, releases from Shaw included the zine-style mini-comicNew Jobs(Uncivilized Books), the comic-book length shorts collection3 New Stories(Fantagraphics), and Shaw's next graphic novel,New School(Fantagraphics).New Schooltakes place on an island preparing for an influx of English-speaking tourists upon the completion of a massive theme park depicting periods throughout history. It follows two brothers, one who has taken a job teaching English to island locals and another who has come to retrieve his sibling. In the course of the book, both brothers experience alienation from their surroundings and conflicts with the locals. NPR calledNew School"striking and enigmatic," while Publishers Weekly described the book as "an unusual combination of bildungsroman, travelogue, and intellectual thriller."[19][20]
Shaw produced the three-part miniseriesClue: CandlestickforIDW comicsin 2019.
Shaw employs a combination of hand drawing, animation techniques andPhotoshopto produce his artwork. Shaw started working on acetate sheets while studying at theSchool of Visual Arts. Pointing to pre-Photoshopcomics that were colored via clearcelluloidcontaining the black line art, under which would be placed a board with the painted colors, Shaw explains that he took this process and combined it withanimation-style use of celluloid, where the backs of the acetate are painted withgouacheand laid over a painted background, in addition to color separations where black line art is used to mark the different colors. In addition to using hand-drawing media such ascrow quillpens,colored pencils, and markers, Shaw incorporatescollage, Photoshop, and painting directly overphotocopies, though he does not work with a separate line art layer, preferring to treat black as simply another color, and not a separate or more important element. OnBodyWorld, for example, Shaw did the color separations by hand, used the paint bucket tool in Photoshop to color the shapes, and then printed it out and painted over the photocopy, before scanning it again and making final adjustments in Photoshop to achieve the final art.[10]
Shaw explains that his key motive is combining what he likes about hand drawing with the processes available in Photoshop. He has stated that he does not own adrawing tablet, and that his actual knowledge of Photoshop is limited, compared to most mainstream colorists who rely on it exclusively, explaining, "that coloring leaves me cold."[10]
His animation influences includeWinsor McCay,Osamu Tezuka(in particular his work onAstroboy), and other 60sanimeshows likeSpeed Racer,[21]the 1973cult filmsBelladonna of SadnessandFantastic Planet,limited animation(includingA Charlie Brown Christmas),[22][23]Ralph Bakshi[24]andSuzan Pitt.[25]

It features the voices of Jason Schwartzman, Lena Dunham, Reggie Watts, Maya Rudolph and Susan Sarandon.[27]
He was also responsible for the "comic book" scenes inJohn Cameron Mitchell's 2010 filmRabbit Holeand the animated dream sequence on an episode of the controversialNetflixseries13 Reasons Whyalongside Jane Samborski.[28][29]
His next featureCryptozoo, about1960sSan Franciscozookeepers trying to capture a mysterious creature,[30]was released in early 2021 at theSundance Film Festivalwhere it won the NEXT Innovator Award.[31]It was also nominated for theJohn Cassavetes Awardat the37th Independent Spirit Awards.[32][33]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
