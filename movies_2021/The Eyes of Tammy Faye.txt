The film tells the story ofTammy Faye Bakker(Jessica Chastain), from her humble beginnings growing up inInternational Falls, Minnesota, through the rise and fall of her televangelism career and marriage toJim Bakker(Andrew Garfield).Cherry JonesandVincent D'Onofrioalso star. The film is produced by Chastain's production company,Freckle Films.
The Eyes of Tammy Fayehad its world premiere at theToronto International Film Festivalin September 2021, and was released on September 17, 2021, bySearchlight Pictures. Critics praised the performances (particularly Chastain's) while criticizing the screenplay, deeming the film to be inferior to the documentary. At the94th Academy Awards, the film wonBest Actress(for Chastain) andBest Makeup and Hairstyling. Chastain also won theSAG AwardandCritics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress.
Tammy Faye LaValleyfalls in love withJim Bakkerwhile studying at North Central Bible College inMinneapolis,Minnesota. The two marry despite disapproval from Tammy's mother Rachel, dropping out of college to preach and inspire Christian communities across the United States. Their preaching gets the attention ofPat Robertson'sChristian Broadcasting Network, who hires them as hosts of children's showJim and Tammy. Jim later becomes the first host of CBN'sThe 700 Clubwhile the two welcome daughter Tammy Sue.
Tammy and Jim meet conservative pastorJerry Falwellduring a party, with Jerry expressing interest in working with CBN. Following an argument with Falwell in which Tammy dismisses the politicization of faith, she encourages Jim to create their own television network. The two leave CBN and establish thePTL Satellite Network, with their flagship showThe PTL Clubbecoming immensely popular over the years. Tammy invites Rachel and stepfather Fred to move in with them at theirTega Cay, South Carolinacompound, but Rachel expresses her disapproval of how PTL monetizes the religious faith of its viewers.
As the press becomes more skeptical and critical of the PTL network, Tammy develops an addiction to pills and becomes flirtatious with music producerGary S. Paxton, whom Jim fires following the birth of their son Jay. In the 1980s, Jim focuses his attention on building aChristian theme parkwhile Falwell's influence over PTL grows. When Falwell decries the "gay cancer", Tammy deliberately arranges forAIDSpatient and Christian pastor Steve Pieters to give an interview onThe PTL Clubabout supporting thegaycommunity.[3]
After collapsing during a taping, Tammy argues with Jim over their strained relationship and his subservience to Falwell. Falwell subsequently usurps control of PTL following news scandals about PTL's financial debt and Jim's extramarital affairs, including speculations about sexual relationships with men. Jim is ultimately imprisoned for fraud, and with no one left to protect her, Tammy is left jobless and forced to sell her home and possessions.
By 1994, Tammy and Jim have officially divorced, Rachel has died, and Tammy is struggling to revive her career and find television gigs. She gets an offer to be the special guest for a Christian concert atOral Roberts University, which she hesitantly accepts. She preaches before performing a moving rendition of "Battle Hymn of the Republic", during which she imagines a rousing gospel choir performing with her.
A textual epilogue reveals Falwell died in 2007, Jim returned to televangelism for a revived PTL after being released from prison, and Tammy continued to supportLGBTQ+ communitiesuntil she died on July 20, 2007, at her home in Loch Lloyd, near Kansas City, Missouri, after an eleven-year bout with cancer at the age of 65.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
