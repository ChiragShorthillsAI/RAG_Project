For her performance as Diana, Stewart was nominated for theAcademy Award,Golden Globe Award, andCritics' Choice Movie Awardfor Best Actress.
OnChristmas Eve1991, theBritish royal familyprepares to spend Christmas atSandringham HouseinNorfolk. Among the attendees isDiana, Princess of Wales, whose marriage toPrince Charleshas become strained due to his affair withCamilla Parker Bowles. The staff of Sandringham prepare for the royals' arrivals. Instead of driving with her security detail, Diana has decided to drive herself and has become lost, until she runs into Royal Head Chef,Darren McGrady. She notes that the long-abandoned neighbouring estate, Park House, was her childhood home. She then notices a scarecrow in the distance and eagerly runs towards it. Diana takes off its jacket, which once belonged to her fatherJohn Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer, and goes back to her car.
When Diana arrives at Sandringham, her sonsWilliamandHarryare excited to see her, but she does not attempt to socialise with the rest of the royal family. Diana's only friend at Sandringham is royal dresser Maggie, who encourages her to both combat the royal family and fulfil the obligations expected of her. Diana finds a book onAnne Boleynin her bedroom. She begins to have dreams about Boleyn (including a hallucination of her at a Christmas Eve dinner where she imagines herself destroying a pearl necklace given to her by Charles and eating the pearls in her soup), eventually coming to believe that Boleyn's ghost is haunting her as a fellow abandoned royal wife. Diana tries to visit her childhood home, but is stopped by royal guards who initially mistake her for an intruder.
On Christmas Day, Diana attends a service atSt Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham, where she notices Camilla among the gathered crowd and is photographed by numerousintrusive journalists. She holds a difficult conversation with Charles, who rebuffs her concerns over William and Harry's participation in apheasantshoot the next day, and advises her to develop a stronger sense of separation between her public and private lives. Charles privately arranges for Maggie to be sent to London and spreads rumours that she had planted the Boleyn book in Diana's room and made critical comments about her mental health; McGrady denies that she had done so when Diana questions him.
Major Gregory attempts to encourage Diana to conform to the pressures of royal life by reminding her that the soldiers of theBritish Armydie trying to protect the interests of the Crown (and by extension her interests). Diana responds by stating that she never asked anyone to die for her and accuses him of planting the Boleyn book in her room as a warning, which he denies.
After imaginingwounding herselfwith a pair ofwire cuttersgiven to her by McGrady, Diana avoids the formal Christmas Day dinner, and instead runs to her childhood home and gains access with the wire cutters. Memories of her happier childhood overtake her, and she dances from room to room while imagining her younger self. She considers taking her own life by throwing herself down a flight of stairs, but the hallucinations of Boleyn stop her. Instead, she rips apart her pearl necklace.
OnBoxing Day, Diana wakes up in her room to find that Maggie has been called back from London. The two travel to a nearby beach, where Diana talks about her mental and marital problems. Maggie responds by confessing that she is in love with Diana. After bidding Maggie farewell, Diana goes to the pheasant shoot, walks out in front of the crowd of hunters, and announces that she is taking William and Harry to London, to which Charles reluctantly agrees. Diana bids farewell to McGrady and Major Gregory returns the Boleyn book to the library. As they drive away, Diana and her children sing along to the song "All I Need Is a Miracle" byMike and the Mechanics, passing the scarecrow which is now dressed in one of Diana's outfits. They drive to London, where they orderKFCand eat by theRiver Thames. Diana looks across the river, uncertain of her future but no longer feeling burdened by royal responsibility.
On 17 June 2020, it was announced thatPablo Larraínwould directSpencer, a film starringKristen Stewartas Princess Diana.[10]On 26 June 2020, it was reported thatNeonandTopic Studioshad acquired the rights to distribute the film in the United States for $4 million in a bidding war that reportedly also includedSearchlight Pictures,Universal PicturesandA24.[3]In July 2020,STX Entertainmentand DCM Film Distribution were set to distribute the film in the United Kingdom and Germany.[4]
Filming began at theSchlosshotel Kronberg, Germany, in January 2021 withTimothy Spall,Sally Hawkins, andSean Harrisjoining the cast.[11][12]Other filming locations were theSchloss Marquardtin Marquardt, north of the city ofPotsdam, andNordkirchen Castle,[13]the moated castle. During the fall of 2020, Larraín and Production DesignerGuy Hendrix Dyasembarked on an intense scout in search of the perfect location. Sandringham House is a British institution set within the picturesque landscape of Norfolk. The fore mentioned Nordkirchen Castle was exactly what the script called for, grand and impressive, yet isolated. "An Elegant prison" was the exact expression coined by Larraín and Dyas to convey the overall sentiment to the rest of the crew. Somewhere where you wouldn't necessarily enjoy spending Christmas, where you get the subtle feeling that underneath the festivities there's a real anguish and misery at play. On 25 March, production moved to the UK for the final stretch of filming, withJack Farthingjoining the cast as Prince Charles, and the film wrapped on 27 April 2021.[14]
The film was shot on both Kodak Super 16mm and 35mm film stock by cinematographer Claire Mathon using theArricam LT, andArriflex416 Plus.[15]To achieve the film's specific look, she used a combination of Leitz Summilux and Zeiss Ultra 16 lenses.
In an interview with Kodak, Mathon said that shooting on film was their obvious choice, calling it a "necessity" and that "there was never a question about shooting digital or film". According to her, the only question was whether they would shoot the film in 16mm or 35mm film stock. She also revealed that she and Larraín reviewed sequences from various Stanley Kubrick films such asBarry Lyndon(1975) andA Clockwork Orange(1971) to learn about the style of camera movement, rhythm of the shots, and the use of short focal lenses.
Most of the film was shot on Super 16mm film format due to the lightness, and ergonomics of the equipment used while also revealing that economic advantages is also part of the reason. In some scenes where they wanted to minimize the grain, they opted for the 35mm film stock as it retains both softness and details on the darker part of the image.[16]
Film processing and 4K 16-bit scans were done at Hiventy in Paris, while the cameras were supported by Arri Rental inBerlin,Germany.
Jonny Greenwoodcomposed the score.[17]The score was released byMercury KXon 12 November 2021.[18]Writing for the You Discover Music website, Sharon Kelly described the soundtrack, stating: "Jonny Greenwood's genre bending music for theSpencersoundtrack combinesfree jazzand classicalbaroque."[19]
Spencerhad its world premiere in competition at theVenice International Film Festival.[20]It then screened at film festivals inTelluride,[21]Toronto,[22]London,[23]Philadelphia,[24][25]San Diego[26]andZurich.[27]
The film was theatrically released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 5 November 2021.[28]It was the last film to be distributed bySTX Entertainmentin the United Kingdom before the distributor's UK division was shut down on 28 July 2022.[29]
Spencergrossed more than $7 million in the United States and Canada, and $18.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $25.2 million.[7]
In the United States and Canada,Spencermade $2.1 million from 996 theatres in its opening weekend.[30]In its second weekend, the film played in 1,265 theatres and made $1.53 million.[31]
Upon the teaser trailer's release,Forbesreported that the role "thrusts" Stewart "into the Oscar race" for theAcademy Award for Best Actress.[32]After the film's world premiere,Varietyalso stated, "There's already been plenty of talk in Venice that the role will likely land Stewart her first Oscar nomination." The film received a three-minute standing ovation at its world premiere,[33]with critics lauding Stewart's performance as Diana.[34]
On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, 83% of 351 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Spencercan frustrate with its idiosyncratic depiction of its subject's life, but Kristen Stewart's finely modulated performance anchors the film's flights of fancy."[35]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[36]
David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterstated that the film "rests on Stewart's shoulders and she commits to the film's slightly bonkers excesses as much as to its moments of delicate illumination" and wrote that "[not] everything lands inSpencer, and I often wondered if the film was so set on bucking convention that it would alienate its audience. But it tells a sorrowful story we all think we know in a new and genuinely disturbing light."[37]Reviewing the film forThe Daily Telegraph,Robbie Collinwrote: "The 31-year-old Stewart – who will be instantly and justifiably awards-tipped for this – navigates this perilous terrain with total mastery, getting the voice and mannerisms just right but vamping everything up just a notch, in order to better lean into the film's melodramatic, paranoiac and absurdist swerves."[38]Drawing comparisons between the film and theJacqueline KennedybiopicJackie(2016), also directed by Larraín, Pete Hammond ofDeadline Hollywoodstated that "Spenceris something else indeed, almost playing out in a conventional dramatic fashion, a more accessible approach in some ways, but also more ambitious as it is squarely from the point of view of its title character, purposely calledSpencerto assure us that the person who once was, is well on the way to finding that very lost spirit again before it is too late."[39]
Spencerwas listed on many critics' top ten lists for 2021.[40]
Stewart's portrayal of Diana was hailed as one of the most accurate portrayals of the late Princess. Ken Wharfe, Diana's former bodyguard, commented, "Out of all the people who have played Diana over the past 10 years, she's the closest to her. She managed to perfect her mannerisms." Former Royal Chef Darren McGrady, who was portrayed by actor Sean Harris in the film, said, "Kristen Stewart is amazing as the princess, with her mannerisms and her voice ... the happy scenes of her with the boys, it was like her coming alive again. For real, Kristen Stewart played an amazing part."[41][42]However, McGrady also pointed out that the film took considerable liberties, especially with its use of metaphors, but acknowledged that the film was a fictionalised take on what possibly could have happened.[42]

NEON Rated, LLC,doing business asNeon(stylized inall caps), is an Americanindependent filmproductionanddistributioncompany founded in 2017 by CEO Tom Quinn andTim League, who also was the co-founder of theAlamo Drafthouse Cinemachain.[1]As of 2019, League is no longer involved with daily operations for the company.[6]
Its first film,Colossal, was released in 2017.[7]The company became known for distributing such notable films asI, Tonya(2017),Parasite(2019),Portrait of a Lady on Fire(2019),Palm Springs(2020),Flee(2021),Spencer(2021),The Worst Person in the World(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023),Anora(2024),Longlegs(2024),The Seed of the Sacred Fig(2024), andThe Monkey(2025).[8][9]
Parasitewent on to become Neon's highest-grossing film at the worldwidebox officewith $262 million and the first non-English-language film to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture.[10]In 2024,Longlegshad a domestic box office gross of $58.6 million, becoming the distributor's highest-grossing film ever in North America.[11]Anorabecame the company's second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[12]Neon has also worked with several high-profile filmmakers, which includesSean Baker,[13]Bong Joon Ho,Julia Ducournau,Craig Gillespie,Pablo Larraín, andCéline Sciamma.[14]
During the 4th Annual Zurich Summit, Tom Quinn commented on Neon's intent to release titles that appeal to audiences who "skew under 45, that have no aversion to violence, no aversion to foreign language and to non-fiction".[15]Explaining the success of the company in 2024, Quinn stated: "We were very much a startup, with everyone functioning as this sophisticated amoeba. We very quickly found ourselves that year inTorontowith a great slate [...] That work enabled us to sit at the table in Toronto that year and buyI, Tonya. Before the ink was even dry on the deal, we were planning itsOscar campaign. It's a testament to how quickly we can make decisions because we're not this big studio. We've always used that to our advantage."[16]
In September 2017, the company partnered withBlumhouse Productionsto manage BH Tilt.[17]In 2018, a majority stake of Neon was sold to30West, the media venture arm of "The Friedkin Group".[4][18]In February 2021,Bleecker Streetpartnered with Neon to launch the joint home entertainment distribution companyDecal, which is a standalone full-service operation that handlesdistribution dealson the home entertainment rights to both Neon and Bleecker Street's features. The first film to be distributed through Decal was the Bleecker Street releaseSupernovain winter 2021.[5]Additionally, Decal acquired North American distribution rights to the South Africanhorror filmGaiafor a summertheatrical release, marking their first ever acquisition.[19]
Andrew Brown (Co-President of Decal) oversaw the launch of Neon's home entertainment division. In 2022, Brown was promoted to "President of Digital Distribution". The exec, who has served as "SVP of Digital Strategy, Marketing, and Distribution" for Neon since 2017, also manages Neon's library, and oversees the annualFYC DVD Box Setanddirect-to-consumerdigital portal "Neon Cinema".[20]Prior to the joint-venture,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, as well asThe Criterion CollectionandWell Go USA Entertainment(for the filmPossessorwhich Neon and Well Go co-distributed), distributed several Neon films onhome video.[21][22][23]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, Neon was approved to continue promotional activities for its films since the company does not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP) nor had encountered any issue in receivingSAG-AFTRAinterim agreements.[24][25][26]
In August 2023, Neon hired formerA24employees Alexandra Altschuler as "VP Media" and Don Wilcox as "VP Marketing".[27]That same month, Neon hired former Sierra/Affinity employee Kristen Figeroid as "President of International Sales and Distribution", Laurel Charnetsky as "VP International Acquisitions & Operations", and Dan Stadnicki as "Manager, International Sales & Distribution".[28]In May 2024, Neon hired Joey Monteiro as "EVP, International Marketing" and Ashley Hirsch as "Manager of International Sales and Marketing".[29]That same month, Neon promoted Elissa Federoff from "President of Distribution" to "Chief Distribution Officer" and Ryan Friscia from "EVP, Finance and Business Development" to "Chief Financial Officer".[30]Furthermore, Jeff Deutchman, who joined Neon when it was launched, serves as "President of Acquisitions and Production".[31]
Additionally, Neon has acquired the distribution rights to fivePalme d'Orwinners at theCannes Film Festival:Parasite(2019),Titane(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023), andAnora(2024); all five won consecutively.[31][32][33]The company's strategy to acquire such titles at Cannes is to eschew "the lazy approach", said Deutchman. "The only real way to do Cannes is to go see as many movies as you can, because you never know where the nextDogtoothorBorderorHungerorForce Majeureis going to come from", he added, citing several modern Cannes standouts championed by arthouse buyers.[31]After acquiringParasitein 2018, Neon financed and distributed the film the following year in U.S. territories.[34]"From the very beginning, Tom Quinn sawParasiteas a universal film and refused to put it in a box as a foreign-language or international film", saidParasitedirectorBong Joon Ho. "He saw the heart of the film and understood that it was about all of us living in our modern class-based society. I was always grateful for that."[16]Neon spent $20 million promoting, distributing, and campaigning for the film's awards.[3]The film subsequently became Neon's highest-grossing film with more than $200 million at the worldwidebox officeand won fourAcademy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Director. Similarly, Neon spent $18 million promotingAnora, three times the film's original budget.[3]Anoraultimately won the two aforementioned Academy Awards whileAnatomy of a FallandTriangle of Sadnesswere nominated for the same two categories, among others. As of March 2025, Neon has garnered 39 Academy Award nominations, winning 11 overall.[10][12][35]
In 2023, Quinn commented on the company's success at Cannes, saying: "We've seen over the years that each of these films, because of their credibility and success, the Palme d'Or has come to mean something quite impactful for a very young group ofcinephiles. And the reason why we know this is we've tested all these movies and dating back toParasite, probably I think, the fifth reason why people came to see the film, in itstest screeninginSherman Oaks, was the fact that it won the Palme d'Or, and each subsequent year that went up. And this year, the number one reason why people came to see the film [Anatomy of a Fall], at a test screening inBurbank, was the fact that it had won the Palme d'Or."[36]In 2024, Quinn stated: "The award means a lot. To audiences here who are looking for the absolute most adventurous, forward-looking cinema available, that award represents it because these films have delivered, and they've been major Oscar contenders."[16]
In July 2024, Neon received its biggest opening weekend at the box office with the horror thriller filmLonglegs, after scoring $22.6 million from 2,510 theaters (a figure that includes $2.5–3 million in Thursday previews) and only behindUniversal/Illumination's second weekend ofDespicable Me 4. Initially projected to gross $7–9 million, the opening marked the biggest total for an original horror film of 2024, one of the top 20 weekends for an independent film and the best opening ever for an independent horror film.[37][38][39]To promote the film, Neon utilizedguerrilla marketingtactics similar to those that led to the box office success ofThe Blair Witch Project(1999).[40]DirectorOz Perkinscredited Neon for the film's marketing, stating the studio "really responded strongly to the movie, the raw materials of the movie really excited them, the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it sounds. They asked me early on, 'Do we have your permission to kind of go nuts?' And I said, 'What else are we doing here? Go for it. Do your thing.'"[41]The film's total marketing budget was under $10 million, focusing ondigital contentand not havingtelevision ads.[37]During its third weekend,Longlegsbecame the company's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office, earning $58.6 million, surpassing whatParasiteearned with $53.3 million in 2020.[11]Furthermore, it became the top grossing R-rated horror film of 2024 and the highest-grossing indie horror film of the last decade, topping A24'sTalk to Me(2022),Insidious: Chapter 3(2015) fromFocus Features, and A24'sHereditary(2018).[11]Afterward, furthering their marketing campaign, from August 1 to 4, Neon (partnering withAtom Tickets) offered free tickets to anyone who has a birthday that falls on the 14th of any given month. To get the tickets, those who registered and purchased tickets through Atom Tickets received a special promo code after verifying their date of birth and were able to get one free ticket per customer, while supplies lasted.[42]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
