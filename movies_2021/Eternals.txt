Produced byMarvel Studiosand distributed byWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it isthe 26th filmin theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU). The film was directed byChloé Zhao, who wrote the screenplay withPatrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, andKaz Firpo. It stars anensemble castincludingGemma Chan,Richard Madden,Kumail Nanjiani,Lia McHugh,Brian Tyree Henry,Lauren Ridloff,Barry Keoghan,Don Lee,Kit Harington,Salma Hayek, andAngelina Jolie. In the film, the Eternals are immortal beings who emerge from hiding after thousands of years to protect Earth from their ancient counterparts, theDeviants.
In April 2018, Marvel Studios presidentKevin Feigeannounced that a film based on the Eternals was in development and would explore the group asancient aliensliving throughout human history. Ryan and Kaz Firpo were hired to write the script, and Zhao was set to direct in September. She was given significant creative freedom to rewrite the script, taking particular inspiration fromTerrence Malick's films, and to use more locations and natural lighting than previous MCU films had. Casting began in early 2019 and Burleigh joined to work on the script ahead ofprincipal photography, which took place from July 2019 to February 2020 atPinewood Studiosand on location in England and theCanary Islands.
Eternalspremiered at theDolby TheatreinLos Angeleson October 18, 2021, and was released in the United States on November 5 as part ofPhase Fourof the MCU. The film grossed $402 million worldwide and received some awards and nominations, but it also became the first MCU film to not receive generally positive reviews. Particular criticism went to the screenplay and pacing, with commentators feeling it did not live up to Zhao's previous work or to previous MCU films. It received some praise for its themes and visuals.
In 5000 BC, ten superpowered beings known asEternals—Ajak,Sersi,Ikaris,Kingo,Sprite,Phastos,Makkari,Druig,Gilgamesh, andThena—are sent to Earth byArishem, aCelestial, on thestarshipDomo. They are charged with exterminating invasive entities known as theDeviants. After the last Deviants are killed in 1521, the group's opinions differ over their continued relationship with humankind. Over the next 500 years, they mostly live apart, waiting for Arishem's orders.
In the present, Sersi and Sprite live together inLondon. After Sersi's partner Ikaris left her without explanation centuries earlier, she is now in a relationship with humanDane Whitmanwho works at theNatural History Museum. When the trio is attacked by the DeviantKro, Ikaris arrives and chases the creature away. The three Eternals travel to South Dakota to reunite with their leader, Ajak, only to find her dead. Sersi is posthumously chosen by Ajak as her successor, granting her the ability to communicate with Arishem.
Sersi learns that the Eternals' mission was actually to prepare Earth for theEmergenceof a new Celestial. Arishem explains that, for millions of years, he has been planting Celestial seeds inside planets where the energy from large populations allows new Celestials to be born. The Deviants were sent to destroy theapex predatorsof each planet to ensure the development of intelligent life, but when they evolved and began hunting the planets' native populations, Arishem created the Eternals to counter them. With the recent end ofthe Bliprestoring Earth's population,[b]humankind has reached the necessary size to allow the CelestialTiamutto be born, which will result in Earth's destruction.
Hoping to delay the Emergence, the Eternals reunite. At Druig's residence in theAmazon rainforest, they are attacked by the Deviants. They kill them all except for Kro, who kills Gilgamesh before fleeing. Phastos proposes they use the Uni-Mind, a connection between all the Eternals that would give Druig enough power to put Tiamut to sleep with hismind-controlabilities. However, Ikaris is loyal to Arishem and refuses to help stop the Emergence. He reveals that Ajak wanted to stop the Emergence and save humanity, so he led her to the Deviants and allowed them to kill her. Sprite joins Ikaris due to her unrequited love for him while Kingo chooses to leave.
Makkari locates the place of the Emergence, anactive volcanoin the Indian Ocean, where Ikaris and Sprite attempt to stop them. Druig knocks out Sprite, and Phastos restrains Ikaris. Kro arrives and is killed by Thena. Druig is unable to put Tiamut to sleep, and Sersi instead attempts to turn him into marble. Ikaris breaks free of his restraints and goes to kill Sersi, but is unable to due to his love for her. Both he and Sprite join with the others in the Uni-Mind, and Sersi gains enough power to turn Tiamut into marble. Guilt-ridden, Ikaris flies into the Sun. Sersi uses the remaining Uni-Mind energy to turn Sprite into a human, ending herpermanent childlike state.
Thena, Druig, and Makkari depart on theDomoto warn Eternals on other planets of the Emergences. Whitman professes his love for Sersi and is about to reveal a secret about his family history when she, Phastos, and Kingo are lifted into space by Arishem. Displeased with their treason, Arishem says he will spare humanity if the Eternals' memories show that humans are worthy of living. He vows to return for judgment and takes the trio into a singularity.
In amid-credits scene, Thena, Makkari, and Druig meet the EternalErosand his assistantPip the Troll. In a post-credits scene, an unseen person[c]questions whether Whitman is ready to wield theEbony Blade.

In April 2015,Marvel Televisionwas working with screenwriterJohn Ridleyto craft a new television series forABC, "reinventing" an existing Marvel character or property,[27]which was revealed years later to be theEternals.[28]Through its development, which ultimately had eventually been abandoned during the folding of Marvel Television in December 2019,[29][28]Ridley stated that he was trying to make a superhero television series that viewers had not necessarily seen before, with hopes that it could occupy "a space that [was] not currently being filled" by Marvel.[30]His approach to the characters would have been "a really weird story", though he stated the characters are "a really hard property" to adapt while conceding that while he believed his series would have been good it may not have been entertaining for everyone.[28]
Marvel StudiospresidentKevin Feigesaid in April 2018 that the studio was actively developing a film based on theMarvel ComicsseriesEternals, created byJack Kirby, to be released as part of theirPhase Fourslate of films. Marvel Studios had met with multiple screenwriters and was believed to be focusing on the characterSersiin the film.[31]Marvel set Ryan andKaz Firpoto write the script a month later,[32]with their outline including a love story between the characters Sersi andIkaris.[33]In June, Feige said Marvel was interested in exploring the "ancient alienskind of sci-fi trope" by having the Eternals be the inspiration for myths and legends throughout the history of theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU).[34]
During late August, Marvel's director search forEternalsnarrowed to a shortlist that includedChloé Zhao—who had also been in the running to direct Marvel'sBlack Widow(2021)—Nicole Kassell,Travis Knight, and the pair ofCristina GallegoandCiro Guerra.[33]Zhao approached Marvel Studios about making the film as she had been a fan of the MCU. She wanted to work with the studio to bring her own take andworld-buildingto the franchise,[35]and impressed them with a presentation that Feige described as fascinating, with "reams of visuals".[36]Zhao worked with producerNate Mooreto develop herpitch.[37]The presentation left Marvel concerned that she might take on a different big-studio project instead ofEternals, forcing them to move quickly to secure her, and Zhao was hired as director in September.[33][38]Zhao hoped to push the scope of the film further than Marvel'sAvengers: Endgame(2019),[36]but also wanted it to have intimacy.[39]Zhao described the film as a melting pot of influences, from Kirby's original work,Neil Gaiman's2006 run, previous MCU projects, Zhao's fandom of the MCU, and her love of science fiction and fantasy films andmanga.[37]Speaking specifically to her love of manga, she hoped those influences would create a "marriage of East and West".[36]Zhao cited the TV seriesAncient Aliens, theFinal Fantasyvideo game series, the concepts fromYuval Noah Harari's bookSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, and the films ofTerrence Malickas her inspirations for the film.[40]
Marvel consideredEternalsto be a perfect transition into its next phase of films along with projects such asCaptain Marvel(2019),[38]allowing the studio to cast a diverse group of actors to portray the various Eternals.[33]Moore's initial planning documents for the project including the swapping of genders, sexualities, and ethnicities of some characters from the comic books, with Zhao further advocating for this approach.[10]In February 2019, Feige reiterated that Marvel was interested in the Eternals due to Kirby's epic, century-spanning story,[41]with the film version spanning 7,000 years and exploring humanity's place in the cosmos.[37]Zhao noted that the Eternals "have lived among us for so long, [they have] the same struggles like identity, purpose, faith, personal freedom versus greater good — all the duality and flaws that make us human". When trying to develop a story that spanned so many years, Marvel realized that the characters would likely be a family unit, with a friendship that would "turn into frenemies, and then turn into enemies, and then come back to friendship". Zhao also looked to the Earth as an eleventh character in the film, chronicling its journey alongside the Eternal characters.[9]Marvel also wanted to create more ensemble films that were not crossover films, likeGuardians of the Galaxy(2014), while introducing relatively unknown characters to audiences as they did withthat film's title charactersand theAvengers.[41]
"I wanted it to reflect the world we live in. But also I wanted to put a cast together that feels like a group of misfits. I didn't want the jocks. I want you to walk away at the end of the movie not thinking, 'This person is this ethnicity, that person is that nationality.' No. I want you to walk away thinking, 'That's a family.' You don't think about what they represent."
Throughout early 2019, Zhao began working on a draft of the script, building upon the multiple drafts submitted by the Firpos. Approximately four months ahead of filming, the script was not finalized, so Moore introducedPatrick Burleigh, who had been part of Marvel's writers program, to Zhao in the hopes he could assist with the writing. Zhao hired him to work on the screenplay, which he did for about three months ahead of filming. Burleigh believed Zhao needed to write on the film as well as direct to "process the film through her own filter", and noted her draft showed she was "trying to make the Terrence Malick version of a Marvel film"; Zhao citing his filmThe Tree of Life(2011) as an inspiration. Burleigh called his work with Zhao on the script mostly "structural" to find "the flow of the film", likening the story to aroad trip film.[42]
Angelina Joliejoined the cast in March 2019, reportedly as Sersi,[43][44]withKumail NanjianiandDon Leecast in undisclosed roles the next month.[44][45]At that time, the film was expected to feature Marvel Studios' first gay superhero.[46]In May,Richard Maddenentered negotiations for the role of Ikaris,[47]andSalma Hayekhad entered early negotiations for an undisclosed role the following month.[48]In July,Varietyreported that the cast included Jolie, Madden, andMillie Bobby Brown, but Brown denied that she had been cast.[49][50]
At the 2019San Diego Comic-Con, Feige officially announcedThe Eternalswith a release date of November 6, 2020. He officially announced the casting of Jolie asThena, Nanjiani asKingo, Lee asGilgamesh, Madden as Ikaris, and Hayek asAjak, along withLauren RidloffasMakkari,Brian Tyree HenryasPhastos, andLia McHughasSprite.[51]Zhao looked for actors for each role that could "find a bit of themselves in their character".[9]Feige added that one of these actors was portraying an LGBTQ character,[52]with actorHaaz Sleimanlater revealing that Phastos is depicted as gay in the film. Sleiman portrays the character's husband, and the pair have a child in the film. Sleiman felt it was important to depict "how loving and beautiful a queer family can be" rather than the "sexual or rebellious" depiction in some previous media.[18]Feige said the relationship was "always sort of inherent in the story" and he felt it was "extremely well done" in the film,[36]while Sleiman said it was a "thoughtful" depiction.[53]
Eternalsis set around eight months after the events ofAvengers: Endgame,[54]and addresses why the Eternals did not interfere in any previous conflicts in the MCU. Both Feige and Moore said the film would have "major ripple effects" on the future of the MCU, and at times, it was "a challenge" to balance the grounded nature of the MCU with the "mythic grandeur" of the Eternals property.[9]
By the time of the film's official announcement in July 2019,principal photographyhad begun atPinewood StudiosinBuckinghamshire, England.[55][56]Ben Davisserved as director of photography, after doing so on several previous MCU films.[10][57]Zhao said Marvel Studios allowed her creative freedom to shoot the film on location, "exactly the way [she] wanted to shoot" it. She was able to use a similar style to her previous films, including 360° shots and working with the same camera and rigs as were used for her filmNomadland(2020),[36]which Zhao was set to completeback-to-backwithEternals.[37]Zhao felt that she "got lucky in that Marvel wants to take risks and do something different."[36]Zhao citedThe Revenant(2015) as a primary influence when composing the film's action sequences.[58]
Gemma ChanandBarry Keoghanwere in talks to join the cast in August 2019.[59][60]Chan previously portrayedMinn-ErvainCaptain Marvel, but reports noted that she was potentially being looked at by Marvel to play a separate character in this film.[59]Since Minn-Erva dies in that film, Chan had felt that it was unlikely she would return to the MCU, but after working on the film she was told by Feige that the studio wanted to "make better use" of her in a future project. This led to Chan auditioning for Sersi, one of the last actresses to be considered for the role. Chan later described Sersi as the most difficult role for the film to cast.[61]Chan and Keoghan were confirmed to be cast in the film at theD23 Expoin August, in the roles of Sersi andDruig, respectively, along withKit HaringtonasDane Whitman.[62]Chan said she and Marvel Studios were surprised by how soon afterCaptain Marvelher new MCU role came, with both assuming that it would have been a project further in the future.[61]Harish Patelwas cast at the end of August asKarun, Kingo's manager,[63][64]and filmed his role from September 2019 until January 2020.[63]
By early November, filming had taken place in theCanary Islands. The cast and crew, including Jolie and Madden, had to be evacuated from a shooting location on the island ofFuerteventurawhen an explosive device, thought to be a remnant armament from a Nazi base, was found there.[65]Later that month,Zain Al Rafeeajoined the cast.[25][66]In early January 2020, filming took place outside theOxford University Museum of Natural HistoryinOxford, England,[67]as well asHampstead Heathand inCamdenin London,[68][69]under theworking titleSack Lunch.[69][70]Chan said the filming process felt very different from what she experienced onCaptain Marvel, explaining thatEternalsshot more on location and utilized natural light whileCaptain Marvelhad more studio work and bluescreens.[61]Filmingwrappedon February 4, 2020.[71]
In March 2020,Scanline VFX, one of the companies working on the film's visual effects, confirmed that they would be working remotely due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[72]Industrial Light & Magic,Luma Pictures,RISE, andWeta Digitalalso worked on the film's visual effects.[73]In early April, Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the pandemic, movingThe Eternals'release date to February 12, 2021.[74]In August, the film's title was officially shortened fromThe EternalstoEternals,[75]and the next month, the release date was pushed back to November 5, 2021.[76]Reshoots had taken place by mid-November 2020.[77]
Additional filming occurred inLos Angelesin early February, also under the working titleSack Lunch.[78]Dylan TichenorandCraig Woodserve as co-editors of the film.[37]Tichenor said Zhao usually edits her own films and has "strong opinions", but onEternalsshe was relying on Tichenor and Wood due to the size of the production and the ongoing awards season forNomadland. Tichenor added that Zhao respected the pair's editing experience and point of view, and they made their first cut of the film without much input from her. They began adjusting the film based on Zhao's feedback and were still working on the editing in April 2021.[79]At the end of the month, Zhao said editing for the film was in its "final stretch",[37]and Jashaun St. John was revealed to appear in the film, after previously starring in Zhao's filmSongs My Brothers Taught Me(2015).[80]
At the end of May 2021, with the release of the first teaser trailer and poster for the film, the official writing credits were revealed: Zhao was credited as the screenwriter, both as a solo contributor and as part of a writing team with Burleigh, while Ryan and Kaz Firpo received story credit.[1][81]Additionally,Gil Birminghamwas revealed to have been cast in the film,[82]although he was absent in the final film.[citation needed]In July 2021,Writers Guild of America Westpresented the film's final writing credits, awarding Ryan and Kaz Firpo screenplay credit along with Zhao and the team of Zhao and Burleigh, in addition to their story credit.[2][42]Moore believed the studio had "bit off as much as we could chew" with the film, creating one that "felt urgent and present and had [a fast] pace, but also took time to reflect back over the centuries".[9]
At the film's world premiere, Matt Donnelly ofVarietytweeted thatHarry Stylesmade an appearance in apost-credits sceneasEros,Thanos' brother in the comics, which was not shown in early press screenings of the film.[83]Zhao later revealed that she "kept tabs on [Styles]" since his appearance inDunkirk(2017), believing that he "makes me think of Eros as a character".[84]WWEwrestlerBecky Lynchhad a role in the film for a planned post-credits scene that was intended to set up a future project. The scene was removed for being reportedly "too depressing".[85]
Ramin Djawadicomposed the score for the film, after previously doing so for Marvel'sIron Man(2008).[86]Two songs from the film's soundtrack, "Across the Oceans of Time" and "Eternals Theme", were released assingleson October 22, 2021, while the full album was released on November 3.[87][88]
The first footage of the film was released in May 2021, as part of a promotional video from Marvel Studios celebrating their films and a return to theaters in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.[89][90]Though the footage was limited and "vague", Hoai-Tran Bui at/Filmstill felt it was "very exciting".[91]Chaim Gartenberg ofThe Vergefelt one of the biggest moments of the footage was seeing Jolie wielding a sword made of light. He was also encouraged thatEternalsappeared to be one of Marvel's first films to "deliver on [their] years-long promise of creating films with more diverse casts".[89]Nerdist'sMichael Arbeiter said the footage was quick, but felt that it "manages an air of wonderment".[90]
The first teaser for the film was released on May 24, 2021. Gartenberg felt the teaser was light on plot elements, with it instead focusing on the "civilization-spanning scope of the superhero team and its members throughout human history". He also believed the film was "a big swing" from Marvel Studios to entice audiences with a lesser-known comics property, but believed that it would succeed due to its diverse cast of well-known actors and Zhao's status as "one of the most exciting directors around".[92]io9'sCharlies Pulliam-Moore felt the trailer was a "multiple millennia-spanning recap of Earth's history", and said it was unclear how much the larger MCU would impact on the film outside of a brief reference to the Avengers at the end of the trailer.[93]Writing forEntertainment Weekly, Nick Romano felt the teaser was a combination of "thrilling, goosebump-inducing moments" and some jokes.[94]Erik Adams ofThe A.V. Clubfelt the spot teased some fresh angles for the MCU in a similar way toThor: Ragnarok(2017) andGuardians of the Galaxy(2014), and he enjoyed the images of Kingo's Bollywood dance, Sprite performing karaoke, and the end scene of the Eternals eating together and joking about the Avengers.[95]After seeing the teaser,Variety'sAdam B. Vary described the film as "unquestionably a Chloé Zhao movie", but wished more action set pieces were featured in the teaser to see how Zhao would approach them in the film.[1]Adele Ankers ofIGNdiscussed the poster that was released at the same time as the trailer, highlighting how the Eternals appear in silhouette against a sunlit background which she described as "another taste of Chloé Zhao's signature filming style and the use of natural light to illuminate a frame" that would be seen in the film.[96]Upon release, the teaser quickly became the number one trending video onYouTubeand amassed 77 million global views in its first 24 hours.[97]Disney's president of marketing Asad Ayaz said the teaser was designed to just be an introduction to the characters and tone and not give much of the film away, adding the marketing team would be "very judicious" on when more material would be revealed, while also using the releases ofBlack WidowandShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten RingsbeforeEternalsto help expose audiences to the characters.[98]
The final trailer was released in August 2021, with Ethan Shanfeld and Manori Ravindran ofVarietyfeeling it was "more serious in tone" than the teaser with the Eternals "grappling with the prospect of emerging after centuries living apart in order to help humans".[99]Entertainment Weekly'sDevan Coggan felt that the trailer was the "best glimpse yet" of the film and gave a "sense of the vast scale and scope of the film", while answering "one important question" about the absence of the Eternals during the conflict againstThanosinAvengers: Infinity WarandAvengers: Endgame.[100]Aaron Couch atThe Hollywood Reportersaid the trailer "reveals much of [the film's] plot as well as its characters' powers, teasing the answers to key questions about who the Eternals answer to, their relationship to Earth and why they ultimately didn't intervene" in the conflict against Thanos.[101]
In October 2021,Lexusreleased a commercial promoting the film and itsLexus IS 500sports sedan starring Nanjiani as Kingo, with frequent MCU directorsJoe and Anthony Russoguiding its development andFramestoreworking on the visual effects.[102]Lexus created tenconcept carsbased on the ten Eternals characters from the film.[103]TheLS 500handNXare featured in the film.[102]Beginning on November 20, 2021, select costumes from the film were part of theFuturesexhibit at theSmithsonian Institution'sArts and Industries Building, which ran through July 2022. Behind-the-scenes content looking at the evolution of the film's visuals as well as an augmented reality experience were also included in the exhibit.[104]

In May 2021, a Chinese state media report excludedEternals, as well asShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, from its list of upcoming MCU films releasing, whichVarietynoted "added to rumors" that the films would not be released in China, especially since Zhao had become "an unexpectedpersona non grata" in the country after she was scrutinized by Chinesenetizensover her remarks in a 2013 interview withFilmmakermagazine in which she described China as "a place where there are lies everywhere".[110][111][112]By September 2021,Deadline Hollywoodreported it remained "an open question" if the Chinese government or Zhao would attempt to "rehabilitate" the situation, but it "seems likely" the film would not be released in China following the country's response toNomadlandas well asShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Ringslikely not being released in the country either following backlash to comments made by starSimu Liuin 2017.[113]
The film was not released inSaudi Arabia,Kuwait,Qatar,BahrainandOmandue to the depiction of a gay couple. Theaters in theUnited Arab Emirates,Jordan,Lebanon, andEgyptwere set to show an edited version of the film which is missing all the love scenes.[114]Angelina Jolie criticized the countries' decision to ban the film, saying: "I'm sad for [those audiences]. And I'm proud of Marvel for refusing to cut those scenes out. I still don't understand how we live in a world today where there's still [people who] would not see the family Phastos has and the beauty of that relationship and that love. How anybody is angry about it, threatened by it, doesn't approve or appreciate it is ignorant."[115]Lebanese actorHaaz Sleiman, who played Phastos' husband Ben in the film, also voiced the same reaction towards the matter: "They stood their ground and said, 'Nope, we are not going to compromise the integrity of our film.' It made these Arab countries looks [sic] so ignorant and pathetic. I have no respect for those governments. They have displayed to the world that they are not only a disgrace to humanity, but to God. Hopefully this will inspire the Saudi people, the Kuwaiti people and the people in Qatar to fight back."[116]Marvel later agreed to cut any kind of love scenes, including the gay couple kiss for the film's release inIndonesia, which received praise from the IndonesianFilm Censorship Board(LSF).[117]

Charlotte O'Sullivan of theEvening Standarddescribed the film as "lavish" and "ambitious", and praised the fight sequences as "astounding, beautifully paced and crammed with detail".[144]Robert Abele ofTheWrapcommended the cinematography and felt "an earnestness to the operatic stakes".[145]Oliver Jones of theObservercalled it "full of wonder and romance and fueled by an agenda and audacity all its own".[146]Owen Gleibermanwas disappointed over Zhao's missing filmmaking style that shaped her filmsThe Rider(2017) andNomadland(2020) to "embrace the straight-up expository conventionality of Marvel filmmaking", but felt that the film was a "squarely fun and gratifying watch".[147]Moira Macdonald ofThe Seattle Timesthought "it's got some pretty slow spots midfilm and it's desperately in need of a bit more wit ... what it does have is a palpable, artful mood; this is a movie full of superheroes who spend time thinking and feeling, and of special effects that aren't just zippy but often delicately elegant".[148]
Linda Marric ofThe Jewish Chronicledescribed it as "a mishmash of well-meaning, yet jarringly verbose and bafflingly incoherent nonsense which is only just about saved by some half decent performances";[149]Nicholas Barber ofBBC Culturecalled Zhao's direction "workmanlike";[150]and Clarisse Loughrey ofThe Independentsaid that it "strives for the same expansive soulfulness" asNomadland"but discovers there's room enough only for the occasional burst of it".[151]Brian Truitt ofUSA Todaypraised Zhao's "penchant for naturalistic environments", but wrote that the narrative "struggles to juggle its many subplots and tries to do too much".[152]Mark Kennedy of theAssociated Presscriticized the dialogue and fight scenes, but praised the visual effects and Nanjiani's performance.[153]Shirley Li ofThe Atlanticfelt that "Zhao's delicate examination of her characters outshinesEternals'duller and more convoluted moments".[154]
Robbie Collinwrote the film was "constantly engaged in a kind of grit-toothed authenticity theatre, going out of its way to show you it's doing all the things proper cinema does, even though none of them bring any discernible benefit";[155]Kevin Maherfelt "a strange self-sabotaging energy at the heart";[156]and Steve Rose ofThe Guardianmissed "the breezy wit of Marvel's best movies ... like coming intoAvengers: Endgamecold without having seen any of the preceding installments".[157]K. Austin Collins ofRolling Stonefelt that the film was "good at telling us where to look, at impressing us with its manufactured sense of grandeur", but lacked "any credible sense of what's actually worth seeing".[158]Justin Changof theLos Angeles Timeshad a "depressing realization that you've just seen one of the more interesting movies Marvel will ever make, and hopefully the least interesting one Chloé Zhao will ever make".[159]Brian Lowry ofCNNthought "the movie's structural flaws offset its stunning visuals and strong performances".[160]Kyle SmithofNational Reviewwas harsher, describing it as "one of the dumbest, cheesiest, most trite, and least human" of the MCU films.[161]
The mixed reception surprised some commentators, given the MCU's positive track record and the acclaim of Zhao's previous work. Richard Newby ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote that "much of the criticism of Kirby's work", which was divisive for its subject matter and relationship to the widerMarvel Universe, "has followed Zhao in her adaptation." He compared the divisive response to that of Zack Snyder'sDC Extended UniversefilmsMan of SteelandBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016), writing that they andEternalsshare "a deconstructive approach to superheroes and force them to question their purpose in the world, through meditative and melancholy narrative beats, and a tragic yet hopeful ending." This approach, he felt, subverted critics and audiences' expectations, which made them review the film more harshly.[162]Zhao addressed some of the criticisms of the film, believing some of the divisiveness came from everyone "having an existential crisis" because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the film being an "existential crisis, both for humanity and God". She also felt the reactions to how the film incorporated her filmmaking sensibilities with Marvel's were "a testament to how much we had merged with each other; how uncomfortable that might make people feel".[163]
