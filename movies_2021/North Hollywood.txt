In October 2022, Alfred gathered a group of unfamiliar and young skateboarders who were hardly known and posted a trailer to a new video he had planned titledHell Week. News about the upcoming video was unknown to the included skateboarders due to Alfred insisting that they were only goingstreet skateboardingand nothing more. A skateboarder named Lando Magik began to post his clips to Instagram. Shortly after, Alfred started to ridicule Magik on the company page for using the clips that he had recorded. Alfred used his equipment to make the recordings possible, so he regarded the material as private property of his own. When Magik asked Alfred to release the footage, Alfred facetiously mentioned a charge of $700 thousand for Magik to gain access to them.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
