Jessica, a Scottishexpatriateto Colombia, awakens one night to a single loud boom. She appears to be the only one who can hear it. The next day, she goes to visit her sister, Karen, who is ill and in a hospital in Bogotá. Jessica operates a market-flower business in Medellín, and is curious to learn more about an excavation project being carried out in the same hospital where her sister is being treated.
Still bothered by the sound, which she hears repeatedly and which prevents her from sleeping, Jessica seeks the help of a youngsound engineernamed Hernán to recreate the sound. Though unsuccessful at first, the two eventually approximate the sound, and begin a friendly relationship. Right before they are to take a trip together, Jessica looks for Hernán at his sound engineering studio, only to discover that he is not there and no one working there knows who he is.
Finding herself growing increasingly uncomfortable in the company of her now-healthy sister, Jessica ventures out into the countryside alone, where she encounters a middle-agedfish scaler, also named Hernán. This Hernán lives a secluded life, but he speaks frankly with Jessica. They discuss his connection to the earth, his sleep, and their memories. Inside his home, Jessica learns to connect with her memories in a similar fashion to Hernán, and at one point while holding hands, appears to have her memories intertwine with his.
Jessica then approaches an open window and hears the booming sound again, but seems to have grown to accept it and even appreciate it. Suddenly, a camouflagedalien spacecraftrises out of the jungle, leaving a loudsonic boomin its wake. A radio broadcast is heard reporting a mildearthquakethat, unbeknownst to the general population, coincided with the take-off of the spacecraft. The broadcast goes on to say that the quake has unearthed previously inaccessible areas that the aforementioned excavation project was searching for.

NEON Rated, LLC,doing business asNeon(stylized inall caps), is an Americanindependent filmproductionanddistributioncompany founded in 2017 by CEO Tom Quinn andTim League, who also was the co-founder of theAlamo Drafthouse Cinemachain.[1]As of 2019, League is no longer involved with daily operations for the company.[6]
Its first film,Colossal, was released in 2017.[7]The company became known for distributing such notable films asI, Tonya(2017),Parasite(2019),Portrait of a Lady on Fire(2019),Palm Springs(2020),Flee(2021),Spencer(2021),The Worst Person in the World(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023),Anora(2024),Longlegs(2024),The Seed of the Sacred Fig(2024), andThe Monkey(2025).[8][9]
Parasitewent on to become Neon's highest-grossing film at the worldwidebox officewith $262 million and the first non-English-language film to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture.[10]In 2024,Longlegshad a domestic box office gross of $58.6 million, becoming the distributor's highest-grossing film ever in North America.[11]Anorabecame the company's second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[12]Neon has also worked with several high-profile filmmakers, which includesSean Baker,[13]Bong Joon Ho,Julia Ducournau,Craig Gillespie,Pablo Larraín, andCéline Sciamma.[14]
During the 4th Annual Zurich Summit, Tom Quinn commented on Neon's intent to release titles that appeal to audiences who "skew under 45, that have no aversion to violence, no aversion to foreign language and to non-fiction".[15]Explaining the success of the company in 2024, Quinn stated: "We were very much a startup, with everyone functioning as this sophisticated amoeba. We very quickly found ourselves that year inTorontowith a great slate [...] That work enabled us to sit at the table in Toronto that year and buyI, Tonya. Before the ink was even dry on the deal, we were planning itsOscar campaign. It's a testament to how quickly we can make decisions because we're not this big studio. We've always used that to our advantage."[16]
In September 2017, the company partnered withBlumhouse Productionsto manage BH Tilt.[17]In 2018, a majority stake of Neon was sold to30West, the media venture arm of "The Friedkin Group".[4][18]In February 2021,Bleecker Streetpartnered with Neon to launch the joint home entertainment distribution companyDecal, which is a standalone full-service operation that handlesdistribution dealson the home entertainment rights to both Neon and Bleecker Street's features. The first film to be distributed through Decal was the Bleecker Street releaseSupernovain winter 2021.[5]Additionally, Decal acquired North American distribution rights to the South Africanhorror filmGaiafor a summertheatrical release, marking their first ever acquisition.[19]
Andrew Brown (Co-President of Decal) oversaw the launch of Neon's home entertainment division. In 2022, Brown was promoted to "President of Digital Distribution". The exec, who has served as "SVP of Digital Strategy, Marketing, and Distribution" for Neon since 2017, also manages Neon's library, and oversees the annualFYC DVD Box Setanddirect-to-consumerdigital portal "Neon Cinema".[20]Prior to the joint-venture,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, as well asThe Criterion CollectionandWell Go USA Entertainment(for the filmPossessorwhich Neon and Well Go co-distributed), distributed several Neon films onhome video.[21][22][23]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, Neon was approved to continue promotional activities for its films since the company does not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP) nor had encountered any issue in receivingSAG-AFTRAinterim agreements.[24][25][26]
In August 2023, Neon hired formerA24employees Alexandra Altschuler as "VP Media" and Don Wilcox as "VP Marketing".[27]That same month, Neon hired former Sierra/Affinity employee Kristen Figeroid as "President of International Sales and Distribution", Laurel Charnetsky as "VP International Acquisitions & Operations", and Dan Stadnicki as "Manager, International Sales & Distribution".[28]In May 2024, Neon hired Joey Monteiro as "EVP, International Marketing" and Ashley Hirsch as "Manager of International Sales and Marketing".[29]That same month, Neon promoted Elissa Federoff from "President of Distribution" to "Chief Distribution Officer" and Ryan Friscia from "EVP, Finance and Business Development" to "Chief Financial Officer".[30]Furthermore, Jeff Deutchman, who joined Neon when it was launched, serves as "President of Acquisitions and Production".[31]
Additionally, Neon has acquired the distribution rights to fivePalme d'Orwinners at theCannes Film Festival:Parasite(2019),Titane(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023), andAnora(2024); all five won consecutively.[31][32][33]The company's strategy to acquire such titles at Cannes is to eschew "the lazy approach", said Deutchman. "The only real way to do Cannes is to go see as many movies as you can, because you never know where the nextDogtoothorBorderorHungerorForce Majeureis going to come from", he added, citing several modern Cannes standouts championed by arthouse buyers.[31]After acquiringParasitein 2018, Neon financed and distributed the film the following year in U.S. territories.[34]"From the very beginning, Tom Quinn sawParasiteas a universal film and refused to put it in a box as a foreign-language or international film", saidParasitedirectorBong Joon Ho. "He saw the heart of the film and understood that it was about all of us living in our modern class-based society. I was always grateful for that."[16]Neon spent $20 million promoting, distributing, and campaigning for the film's awards.[3]The film subsequently became Neon's highest-grossing film with more than $200 million at the worldwidebox officeand won fourAcademy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Director. Similarly, Neon spent $18 million promotingAnora, three times the film's original budget.[3]Anoraultimately won the two aforementioned Academy Awards whileAnatomy of a FallandTriangle of Sadnesswere nominated for the same two categories, among others. As of March 2025, Neon has garnered 39 Academy Award nominations, winning 11 overall.[10][12][35]
In 2023, Quinn commented on the company's success at Cannes, saying: "We've seen over the years that each of these films, because of their credibility and success, the Palme d'Or has come to mean something quite impactful for a very young group ofcinephiles. And the reason why we know this is we've tested all these movies and dating back toParasite, probably I think, the fifth reason why people came to see the film, in itstest screeninginSherman Oaks, was the fact that it won the Palme d'Or, and each subsequent year that went up. And this year, the number one reason why people came to see the film [Anatomy of a Fall], at a test screening inBurbank, was the fact that it had won the Palme d'Or."[36]In 2024, Quinn stated: "The award means a lot. To audiences here who are looking for the absolute most adventurous, forward-looking cinema available, that award represents it because these films have delivered, and they've been major Oscar contenders."[16]
In July 2024, Neon received its biggest opening weekend at the box office with the horror thriller filmLonglegs, after scoring $22.6 million from 2,510 theaters (a figure that includes $2.5–3 million in Thursday previews) and only behindUniversal/Illumination's second weekend ofDespicable Me 4. Initially projected to gross $7–9 million, the opening marked the biggest total for an original horror film of 2024, one of the top 20 weekends for an independent film and the best opening ever for an independent horror film.[37][38][39]To promote the film, Neon utilizedguerrilla marketingtactics similar to those that led to the box office success ofThe Blair Witch Project(1999).[40]DirectorOz Perkinscredited Neon for the film's marketing, stating the studio "really responded strongly to the movie, the raw materials of the movie really excited them, the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it sounds. They asked me early on, 'Do we have your permission to kind of go nuts?' And I said, 'What else are we doing here? Go for it. Do your thing.'"[41]The film's total marketing budget was under $10 million, focusing ondigital contentand not havingtelevision ads.[37]During its third weekend,Longlegsbecame the company's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office, earning $58.6 million, surpassing whatParasiteearned with $53.3 million in 2020.[11]Furthermore, it became the top grossing R-rated horror film of 2024 and the highest-grossing indie horror film of the last decade, topping A24'sTalk to Me(2022),Insidious: Chapter 3(2015) fromFocus Features, and A24'sHereditary(2018).[11]Afterward, furthering their marketing campaign, from August 1 to 4, Neon (partnering withAtom Tickets) offered free tickets to anyone who has a birthday that falls on the 14th of any given month. To get the tickets, those who registered and purchased tickets through Atom Tickets received a special promo code after verifying their date of birth and were able to get one free ticket per customer, while supplies lasted.[42]

Apichatpong Weerasethakul[a](Thai:อภิชาติพงศ์ วีระเศรษฐกุล;RTGS:‹See RfD›Aphichatphong Wirasetthakun;IPA:[ʔà.pʰí.tɕʰâːt.pʰōŋwīː.rá.sèːt.tʰà.kūn],[2]born 16 July 1970) is a Thaiindependent filmdirector, screenwriter, film producer and Professor atTama Art Universityin Tokyo. Working outside the strict confines of the Thai film studio system, Apichatpong has directed several features and dozens of short films. Friends and fans sometimes refer to him as "Joe" (a nickname that he, like many with similarly longThai names, has adopted out of convenience).[3]
His feature films includeUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, winner of the2010 Cannes Film FestivalPalme d'Or;Tropical Malady, which won theJury Prizeat the2004 Cannes Film Festival;Blissfully Yours, which won the top prize in theUn Certain Regardprogram at the2002 Cannes Film Festival;[4]Syndromes and a Century, which premiered at the63rd Venice International Film Festivaland was the first Thai film to be entered in competition there; andCemetery of Splendour, which premiered in theUn Certain Regardsection of the2015 Cannes Film Festivalto critical acclaim.[5]Apichatpong has received numerous additional accolades, including the2016 Principal Prince Claus Awardand the eighth edition of the Artes Mundi Prize.[6]His first English-language film wasMemoria, a 2021 international collaboration set inColombia.
Themes reflected in his films include dreams, nature, sexuality (including his ownhomosexuality),[7]andWesternperceptions of Thailand and Asia, and his films display a preference for unconventional narrative structures and for working with non-actors.
Apichatpong has also widely exhibited in galleries, including FACT in Liverpool, and theBFI Galleryin London, the contemporary art space withinBFI Southbank.[8]
Apichatpong was born inBangkok, Thailand, to aThai Chinesefamily.[9]Both his parents had been physicians who worked at a hospital inKhon Kaen, while his grandparents came from Canton. Apichatpong never learned to speak Chinese as his father, who was also a member of theHouse of Representatives,[10]died when he was young.[11]
Apichatpong grew up in a traditionalBuddhistfamily, exposed to rituals that incorporateanimismandHinduism, spiritual practices retained in thesurrealisttones of his works today. Among the filmmaker's early influences are theDada movementandJoseph Cornell's "boxes".[11]
Apichatpong attendedKhon Kaen Universityand received abachelor's degreeinarchitecturein 1994. He made his first short film,Bullet, in 1993. He attended theSchool of the Art Institute of Chicagoand received aMaster of Fine Artsin filmmaking in 1997.[9]
Apichatpong's feature-length debut,Dokfa nai meuman(Mysterious Object at Noon) is a documentary[12]and was conceptually based upon the "exquisite corpse" game invented bysurrealists.[citation needed]He co-founded the production company, Kick the Machine, in 1999, and uses the company as a vehicle for his own works, alongside Thai experimental films and video. The list of other founders includes Gridthiya Gaweewong and Suaraya Weerasethakul and the company co-organised the Bangkok Experimental Film Festival in 1999, 2001, 2005 and 2008.[13]
Apichatpong's2002filmSud Sanaeha(Blissfully Yours) was his debut narrative feature film[12]and was awarded theUn Certain Regard prizeat the2002 Cannes Film Festival,[4]though it was censored in his native Thailand.[14]His 2004Sud Pralad(Tropical Malady) won aJury Prizefrom the same festival.
BetweenBlissfully YoursandTropical Malady, Apichatpong co-directedThe Adventure of Iron Pussywith artistMichael Shaowanasai, who starred as the main character, atransvestitesecret agent, while pop singerKrissada Terrence, better known as Noi from the Thai bandPru, portrayed the male lead.[15]The low-budget, digital movie was a spoof of Thai films of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the musicals and action films ofMitr ChaibanchaandPetchara Chaowarat.[16]The Adventure of Iron Pussywas screened at theBerlin Film Festivalin 2004.[17]When asked about the film in May 2013, Apichatpong said: "I have had enough of Iron Pussy for now. I was having a good time making it but I was not inspired."[12]
Along with his features, Apichatpong is also known for his short films, videoworks and installations. For the 2005Jeonju International Film Festival, he was commissioned to contribute to theThree Digital Short Filmsproject, alongside two other Asian directors. His film was calledWorldly Desires, while Japanese filmmakerShinya TsukamotomadeVital, Bullet BalletandSong Il-gonfrom South Korea createdMagician(s).[18]
In 2005 Apichatpong served as the consultant on theTsunami Digital Short Films, a series of 13 films commissioned by the Thailand Culture Ministry's Office of Contemporary Art and Culture as a memorial tribute to the2004 Indian Ocean earthquakeand the resultingtsunamithat struck Thailand.[19]His contribution was the filmGhost of Asia.[20]
The Thai Office of Contemporary Art and Culture also honoured Apichatpong with its 2005Silpathorn Awardfor filmmaking. The annual award is given to living contemporary artists in various disciplines.[19]
In 2006, Apichatpong released a feature film,Syndromes and a Century, that was commissioned byPeter Sellarsfor the New Crowned Hope Festival inViennato celebrate the 250th anniversary ofMozart's birth.[21]It premiered at the 63rdVenice Film Festivaland screened at numerous film events, such as the2006 Toronto International Film Festival.[22]
The film's Thai release, originally slated for 19 April 2007, was indefinitely delayed after theThai Censorship Boarddemanded the removal of four scenes.[23]Apichatpong refused to recut the film and said he would withdraw the film from domestic circulation. He explained his reasons for doing so in an article in theBangkok Post:
I, as a filmmaker, treat my works as I do my own sons or daughters. I don't care if people are fond of them or despise them, as long as I created them with my best intentions and efforts. If these offspring of mine cannot live in their own country for whatever reason, let them be free. There is no reason to mutilate them in fear of the system. Otherwise there is no reason for one to continue making art.[24]
Two of the "sensitive" scenes involve doctors engaging in "inappropriate" conduct (kissing and drinking liquor) in a hospital; the others depict aBuddhist monkplaying a guitar and two monks playing with a remote-controlflying saucer.[25]The censors refused to return the print unless the requested cuts were made.[26]In 2007 the film was shown twice in privately arranged screenings at theAlliance françaisein Bangkok.[27]
The censorship of the film came about as amotion picture ratings systemwas being considered by thejunta-appointedNational Legislative Assembly. A replacement for the 1930 film act, the ratings law contained a restrictive ratings structure and retained the government's powers to censor and ban films it deemed would "undermine or disrupt social order and moral decency, or that might impact national security or the pride of the nation".[28]The ratings board would comprise mainly bureaucrats in the Ministry of Culture, as well as members of theRoyal Thai Police.[29]
To oppose the draft law, Apichatpong and other directors formed the Free Thai Cinema Movement.[30]Apichatpong was quoted as saying: "We disagree with the right of the state to ban films ... There already are other laws that cover potential wrongdoings by filmmakers."[31]Ladda Tangsupachai, director of the Ministry of Culture's Cultural Surveillance Department, said the ratings law was needed because moviegoers in Thailand are "uneducated". She further explained, "They're not intellectuals, that's why we need ratings ... Nobody goes to see films by Apichatpong. Thai people want to see comedy. We like a laugh."[32]
The filmmakers sought a self-regulation approach, with the founding of an independent body run by film professionals. Apichatpong had written in a commentary earlier in the year:
Free from state influence, this agency would be responsible for monitoring and assigning ratings, and it would bear direct responsibilities towards the audience, who in turn would monitor the performance of the agency. This way, the film industry will be liberated from the state's shackles and begin to have a dialogue with the public.[33]
A protest against the draft ratings law was held outside the Parliament building in Bangkok, at which Apichatpong and fellow Thai directorsWisit SasanatiengandPen-Ek Ratanaruangheld banners that read: "No Freedom. No Democracy. No Peace"[31][34]The ratings law, with the "cut-and-ban" categories left intact, was passed on 20 December 2007.[29]
Apichatpong presented the "Apichatpong On Video Works" session as part of the "Tomyam Pladib" art exhibition that featured both Thai and Japanese artists who produced works regarding the coexistence of traditional and modern cultures. The filmmaker's presentation consisted of three short films:Ghost Of Asia,0116643225059andThe Anthem. Apichatpong also answered questions from the audience to conclude the presentation.[20]
The first English-language book on Apichatpong was published in March 2009.James Quandtis the editor and author of the analytical career overview that introduces the book. Other contributors include the cultural and political theorist Benedict Anderson, filmmaker Mark Cousins, art curator Karen Newman, criticsTony Raynsand Kong Rithdee, and actressTilda Swinton.
"Primitive", Apichatpong's first solo exhibition—composed of a two-channel video installation, seven single-channel videos, and two giclée prints[35]—was first shown at Haus der Kunst in February 2009. In September 2009, the exhibition was shown inLiverpool, United Kingdom (UK) at FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology).[36]The work was commissioned by Haus der Kunst, ofMunich, Germany, with FACT and Animate Projects, and was produced by Illuminations Films, London and Kick the Machine. Curator Karen Newman wrote in the introduction for the exhibition: "His works are also vehicles that take us between different worlds, asking questions about the future and revealing a much bigger story than at first appears." Primitive was shot in the border town, Nabua, where the Mekong River divides Thailand andLaos.[36][37]In 2011 theNew Museumpresented the American debut ofPrimitive[35]
In 2010, Apichatpong's feature film,Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, won thePalme d'Orat the Cannes Film Festival.[38]The film was also selected as the Thai entry for theBest Foreign Language Filmat the83rd Academy Awards[39]but it did not make the final shortlist.[40]
In 2012, Apichatpong's filmMekong Hotelwas screened in the Special Screenings section at the2012 Cannes Film Festival.[41][42]
In March 2013, Apichatpong and fellow Kick The Machine artist Chai Siri received the "Sharjah Biennial Prize" at the 2013 Sharjah Biennial 11 in theUnited Arab Emirates(UAE), alongside five other artists, including Magdi Mostafa and Fumito Urabe.[43]Apichatpong was also awardedJapan's "Fukuoka Art and Culture Prize" in June, alongsideIndianvisual artistNalini Malani, worth 3,000,000yen(US$30,530).[44]
In March 2014, it was announced that Apichatpong will feature among 32 directors from four continents, includingVincent GalloandGaspar Noé, to directShort Plays, a soccer-themed omnibus production shot around the world.[45]Apichatpong's short is set in his home town, features 22 shots of its lake, almost the only recognizable feature from his childhood, which are arranged like players in a soccer game.[46]
Apichatpong's latest film,Memoria, a collaboration withTilda Swinton, produced by Diana Bustamante and shot inColombiain 2019, had its premiere in the2021 Cannes Film Festival. It received theJury Prize(ex aequo), alongsideNadav Lapid'sAhed's Knee.[47][48]Apichatpong also directed a segment ofThe Year of the Everlasting Storm, an anthology film.[49]
It was reported in October 2024 that Weerasethakul is preparing a new feature film set inSri Lanka, with production expected to begin in 2026.[50]The film is likely to be inspired by Arthur C. Clarke'sThe Fountains of Paradise(1979) as well as an article written by a Thai woman who went to Sri Lanka on a religious pilgrimage.[51]
In a May 2013 interview for theEncounter Thailandjournal, Apichatpong stated that all of his films are personal in nature and he does not consider himself a cultural ambassador for Thailand. In relation to the concept of "queer", he explained: "For me, the word queer means anything’s possible."[12]
In December 2023, alongside 50 other filmmakers, Apichatpong signed an open letter published inLibérationdemanding a ceasefire and an end to the killing of civilians amid the2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, and for a humanitarian corridor into Gaza to be established for humanitarian aid, and the release of hostages.[52][53][54]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
