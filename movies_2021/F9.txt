On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 60% of 315 critics gaveF9a positive review, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site's critics consensus reads, "F9sends the franchise hurtling further over the top than ever, but director Justin Lin's knack for preposterous set pieces keeps the action humming."[73]According toMetacritic, which assigned a weighted average of 58 out of 100 based on 54 critics, the film received "mixed or average reviews".[74]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakreported 80% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 62% saying they would definitely recommend it.[64]
FromTheWrap,Alonso Duraldesummarized the film by writing that "Physics, gravity, and logic in general have long since been thrown out the window, but the jolts of pleasure keep coming."[75]Matt Patches ofPolygoncriticized the film for its lack of characterization, saying, "After 20 years ofFastfilms, Dom is a totally functional blockbuster superhero," and that "F9counteracts any character development by devoting a grating amount of time to meta-commentary on its own ridiculousness." However, he also praised Lin's direction and the set pieces by writing, "Each location fills Lin's pockets with the currency of imagination, which he cashes in with absolute delight. Where previous installments built off the glory ofThe Italian Job,The French Connection, andMad Max: Fury Road,F9finds inspiration in the Harlem Globetrotters. The cars catch falling bystanders, flip over enemy off-roaders, and stage intricately choreographed attacks using amped-up magnets."[76]
Variety'sOwen Gleibermanfound one of the opening scenes to be "the suspenseful high point of the movie," and wrote, "The scene is so over-the-top ludicrous that it's [as] if the filmmakers were saying, 'Let's put what would have been the grand climax ofFast and Furious 4in the opening half hour.' Good enough. But what do you do for an encore?"[77]Writing forThe Hollywood Reporter, John DeFore said that the feature "probably sounds like more fun than it is," and concluded his generally negative review by saying that "Furious 7was a lot more fun. And, not that anyone cares, but it was more believable as well."[78]Meanwhile,IndieWire's David Ehrlich gave a more negative response with a C+ rating, and praised Lin's direction, writing, "This is a movie that sling-shots so far past self-parody that it loops all the way back to something real."[79]Jesse Hassenger ofThe A. V. Clubalso gave the film a C+ rating, remarking that "Lin's writing just isn't as fleet as his directing—and his directing inF9isn't as fleet as his work onFast FiveorFast & Furious 6." He added, "The problem is all the runway in between the highlights, even longer than the endless literal concrete of theFast & Furious 6climax. After a reinvention as a warmer, more diverseMission: Impossible(practically name-checked here), the series has wound up more like a mid-period James Bond movie in its channel-surfing bloat."[80]
Fast Xwas released on May 19, 2023.[89]AlthoughFast Xwas reported as the final mainline installment of the franchise, an eleventh film,Fast XI(2026), is in production.[90][91]
