Because of their own experience with the entertainment industry, Birch's parents were reluctant to encourage her to act, but were persuaded to show Birch's photograph to talent agents by a babysitter who noticed her imitating commercials.[13]Birch got her first big break at the age of four, when the babysitter accompanied her to a successful audition for aQuaker Oatscommercial.[11]
Birch appeared in commercials in the late 1980s forBurger King,California Raisins,Quaker Oats, andVlasic Pickles.[11][14]She made her film debut as Molly Johnson in the 1988 science fiction comedyPurple People Eater, for which she received aYoung Artist Awardin the category of "Best Young Actress Under Nine Years of Age".[15]That same year, she guest-starred in an episode ofDoogie Howser, M.D.,[16]and was cast in the regular role of Molly on theNBCsitcomDay By Day. The show ran for two seasons and earned Birch a further two Young Artist nominations.[15]
In 1990, Birch was cast in a principal role onParenthood, a sitcom based on the1989 film of the same name, which ran for a single season on NBC. Birch co-starred as Billie Pike in the 1991 dramaParadise, withRoger Ebertcommenting in his review for theChicago Sun-Timesthat Birch played the role with "strong, simple charm".[17]She appeared in the festive comedyAll I Want for Christmasthat same year, playing a girl who schemes to reunite her divorced parents.

At age 11, Birch starred in the Halloween-set fantasy filmHocus Pocus(1993), playing Dani Dennison, the younger sister of a teenage boy who inadvertently resurrects a trio of witches. Making US$39 million in the U.S. (against a budget of US$28 million),[21]Hocus Pocuswas not considered a financial success, but quickly developed a sizeablecult followingdue to strong home video sales and television re-runs.[22][23]"I think the most surreal thing is that it keeps getting more popular instead of the other way around", Birch later said, while admitting the experience was "the most amount of fun I've ever had on a set".[24]
In the 1994 comedyMonkey Trouble, Birch portrayed a girl who befriends aCapuchin monkey. In a positive review for theAustin Chronicle, Marjorie Baumgarten observed that Birch's "nuanced performance (a rarity amongst child performers) no doubt lendsMonkey Troubleits realistic touch".[25]That same year, she reprised herPatriot Gamesrole in its sequel,Clear and Present Danger, which grossed over US$215 million globally.[26]She was then cast as "Teeny" Tercell in the 1995 coming-of-age dramaNow and Then. The film was largely dismissed by critics upon release,[27]but has since been recognised as a milestone of its genre.[28]Next, Birch headlined the adventure filmAlaska(1996), playing one of two siblings who cross the Alaskan wilderness in search of their lost father. TheAustin Chroniclefound it to be a "decent kids' adventure movie" with an "impeccable" performance by Birch.[29]For the next two years, she did not appear on film but guest-starred in episodes ofPromised LandandTouched by an Angel.
Birch appeared in several projects in 1999: firstly, the made-for-television filmNight Ride Home, where she played a teenager grieving the loss of her older brother. Writing forVariety, David Kronke called it "a thoughtful and sensitive examination of how a family copes with grief", and said of the performances, "De Mornay… digs deep and comes up with a character that seems true;Burstynand Birch competently complement [her]".[30]Next, she played the small, uncredited role of Mary inAnywhere but Here.
Birch's portrayal of insecure teenager Jane Burnham inAmerican Beauty,Sam Mendes' darkdramedyabout the struggles of a middle class household, was roundly praised by critics,[31][32]withPeter TraversofRolling Stonewriting that she"[glimmered]with grown-up radiance".[33]The performance earned her aBAFTAnomination forBest Supporting Actress,[34]while the film was the recipient of the 1999Academy Award for Best Pictureand grossed over US$356 million worldwide,[35][36]emerging as the biggest commercial success of Birch's career to date.[37]She later said of the experience, "There was a lot of therapy involved … A lot of opening up and sharing things from our own lives about why we related to these characters. Everybody brought a lot of themselves to it. I knowAnnettedid a lot of research about women becoming obsessed with the self-help realm.Kevinwas working out obsessively and already in the headspace of [his character] Lester, even in rehearsals. And then there wasWes,Menaand I, who were these kids just incredibly excited to be there and watching [these] masters at their craft — just trying to absorb as much as we could from them".[38]
Following the success ofAmerican Beauty, Birch appeared in two films released in 2000: low-budget dramaThe Smokers, in which Birch was called "a scene-stealer" byThe Hollywood Reporter,[39]andDungeons & Dragons, a poorly-received adaptation of the fantasyrole-playing game of the same name.[40]British horror filmThe Holecame next, where she starred as Elizabeth Dunn, a devious schoolgirl who lures her friends into an underground bunker. In a mixed review forVariety,Derek Elleystated that Birch gave "an effectively creepy lead [performance]", but called the film "clunky" in its "attempt to merge the psychothriller and teen movie genres".[41]
Birch's next project was the satirical 2001 comedyGhost World, directed byTerry Zwigoff. Based on thegraphic novel of the same name, the film was released to an enthusiastic critical reception and developed a loyal cult following.[42][43][2]James Berardinellifound Birch's part to be her "first effectively developed role" sinceAmerican Beauty, commending the actress for the "quirkiness [and the] underlying sense of melancholy and ennui" in her portrayal ofEnid Coleslaw.[44]Meanwhile, A. O. Scott said in his appraisal forThe New York Times:
Thora Birch, whose performance as Lester Burnham's alienated daughter was the best thing aboutAmerican Beauty,plays a similar character here, with even more intelligence and restraint. Enid's capacity for scorn is unlimited: her plucked eyebrows might illustrate a dictionary entry for "supercilious," and her quiet voice shoots darts of sarcasm in every direction.[45]
Birch received various accolades forGhost World,[15]including a nomination for the 2002Golden Globe Award for Best Actress.[46]
In 2003, she appeared as thetitle characterin the biographical television filmHomeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story, starring as a young woman who, after becoming homeless at 15 amid personal tragedies, decides to finish her schooling. Birch's performance earned her a nomination for theEmmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actressthat year.[47]
Birch played a supporting role inSilver City, a political satire directed byJohn Sayles, which premiered at the2004 Cannes Film Festival. Theindependentfeature received mixed reviews, butEmpire'sAngie Errigo thought Birch's portrayal of whistleblower Karen Cross was "terrific".[48]She co-starred in the crime dramaSlingshotthe following year.
InDark Corners(2006), a psychological horror-thriller about a young woman who wakes up one day as a different person, Birch starred in the dual role of Susan Hamilton and Karen Clarke. The film received a mixed reception, with Adam DiLeo ofIGNpraising its surreal,David Lynch-style elements, but criticizing Birch's performance.[49]She followed this with roles in two more genre films:Train—a loose remake of the 1980 slasher filmTerror Train, released in 2008—and the psychological thrillerDeadline, in which she co-starred withBrittany Murphy, who died shortly after the film's release in December 2009.[50]Birch later revealed she had been concerned about Murphy's wellbeing during filming.[51]
In the true crime dramaWinter of Frozen Dreams(2009), Birch played Barbara Hoffman, a Wisconsin prostitute convicted of murder in the first-ever televised murder trial.[52]In a review forBloody Disgusting, John Marrone described Birch's "alluring" performance as the highlight of the film.[53]Next, she took on the role of journalist Sidney Bloom inThe Pregnancy Pact, aLifetimemovie based on the true story of a group of high schoolers inGloucester, Massachusetts, who plotted to get pregnant at the same time and raise their children communally.[54]The film was watched by 5.9 million viewers when it premiered in January 2010.[55]Later that year, Birch was cast—in what would have been her stage debut—asLucyin theoff-Broadwayrevival ofHamilton Deane'sDracula,[56]but was subsequently dismissed from the production for the alleged behavior of her father—her manager at the time—who was reported to have physically threatened one of the show's cast members during a rehearsal.[6]
Birch played the role of Vivian inPetunia(2012), an independent dramedy depicting the lives and romantic relationships of a dysfunctional New York family. Birch, who is credited as one of its producers,[51]described the "intimate [and] honest" feature as "a little bit different".[57]Given a small theatrical release in the U.S.,[58]the film garnered mixed reviews,[59]though Birch and the rest of the ensemble were praised.[60][61]
After devoting herself to academic pursuits, which included securing a degree in legal studies throughKaplan University,[62]Birch returned to acting in 2015 with a recurring role as software engineer Morgan on the first season ofUSA Network'sColony.[63]It was later revealed that Birch would not return for the second season  because of a scheduling conflict, and that the part had been recast.[64]
Birch starred as a left-wing activist in the 2018 political thrillerAffairs of State, which Noel Murray ofThe Los Angeles Timescalled "refreshingly smart".[65]In a less favorable review forForbes, Luke Y. Thompson wrote, "[cinematographer] Horacio Marquinez gamely films everything like it's an art movie, though there's one scene in which he shoots Birch so unflatteringly that you wonder what she must have done to make him mad".[66]She headlined and co-producedThe Competitionthat same year, an independent romantic comedy.[67]
Next, Birch starred in the 2018 dramaThe Etruscan Smile—an adaptation ofJosé Luis Sampedro'snovel—which was filmed in Scotland and received strong reviews.[68][69]The following year, she played a supporting role in the crime thrillerAbove Suspicion, which—afterPatriot GamesandClear and Present Dangerin the 1990s—marked her third collaboration with directorPhillip Noyce. In a positive review forThe Guardian,Peter Bradshawcommented, "There's an interesting cameo from Thora Birch [as the] long-suffering Jolene".[70]
Birch's cameo appearance inThe Last Black Man in San Francisco(2019), a drama about a young man's pursuit to reclaim the Victorian home built by his grandfather, was considered a crucial part of the film's success.[3]Speaking of her casting and the symbolic nature of the part, directorJoe Talbotsaid:
Thora is one of the great actresses of her generation and her work, in part, inspired me to want to make films. Her performance inGhost Worldmade me feel seen as a teenager when I was a bit lost. At the end of that film, [she] rides a bus off into the sunset. In our film, we meet her character on a bus in the heart of San Francisco—almost as if she kept riding it all these years, and somehow wound up in theBay Areaworking a tech job she loathed. Her exchange that follows with [main character] Jimmie, however brief, has been written about and quoted more than any other part of the film.[3]
The film premiered at theSundance Film Festivalin January 2019, where it won awards for Best Directing and a Special Jury Prize for Creative Collaboration.[71]It was released theatrically in the U.S. byA24.
Between 2019–2020, Birch appeared in the role of Mary (aka "Gamma") on thetenth seasonofAMC's post-apocalyptic horror seriesThe Walking Dead,[72]withCollidercommenting that she brought "emotional depth" to the part.[73]Birch called the experience "a fun, massive thing to have been a part of".[62]Next, in the independent drama13 Minutes(2021), she played a single mother struggling to keep her family together in the wake of a destructive tornado.Rex ReedofThe New York Observerfelt that the film succeeded on the strength of its "compelling" and "likable" ensemble, singling out Birch as a highlight.[74]
Birch made her directorial debut in 2022 withThe Gabby Petito Story, a Lifetime television movie in which she also co-starred.[4]The film is based on the2021 disappearanceof Petito, a 22-year-old who was murdered by her boyfriend during a cross-country drive. Birch said she had been wanting to direct since she was "nine or ten years old" and that it was the subject matter which drew her to the project: "There's an element of abusive relationships in this story that I think so many of us can relate to … [it] captured the entire nation's attention in the middle ofCovid… Everyone stopped and took a minute and [said] "Where’s Gabby? What happened to Gabby?" That kind of fascination and focus point was something that I thought was a third character in [the] story".[75]The ethical nature of dramatizing such recent events was met with public criticism,[76]especially as the film—which premiered on October 12, 2022, just over one year after Petito's death—was made without the involvement of the Petito family.[76]
Also in 2022, Birch played Audrey Beach in the ten-part fictional podcastOverleaper,[77]an espionage-style thriller about a female soldier embarking on a top-secret mission. Birch said it was the idea of "a return to the old radio dramas … from the [1920s and '30s]", as well as the luxury of acting with her voice and not having to endure "the harsh physical positions that the character is in", which drew her to the project.[78]
It was announced at the2023 Cannes Film Festivalthat Birch's next project as director—her feature debut—will be an adaptation ofElmore Leonard's novelMr. Paradise, making her the first woman to direct a Leonard adaptation.[79]
Birch married talent manager andphilanthropistMichael Benton Adler on December 21, 2018.[80][81]Birch is a long-timeDemocratwho was a delegate at the2012 Democratic National Convention.[82][83]She has supportedJoe Bidenand local political efforts, such asCongressmanWiley Nickel's campaign.[84][85]
