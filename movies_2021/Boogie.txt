Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Working as an expeditor was a skill he learned from his father.[17]In 2011, Huang was named to the Chow 13, a list of influential people in food presented annually by Chow.com.[18][19]

Another restaurant, Xiao Ye, was less successful and closed after poor reviews and controversy over its sales ofFour Loko.[24]Sam Sifton, a reviewer forThe New York Times,awarded the restaurant zero (out of four) stars, and wrote that "if Mr. Huang spent even a third of the time cooking that he does writing funny blog posts and wry Twitter updates, posting hip-hop videos and responding to Internet friends, rivals, critics and customers, Xiao Ye might be one of the more interesting restaurants to open inNew York Cityin the last few months."[25]
Huang created the blog calledFresh Off the Boatand later publisheda memoirwith Random House by the same name.[26]Fresh Off the Boat: A Memoirwas released in early 2013, receiving favorable reviews fromPublishers Weekly[27]andThe New York Times.[28]

In 2014, Huang was the host ofSnack OffonMTV. The show featured Huang, mentoring contestants participating in challenges that determine who can whip up the tastiest treats using random ingredients like fish sticks, canned oysters, chocolate and much more.[8][29]
In 2014, ABC ordered a television series based on his book, also titledFresh Off the Boat, starringRandall ParkandConstance Wu, withHudson Yangplaying Eddie.[30]The show debuted with two preview episodes on February 4, 2015, and premiered in itsprime timeslot on February 10, 2015.[31]Huang narrated every episode of the first season, but left the show prior to the second season.[32]
Huang was outspoken in his criticism of the development process of the show, writing a lengthy essay about his concern that his vision for the show was compromised.[33][34]Huang has said that he doesn’t like the show, because he thinks that the storyline after the pilot episode is not what he wrote in his memoir.[35]He has said that he mostly avoids watching it, though he admits there were two exceptions he tuned into: The episode with a DMX cameo in which he appreciated the interactions between DMX and young Eddie, which he talks about in his book, “Double Cup Love”. He also admits tuning for a few minutes to the episode where the family visits Taiwan, but didn’t like it.[36]
In August 2019, it was announced Huang would direct and writeBoogie, a coming-of-age movie about a young Chinese-American basketball player's rise to prominence, starringTaylor Takahashi,Pamelyn Chee,Jorge Lendeborg Jr.,Mike Moh,Dave East,Pop Smoke, Perry Yung, Alexa Mareka andTaylour Paige, withFocus Featuresdistributing.[37][38][39][40]Huang wrote the screenplay in five days with no plan or outline, incorporating the themes that have defined his life such as basketball, feeling adrift in a country where he has always been in a minority, and domestic abuse.[41]
Huang drew criticism in May 2015 for comments he made about black women during an interview onReal Time With Bill Maher. He said, "I feel like Asian men have been emasculated so much in America that we're basically treated like black women." Later he engaged in aTwitterexchange on his account @MrEddieHuang with @BlackGirlDanger where he defended his comments, which were called "misogynoir". Huang then tweeted "are we dating cause you wildin. lol" and proceeded to make romantic advances towards her.[42][43]The comment is intended to shine light on the racism experienced by both Black women and Asian men in dating, where Huang calls out the similarities in racial experiences between Black women and Asian men, where Black women are often (incorrectly) portrayed as overly masculine and Asian men as (also incorrectly) overly feminine. The offended parties failed to understand the comparison as a critique on both instances of racial bias.
Huang has also drawn criticism for his appropriation of African-American culture.[44]Huang has stated: "I’ve devoted myself to speaking about people owning their own cultures that they’ve created, that they came over with, and educating people about the foundational values in culture."[45]InThe New York Times,Joshua David Stein described Huang as "a walking mixtape of postmodern cultural appropriation."[46]InNew Bloommagazine, Brian Hioe wrote that Huang exhibits "misogynistic language and attitudes," non-conventional English speech and dress, and experiences with police that indicate an "adoption of a hip hop influenced persona". In which Asian Americans have been a part of the Hip Hop community sinceFresh Kid Iceof2 Live Crewfame.[47]
In late February 2025, Huang was involved in an incident in his New York City apartment building with Matt Sauerhoff, a celebrity trainer who is the founder and CEO of the personal training business The LIV Method. The encounter began outside the building when Huang and his dog were allegedly knocked off of a bench by an unleashed dog owned by Sauerhoff. Huang asked Sauerhoff to leash his dog, but Sauerhoff refused. Both men and their dogs then went inside to the lobby of their building, and Huang began filming Sauerhoff as he went on a long tirade. Sauerhoff attempted to have Huang thrown out of the building and yelled “Get the f— off the private property, get the f— out of here!” Sauerhoff also shouted out “This guy’s got a f—ing problem. This guy started with me. F—you! Suck a d—, dude. F— off!” New York City law requires that dogs be leashed in public places and Huang reported Sauerhoff for keeping his dog off of leash. Huang also demanded an apology from Sauerhoff, which Sauerhoff has also refused as of February 27, 2025.[48][49]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
