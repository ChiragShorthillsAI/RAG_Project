In 1925Montana, wealthy ranch-owning brothers Phil and George Burbank meet widow and inn owner Rose Gordon during a cattle drive. The kindhearted George is quickly taken with Rose, but the coarse and volatile Phil dislikes her, believing she only wants George's money. Phil also belittles her teenage son Peter, deriding him as weak and effeminate.
George and Rose marry and she moves into the Burbank ranch house while Peter attends medical school. George organizes a dinner party with his parents and the governor and pressures Rose into a piano performance. George reveals that Phil was a brilliant Classics student at Yale, in contrast to his rough nature. Shaken by Phil's earlier belittlement, Rose is unable to perform. Humiliated and upset by Phil's behavior, Rose starts drinking, becoming an alcoholic by the time Peter arrives home for a break from school. Phil and his men taunt Peter, and he isolates himself in his room, where he dissects a rabbit he has caught.
In a glade away from the mansion, Phil masturbates with a delicate scarf belonging to his late mentor, Bronco Henry. Peter enters a bivouac in the glade and finds a stash of Bronco Henry's homoerotic magazines. He observes Phil bathing in a pond with Bronco's scarf around his neck before Phil notices and chases him away. Later, in front of his men, Rose, and George, Phil makes amends with Peter, offering to plait him alassofromrawhidebefore he returns to school. He teaches Peter to ride a horse.
Peter heads out on his own one day, finds a dead cow, and, after carefully putting on rubber surgeon's gloves he brought in his backpack, cuts off pieces of its hide. Phil and Peter ride into the hills together. While trying to catch a rabbit hiding in a pile of wood posts, Phil gashes his hand but declines Peter's offer to dress the wound. Peter tells Phil about finding the body of his alcoholic father, who had hanged himself, and having the strength to cut him down.
Rose's alcoholism worsens as Peter and Phil spend more time together. Upon learning about Phil's policy of burning unwanted hides, Rose defiantly trades them to localNative Americansand collapses on her way back to the house. Upon discovering this, Phil is infuriated. George says she is unwell. Peter pacifies Phil by offering him strips from the hide he cut, not mentioning its origin. Phil is touched by Peter's gesture and holds him close to his face. The pair spend the night in the barn finishing the rope. Blood flows from Phil's open wound as he swirls the hide in the solution used to soften it. Peter asks Phil about his relationship with Bronco Henry. Phil says Bronco Henry had once saved his life when they were caught in a freezing storm in the mountains by keeping him warm with his body. Peter asks if they were naked, but Phil does not answer. They later share a cigarette.[8]
The next morning, George finds Phil sick in bed, his wound now severely infected. A delirious Phil looks for Peter to give him the finished lasso, but George takes him to the doctor. Phil dies. Later, George picks out a coffin for Phil, while his body is prepared for burial. At the funeral, the doctor tells George that Phil most likely died ofanthrax. This puzzles George, as Phil was always careful to avoid diseased cattle.
Peter, who skipped Phil's funeral, opens aBook of Common Prayerto a passage on burial rites and readsPsalm 22before stowing the finished lasso under his bed with carefully gloved hands. As Peter watches George and a now-sober Rose return home and embrace, he turns away and smiles.
In early 2017, writer-directorJane Campion, having just finished filming the second season ofTop of the Lake, received a copy ofThomas Savage's 1967 novelThe Power of the Dogfrom her stepmother, Judith. Enthralled by the book, Campion began hunting for its film rights. She and producerTanya Seghatchianobtained the rights from Canadian producerRoger Frappierafter meeting with him at the2017 Cannes Film Festival.[9][10]According to Campion, the novel had been optioned at least five times but never adapted.[10]Paul Newmanwas among those who had tried to adapt it.[11]
While working on the script, Campion maintained correspondence with authorAnnie Proulx, who wrote the afterword to a 2001 edition of Savage's novel.[12][13]After completing her first draft, Campion visited Savage's ranch inMontana, met with members of his family (Savage died in 2003), and consulted with an expert on Savage at theUniversity of Montana WesterninDillon.[9]She was unable to film in Montana due to budget concerns, and opted to shoot in her native New Zealand instead.[10]CinematographerAri Wegnerand production designerGrant Majorfound an ideal location inCentral Otagoon New Zealand'sSouth Island, months before the film's early 2020 start date.[9]
In May 2019 it was announced that Campion was to write and direct the film withBenedict CumberbatchandElisabeth Mosscast to star.[14]Paul Danoentered negotiations to join the film in September.[15]He was confirmed to star the next month, withKirsten Dunstcast to replace Moss.[16]But by November, Dano also dropped out due to scheduling conflicts withThe Batman.Jesse Plemons, who had been offered the role before Dano, was cast to replace him.[17]In February 2020,Thomasin McKenzie,Kodi Smit-McPhee,Frances Conroy,Keith Carradine,Peter Carroll, andAdam Beachwere confirmed to be cast in the film.[18]
Campion had Cumberbatch in mind for the role of Phil Burbank.[10]He first caught Campion's attention in the 2012–13 BBC dramaParade's End.[13]To prepare for the role, Cumberbatch researched theLewis and Clark Expeditionand worked for a time on a Montana cattle ranch nearGlacier National Park.[9]He attended a three-week boot camp to learn horse-riding, rope-throwing, castrating bulls, and playing the banjo.[13][19]
Filming began in New Zealand in January 2020 in theManiototoin Central Otago, and also took place in the coastal Otago city ofDunedinand the town ofOamaru.[20][21][22]Production was halted in March by theCOVID-19 pandemic.[9]After border exemptions were granted for cast and crew, production resumed in June.[23]All the film's interior scenes were shot onsound stagesinAucklandduring the final weeks of filming. Principal photography concluded in July.[9]Throughout the production Cumberbatch stayed in character; he and Dunst agreed not to speak on set.[13][19][24][25]
Director of photographyAri WegnershotThe Power of the Dogusing twoArri Alexa LFcameras paired withPanavisionUltra Panataranamorphic lenses, with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.[26][27]Campion was specifically looking for a female cinematographer who would embark on a full year of preparations alongside her. She sought out Wegner, who had shot a 2015ANZad campaign with Campion.[28]Wegner and Campion did meticulousstoryboardingfor the film, sometimes separately so that the two could compare later.[29]Wegner drew extensively on the work ofEvelyn Cameron, an English photographer who moved to Montana near the turn of the 20th century.[28]Period photographs from theTimemagazine archives,Ken Burns's documentary seriesThe West, and the works of artistsAndrew WyethandLucian Freudwere additional points of reference.[27][30]
Grant Majorwas responsible forThe Power of the Dog's production design; he had worked with Campion on her filmAn Angel at My Table.[13]In inclement weather, Major and his team built the façade of the two-story mansion, a working barn, a cattle pen, and stockyards on location in time for the start of the shoot.[9][13]The interiors of the mansion, built later on a sound stage in Auckland, were modeled afterTheodore Roosevelt'sSagamore Hill.[31][32]Period-correct furniture was not readily available in New Zealand, so set decoratorAmber Richardssourced most of the objects from various prop houses in Los Angeles.[32]
Campion recruitedJonny Greenwoodto compose the film score.[33]Greenwood wanted to avoid the "sweeping strings" typical of Westerns, opting instead to useatonalbrasssounds to emphasize the "alien, forbidding" quality of the landscape.[33]He was not satisfied with the sound of Phil's banjo on screen and, as an alternative, played thecellolike a banjo on his own, using the same fingerpicking technique.[33]The resulting sound, according to Greenwood, was "a nice confusion" and "a sound you recognize, but it's not a style that you’re familiar with."[34]As a result of the pandemic and the accompanying restrictions, Greenwood was unable to work with an orchestra and recorded many of the cello parts himself, layering them to achieve an orchestral texture.[35]
The Power of the Dogpremiered at the78th Venice International Film Festivalon September 2, 2021,[36]and had Special Presentation screenings at the2021 Toronto International Film FestivalandTelluride Film Festivalthat same month.[37]By the end of its run, it screened at film festivals inCharlottesville,[38]London,[39]Middleburg,[40]Mill Valley,[41]Montclair,[42]New York(centerpiece screening),[43]San Diego,[44]San Sebastian,[45]Savannah,[46]andZurich.[47]It also played at the52nd International Film Festival of Indiain November.[48]
The film had alimited theatrical releasein Australia and New Zealand commencing on November 11, 2021, with theatrical distribution in both countries handled byTransmission Films.[49][50]The film's limited theatrical release in the United States and the United Kingdom began on November 17,[51][52]before it was released onNetflixworldwide on December 1.[52]A behind-the-scenes documentary,Behind the Scenes with Jane Campion, was released on Netflix worldwide on January 27, 2022.[53]Between promotion and awards campaigns, Netflix spent around $50 million on the film.[54]
TheCriterion Collectionreleased the film on DVD and Blu-ray on November 8, 2022.[55]

Onreview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 351 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Brought to life by a stellar ensemble led by Benedict Cumberbatch,The Power of the Dogreaffirms writer-director Jane Campion as one of her generation's finest filmmakers."[59]Metacriticassigned a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on 58 critics.[60]
Reviewing the film forThe Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney wrote: "This is an exquisitely crafted film, its unhurried rhythms continually shifting as plangent notes of melancholy, solitude, torment, jealousy and resentment surface. Campion is in full control of her material, digging deep into the turbulent inner life of each of her characters with unerring subtlety."[61]Conversely,Owen GleibermanofVarietywrote: "All of this should build, slowly and inexorably, in force and emotion. But for a film that's actually, at heart, rather tidy and old-fashioned in its triangular gamesmanship,The Power of the Dogneeded to get to a more bruising catharsis. In its crucial last act, the film becomes too oblique."[62]
Metacriticreported thatThe Power of the Dogappeared on over 118 film critics' top-ten lists for 2021, the most for any film that year. It ranked first on 31 lists and second on 23 lists.[63]
On 6 April 2023, it ranked 15th onThe Hollywood Reporter's list of the "50 Best Films of the 21st Century (So Far)" and was called a "brilliantly uncomfortable chamber piece about corrosive masculinity fed by sexual repression" and a "psychodrama whose epic scope is echoed in its majestic landscapes".[7]On 24 August 2023, it ranked eighth onCollider's list of "The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far".Colliderwrote, "Campion unravels an understated love story in the heart of the American west, and shows how forcing someone to conform can lead to tragic circumstances".[64]The March 2022 issue ofNew Yorkmagazine included the film as one of "The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars".[65]
The Power of the Dogis the first film directed by a woman to receive more than ten Academy Award nominations, and Campion is the first woman to receive more than one Academy Award nomination for Best Director, her first being forThe Piano. The film is the first sinceBecket(1964) to win only one award from 12 nominations.

Campion was born inWellington, New Zealand, the second daughter ofEdith Campion(born Beverley Georgette Hannah), an actress, writer, and heiress; andRichard M. Campion, a teacher, and theatre and opera director.[3][4][5]Her maternal great-grandfather was Robert Hannah, a well-known shoe manufacturer for whomAntrim Housewas built. Her father came from a family that belonged to the fundamentalist ChristianExclusive Brethrensect.[6]She attendedQueen Margaret CollegeandWellington Girls' College.[7]Along with her sister, Anna, a year and a half her senior, and brother, Michael, seven years her junior, Campion grew up in the world of New Zealand theatre.[4]Their parents founded the New Zealand Players.[8]Campion initially rejected the idea of a career in the dramatic arts and graduated instead with aBachelor of Artsin Anthropology fromVictoria University of Wellingtonin 1975.[4]
In 1976, she enrolled in theChelsea Art Schoolin London and travelled throughout Europe. She earned a graduate diploma in visual arts (painting) from theSydney College of the Artsat theUniversity of Sydneyin 1981. Campion's later film work was shaped in part by her art school education; she has, even in her mature career, cited painterFrida Kahloand sculptorJoseph Beuysas influences.[4]
Campion's dissatisfaction with the limitations of painting[4]led her to filmmaking and the creation of her first short,Tissues,in 1980. In 1981, she began studying at theAustralian Film, Television and Radio School, where she made several more short films and graduated in 1984.[9]

In 2006 she producedAbduction: The Megumi Yokota Story.
Her 2009 filmBright Star,a biographical drama about poetJohn Keats(played byBen Whishaw) and his loverFanny Brawne(Abbie Cornish), was shown at the Cannes Film Festival.[citation needed]In an interview withJan Lisa Huttner, Campion discussed how she focused on Fanny's side of the story, pointing out that only two of the film's scenes did not feature her.[14]Campion created, wrote, and directed the TV mini-seriesTop of the Lake,[15]which received near universal acclaim,[16][17]won numerous awards—including, for its lead actressElisabeth Moss, aGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Filmand aCritics' Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Movie/Miniseries—and was nominated for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.[18]Campion was also nominated for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special.[19]
She was the head of the jury for the Cinéfondation and Short Film sections at the2013 Cannes Film Festival[20]and the head of the jury for the main competition section of the2014 Cannes Film Festival.[21]When Canadian filmmakerXavier Dolanreceived thePrix du Juryfor his filmMommy, he said that Campion'sThe Piano"made me want to write roles for women—beautiful women with soul, will and strength, not victims or objects." Campion responded by rising from her seat to give him a hug.[22][23]In 2014, it was announced that Campion was nearing a deal to direct an adaptation ofRachel Kushner's novelThe Flamethrowers.[24][25]
In 2015, Campion confirmed that she would co-direct and co-write a second season ofTop of the Lakewith the story moved toSydneyandHarbour City, Hong Kong, and withElisabeth Mossreprising her role as Robin Griffin.[26]The sequel series titledTop of the Lake: China Girlwas released in 2017. Shot and set in Sydney,Top of the Lake: China GirlfeaturesAlice Englert, Campion's daughter, in a lead role as Robin's biological daughter.

In 2019, Campion's first film in a decade was announced, an adaptation ofThomas Savage's novelThe Power of the Dog. The film was written and directed by her and was released in 2021,[27]having premiered at the78th Venice International Film Festival, where Campion was awarded theSilver Lionfor Best Direction.[28]The film was critically acclaimed internationally, winning numerous awards and nominations for the direction, screenplay, and performance of the cast of actors.[29]Campion earned three nominations in the respective categories for Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Picture at theGolden Globe Awards,AACTA International Awards,Critics' Choice Movie Awards, andSatellite Awards. Campion issued an apology toSerenaandVenus Williamsfollowing criticism of her acceptance speech forCritics Choice for Best Director, in which Campion said, "And you know, Serena and Venus, you are such marvels. However, you do not play against the guys — like I have to." Her apology included, "I made a thoughtless comment equating what I do in the film world with all that Serena Williams and Venus Williams have achieved," she said. "I did not intend to devalue these two legendary Black women and world-class athletes."[30]In February 2022, the film received 12 nominations at the94th Academy Awards, leading that year's Oscar nominations.[31]The film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor forBenedict Cumberbatch, Best Supporting Actress forKirsten Dunst, and Best Supporting Actor for bothKodi Smit-McPheeandJesse Plemons.[32]Campion became the first woman to receive multiple Best Director nominations, and she won Best Director for the film.[33]She is also the first woman to win Best Director without also winning a corresponding Best Picture.
In 1992, Campion married Colin David Englert, an Australian who worked as a second unit director onThe Piano.[34]Their first child, Jasper, was born in 1993 but lived for only 12 days.[35]Their second child,Alice Englert, was born in 1994; she is an actress. The couple divorced in 2001.[36]
Her work, according to the criticbell hooks, "seduces and excites audiences with its uncritical portrayal of sexism andmisogyny. Reviewers and audiences alike seem to assume that Campion's gender, as well as her breaking of traditional boundaries that inhibit the advancement of women in film, indicate that her work expresses a feminist standpoint."[37]Accordingly, Campion's work has received praise from other critics. In V.W. Wexman'sJane Campion: Interviews(1999), criticDavid Thomsondescribes Campion "as one of the best young directors in the world today."[38]In Sue Gillett's "More Than Meets The Eye: The Mediation of Affects in Jane Campion'sSweetie", Campion's work is described as "perhaps the fullest and truest way of being faithful to the reality of experience"; by utilising the "unsayable" and "unseeable", she manages to catalyze audience speculation.[39]Campion's films tend to gravitate around themes of gender politics, such as seduction and female sexual power. This has led some to label Campion's body of work as feminist; however, Rebecca Flint Marx argues that "while not inaccurate, [the feminist label] fails to fully capture the dilemmas of her characters and the depth of her work."[40]
Campion was appointed a Dame Companion of theNew Zealand Order of Merit(DNZM) in the2016 New Year Honours, for services to film.[41][42]

Keith Ian Carradine(/ˈkærədiːn/KARR-ə-deen; born August 8, 1949) is an American actor. In film he is known for his roles as Tom Frank inRobert Altman'sNashville,E. J. BellocqinLouis Malle'sPretty Baby, and Mickey inAlan Rudolph'sChoose Me.On television he is known for his roles asWild Bill Hickokon theHBOseriesDeadwood, FBI agent Frank Lundy on theShowtimeseriesDexter,Lou Solversonin the first season ofFX'sFargo,Penny'sfather Wyatt on theCBSsitcomThe Big Bang Theory, and U.S. PresidentConrad Daltonon the CBS political dramaMadam Secretary.
He is a member of theCarradine familyof actors that began with his father,John Carradine.
Carradine was born inSan Mateo, California. He is a son of actress and artist Sonia Sorel (née Henius), and actorJohn Carradine.[2]His full brothers areChristopherandRobert Carradine, both of whom are actors.  His paternal half-brothers areBruceandDavid Carradine. His maternal half-brother isMichael Bowen. His maternal great-grandfather was biochemistMax Henius, and his maternal great-grandmother was the sister of historianJohan Ludvig Heiberg.[3]
Carradine's childhood was troubled; he has said that his father drank and his mother "was a manic depressiveparanoid schizophreniccatatonic—she had it all."[4]His parents divorced in 1957, when he was eight years old. A bitter custody battle led to his father gaining custody of him and his brothers, Christopher and Robert, after the children had spent three months in a home for abused children as wards of the court. Keith said of the experience, "It was like being in jail. There were bars on the windows, and we were only allowed to see our parents through glass doors. It was very sad. We would stand there on either side of the glass door crying."[5]He was raised in San Mateo primarily by his maternal grandmother,[6]and he rarely saw either of his parents.[7]His mother was not permitted to see him for eight years following the custody settlement.[4]
Carradine attendedOjai Valley School, where he was active in the school's theater department, performing in productions ofAria da CapoandThe Madwoman of Chaillot.[6]After high school, Carradine entertained the thought of becoming aforest ranger, and enrolled atColorado State UniversityinFort Collins.[6]"I had this idyllic fantasy of sitting somewhere communing with nature and chatting with the bears," he recalled, "[but] I didn't want to have to learn anything."[6]He changed his major to drama after enrolling, but dropped out after one semester and returned to California,[6]moving in with his older half-brother, David, who encouraged him to pursue an acting career, paid for his acting and vocal lessons, and helped him get an agent.[7]
As a youth, Carradine had opportunities to appear on stage with his father in the latter's productions of Shakespeare.[8]Thus, he had some background in theater when he was cast in the original Broadway run ofHair(1969), which launched his acting career. In that production he started out in the chorus and worked his way up to the lead roles[9]playing Woof and Claude. He said of his involvement inHair, "I really didn't plan to audition. I just went along with my brother, David, and his girlfriend at the time,Barbara Hershey, and two of their friends. I was simply going to play the piano for them while they sang, but I'm the one the staff wound up getting interested in."[10]
His stage career is further distinguished by hisTony-nominated performance for Best Actor (Musical) as the title character in the Tony Award-winning musical,The Will Rogers Folliesin 1991, for which he also received a Drama Desk Award nomination. He won the Outer Critics Circle Award forFoxfirewithHume CronynandJessica Tandy, and appeared as Lawrence inDirty Rotten Scoundrelsat the Imperial Theater. In 2008, he appeared as Dr. FarquharOff-BroadwayinMindgame, a thriller by Antony Horowitz, directed byKen Russell, who made his New York directorial debut with the production.[11]In March and April 2013, he starred in the Broadway production ofHands on a Hardbody. He was nominated for the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for his work.
Carradine's first notable film appearance was in directorRobert Altman'sMcCabe & Mrs. Millerin 1971. That same year, he co-starred withKirk DouglasandJohnny CashinA Gunfight. His next film,Emperor of the North Pole(1973), was re-released with a shorter titleEmperor of the North.Carradine played a young aspiring hobo. The film was directed byRobert Aldrichand also starredLee MarvinandErnest Borgnine. Carradine then starred in Altman's filmThieves Like Us(1974), then played a principal character, a callow, womanizing folk singer, Tom Frank, in Altman's critically acclaimed filmNashville(1975; see "Music and songwriting"). He had difficulty shaking the image of Tom Frank following the popularity of the film. He felt the role gave him the reputation of being "a cad."[12]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
