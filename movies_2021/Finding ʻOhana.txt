Hawaiiansiblings Pili and Ioane "E" were New York–raised inBrooklyn. An avidgeocachingfan, she wins a competition that earns her free tuition to a summer camp in theCatskills. Pili can't go in the end as they temporarily relocate from New York toOʻahuwith their mother Leilani to help her father, Kimo as his health and financial issues are becoming serious.
As Pili is so into geocaching, her malaise at being separated from her beloved New York is assuaged by secretly liberating an old diary from her grandfather's art studio, set up in an old bus. Just as she's sneaking off the bus, she meets local boy Casper who helps cover for her.
That night, as Pili is trying to secretly read the diary, E catches her. He explains the term Night Watchers to her, trying to scare her, explaining they are ghosts of fallen warriors who protect the island.
Meanwhile, E is distracted from his own search for better Internet signal by local girl Hana, who is Casper's friend. She, on the other hand, is not impressed by his attitude towards the younger kids.
In the diary of the ship the Peruvian's quartermaster Monks, he documented Robinson and Brown's excursion on the island. The privateers had mutinied, burned their ship and taken the treasure ashore. Monks stayed to protect the treasure while his superiors died. He gave the diary to Pili's ancestors for saving his life.
Kimo catches Pili with the diary. Initially angry, he ends up taking the enthusiastic girl to see some of the landmarks in it. He falls, breaking a rib. While Leilani is distracted with Kimo in the hospital, Pili and Casper sneak off to seek the lost pirate treasure. E and Hana follow close behind.
They end up having to follow the instructions in the diary as all four slide inwards of a cave too far to back out. They have to crawl through a narrow tunnel, its opening is called 'The Jaws of Death' and it is lined with stalactites. Fearing a deadly spider, E hurries frantically out of the tunnel, leaving behind the ship journal as it is inside Casper's backpack as it collapses. Finding a mini rope bridge over a lava-filled crevice, they realize it is too deteriorated to cross, but Pili and Casper inch around it on a narrow ledge. E helps Hana manoeuver around it, partially by distracting her singing a favorite song.
E confides in Casper that the brown violin spider bit him, leaving him with a huge blister, possibly indicating necrosis. To not alarm the others, he covers it with duct tape. Arriving to a pool, they realise the next tunnel is filled with rain water. Pili gets through it piggybacking on E.
Arriving at 'ground zero', Pili and Casper go in search of the treasure while E talks with Hana. He tries to convince her to send in her application toJuilliard, but she fears it might change her too much. Pili and Casper examine the complex pulley and rope system they had remembered from the journal. Realizing one of the counterweights is down, they deduce they can access the treasure room by putting all of their weight on the severed rope.
Once in, they all are collecting large amounts of gold and jewels, when Hana spots a religious statuette indicating they are in a type of tomb. Realizing the treasure is an offering, she insists they can't take anything without waking the Night Watchers. When E refuses to believe it, they awaken.
All four drop their treasure and head for the pools below using the banyon roots. Everyone makes it, although E has to be resuscitated. As they move away from the mountain Leilani catches up with them. The Night Watchers approach them as they seek shelter in a shed. Pili makes an offering with a few treasures she'd kept. They are bowing down, averting their eyes when their father Kua steps out. He had died 11 years ago while enlisted. Leilani, Pili and E have a brief moment before Kua and the other Night Watchers disappear into the ocean.
Leilani calls a family meeting and proposes they decide as a group if they all stay in Hawaiʻi or go back to Brooklyn, they decide to stay and start to live a better life.

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
