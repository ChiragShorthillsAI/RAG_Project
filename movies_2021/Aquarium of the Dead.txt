Aquarium of the Deadis a 2021 Americanzombie[1]comedy-horrorscience fiction filmdirected by Glenn Miller and written by Marc Gottlieb and Michael Varrati.[2]The film starsVivica A. Fox,Eva Ceja, andD. C. Douglas.[3]It is aspin-offtoThe Asylum'sZoombiesfranchise.[4]The film features zombie-likeaquatic animals.[5]
At the Shining Sea Aquarium, Dr. Karen James and two workers attempt totagthe residentoctopus. The octopus goes intocardiac arrestas the result of the procedure and seemingly dies, thenreanimates, attacks Karen, kills the two workers, and escapes into the ducts.
Meanwhile, aquarium scientist Miranda Riley receives a transmission from the Eden Wildlife Zoo warning her to dispose of anyepinephrinethe aquarium received. Her colleague Daniel Hanley assures her that he took care of the disposal before leaving to guide Skylar, a tourist, on a V.I.P. visit to the aquarium. Miranda meets with Senator Bailey Blackburn, who is responsible for securing additional funds for the facility, but they are interrupted by Karen warning them of the octopus. They alert security chief Eddie "Clu" Cluwirth of the breach, but before they can take any action, contaminated slime left by the octopus infects the rest of the animals in the aquarium, who shatter their tanks to escape. Miranda, Karen, Blackburn, and Blackburn's aide Beth take shelter in a theater as the aquarium goes into lockdown. Elsewhere, Daniel and Skylar attempt to get back inside the building. They are attacked by a group of zombifiedspider crabs, but escape and manage to get inside.
Miranda's group ventures out of the theater, surmising that if they can reset the aquarium's power, the lockdown will be lifted. They come across Daniel and Skylar, as well as zombifiedcrocodilesandwalruses. Skylar loses his composure, attacks a walrus, and is killed by it. As a result of the encounter, Karen realizes the reanimated animals areblindand navigate based on sound. This allows her to use hermobile phoneto trick the walrus and lead it away. However, the group soon discovers an undeadstarfishstuck to Beth's abdomen, which had slipped unnoticed into her notebook earlier. They cannot detach the starfish and Beth soon dies from it feeding on her.
The group passes through asharkhabitat, then unites with Clu and ventures into the basement, where they are confronted by the octopus. Clu sacrifices herself in a failed attempt to kill the octopus while Miranda resets the power. Cornered by the octopus, Miranda uses a stray power cable to fatally electrocute it. The reset lifts the lockdown, and the group escapes. As they leave, the truth about the incident is discovered: Daniel was conspiring with Blackburn to cut costs at the aquarium and did not dispose of the epinephrine from the Eden Wildlife Zoo as he said he did, leading it to be used on the octopus and cause the outbreak. Miranda punches Daniel, breaking his nose, and leaves with Karen.
In an interview withBloody Flicks, screenwriter Marc Gottlieb said he was not on set but that all special effects on the project were CGI. He said writing the script was different from his previous projects because his draft was based on an outline byMichael Varratiinstead of his own.[6]
The film was released in theaters andvideo on demandon May 21, 2021.[7][8]It was later released on DVD on June 21, 2021.[9]

The Asylumis an American independent film production and distribution company based inBurbank, California, known for producing low-budget,direct-to-videofilms, in particularmockbusters, which capitalize on the popularity of major studio films with similar titles and premises. The Asylum's business model revolves around producing as many low-budget films as quickly as possible, which earn around $150,000 to $250,000 in profit. Since the company produces dozens of films every year, this model generates millions of dollars, and the company claims to have never lost money on a film. The Asylum spends around 4-6 months making a film, and since the company is not affiliated with any industryguildsother thanSAG-AFTRA, this means their employees will sometimes work up to 22 hours a day.
Initially founded as a distribution company for low-budget drama films, The Asylum switched to in-house productions in the mid-2000s due to competition from larger studios likeLionsgate Films. In 2005, The Asylum released the filmH. G. Wells' War of the Worldsthe day beforeSteven SpielbergfilmWar of the Worlds.Blockbusterordered 100,000 copies, which inspired The Asylum to focus on mockbusters. This led to a partnership with the television channelSyfy, and with the rise ofvideo on demand(VOD) services in the early 2010s, partnerships withPluto TVandTubi. The Asylum's greatest success came in 2013 with the filmSharknado, which is about awaterspoutthat lifts sharks out of the ocean and drops them overLos Angeles. The over-the-top premise wentviral, and led to the creation of theSharknadofranchise. In response to the popularity ofSharknado, Syfy commissioned The Asylum to produce azombietelevision series calledZ Nation, which ran for five seasons.
The Asylum was founded in 1997 by David Latt, David Rimawi, and Sherri Strain.[1]Rimawi and Strain had been fired byVillage Roadshow Pictures, and Latt was working for aneducation softwarecompany called Chimera Multimedia.[1]Latt and Rimawi had previously worked together on the 1992 filmSorority House Party, and together with Strain, launched The Asylum as a film distribution company.[1][2]The Asylum's first release wasBellyfruitin 1999, acomedy dramaabout a teen pregnancy.[3]The company's initial goal was to distribute low-budget drama films likeBellyfruittovideo rental chainslikeBlockbusterandHollywood Video, but their approach changed in the early 2000s, as video rental chains were more interested indirect-to-videohorror films.[4]The Asylum struggled to break into the distribution market, as larger companies likeLionsgate Filmswould routinely offer filmmakers more money.[4]This led to a change in their business model in 2002, with a focus on in-house productions.[1]Their goal was to produce one film per month, starting with the 2002crime thrillerKing of the Ants.[1]Strain left the company in 2002, and was replaced by formerScreen Actors GuildemployeePaul Bales.[3]
According toFilm International, The Asylum's first hit film wasVampires vs. Zombiesin 2004.[3]Although the film was marketed as an adaptation of the 1872 novellaCarmilla,Vampires vs. Zombies'sposter bore a striking resemblance toFreddy vs. Jason'sposter, which came out the year before.[3]Film Internationalwriter Wheeler Winston Dixon describedVampires vs. Zombiesas The Asylum's firstmockbuster, a film that closely resembles another film with a similar title and premise in order to capitalize on its popularity.[3]Around the same time, Latt began working on an adaptation of the 1898 novelThe War of the Worlds, but learned thatSteven Spielbergwas also working on a film adaptation of the novel.[2]Latt was prepared to end production until Blockbuster ordered 100,000 copies of the film, roughly seven to eight times the normal order for Asylum films.[4][5]Latt's film, titledH. G. Wells' War of the Worlds, was released on June 28, 2005, one day beforeSpielberg's film.[3]
Emboldened by the success ofH. G. Wells' War of the Worlds, The Asylum started producing low-budget films to capitalize on the popularity of similar major studio films.[1]The Asylum marketed their films as "tie-ins", although journalists and critics often referred to them as rip-offs or mockbusters.[2][5]Among the company's early releases within this business model wereKing of the Lost World(based onKing Kong),Snakes on a Train(based onSnakes on a Plane),The Da Vinci Treasure(based onThe Da Vinci Code), andTransmorphers(based onTransformers).[4][5]In 2008, The Asylum increased their meager production budget, and partnered withSyfyfor a television release ofThe Day the Earth Stopped, based onThe Day the Earth Stood Still.[3]20th Century Foxfiled acease and desistletter against The Asylum for the similarities betweenThe Day the Earth StoppedandThe Day the Earth Stood Still, although nothing came of the letter.[1][6]Film titles are usually not protected underUnited States trademark law, which allows The Asylum to produce films with similar titles so long as they can argue that they did not try to deceive consumers.[6][7]
With the rise ofvideo on demand(VOD) services in the early 2010s, The Asylum focused on digital distribution.[4]Since VOD services would often categorize their films in alphabetical order, The Asylum added numbers or typographical symbols to the beginning of their film titles in order to been seen first, such as#1 Cheerleader Campand2-Headed Shark Attack.[4]The Asylum also released the filmHold Your Breath(stylized as#HoldYourBreath) in 10AMC Theatres, as VOD services prioritized films with theatrical releases.[4][8]Pluto TVbecame the studio's largest source of revenue, with an entire channel dedicated to Asylum films.[1]Another VOD service,Tubi, commissioned The Asylum to produce 12 original films after the surprise popularity of the filmTitanic II.[1]Rimawi estimated that by 2012, 70 percent of the studio's films were original ideas.[4]
The Asylum's biggest success came in 2013 with the filmSharknado, which is about awaterspoutthat lifts sharks out of the ocean and drops them overLos Angeles.[1]The over-the-top premise wentviral, with over 387,000 mentions on social media.[9]Todayco-hosts held a dramatic reading of some of the film's lines, and the mayor of Los AngelesEric Garcettijoked about it onTwitter.[9]Sharknadospawned five sequels, and when combined with merchandising and licensing sales, nearly quadrupled The Asylum's revenue from three years earlier.[8]According to Bales, "Up until that point, even with the notoriety that we had, if you'd speak to anyone and be like, 'Hey, I'm a filmmaker, have you seen anything I've made?' the answer would be, 'No,' but withSharknadowe became known."[1]Latt added, "We still talk about how to exploit it in every production meeting."[1]
In response to the popularity ofSharknado, Syfy commissioned The Asylum to produce azombietelevision series calledZ Nation, the studio's first foray into episodic content.[1]Loosely based on The Asylum filmRise of the Zombies,Z Nationrevolves around a group of survivors who escort a man who is immune to the zombie virus to the last knownCenters for Disease Controlresearch lab.[1][10]Journalists often comparedZ NationtoThe Walking Dead, especially given The Asylum's penchant for mockbusters.[11][12]Z Nationran for five seasons on Syfy, and was followed by the spinoff seriesBlack SummeronNetflix.[1][10]Bales felt that the production costs forZ Nationwere too high, and decided that The Asylum's next potential television series, titledCrisis Earth, would be written as three separate low-budget films that can then be cut into six individual episodes.[1]The script forCrisis Earthwent up for sale at the 2022American Film Market.[1]
The Asylum's business model revolves around producing as many low-budget films as quickly as possible.[4]Their films usually have a budget of $250,000 to $500,000, and earn $150,000 to $250,000 in profit.[2][4]Since The Asylum produces dozens of films every year, this model generates millions of dollars.[4]From October 2011 to October 2012, The Asylum's revenue totaled $12,000,000 for a 15 percentprofit margin.[4]This model is so successful, that Rimawi claims that they have never lost money on a film.[7]Rimawi stated, "One of the reasons we've remained in business for 25 years is that we make a movie for exactly less than we think we can earn from it ... People say all the time, 'Why don't you make a $20 million original production?' And our answer is because we'd like to stay in business."[1]
The Asylum spends around 4-6 months making a film.[4][13]It starts with The Asylum soliciting 100-wordpitchesfrom freelance screenwriters based on a story concept that the studio's distribution affiliates want.[3][14]As journalist Amanda Hess explained, "If a Japanese DVD company wants a submarine, and Blockbuster needs a monster, the Asylum will make a sailors-meet-sea creature movie, then tweak the concept further to sell to all its potential platforms."[14]The studio then chooses the best pitch, and the chosen screenwriter produces a draft within 10 days.[14]Asylum films are almost always serious in tone despite the far-fetched plots.[5][14]The first script forSharknadofeatured a lot of self-aware humor, but screenwriterThunder Levinsaid that The Asylum wanted every comedic line removed and left a strongly worded note that reiterated thatSharknadowas not a comedy film.[15]
If The Asylum is making a mockbuster, they will target larger films that are based on works or characters in thepublic domain, such asSherlock HolmesorThor.[13][16]Despite the similar titles, the scripts for Asylum mockbuster films often have little to nothing to do with the larger film they are based on.[2]Rolf Potts ofThe New York Timesnoted that although the title of The Asylum filmTransmorpherswas a clear imitation ofTransformers,Transmorphersonly occasionally features shape-shifting robots and devotes more time to a lesbian subplot.[5]Latt said this is because the studio's writers only have a brief outline of what the larger film is going to be about from promotional material.[2]
The Asylum is not affiliated with any industrytrade unionsother than theSAG-AFTRA.[3]This means their employees will sometimes work up to 22 hours a day.[17]Whereas most major studios shoot one page from the script a day, The Asylum shoots around 10 to 12 pages a day.[2][17]Due to the demanding work schedule, The Asylum often hires filmmakers with several years of experience.[2]Around $150,000 of a film's budget is allocated to hiring lesser known actors that would appeal to specific audiences.[2]For example, Rimawi notes that formerBaywatchactors likeDavid Chokachiare popular among European audiences.[2]In an interview withGrantland, Latt stated, "We know not to go afterJohnny Depp. But we'll go after Johnny Depp's cousin. That's fair game."[16]Rimawi further added, "I'm guessing that many of our main actors do this because they have bills to pay, and they want to be in and out as inconspicuously as possible. But the repeat guys have made their peace with what they're doing."[2]
Post-production is handled at The Asylum's headquarters inBurbank, California, which includes its own editing bays and visual effects studios.[2]The visual effects for their films are often poorly rendered, and a constant source of ridicule from critics.[2][16]Tom Breihan ofGrantlandjokingly wrote, "From the looks of things, [The Asylum] also goes after the cousins of thePirates of the Caribbeanspecial-effects team ... At their best, Asylum's in-house effects team can manage something slightly more lifelike than what you'd see on the averageHercules: The Legendary Journeysepisode."[16]The Asylum employs 15 visual effects artists, and they are often working on six films at once.[2]
Marketing campaigns often hype up the absurdity of the film's premise and the studio's overall business model.[14]In 2012, Asylum films would open with the text, "15 years. 100 films. You're Welcome".[16]In a similar vein, the tagline forSharknadowas "Enough Said".[14]Latt described The Asylum's marketing strategy as "a parody of the studio system".[14]Whenever The Asylum makes a mockbuster, they tie the release of their film to coincide with the release of the larger film it's based on.[16]Bales argues that this is not an attempt to deceive consumers, but instead gives consumers more options to watch.[16]The Asylum is upfront about some of their duplicitous marketing strategies.[14]In a 2010 blog post, The Asylum urged fans to add the studio's film to their Netflix queues in order to increase the perception of public demand.[14]The blog post said, "This isn't about trying to get you to watch our movie. This is about gaming the system. This is about taking a stand. Against math."[14]
The Asylum has garnered a discordant and at times controversial reputation within the film industry.[16][18]Nearly all of their films have been panned by critics, and their mockbusters are often belittled as shamelesscash grabs.[3][19]Breihan wrote, "It takes a certain punk-rock panache for a company to unapologetically position itself as a parasite on the movie business."[16]Film producerBrian Grazercompared The Asylum to "pollution in Hollywood, in that you've just got to live with it".[1]Despite their reputation, Bales argues that The Asylum's popularity is multifaceted, and not the result of deceitful marketing tactics.[2][20]To this extent, some journalists have postulated that consumer interest in Asylum films come from a desire to watch campy films, in particular those that fall under the "so bad it's good" label.[19][20]
Some journalists have defended The Asylum.[3][20][21]Greg Hudson ofSharpbelieves that The Asylum's cynical business model is merely a microcosm of the American film industry. Hudson wrote, "Sure, The Asylum makes knock-offs, but so does Hollywood. So does fashion. If culture is a constant exchange of ideas, commerce is the booze that lubricates that discussion. Consider The Asylum a drunken digression."[20]Amy Nicholson ofBoxofficesaid that The Asylum caters to its audience by leaning into the absurdity of their film plots.[16]She usedSnakes on a Planeas an example of a large studio film that disappointed viewers with a predictable ending, whereas The Asylum mockbusterSnakes on a Trainends with a giant snake eating the train.[16]According to Nichsolson, "That's what people who see that kind of movie want to see, and studios don't have the guts to do it."[16]
David Roth ofSlateargues that The Asylum's mockbusters succeed in satirizing the larger films they are based on.[21]Roth used The Asylum filmSir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmesas an example, as he felt that its usage of dinosaurs and dragons as antagonists was intended to mock the action sequences and animal jokes in theGuy RitchiefilmSherlock Holmes.[21]Roth wrote, "The more puffed-up and self-serious and dumb Hollywood blockbusters become, the more they demand to see their goofiness mirrored by cheap, unpretentious, equally dumb knockoffs."[21]
According to The Asylum's website, the studio has released more than 500 films, including 300 original films.[22]Their catalog encompasses virtually every majorgenre, although the studio primarily focuses ondisaster films,horror films, andscience fiction films.[3]Rimawi stated, "The only thing we haven't done is straightdrama. In other words, good films."[2]Among their more notable releases include:

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
