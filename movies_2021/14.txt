Rumbleis a 2021 American animatedsports comedy filmdirected by Hamish Grieve (in his directional debut) with a screenplay by Grieve andMatt Lieberman. Loosely based onMonster on the Hill, a graphic novel by Rob Harrell, the film stars the voices ofWill Arnett,Geraldine Viswanathan,Terry Crews,Stephen A. Smith,Jimmy Tatro,Tony Danza,Susan Kelechi Watson,Tony Shalhoub,Bridget Everett,Greta Lee,Ben Schwartz,Roman ReignsandBecky Lynch. It tells the story of a world where humans and giant monsters exist as an aspiring trainer trains an amateur giant monster wrestler to go up against the world champion.
Produced byParamount Animation,WWE Studios,Walden MediaandReel FX Animation Studios, the film was released in the United States on December 15, 2021 onParamount+.[1]The film received mixed reviews from critics with criticism for its writing, characters, and pacing, although the animation and voice acting received some praise.
In a world where giant monsters and humans coexist, giant monsters compete in a popular professionalwrestlingglobal sport known as monster wrestling, with each city having its own monster wrestler. After the current wrestler for the small town of Stoker, the shark-like Tentacular, becomes the new world champion, he announces he no longer wants to represent Stoker. The townspeople are later told if they do not find a new wrestler, they will lose the town's stadium and its revenue which prompts wrestling enthusiast Winnie Coyle to search for a new monster representative for her town.
Winnie heads to an underground fight and finds Rayburn Jr., the son of Stoker’s late champion Rayburn Sr., fighting under the name of "Steve the Stupendous". Winnie interferes in the match and causes Steve to win instead of taking a dive as the underground arena employer Lady Mayhem wanted. Steve is confronted by Lady Mayhem and threatened unless he can get her back the money she just lost. Winnie tells Steve she can help him get the money by training him to fight Tentacular. Realizing he has no other way to make the money, Steve agrees to be trained.
Steve initially is uninterested in learning how to fight properly and wins his first match by evading his opponent. Steve later tells Winnie he left Stoker because everyone saw him as an extension of his father and could not live up to his name. Winnie learns Steve loves dancing and decides to train him using dance moves.
As they progress up the league's rankings, Tentacular announces he and his agent have bought Stoker's stadium and want to demolish it as Tentacular sees it as a reminder that he will be always compared to Rayburn. Even though Steve repays Lady Mayhen, he decides to help Winnie, reveals his identity as Rayburn's son, and challenges Tentacular to a match for the stadium.
During the fight, Steve avoids most of the hits by Tentacular in the first round, but Tentacular counters his dance moves in the second round. After convincing Winnie not to give up, Steve, in the third round, lands several hits with his dance moves. Winnie tells Steve to use Tentacular's suckers to stick him to one of the corner posts. When Steve goes in for the final move, he and Tentacular collide and are both knocked out. Tentacular gets up first but is too rattled to end the match. The crowd gets Steve back up by clapping asalsabeat and he is able to defeat Tentacular, becoming the new monster wrestling champion and saving the stadium.

Paramount Animationis an Americananimation studio, serving as the animation division and label ofParamount Pictures, a subsidiary ofParamount Global.[4]The division was founded on July 6, 2011, following the box office success of Paramount's ownRangoand the end of their distribution deal withDreamWorks Animationin 2012.
The studio's first filmThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Waterwas released on February 6, 2015, and its latest release wasTransformers Oneon September 20, 2024, with their next release beingSmurfson July 18, 2025.[5]
Films produced by Paramount Animation have grossed a total of $832 million at the box office. Its highest-grossing film to date isThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, which grossed $325.1 million.
After the closure ofParamount Cartoon Studios(formerly named Famous Studios) in December 1967, Paramount distributed a few animated films from 1973 to 1992 that were produced by outside studios, includingCharlotte's Web,Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown,Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don't Come Back!!), andBebe's Kids.
In the fall of 1993, Canadian animation studioNelvanasigned a multi-year deal to produce five animated feature films in collaboration with Paramount Pictures, withKathleen KennedyandFrank Marshallproducing; the first two began production the following summer, at a cost of over US$20 million each.[6][7]Three of the projects were based on books byE. B. White(The Trumpet of the Swan),Clive Barker(The Thief of Always) andGraeme Base(The Sign of the Seahorse); an original production calledMask Visionwas also in the works.[8]However, none of the films were produced in this deal.
Following Paramount's merger withViacom, the studio started releasing several animated films based onNickelodeon's TV shows, including theRugratsfilm trilogy,The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, andJimmy Neutron: Boy Genius; the films produced byNickelodeon Movies. The studio also released features based onMTV'sBeavis and Butt-HeadandComedy Central'sSouth Park.
In 2005, Paramount's new CEOBrad Greyconsidered building an in-house animation division, because he saw family films as the "sweet spot" of the movie business.[9]The following year, Paramount signed a distribution deal withDreamWorks Animation, starting withOver the Hedgeand ending withRise of the Guardians. During this deal, the studio released Nickelodeon Movies'Barnyardin 2006 andImageMovers'Beowulfin 2007.
On March 4, 2011, the studio released its first in-house animated film, Nickelodeon Movies'Rango. The film was critically acclaimed and grossed over $245 million at the box office. The success ofRangohelped Paramount discover its potential in making successful animated features on its own. In June of that year, the studio acquired the rights to produce an animated film based onPenny Arcade's 2010 webcomicThe New Kid.[10]
In July 2011, in the wake ofRango's success, the high hopes forThe Adventures of Tintin, and the departure ofDreamWorks Animationupon completion of their distribution contract withMadagascar 3: Europe's Most WantedandRise of the Guardiansin 2012, Paramount announced the formation of a new animation division. The studio would initially produce one animated film a year with a maximum budget of $100 million. A key portion of the films would be co-produced with Nickelodeon and they would be cross-promoted at Nickelodeon's theme parks and hotels.[4]
In October 2011, Paramount named a former president ofWalt Disney Feature Animation,David Stainton, president of Paramount Animation.[11]In February 2012, Stainton resigned for personal reasons, with Paramount Film Group's president, Adam Goodman, stepping in to directly oversee the studio.[12]It was also announced thatThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, astandalone sequelto 2004'sThe SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, would be the studio's first film and would be released in 2014. A short time after, the film was delayed to early 2015.[13]
In August 2012,Varietyreported that Paramount Animation was in the process of starting development of several animated films in collaboration with Nickelodeon,Mary Parent, andJ. J. Abrams. Besides theSpongeBobsequel, Paramount Animation considered adaptingDora the Explorer,The Legend of Korra, andMonkey Questinto films. The increase in animated film production was due to DreamWorks Animation being in talks with other studios to distribute their post-2012 animated films.[14]
On July 31, 2013, Paramount Animation announced that they were developing a new live-action/animated franchise in the vein of theTransformersseries, which was titledMonster Trucks.Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Bergerwere set to write the film's script,Chris Wedge(director of 2002'sIce Age) was set to direct the film, andMary Parentwas set to produce the film, with an initial release date set for May 29, 2015.[15]

The studio also announcedMonster Trucks,The Little Prince,Sherlock Gnomes, and the thirdSpongeBobfilm.[22]
The studio's second film,The Little Prince, was released on July 29, 2015, in France. It was scheduled to be released on March 18, 2016, in the United States, but Paramount canceled the American release due to the French producers not paying an additional, previously agreed $20 million for the North American prints and advertising budget, however they still retained the distribution rights in France. It was later released ontoNetflixon August 5, 2016, as aNetflix original film.[23][24]

In April 2017, Paramount ended its deal with Locksmith Animation when Paramount chairman and CEOBrad Greywas replaced byJim Gianopulos, who decided that their projects did not fit in with Paramount's other upcoming releases. Locksmith formed a multi-year production deal with20th Century Foxfour months later.[30][31]
In July 2017, Paramount Pictures named formerDreamWorks Animationco-presidentMireille Soriaas the president of the studio.[32]Soria restructured the studio, increasing its number of employees from 10 to over 110, and created a new goal of releasing two tentpole animated films a year with different animation styles and genres. She would also look over the completion ofSherlock GnomesandWonder Park, which were in production before her arrival. That same month, Skydance announced its first two animated feature films for Skydance Animation —Split(later retitledSpellbound) andLuck.[33]Both films would be distributed by Paramount Pictures as part of their deal with Skydance.

The studio's eighth filmRumblewas released on December 15, 2021, onParamount+. It was originally expected to be released in theaters on February 18, 2022, but due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, it was later moved to Paramount+. It received mixed reviews.
On January 20, 2022, Latifa Ouaou (a veteran of bothIlluminationand DreamWorks Animation viaUniversal Pictures) was hired as the executive vice president of movies and global franchises for both Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Animation Studio. In this position, Ouaou will oversee both streaming and theatrical films for the two companies. It was also revealed thatThe Tiger’s Apprentice(which was originally being directed byCarlos Baena) will now be directed byRaman Hui, with Paul Watling andYong Duk Jhunbeing co-directors.Bob Persichetti(the Academy Award-winning co-director of Sony Pictures Animation'sSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse) had also joined the film as a producer.[2]
On July 26, 2023, Robbins revealed in aVarietyarticle that the original filmUnder the Boardwalkwould be released straight to Paramount+ instead of theaters (similarRumble). He stated, “We’re not going to release an expensive original animated movie and just pray people will come,” while also pointing to the box office underperformances of Pixar animated films such asLightyearandElemental.[55]This statement received widespread criticism on social media, including from those in the industry such asGuillermo del Toro,Jorge R. Gutierrez, andChristopher Miller.[56][57][58]This also contradicts an earlier statement by the division’s president Naito, who stated in aDeadlineinterview that she plans to release original animated features to continue building franchises.[59]Under the Boardwalk, the studio's ninth film was instead given a limited theatrical release under the Nickelodeon Movies imprint. It was released on October 27, 2023, with a video-on-demand release on November 7.[60]
The studio's tenth film,The Tiger's Apprentice, was released on February 2, 2024 on Paramount+, after facing several theatrical delays and its theatrical release being cancelled.[61]It received mixed reviews from critics.

The studio's eleventh film,Transformers One, was released on September 20, 2024. It received positive reviews from critics but became a financial disappointment grossing $128.9 million worldwide on a budget of $75–147 million.
If the pending merger of Paramount Global andSkydance Mediahappens,John Lasseter, who is head of Skydance Animation will become head of Paramount Animation.[63]
Initially, Paramount Animation did not have its own opening logo. Its first six features (and new features starting withTransformers One) just used the standard Paramount logo. On September 19, 2019, Paramount Animation introduced a new animated logo featuring a character nicknamed "Star Skipper".[64]When Mireille Soria came to Paramount Animation, one of the first goals set by Jim Gianopulos was to make a logo for the division. The crew wanted to put a female character in the logo because the studio's team is mostly female, and according to Soria, it captures "the magic" of the division. The logo and the character of Star Skipper were designed byCaptain Underpants: The First Epic Movielead visual development artist and art director Christopher Zibach and animated by ATK PLN andReel FX Creative Studios.[64]This logo debuted in front ofThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Runin 2020. The logo's music is the same as the standard Paramount Pictures logo, which is composed byMichael Giacchino.
Similar toWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,Illumination, andSony Pictures Animation, Paramount Animation outsources its animation production to other animation studios such as Mikros Image, Reel FX,[65]andIndustrial Light & Magic(Transformers One).Rumblewas developed outside of Paramount Animation by Reel FX, but the studio acquired the rights to the film and co-produced it.[66][67]
Like20th Century Animationwith animated films under20th Century Studios, the studio also acts as somewhat of a distribution label for animated films that are made under or acquired byParamount Pictures. The earliest case of this would be the aborted deal with Locksmith Animation.[25]Additionally,Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank, originally expected to be distributed byOpen Road FilmsandSTX Entertainment, was acquired by Paramount to be distributed under Paramount Animation, later being distributed  under Nickelodeon Movies.[5]
Paramount Animation does not have an in-house animation style. According to Mireille Soria, each film has their own unique style created by the filmmakers, which would be helped by outsourcing animation to different vendors.[68]
When Ramsey Ann Naito took charge of Paramount Animation in September 2021, she brought over the culture of theNickelodeon Animation Studio, which she describes as "artist-driven" and "creative". Both companies are now united under one team, in a move different from Disney and Universal's animation studios (Walt Disney Animation StudiosandPixarpost-Lasseterfor the former andIlluminationandDreamWorksfor the latter).[69]
All films listed are distributed byParamount Picturesunless noted otherwise.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
