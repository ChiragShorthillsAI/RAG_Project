Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timescommended Giannopoulos' directorial efforts, the star-studded ensemble and some "truly tense and harrowing moments" throughout the film, but felt it was nothing more than "a lower-budget descendant to films" likeGoodfellasandA Bronx Tale.[5]Leslie Felperin ofThe Guardianwas critical of the film's "meandering script and absurdly grand guignol ending," but gave praise to Sean Price Williams' cinematography for capturing New York City.[6]Conversely, Jeannette Catsoulis ofThe New York Timespraised Giannopoulos and his screenwriters for crafting a "story of operatic vengeance" with "multiple threads of unease" and "throttling tension", concluding that: "Giannopoulos might be inexperienced, but he's canny with mood and unafraid to experiment with the rhythms of violence. I, for one, am keen to see what he does next."[7]Alex Saveliev ofFilm Threatpraised Fernandez for being "a compelling lead" and the rest of his ensemble cast, singling out Fichtner for displaying "unbridled ferocity" as Uncle Ricardo, and the overall quality giving off "a strongSafdie brothersvibe," concluding that: "As it stands,The Birthday Cakeis a formidable showcase for an emerging director. It looks like Giannopoulos has several projects on his slate. Behold the birthday of a new cinematic talent."[8]

It premiered at theCannes Film Festivalto critical acclaim.[7]He was one of the best-paid actors of the 1990s; films featuring him have grossed over $3.5 billion at the worldwide box-office.[8]In 1992, criticRoger Ebertwrote, "if there is an award for the most unsung leading man of his generation, Kilmer should get it".[9]
Kilmer was born December 31, 1959, in Los Angeles, California,[1]the second of three sons to Gladys Swanette (néeEkstadt)[10]and Eugene Dorris Kilmer.[11]His mother was of Swedish descent.[12]His other ancestry includes Irish, German andCherokee roots.[13]His parents divorced in 1968 when he was 8 years old. His mother later married William Bernard Leach in 1970. Kilmer's grandfather was a gold miner inNew Mexico, near the border withArizona.[14]In 1977, Kilmer's younger brother Wesley, who had epilepsy, drowned in a jacuzzi at age 15.[15][16]
He attendedChatsworth High SchoolwithKevin Spacey.[1]His high school girlfriend wasMare Winningham.[17]He became the youngest person at the time to be accepted into theJuilliard School's Drama Division, where he was a member ofGroup 10.[18]
Kilmer declined a role inFrancis Ford Coppola's 1983 filmThe Outsiders, as he had prior theater commitments.[19]In 1983, he appeared off Broadway inThe Slab BoyswithKevin Bacon,Sean Penn, andJackie Earle Haley. That same year, his first off-stage acting role (excluding television commercials) came in the form of an episode ofABC Afterschool SpecialcalledOne Too Many, which was an educational drama on drinking and driving;[20]it also starred a youngMichelle Pfeiffer. Also in 1983, Kilmer self-published a collection of his own poetry entitledMy Edens After Burns,that included poems inspired by his time with Pfeiffer. The book of poems is difficult to obtain and expensive; known second-hand copies cost $300 and up.[21][22][23]
His big break came when he received top billing in the comedy spoof of spy moviesTop Secret!, in which he played an American rock and roll star. Kilmer sang all the songs in the film and released an album under the film character's name, "Nick Rivers".[24]
During a brief hiatus, he backpacked throughout Europe before going on to play the lead character in the 1985 comedyReal Genius. He turned down a role inDavid Lynch'sBlue Velvet[25]before being cast as naval aviator "Iceman" in the action filmTop GunalongsideTom Cruise.Top Gungrossed a total of over $344 million worldwide and made Kilmer a major star.[26]Following roles in the television filmsThe Murders in the Rue MorgueandThe Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains,Kilmer portrayed Madmartigan in the fantasyWillow;he met his future wife, co-starJoanne Whalley, on the film's set. Kilmer starred in theColorado Shakespeare Festivalproduction ofHamletin 1988. In 1989, Kilmer played the lead in bothKill Me Again, again opposite Whalley, and inTNT'sBilly the Kid.
After several delays, directorOliver Stonefinally started production on the filmThe Doors, based on the story ofthe band of the same name.[27]Kilmer spoke with Oliver Stone early on, concerned about what he might want to do with the story because Kilmer did not believe in or want to promote substance abuse. Kilmer sawJim Morrisonas having picked the wrong heroes, who had different issues, which were not part of the creativity or inspiration. Kilmer saw Morrison's story as one that could be told "a thousand different ways" and did not want to tell it by playing the role in the style of drugs, with which Oliver Stone agreed.[citation needed]Kilmer memorized the lyrics to all of lead singer Morrison's songs prior to his audition and sent a video of himself performing some Doors songs to director Stone.[28]Stone was not impressed with the tape, butPaul A. Rothchild(the original producer of the Doors) said "I was shaken by it" and suggested they record Kilmer in the studio. After Kilmer was cast as Morrison, he prepared for the role by attending Doors tribute concerts and reading Morrison's poetry.[29]
He spent close to a year before production dressing in Morrison-like clothes, and spent time at Morrison's old hangouts along theSunset Strip. His portrayal of Morrison was praised and members of the Doors noted that Kilmer did such a convincing job that they had trouble distinguishing his voice from Morrison's.[27]Paul Rothchild played Kilmer's version of "The End" for the band's guitarist,Robby Krieger, who told him, "I'm really glad they got 'The End'. We never got a recording of that live with Jim and now we've got it." However, Doors keyboardistRay Manzarekwas less than enthusiastic with how Morrison was portrayed in Stone's interpretation.[30]
In the early 1990s, Kilmer starred in the mystery thrillerThunderheart, the action comedyThe Real McCoy, and again teamed withTop GundirectorTony Scottto playElvis PresleyinTrue Romance, which was written byQuentin Tarantino. In 1993, Kilmer playedDoc Hollidayin the westernTombstonealongsideKurt Russell. In the film, Doc Holliday performsChopin'sNocturne in E minor, Op.72, No. 1; however, Kilmer does not play the piano and he practiced that one piece for months in preparation.[31]In 1995, Kilmer starred inWings of Courage, a 3DIMAXfilm, and that same year, he starred oppositeAl PacinoandRobert De NiroinHeat, which is now considered one of the best crime/drama films of the 1990s.[32]
In December 1993Batman ForeverdirectorJoel Schumacherhad seenTombstoneand was most impressed with Kilmer's performance asDoc Holliday. Schumacher felt him to be perfect for the role ofBatman, though at the time, the role was stillMichael Keaton's.[33]In July 1994, Keaton decided not to return for a third Batman film after 1992'sBatman Returns,[34]due to "creative differences".[33]William Baldwin(who previously worked with Schumacher onFlatliners) was reported to be a top contender, though just days after Keaton dropped out, Kilmer was cast.[34]Kilmer took the role without even knowing who the new director was and without reading the script.[33]
Released in June 1995,Batman Foreverwas a success at the box office,[35]despite receiving mixed reviews from critics.[36]There was debate about Kilmer's performance: some critics, likeThe New York Times'Janet Maslin, thought Kilmer was a poor successor to Keaton in the part;[37]while others, such asRoger Ebert, had kind words for Kilmer.[38]Batmanco-creatorBob Kanesaid in aCinescapeinterview that of all the actors to have played Batman up to that point, he felt Kilmer had given the best interpretation. Film criticLeonard Maltin(who criticized the dark tone contained inBatman Returns) complimented Kilmer's portrayal when he reviewed the film for his expanding collection of film reviews.[39]Defenders ofBatman Foreverpraised the film for portraying Batman as a more heroic, less ruthless, and more human character than in the Tim Burton films. The film also brought the film interpretation of Bruce Wayne more into line with his comic book counterpart, showing him as a socialite and a very public figure rather than the neurotic recluse of the previous films.
In February 1996, Kilmer decided not to return for another Batman feature film, feeling that Batman was being marginalized in favor of the villains[40]and because of scheduling problems withThe Saint.George Clooneyreplaced Kilmer as Batman in 1997'sBatman & Robin.

So this big thing just came up, and I ended up getting to do this. I'm happier that I got off the soap though. I mean I give all my credit to them, because I have learned so much from being on soap operas and working with amazing actors who've been on there for like thirty, forty years. It was an honor to work with them. It's definitely given me all my background. But getting off the soap opera helped me a lot too, because I can move on to bigger and better things. So I am definitely thankful I got to be on a soap opera though.[4]
