Nightbookswas released on September 15, 2021, byNetflix.[1]
Alex Mosher, a young boy fromBrooklyn,New York, overhears his parents talking about how worried they are about his preoccupation with writing scary stories and their fear of how he will react to a recent incident. Screaming in pain, Alex trashes his room, grabs his "Night books" and takes the elevator to the basement, planning to burn them in the furnace.
The elevator suddenly stops— and stays—on a dark floor where an apartment's open door reveals a TV showing Alex's favorite show "The Lost Boys". He enters and sees a piece of pumpkin pie that was not touched. This made him eat the pie and pass out, making the door and television vanish.
He awakens to find himself in the magical apartment of a beautiful witch named Natacha who shows him a closet full of clothes belonging to children who were "not useful to her". Alex denies having any unique qualities but when he shows her his books, she demands that he read a new story to her each night, or die. She puts him to work alongside the housekeeper, a girl named Yasmin, who was lured into the apartment in Washington, D.C. The apartment moves around the world, seeking victims. The doors respond only to Natacha's keys. Her ill-tempered, sometimes-invisible cat, Lenore, spies on them.
Natacha demands that Alex's stories end unhappily. If not, the apartment shakes. She repeatedly asks why he wanted to burn his writings, but he manages to distract her. Searching her vast library for inspiration, Alex finds notes in the margins of books detailing the escape plans of a trapped girl. She writes about her treasured unicorn necklace, so he dubs her "Unicorn Girl".
Yasmin and Alex bond, and they eventually win Lenore's trust. Yasmin tearfully reveals she was afraid to befriend him because Natacha killed the others by transforming them into little figurines, now displayed in Natacha's cabinet. None has a unicorn necklace; Alex concludes that Unicorn Girl escaped. Her notes contain a recipe for a sleeping potion. Lenore slips it into Natacha's perfume bottle. When she falls asleep, they steal her keys and open the door, revealing a forest. They soon realize they are still inside the apartment.
An evil unicorn drives them to a gingerbread cottage that mesmerizes Yasmin. They eat the gingerbread and fall unconscious. Alex wakes to find Yasmin and Lenore caged in a room lined with countless skulls. Blue mist is being siphoned from a coffin containing a witchlike figure. Natacha reveals that she was the Unicorn Girl, who after successfully escaping the original witch—who ate all her victims except Natacha—, was able to put her to sleep and returned to her home, only to find that her parents had moved away. With nowhere to go, she returned, studied witchcraft, and eventually lulled the witch into a deep sleep, using scary stories due to her immense love for them. Alex has been helping her keep the witch unconscious with his own scary stories while Natacha harvests her magic. The room shakes. They will all die if the witch wakes. Alex's fear of telling his truth makes it the ultimate scary story. He begins:
Alex is used to being called names, but on his birthday, his supposed best friend, Josh, admits that Alex is too "weird". Everyone is going to Cody's party instead. Alex's parents are distressed when no one comes to Alex's. "They made him hate himself," and Alex, ashamed and hurt, resolves to hide what made him special. Natacha and the sleeping witch are mollified, but suddenly Alex says that he is glad he was kidnapped because he met Yasmin and Lenore, friends who value him.
The happy ending wakes the hideous witch. While the witches battle, Yasmin grabs Natacha's perfume bottle and flees with Alex and Lenore. The front door opens into Alex's building. The ravenous witch pursues them to the basement. Alex distracts her by pretending to read a story, then pauses on a cliffhanger and throws the empty notebook into the furnace. The witch reaches for it. They push her in and hold the door shut while she melts.
Alex introduces Yasmin and Lenore to his delighted parents as his best friends. Yasmin is reunited with her family. On a later visit, she gives Alex a beautiful leather-bound notebook signed "Stay weird storyteller. Yas."
Meanwhile, a figurine in Natacha's cabinet begin to crackle. Natacha's hand slams down, and we hear her laughter.

Brightburnwas released in the United States on May 24, 2019, bySony Pictures Releasing. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who felt that it did not deliver on the full potential of its premise. The film grossed $33.2 million against a production budget of $6–12 million.
In 2006, a spaceship crashes in a forest in Brightburn,Kansas. Tori and Kyle Breyer, a couple who are unable to conceive, see an explosion from their house and go to the crash site. There, they find a spaceship with a baby inside, whom they adopt and name Brandon. They also hide the spaceship in their barn. Around Brandon's 12th birthday, he discovers he has exceptional strength and the ability to fly. His disposition also changes.
In middle school, Brandon is an academically exceptional student but socially awkward and frequently bullied. Classmate Caitlyn Connor shows sympathy for him. Brandon develops a crush and stalks Caitlyn in her room in the middle of the night, scaring her. One day, during a trust exercise inPhysical Educationclass, Brandon falls towards Caitlyn, but she lets him drop to the ground and calls him a pervert. Angered by her accusation, Brandon crushes her hand and is suspended from school after being accosted by Caitlyn's mother, Erika.
That night, Brandon sleepwalks to the spaceship and breaks into the barn where it is hidden, cutting his hand on the ship. Tori follows and sees him levitating, chanting the ship's message: "Take the world". She reveals the truth of his origin, to which Brandon angrily destroys the family photos before later ambushing and killing Erika. Police find symbols drawn on a window while investigating Erika's disappearance, the same symbols that Brandon is seen drawing in his notebook. The next day, Brandon dons his costume and is caught sneaking into his aunt and uncle's house by his uncle, Noah. After Noah threatens to tell his father, Brandon frightens and kills him by flipping his truck. The following morning, Tori and Kyle inform Brandon of Noah's death, which the police believe was an accident, but Brandon shows no emotion. Suspecting him to be the killer, Kyle finds Brandon's blood-stained shirt and shows it to Tori, but she refuses to believe it.
Kyle takes Brandon on a father-son hunting trip in the woods. He attempts to shoot and kill Brandon with his hunting rifle, but the bullet bounces off the back of Brandon's head. Brandon then kills Kyle with heat vision. The sheriff arrives at the Breyers' and shows Tori the symbol found at the scenes of Erika's and Noah's deaths. Tori finds Brandon's notebook with drawings of his murders and the message "take the world". She calls Kyle, but Brandon answers and implies he is coming for her.
Brandon returns and begins destroying the house. Tori calls the police, but Brandon kills the sheriff and his deputy before backup can arrive. Remembering that the ship's hull can cut him, Tori runs to the barn and discovers Erika's eviscerated body. As Brandon pursues her, Tori tries to stab him with a piece of the ship, but he grabs her and flies her into the sky before dropping her to her death. After Brandon watches her fall, he looks up to see an oncoming airplane.
The following morning, the airplane is revealed to have crashed into the farmhouse, destroying the evidence of the murders from the previous night. Brandon's symbol is seen painted on a piece of the plane wreckage as rescue workers attend to Brandon.
Brandon is later seen in news reports over the locations of various disasters as an online conspiracy theorist urges the public to take action before it is too late.

Frank Scheck ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "While not exactly original, the premise is certainly effective enough. ButBrightburnlacks the visual stylization or wit to elevate it from the realm of the crudely effective B-movie."[6]James White fromEmpirewrote: "Crossbreeding superhero tropes with horror staples was an idea laden with promise.Brightburnis enlivened by trademark James Gunn black comedy, but hamstrung by sketchy writing and a botched sense of dread."[33]
Alex Arabian fromThe Playlistwrote: "The film is a gem, especially for anyone yearning for a superhero film that gleefully torches the familiar 'good versus evil' formula and introduces far more sinister sensibilities."[5]
Ed Gonzalez fromSlantalso gave it a negative review: "The way the film shuttles through its 90 minutes, it’s as if it’s been stripped of its most crucial narrative parts."[34]

In June 2019, producer James Gunn stated that discussion of a potential sequel was happening, but he was busy writing and directingThe Suicide SquadandGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.[37]In August 2019, Jackson A.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
