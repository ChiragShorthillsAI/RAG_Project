In the present, John Hartley is anFBIprofiler who investigates the theft of one of the eggs on display at theMuseo Nazionale di Castel Sant'AngeloinRome, along withInterpolagent Urvashi Das. Having stolen the egg, globally wanted art thief Nolan Booth manages to escape but finds Hartley and the Interpol at his home inBali. They arrest Booth, but not before Booth's main rival Sarah "The Bishop" Black steals the egg and frames Hartley.
Das has Hartley incarcerated in a remote Russian prison with Booth, believing he is responsible for the theft. Hartley suggests that he and Booth work together to defeat Black. If he helps Hartley imprison her, Booth will be the number one art thief in the world and Hartley's name will be cleared. The pair escapes from prison and heads forValenciato steal the second egg, currently in possession of arms dealer Sotto Voce.
They infiltrate hismasquerade balland fight Black in Voce's vault for the egg. Black reveals she is working with Voce and they torture Hartley until Booth reveals the location of the third egg. Black betrays Voce and leaves forEgypt, where Booth claims it is.
Booth reveals to Hartley that he lied; the egg is actually inArgentinain a secret location inscribed on his late father's special watch, which once belonged toAdolf Hitler's personal art curator Rudolph Zeich. Searching the jungle, they find a secret bunker containingNaziartifacts, including the third egg. Black arrives to steal it but the three are interrupted by Das and police. Hartley, Booth and Black escape in an antique 1931Mercedes-Benz 770.
Booth learns that Hartley is actually not an FBI profiler, but a conman, and shares the Bishop mantle with Black; Hartley and Black are a couple and work as a team. They had planned the entire heist from the very beginning, using Booth to take them to the third egg. Booth surrenders and they leave him handcuffed.
InCairo, Hartley and Black deliver the three eggs to an Egyptian billionaire as a gift for his daughter's wedding. They then double-cross him; Interpol raids the wedding and arrests the billionaire.
Six months later, Hartley and Black find Booth on their boat inSardinia. He informs them that he told Das about theirCayman Islandsaccount containing the $300 million payout for the eggs, which Das freezes, leaving them with no money, in retaliation for leaving him cuffed.
Booth also reveals that Interpol is on their way to capture them, and offers escape if they help him with a new heist, which requires three individuals to pull off. They agree and Das placesred noticeson all of them. The trio begin casing theLouvreinParisfor their next heist.

Peter Debruge ofVarietycalled the film a "fun, fast-paced and frequently amusing divertissement," and wrote, "It's all reasonably clever, so long as you don't scrutinize it too closely.Red Noticemay be Thurber's spin onNational Treasure, with just as much DNA from the RKO classicGunga Din."[61]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterstated, "You can't argue with the muscular marquee value of headlining Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot in a slick, fast-paced action thriller laced with playful comedy, even if it's an empty-calorie entertainment likeRed Notice."[62]Reviewing the film for theLos Angeles Times,Justin Changwrote, "A depressing reminder of what Hollywood considers 'original' material these days,Red Noticeplays one of those self-consciously convoluted, ultimately derivative long cons that strain so hard to seem breezily insouciant they wind up wearing you out. By the end, it's the clichés that warrant a rest."[63]

Gal Gadot(pronounced[ˈɡalɡaˈdot];[1]born 30 April 1985) is an Israeli actress. From 2016 to 2023, Gadot portrayedWonder Womanin theDC Extended Universefilms. In 2018, she was named one ofTime's100 most influential peopleand ranked byForbesas the tenth-highest-paid actress, later rising to third in 2020.
She first gained attention locally after winning theMiss Israel 2004, followed by two years of service in theIsrael Defense Forces. During this time, she participated in aMaximphoto shoot that boosted her public profile. She then began modeling and endorsing various brands. She made her television debut in the dramaBubotin 2008, followed by her film debut in a supporting role asGisele YasharinFast & Furious(2009), reprising it in multiple sequels.
Her breakout role came in 2016, when she portrayed Wonder Woman inBatman v Superman. The success of the film led to her starring inWonder Woman(2017), which became a majorbox office hit. She also reprised the role inJustice League(2017) andWonder Woman 1984(2020). Since then, she has starred inRed Notice(2021),Death on the Nile(2022), andHeart of Stone(2023).
Beyond acting, Gadot and her husband have co-founded a film production company, launched a food brand, and invested in Israeli startups.  She is widely celebrated in Israel as a national icon and ambassador. However, her strong support for the Israeli military has sparked both praise and criticism.
Gal Gadot was born on 30 April 1985[2]inPetah Tikva,[note 1]where she initially lived.[9]She was born to Jewish parents ofAshkenazidescent;[7]her mother's roots areCzechandPolish, while  her father's areAustrian,Russian, andGerman.[10]Her parents, Michael, an engineer, and Irit, a physical education teacher,[11][12]hebraized their surnamefrom "Greenstein" to "Gadot" before her birth.[13]In Hebrew, her first name means "wave," and her surname translates to "riverbanks."[6]She has a younger sister, Dana.[14]
Her father is a sixth-generationSabra,[15]and one of his ancestors was the firstchemistatShaare Zedek Hospitalin Jerusalem,[16]while her mother is a first-generation Sabra and the daughter ofHolocaust survivors.[14][5]Her maternal grandfather,[5]Abraham Weiss,[17]was born as Adolf Weiss,[18]in the village ofMunkács,[19]Czechoslovakiain 1928. At 13, whenNazi Germany invaded, his father died in the army. He, his mother, and his brother were sent toAuschwitz, where the latter two perished in thegas chamber. He was the sole survivor of his family. Her maternal grandmother, however, managed to escape Europe beforeWorld War II.[20][15][17]Abraham immigrated alone toJaffa, where he built a family and "a successful business". He later served in theGolani Brigade, and in his later years, he joinedIsrael Defense Forces(IDF) expeditions to share his firsthandHolocaust testimony.[21]
Gadot grew up in the Givat Tal neighborhood ofRosh HaAyin,[8][22][23][15]in what she described as a "very Jewish, Israeli family environment".[14]At 11, she visitedHolocaust memorial sitesin Poland to learn about Auschwitz andMajdanek. Reflecting on the experience, she recalled: "I, an entitled child, felt the suffering theMuselmannexperienced back then."[23]Encouraged by her mother to be active from a young age, Gadot took up swimming at four and later played tennis.[15]She joined the local volleyball and basketball teams,[24]soccer-teamcheerleader,[19]and trained in ballet, hip-hop, and jazz for 12 years, at one point considering a career as a choreographer.[14]
As a child, she struggled with a weak voice and attendedspeech therapy, where she learned properbreathing techniques.[25]At 12, she was invited to enter theGirl of the Year[he](Hebrew:נערת השנה‎) competition but declined, saying, "Ugh, modeling? I'm much smarter and deeper. I won't make a living from posing for the camera." However, reflecting on that decision later, she acknowledged, "when I grew up, I realized that it's a job and that it's also fun—you make great money, meet fascinating people, and visit interesting places."[24]
Although Gadot’s native language isHebrew, she started taking English lessons inthird gradeand became fluent when she decided she wanted to watchSeinfeldandFriends.[26]She later attended Begin High School, where she majored in biology.[23]After graduating, she had a few months before beginning her mandatory two-year service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). During this time, she received modeling offers but instead chose to work atBurger King, saying, "I was like, posing for money? Ugh, it’s not for me." Meanwhile, her mother and a friend submitted an application on her behalf for the Miss Israel pageant.[15]Before enlisting, she also worked as acaregiverfor eight-month-old twins.[23]
"It wasn't my love for fashion or glamour that led me there. My enlistment [in the army] had been postponed by six months, and all my friends were already in uniform. My mother suggested I try out, so I went through the selection process, met wonderful girls, and thought, 'Why not? It will be fun, and I'll get one last trip abroad before the army.' I figured it would make for a good story to tell my future grandchildren."
In 2004, the 54thMiss Israelbeauty pageant took place at theHaifaCongress Center,[27]where an 18-year-old Gal Gadot participated with little expectation of winning. However, the 5'10" Gadot,[23]was crowned Miss Israel bySivan Klein, andYona Yahav,[28]and received aCitroën C3supermini car.[29]Following her win, Gadot represented Israel in theMiss Universe 2004pageant in Ecuador but admitted she intentionally "rebelled" to avoid winning, arriving late to events and refusing to wear an evening gown.[30]Before parting ways with the crown, Gadot emphasized the importance of serving in the Israeli army, saying, "Serving in the army is an integral part of the lives of the youth here [Israel]. Beyond my contribution, I believe that this period will contribute greatly to me as well."[31]In 2005, a week after passing on the crown,[32]Gadot, at 20,[33]was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces. After excelling in a three-month boot camp,[34]she served as a combat trainer, teaching soldiers gymnastics andcalisthenics.[35]Reporting daily at 5 a.m., she led soldiers through a form of boot camp.[15]Gadot became so passionate about the techniques she learned that she eventually trainedsergeantsand high-rankingcommanders.[36]Gadot also practicedKrav Maga,[37]gaining proficiency in handling weapons and preparing for combat.[36]She completed hermandatory two-year service, of which only 20 days were in uniform.[38]Reflecting on her military experience in a 2016 interview withFashion, Gadot said, “It was demanding because you give up your freedom for two years, but there is something special in giving back to your community.”[36]
In 2007, while serving, 21-year-old Gadot appeared inMaxim's "Women of the Israel Defense Forces" photo shoot,[39]which was later featured on the cover of theNew York Post.[40]The shoot was part of a campaign byIsrael's consulatein New York,Maxim, and theMinistry of Tourismto promote Israel, attract young American men, and reshape its public image.[39]The campaign faced criticism, particularly fromKnessetmembers, over the portrayal of female soldiers in bikinis.[41]Reflecting on the experience in 2013, Gadot stated, "I’m a model, not a doctor. My job is to take pictures in a bathing suit. There’s nothing provocative about that."[42]After the issue was released in July 2007,[42]the shoot significantly boosted her public profile,[43][44]and as a result, she landed an international campaign for "Prada Ellis" perfume.[31]
Gadot then pursued law and international studies[45]atIDC Herzliya(now Reichman University).[31]She attributed this decision to being "so deep," and because she "loved"Ally McBeal.[15]After her first year, a casting director from London contacted Gadot's agent after seeing hermodeling cardon the agency's wall, leading her to audition for the role ofCamille Montesin theJames BondfilmQuantum of Solace.[34][46]In a 2017 interview withW Magazine, Gadot recalled her initial reaction to the role, saying she felt "too serious and smart to be an actress" because of her studies and was not comfortable speaking in English.[45]Her agent encouraged her to go, saying, "Just go, please, out of respect."

When I look back 15 years, when I was starting out, being Israeli was something that people admired and were excited about—Israeli women, their strength, and all that. I’m not saying it’s no longer the case, but now it’s complicated. The conversation has changed. It’s different. And I find myself, time and again, having to engage in very complex and often uncomfortable discussions with people who have opinions about what’s happening, trying to give them the full picture of what’s really going on.
In January 2025, Gadot participated inNoa Tishby’s "#BringOnTheLight" campaign, celebrating Jewish resilience and joy duringHanukkah. The campaign featured other celebrities who lit the menorah on different nights.[213]Late that month, she faced backlash after attending the 2025 Golden Globes without wearing a yellow ribbon pin, a symbol of support forhostages held by Hamas. Reports then circulated claiming she was forbidden from wearing the pin. In response, Gadot clarified that she was never told not to wear it. Instead, Gadot wore a yellow ring and posted on social media to raise awareness for the hostages' plight.[214]She faced backlash over this, including from Ofira Asayag, who called Gadot a "hypocrite."[215]
In February 2025, Gadot spoke about the hostages and the Israel-Gaza war, stating on her Harper's Bazaar Spain interview that her wish is for a "diplomatic agreement that allows all parties at the table to live a good and prosperous life."[216]
She reinforced her anti-war stance, saying that "I know it sounds cliché, but just as they are teaching us to hate, by increasing antisemitism, we can also teach them to love. I want to believe that love is the force that moves the world. War is a defeat for everyone. Hate is horrible. It is toxic for the outside world and for the hater."[217]
In March 2020, Gadot and a number of other celebrities, including herWonder Woman 1984co-starKristen Wiig, performedan online versionof the song "Imagine" byJohn Lennon, intended to raise morale during theCOVID-19 pandemic.[218]The video received backlash with critics dismissing it as an ineffective response to the pandemic; Jon Caramanica ofThe New York Timescalled it "an empty and profoundly awkward gesture".[219][220][221][222][223]Gadot later acknowledged the video did not garner the positive reaction that had been intended, but was unapologetic in explaining the thinking behind it.[83]In a 2022 interview withInStylemagazine, Gadot admitted that the video was done in "poor taste", but still maintained that it had "pure intentions".[224]

The couple connected at a "chakra/yoga retreat type of party" in theIsraeli desert.[233]
In 2008, during a weekend off from filmingFast & Furious 4, the couple went toNapa Valley,[24]where Varsano (33) proposed to Gadot (23).[234]Later that year, on September 28,[235]they married at the David Intercontinental Hotel in Israel.[236]They reside in theNeve Tzedekneighborhood of Tel Aviv,[6]and have four daughters, Alma born November 5, 2011,[237]Maya born March 20, 2017, Daniella born June 29, 2021,[238][58][239]and Ori born March 6, 2024.[240]The couple owned aboutique hotelinTel Aviv,Israel, which she helped run,[241]that was eventually sold to Russian oligarch and politicianRoman Abramovichin 2015 for $26 million.[242]
Gadot revealed in a 2023 interview withL'Officielthat she struggles withimposter syndrome, despite her success in Hollywood, saying "I feel so lucky and happy that I'm doing what I really love, but I also always think to myself: 'I hope they'll like it.' There's never a moment when I'm sure they will."[243]She shared advice she once received from directorFrancis Ford Coppola: "He said to me, 'You know what? I'm always full of doubts too and I'm sure people won't like my work. So I just follow my heart and stay humble".[243]
In February 2024, during her eighth month of pregnancy, Gadot was diagnosed withcerebral venous thrombosis, a rare type ofstrokethat accounts for less than 3% of all strokes.[244]She was rushed to the hospital, where she underwent emergency surgery within hours. Her fourth daughter, Ori, was born during the procedure. In December 2024 Gadot stated that she had fully recovered and  chose to share her experience to raise awareness about the condition.[245]
A year after her daughter's birth, Gadot opened up to Harper's Bazaar about her experience with the condition, stating that "Having such anear-death experiencehas made me feel more grateful and present in my own life, I try to remind myself daily to slow down and do things at my own pace."[246]

She described feeling comforted and embraced by theJewish community, stating that, though far from Israel, she felt at home in Los Angeles. For a brief moment, she said, the chaos of the outside world felt more bearable. She concluded with the phrase "Am Yisrael Chai."[16]
Gadot has expressed admiration forPenélope Cruz, particularly for her courage, individuality, and confidence in embracing her identity. She appreciates how Cruz "stands up for herself and has something to say—she has her own spice, which I love. She is very courageous and also has an accent, but she just goes with it."[36]She also recognizesYafa Yarkonias her "Israeli culturalhero", referring to her as "the singer of wars".[23]Additionally, when asked whichhistorical eventshe would like to witness, Gadot shared that she would have chosen the rally after whichYitzhak Rabinwas assassinated, as it symbolized "the extreme rejection of democracy".[23]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
