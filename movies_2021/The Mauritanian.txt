The Mauritanianis a 2021legal dramafilm based on the memoir ofMohamedou Ould Slahi,[5]aMauritanianman who was held from 2002 to 2016 without charge in theGuantanamo Bay detention camp, a United States military prison. The film was directed byKevin Macdonaldbased on a screenplay written by M.B. Traven,Rory Haines, andSohrab Noshirvani, adapted from Slahi's 2015 memoirGuantánamo Diary. It starredTahar Rahimas Slahi, and also featuredJodie Foster,Shailene Woodley,Benedict Cumberbatch, andZachary Leviin supporting roles.
The Mauritanianwas released in the United States on 12 February 2021 bySTXfilms. In the United Kingdom, where all cinemas were closed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, the planned cinema release was cancelled and the film was premiered onAmazon Prime Videoon 1 April 2021.[1]It received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising Macdonald's direction, its cinematography and the performances of the cast (particularly of Rahim and Foster) but criticising its screenplay. At the78th Golden Globe Awardsthe film received two nominations;Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama(for Rahim), with Foster winningBest Supporting Actress – Motion Picture. At the74th British Academy Film Awardsthe film received five nominations, includingBest Film,Outstanding British Film, andBest Actor(for Rahim).
In November 2001,Mohamedou Ould Slahiis inMauritania, two months after theSeptember 11 attacks. A Mauritanian policeman tells Mohamedou that Americans want to have a talk with him. Mohamedou agrees to go with them.
InAlbuquerque, New Mexico, in February 2005, lawyerNancy Hollanderis told by French lawyer Emmanuel that a lawyer from Mauritania approached his firm in Paris on behalf of Mohamedou’s family. They haven’t seen Mohamedou since he was arrested three years ago and only just found out in a newspaper that he is being held by the United States at theGuantanamo Bay detention campand is accused of being one of the organizers of 9/11. Emmanuel asks Nancy to look into it because she has a security clearance from a previous case and can ask questions he can’t. Nancy agrees to check.
At a Naval Law Conference inNew Orleans, Marine ProsecutorStuart Couchis told by Colonel Bill Seidel about the Mohamedou case which Seidel wants him to prosecute. Seidel says that Mohamedou fought withAl-Qaedain the '90s and then recruited for them inGermany, and says it was Mohamedou who recruited the terrorist who flew Stu’s friend’s plane into the tower.
Nancy and Teri (her fellow lawyer) fly down to Guantánamo to meet Mohamedou. Mohamedou agrees to hire them as his lawyers. Meanwhile, Stu tells his team to go through all the intel reports they have to corroborate the story against Mohamedou.
Nancy finds out something through Mohamedou’s letter which she received from him while Stu looks at the MFR (Memorandum for the Record), showing exactly what happened. The letter and reports talk aboutenhanced interrogation methods(i.e., torture) and other maltreatment including sexual assault upon Mohamedou by the Guantanamo guards as ordered by General Mandel. General Mandel also threatened the arrest and rape of his mother. Thus, to save his mother and to get the torture to stop, Mohamedou gave false confession about being a terrorist. Stu withdraws from Mohamedou's prosecution in disgust.
In December 2009, at trial Mohamedou testified over video link to the court. In March 2010, Mohamedou got a letter informing him that his case was successful, and the judge has ordered him to be released. Text is shown telling us that it would be another 7 years before he actually was released, because the government appealed. His mother died in 2013 so he never saw her again. He was finally released in 2016, having spent 14 years in prison without ever being charged.
Finally, footage of the real Mohamedou arriving back in Mauritania is shown. Texts are shown, telling us Mohamedou lives in Mauritania and got married in 2018 to an American lawyer. They have a son, Ahmed, but haven’t been able to live together as a family and are hoping a country will grant them protection and citizenship. Nancy and Teri are still lawyers working against injustice, and we see footage of Mohamedou giving them necklaces with their names inArabic.

In December 2021,Jahm Najafiannounced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1]
In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014 (the "S" standing for Simonds, the company's founder; the "T" standing forTPG Growth, whose managing partner McGlashan helped launch the company; and the "X" standing for "secret project"),[2]with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[3][4]Investors in the company includedHony Capital,Tencent,PCCW, TPG Growth,RTL GroupandLiberty Global. Individual investors includeGigi Pritzker,Beau Wrigley, andDominic Ng.[5][6][7]
In September 2017, it was reported that STX was considering aninitial public offeringon theHong Kong Stock Exchange(SEHK). It was reported that a listing on the SEHK could bring STX closer to Chinese investors and audiences.[8]TheWall Street Journalstated that the company could be valued at $3.5 billion, after raising an additional $500 million following the IPO.[8][9]In April 2018, the company filed for an IPO on theHong Kong Stock Exchange.[10]
STX called off its IPO in October 2018, citing theChina–U.S. trade war, and conditions having deteriorated in Hong Kong due to turbulence in the mainland Chinese equity market.[11]An overall co-funding agreement with Chinese companyHuayi Brothers Medialapsed at the end of 2018,[12]and in April 2019, co-founder Bill McGlashan was fired due to his being indicted in thecollege admissions bribery scandal.[13]
In April 2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian film and television studioEros International plc.

Linked page for 'Kevin Macdonald' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Macdonald_(director)):
Kevin Macdonald(born 28 October 1967) is a Scottish film director. His films includeOne Day in September(1999), a documentary about the 1972murder of 11 Israeli athletes, which won him theAcademy Award for Best Documentary Feature, the climbing documentaryTouching the Void(2003), the dramaThe Last King of Scotland(2006), the political thrillerState of Play(2009), theBob MarleydocumentaryMarley(2012), the post-apocalyptic dramaHow I Live Now(2013), the thrillerBlack Sea(2014), theWhitney HoustondocumentaryWhitney(2018), and the legal drama filmThe Mauritanian(2021).
Macdonald was born inGlasgow, Scotland. His maternal grandparents were the Hungarian-born BritishJewishfilmmakerEmeric Pressburgerand English screenwriter and actress Wendy Orme. He was brought up inGartocharn, Dunbartonshire and attended the local primary school for the first five years of his education,[1]He was educated atGlenalmond College, andSt Anne's College, Oxford. His brotherAndrew Macdonaldis a film producer.
In 1999, he married Tatiana Lund, with whom he has three sons. He lives inNorth London.
Macdonald began his career with a biography of his grandfather,The Life and Death of a Screenwriter(1994), which he turned into the documentaryThe Making of an Englishman(1995).
After making a series of biographical documentaries, Macdonald directedOne Day in September(1999), about themurder of Israeli athletesat the1972 Munich Olympics. Possibly the most striking feature of this film was the lengthy interview withJamal Al-Gashey, the last known survivor among theMunich terrorists(it has been suggested recently in Aaron Klein's bookStriking Backthat another, Mohammed Safady, might also still be alive).  Macdonald found Al-Gashey through intermediaries, and was able to convince him that the film would only be truly authentic if Al-Gashey gave his side of the story. Since the former terrorist was convinced that Israeli authorities were still hunting him (he had been in hiding ever since being ransomed for a hijacked aeroplane less than two months after theMunich massacre), Al-Gashey agreed to the interview only on condition that he would be disguised, his face would be shown only in shadow or blurred out, and that the interview would be conducted by a person and in a place of Al-Gashey's choosing (which turned out to beAmman, Jordan), although Al-Gashey agreed that Macdonald could be present. Since the interview was conducted entirely inArabic(even though Al-Gashey was known to be fluent in English, having been interviewed in the language in 1972), and Al-Gashey (through paranoia or annoyance) frequently stormed out of the interview room, Macdonald did not know if he had anything usable until he returned to London and hired an Arabic translator. The film won anOscarforBest Documentary.
His next film wasTouching the Void, adocudramathat told the story of two climbers making the first successful ascent of the West Face ofSiula Grande, a major peak in the PeruvianAndes, in 1985 and the subsequent dramatic series of events during their descent after one of the climbers broke his leg whilst high on the peak. The film won theAlexander KordaAward for Best British Film at the2003–04 BAFTA Awards– coincidentally, it was Korda who had given Macdonald's grandfather his first job when he had arrived inBritainin 1935.
Next wasThe Last King of Scotland, for whichForest Whitakerreceived widespread acclaim and won multiple acting awards includingAcademy Award for Best Actor.
