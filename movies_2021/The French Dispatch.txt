The French Dispatch of the Liberty, Kansas Evening Sunis a 2021 Americananthologycomedy dramafilm written, directed, and produced byWes Andersonfrom a story he conceived withRoman Coppola,Hugo Guinness, andJason Schwartzman. It features an expansiveensemble castand follows three different storylines as the Frenchnews bureauof the fictionalLiberty, KansasEvening Sunnewspaper publishes its final issue.
The first segment, "The Concrete Masterpiece", follows an incarcerated and unstable painter, and starsBenicio del Toro,Adrien Brody,Tilda SwintonandLéa Seydoux. The second, "Revisions to a Manifesto", is inspired by theMay 68student protests, and starsFrances McDormand,Timothée Chalamet, andLyna Khoudri.

The project was first mentioned in August 2018 as an untitled musical set afterWorld War II. That December, the film was officially announced, with Anderson calling it a "love letter to journalists". Filming took place between November 2018 and March 2019, with cinematographerRobert D. Yeoman, in the city ofAngoulême, France. In post-production, editing was completed byAndrew Weisblumand thescorewas composed byAlexandre Desplat.
Following a delay from 2020,The French Dispatchpremiered at theCannes Film Festivalon July 12, 2021, and was theatrically released in the United States bySearchlight Pictureson October 22, 2021.[7]It received generally positive reviews, with praise for its score, production design, and performances. It has grossed $46 million worldwide against its budget of $25 million.
In 1975, in the fictional French town of Ennui-sur-Blasé,[a]Arthur Howitzer Jr., the editor of the magazineThe French Dispatch, dies of a heart attack. According to the wishes expressed in his will, publication of the magazine is immediately suspended following one final farewell issue, in which four articles are published, along with an obituary.
Herbsaint Sazerac delivers a cycling tour of Ennui-sur-Blasé, demonstrating several key areas such as the arcade, Le Sans Blague café and a pickpocket's alleyway. He compares the past and the present of each place, demonstrating how much and yet how little has changed in Ennui over time.
J.K.L. Berensen delivers a lecture at the art gallery of her former employer, Upshur "Maw" Clampette, in which she details the career of Moses Rosenthaler. Rosenthaler, a mentally disturbed artist serving a sentence in the Ennui prison for murder, paints an abstract nude portrait of Simone, a prison officer with whom he develops a relationship. Julien Cadazio, an art dealer also serving a sentence for tax evasion, is immediately taken by the painting and buys it despite Rosenthaler's protests. Upon his release, Cadazio convinces his family of art exhibitors to put it on display, and Rosenthaler soon becomes a sensation in the art world. Privately, Rosenthaler struggles with inspiration to the point of near-suicide, and devotes himself to a long-term project at Simone's challenging.
Three years later, Cadazio, his uncles, Clampette, Berensen, and a mob of artists inspired by Rosenthaler, all frustrated at the lack of further paintings, bribe their way into the prison to confront him, only to discover that his masterpiece is in fact a series offrescoesin the concrete prison hall. Angered that the paintings are irremovable from the prison, Cadazio gets into a physical altercation with Rosenthaler, but soon comes to appreciate the paintings for what they are, and later arranges for the entire wall to be airlifted out of the prison into a private museum in Kansas, owned by Clampette. For his actions in halting a prison riot that breaks out during the reveal of the paintings, Rosenthaler is released on probation. Simone also departs after earning a great sum of money for becoming the inspiration and motivation for Rosenthaler during his incarceration. Simone and Rosenthaler maintain correspondence following his release, but never see each other again.
Lucinda Krementz reports on a student protest breaking out in the streets of Ennui that soon boils over into the "Chessboard Revolution", so-called for the students using chess to communicate with the police. While the revolution initially is inspired by petty concerns over access to the girls' dormitory, the traumatic military conscription of one student, Mitch-Mitch, inspires greater uprising.
Despite her insistence on maintaining "journalistic neutrality", Krementz has a brief romance with Zeffirelli, a self-styled leader of the revolt, and secretly helps him write his manifesto and adds an appendix. Juliette, a fellow revolutionary, is unimpressed with his manifesto. After they briefly express their disagreement about its contents, Krementz discovers that Juliette is in fact infatuated with Zeffirelli and is jealous of her closeness with him. She then tells the two to "go make love", which they do.
A few weeks later, Zeffirelli dies attempting repairs on the tower of a revolutionarypirate radiostation, and soon a photograph of his likeness becomes symbolic of the movement. Five years later, Krementz translates Mitch-Mitch's theatrical dramatization of his conscription, and Zeffirelli's death, for a National Playhouse production of his play (at the downstairs Knoblock Theatre).
During a television interview, Roebuck Wright recounts the story of his attending a private dinner with The Commissaire of the Ennui police force, prepared by legendary police officer/chef Lt. Nescaffier. Nescaffier is a famous specialist in a kind of haute cuisine specifically designed to be eaten by working police officers.  The dinner is disrupted when the Commissaire's son Gigi is kidnapped and held for ransom by criminals, led by a failed musician labelled The Chauffeur.
The kidnappers represent the warring criminal syndicates of Ennui-sur-Blasé, and demand the release of an underworld accountant Albert, nicknamed "the Abacus", who possesses their shared financial records. The Abacus is being held in a solitary confinement cell at police headquarters. Wright recollects his own imprisonment in that same cell for his homosexuality, for which he was bailed out by Howitzer and offered a job at theDispatch.
Following a shoot-out at the kidnapper's hideout, Gigi manages to sneak out a message inMorse codeto "send the cook". Lt. Nescaffier is sent into the kidnappers' hideout, ostensibly to provide both them and Gigi with food, but secretly the food is laced with poison. The criminals all succumb to the poison except Gigi and The Chauffeur as neither ate the poisoned radishes, and Nescaffier just barely survives after willingly sampling the food to trick the criminals. The Chauffeur escapes with Gigi, and leads the police on a chase. Gigi manages to escape through the car's sunroof and reunites with his father. During his recovery, Nescaffier saves The Abacus from starving to death by preparing him an omelette, the prisoner having been totally forgotten in the commotion.
Back at theDispatchoffice, Howitzer tells Wright to reinsert a deleted segment. In it, a recovering Nescaffier tells Wright that the taste of the poison was unlike anything he had ever eaten before, before they reflect on the state of being foreigners in France, and outsiders to society as a whole. Howitzer and Wright disagree on whether this conversation is the heart of the piece.
In an epilogue, theFrench Dispatchstaff mourn Howitzer's death, but set to work putting together a final issue to honor his memory.
During the closing credits, there is a dedication to the following writers and editors, many of whom were associated withThe New Yorker:Harold Ross,William Shawn,Rosamond Bernier,Mavis Gallant,James Baldwin,A. J. Liebling,S. N. Behrman,Lillian Ross,Janet Flanner,Lucy Sante,James Thurber,Joseph Mitchell,Wolcott Gibbs,St. Clair McKelway,Ved Mehta,Brendan Gill,E. B. White, andKatharine White, and additionally toChristophe, writer of the featured song "Aline". Accompanying the credits are covers of theFrench Dispatchwhich are reminiscent ofThe New Yorkercovers.
The film has been described as "a love letter to journalists set at an outpost of an American newspaper in a fictional 20th-century French city", centering on four stories.[11]It brings to life a collection of tales published in the eponymousThe French Dispatch, based in the fictional French city of Ennui-sur-Blasé.[12]The film is inspired by Anderson's love ofThe New Yorker, and some characters and events in the film are based on real-life equivalents from the magazine.[8]Arthur Howitzer Jr., the Kansas-born editor of theDispatch, was based onThe New Yorkerfounding editorHarold Ross, who came from Colorado.A. J. Lieblingserved as a secondary inspiration for the character.[8]The character Herbsaint Sazerac was inspired byThe New YorkerwriterJoseph Mitchell.[8]The food journalist Roebuck Wright was based on an amalgamation ofJames Baldwin, Liebling andTennessee Williams.[8][13]The story "Revisions to a Manifesto" was inspired byMavis Gallant's two-part article "The Events in May: A Paris Notebook", centering on theMay 68student protests.[8]"The Concrete Masterpiece" was inspired by the 1951 feature "The Days of Duveen", a six-part profile on art dealerLord Duveen, upon which the character Julien Cadazio (played by Adrien Brody) is modeled.[8]The character Upshur "Maw" Clampette was based on art collectorDominique de Menil, and J.K.L. Berensen was inspired by art lecturerRosamond Bernier.[13]
When speaking to French publicationCharente Librein April 2019, Anderson said: "The story is not easy to explain . . . [It's about an] American journalist based in France [who] creates his magazine. It is more a portrait of this man, of this journalist who fights to write what he wants to write. It's not a movie about freedom of the press, but when you talk about reporters you also talk about what's going on in the real world."[14]
In August 2018, it was reportedWes Andersonwould write and direct an untitled musical film set in France, post World War II.[15]In November 2018, it was announcedJeremy Dawsonwould produce the film, withTilda SwintonandMathieu Amalricstarring in the film. Dawson also confirmed the film is not a musical.[16]Additionally,Natalie Portman,Brad Pitt, andLéa Seydouxwere rumored for roles in the film.[17]In December 2018, it was announced Anderson would write and direct the film, withFrances McDormand,Bill Murray,Benicio del Toro, andJeffrey Wright; Seydoux was confirmed to star in the film alongside Swinton and Amalric, withSteven Ralesproducing under hisIndian Paintbrushbanner andFox Searchlight Picturesdistributing.[18]Timothée Chalamet's role was written with him in mind.[19]
Later that month,Lois SmithandSaoirse Ronanjoined the cast.[20][21]In January 2019,Owen Wilson,Adrien Brody,Henry Winkler,[22]Willem Dafoe,Bob Balaban,Steve Park,Denis Ménochet,Lyna Khoudri,Alex Lawther,[23]Félix Moati,Benjamin Lavernhe,Guillaume Gallienne, andCécile de Francewere cast.[24][25]Robert D. Yeomanserved as the film's cinematographer.[26]In February 2019, it was announcedWally Wolodarsky,Fisher Stevens,Griffin Dunne, andJason Schwartzmanhad joined the cast of the film.[27]In April 2019,Christoph Waltz,Rupert Friend, andElisabeth Mosswere cast.[28][29]Initially,Kate Winsletwas also part of the cast, but had to exit the project to prepare for her next role inAmmonite.[30][31]
Principal photography began in November 2018, in the city ofAngoulêmein southwestern France and wrapped in March 2019.[32]Murray and Ronan, who had small roles, recorded their scenes in two days.[33][34]
Director of photographyRobert YeomanshotThe French Dispatchon35 mm filmusingKodak Vision3 200T 5213for the color sequences, andEastman Double-X 5222for the black-and-white sequences, onArricam Studio and Litecameras provided by a studio in Paris.[35]Anderson preferred classic methods for shooting the scenes. Accordingly, the crew used scaffolding and hauled equipment on ropes, rather than aTechnocrane; and golf carts for transporting cameras, rather than camera cars.[36]Most scenes were framed in 1.37:1 format (also known asAcademy ratio), which Anderson used in hisThe Grand Budapest Hotel, and which was used for many of the French films that inspiredThe French Dispatch. Occasional scenes were shot inanamorphic format"mainly to make a bold dramatic statement", according to Yeoman.[35]French New Wavefilms were primary sources of inspiration for Yeoman's lighting;In Cold Blood(1967, shot byConrad Hall) was another major reference.[35]
The animated segments were directed by Gwenn Germain, who previously worked on Anderson'sIsle of Dogs.[37]As a nod to Angoulême's comic heritage, they were done entirely by local illustrators.[38]The team comprised a maximum of 15 people, withThe Adventures of TintinandBlake and Mortimeras their main inspirations. They took about seven months to complete.[37]The visual effects were done by the UK-based company Koala FX.[39]
Adam Stockhausenwas responsible for the production design ofThe French Dispatch. He and his team began thescoutingprocess usingGoogle Maps, looking for promising locations before visiting them in person.[38]Stockhausen and Anderson envisioned a town which "felt like Paris but not as it is today – more a sort of memory of Paris, the Paris ofJacques Tati." The team eventually settled on Angoulême.[40]Stockhausen estimates that over 125 sets were constructed, most of them on location around Angoulême. A formerfeltfactory was converted into a makeshift movie studio for the crew.[38]A real building in Angoulême was chosen as the basis for theDispatchheadquarters, enhanced with foreground sets andminiaturesin order to create the symmetry typically seen in Anderson films.[41]
Rena DeAngelowasThe French Dispatch'sset decorator.[42]DeAngelo and Anderson sought inspiration from French films such asThe Red Balloon,The 400 Blows,Bande à partandVivre sa vie, and researched an extensive photo collection of Paris from the mid-1800s through the 1960s in order to "get a feeling of Paris when it was dirtier—still beautiful, but grimy."[42]DeAngelo and her team sourced the furniture for Le Sans Blague café from various places in Paris, and the coffee cups were specially made inLimoges, a city famous for itsporcelain.[38]She also shopped once a month during filming at prop houses and flea markets inLe Mans, from which she sourced the furniture for Roebuck Wright's office. Much of the rest of the film's furniture came from a local estate liquidator in Angoulême.[38]
Rosenthaler's abstract paintings were created by the German-New Zealand visual artist (and Tilda Swinton's partner)Sandro Koppin a three-month-long process.[43][44]Kopp cited the works ofFrank Auerbach,Willem de Kooning, andFrancis Baconas references, while insisting that the paintings must be "idiosyncratic", and would not "look too much like the work of any living or dead painter".[43]He relocated to theFrench Dispatchset in Angoulême to create the paintings, working in the on-set studio.[43]Kopp also served as Tony Revolori'shand-doublefor the scenes where the young Rosenthaler is seen painting.[44]
Catalonian-based illustrator Javi Aznarez drew from his own imagination and memories to design the covers for this movie, which were made to look likeThe New Yorker-style magazine covers.[45]
For the film's musical score,Wes Andersonteamed up with his long-time collaboratorsAlexandre DesplatandRandall Poster. Desplat enlisted pianistJean-Yves Thibaudetand drew inspiration from composersErik SatieandThelonious Monkto pair him in unusual duos, such as with a harp, timpani, bassoon, or tuba.[46]Recording took place remotely due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[47]The film's soundtrack album was released on CD and digitally on October 22, 2021, byABKCO Records,[48][49]with a vinyl release planned for early 2022.[50]The only single from the film's soundtrack album, titled "Obituary", was released on September 14, 2021.[51]The film's musical score was given a separate, earlier, release.
In September 2019,Searchlight Picturesacquired distribution rights to the film.[52]It was set to premiere at theCannes Film Festivalon May 12, 2020, and get a wide release on July 24, but, due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, the festival was cancelled and the film was pulled from the schedule on April 3, 2020.[53][54]The film was rescheduled for release on October 16, 2020, before being pulled from the schedule again on July 23, 2020.[55][56]

David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterpraised the film's "hand-crafted visual delights and eccentric performances", and wrote: "WhileThe French Dispatchmight seem like an anthology of vignettes without a strong overarching theme, every moment is graced by Anderson's love for the written word and the oddball characters who dedicate their professional lives to it".[82]Writing forThe Guardian, Peter Bradshaw said: "It might not be at the very zenith of what he can achieve but for sheer moment-by-moment pleasure, and for laughs, this is a treat".[83]

Anderson's next comedy-drama,The Royal Tenenbaums, was released in 2001. The film focuses on a successful, artistic New York City family and its ostracized patriarch, played byGene Hackman. It also starsAnjelica Hustonas the ex-wife andBen Stiller,Luke Wilson, andGwyneth Paltrowas the children. The film was a box-office and critical success.

The film also stars Owen Wilson,Cate Blanchett,Willem Dafoe,Jeff Goldblum, Anjelica Huston, andMichael Gambon. It is a classic example of Anderson's style, but its critical reception was less favorable than his previous films', and its box office did not match the heights ofThe Royal Tenenbaums.[25]
The Darjeeling Limited(2007) was about three emotionally distant brothers traveling together on a train in India. It reflects the more dramatic tone ofThe Royal Tenenbaumsbut faced criticism similar to those ofThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Anderson has acknowledged that he went to India to film the movie partly as a tribute to Indian filmmakerSatyajit Ray, whose "films have also inspired all my other movies in different ways" (the film is dedicated to him).[26]The film stars Anderson staples Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson in addition toAdrien Brody, and the script is by Anderson, Schwartzman, andRoman Coppola.[27]

It includes ensemble performances by Bill Murray,Edward Norton,Bruce Willis,Frances McDormand, andTilda Swinton. The film is emblematic of Anderson's style and earned him another Academy Award nomination for his screenplay. The film was also a financial success, earning $68.3 million at the box office against a budget of only $16 million.
In 2014, Anderson's next film,The Grand Budapest Hotel, was released. It starsRalph Fiennes,Tony Revolori,Saoirse Ronan,Jeff Goldblum,Willem Dafoe,F. Murray Abraham, and several of Anderson's regular collaborators, including Murray, Owen Wilson, Swinton and Schwartzman.[30]It is mostly set in the 1930s and follows the adventures of M. Gustave, the hotel's concierge, making "a marvelous mockery of history, turning its horrors into a series of graceful jokes and mischievous gestures", according toThe New York Times.[31]The film is one of Anderson's greatest critical and commercial successes, grossing nearly $175 million worldwide and earning dozens of award nominations, including nine Oscar nominations with four wins forBest Production Design,Best Costume Design,Best Makeup, andBest Original Score.[32]These nominations also included his first forBest Director.
Anderson returned to stop-motion animation withIsle of Dogs.[33]Production on the film started in the United Kingdom in October 2016, and it was released in March–April 2018.[34][35][36]The film received Academy Award nominations forBest Animated FeatureandBest Original Score.[37]

In March 2024, Anderson began production inGermanyfor a new film calledThe Phoenician Scheme, withBenicio del Toro,Michael Cera, andBill Murrayconfirmed to star, with some of Anderson's other regular stars expected to appear.[51]
Anderson's cinematic influences includeWoody Allen,[52]Pedro Almodóvar,[53]Satyajit Ray,[26]Hal Ashby,[54]andRoman Polanski.[55]In an interview withHoda KotbonToday,Bryan Cranstongave insight into Anderson's process (on the same day as one of hisAsteroid Cityco-stars,Jason Schwartzman, who built adarkroomin his house because he thought Anderson would approve of his character development). Schwartzman was onToday 3rd Hour. Cranston said:
"But it's also what surrounds it, where all the actors stay in the same hotel. We have dinner at one table every single night with Wes and all guests; it's like actor camp... On a Wes Anderson film there are no trailers, no dressing rooms... there's no hierarchy, no call sheet—you are just ready to go at about 9:30, 10:00 in the morning in your wardrobe. You hop in his golf cart with him or a van and you go to the set... you hang out with everyone so you never know if you are going to be called into a scene. He's such a kind and generous spirit... also in his personal life. Everyone makes the same amount of money. You just show up and off you go. Sometimes you might [be] just a small supporting role in a scene and then [in] others you'll be the lead in a movie.[56]
Anderson has a unique directorial style that has led several critics to consider him anauteur.[57][58][59][60]He is considered a central figure inAmerican eccentric cinema.[61]
A great many similarities have been noted between Anderson's work and the 1984 filmThe Hotel New Hampshire, a quirky and eccentric comedy-drama written and directed byTony Richardsonwhich featured an ensemble cast includingJodie Foster,Beau Bridges,Rob Lowe,Nastassja Kinski,Amanda Plummer,Matthew Modine, andSeth Greenin his film debut.[62]
TheSovietcomedy movieWelcome, or No TrespassingbyElem Klimov(1964) has been pointed out as one major source of inspiration for Wes Anderson, specifically its “camera work, storytelling devices, and charming whimsy".[63]
In 2010, Wes Anderson selected twelve of his favorite films from theCriterioncloset. Titles three through five were aboxset. They were:[64]
In 2022, Wes Anderson participated in theBritish Film Institute'sSight and Soundpolls. Held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, contemporary directors were asked to select ten films of their choice. Anderson's choices, all French, in chronological order, were:[65]
Anderson has namedRosemary's Babyas his favorite horror film.[66]His three favorite musicals areThe Pajama Game,Meet Me in St. Louis, andSadie McKee.[67]
Anderson's work has been classified aspostmodern, on account of his nostalgic attention to detail, his subversion of mainstream conventions of narrative, his references to different genres in the same film, and his love for eccentric characters with complex sexual identities.[68][69]
Anderson has mostly directed fast-paced comedies marked by more serious or melancholic elements, with themes often centered on grief, loss of innocence, dysfunctional families, parental abandonment, adultery, sibling rivalry and unlikely friendships. His movies have been noted as unusually character-driven and, by turns, both derided and praised with terms like "literary geek chic".[70][71]Their plots often feature thefts and unexpected disappearances, with a tendency to borrow liberally from thecapergenre.[72]
According to Alex Buono,[73]Anderson has been noted for extensive use of flat space camera moves (pans, tilts, and zooms within scenes that look two-dimensional),[74]symmetrical compositions,snap-zooms(rapid, shakey zooms onto subjects),[75]slow-motion walking shots, a deliberately limited color palette, and handmade art direction often using miniatures. These stylistic choices give his movies a distinctive quality that has provoked much discussion, critical study, supercuts, mash-ups, and parody. Many writers, critics, and Anderson himself have commented that this gives his movies the feel of being "self-contained worlds" or a "scale-model household".[76]According to Jesse Fox Mayshark, his films have "a baroquepopbent that is not realist, surrealist or magic realist", but rather might be described as "fabul[ist]".[77]In 2019, the company Murals Wallpaper launched a line of wallpapers inspired by the visual design of Anderson's films.[78]
SinceThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Anderson has relied more heavily on stop motion animation and miniatures, even making entire features with stop motion animation withFantastic Mr. FoxandIsle of Dogs.[79]
Anderson frequently uses pop music from the 1960s and '70s on the soundtracks of his films, and one band or musician tends to dominate each soundtrack.Rushmoreprominently featuredCat StevensandBritish Invasiongroups;The Royal TenenbaumsfeaturedNico;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,David Bowie, including both originals andcoversperformed bySeu Jorge;The Darjeeling LimitedandRushmore,the Kinks;Fantastic Mr. Fox,the Beach Boys; andMoonrise Kingdom,Hank Williams.Moonrise Kingdomis also filled with the music ofBenjamin Britten, which is tied to a number of major plot points.[80]The Darjeeling Limitedalso borrowed music styles from Satyajit Ray's films.
The Grand Budapest Hotel, which is mostly set in the 1930s, eschews pop music, instead using music byAlexandre Desplat. Its soundtrack won Desplat theAcademy Award for Best Original Score, theBAFTA Award for Best Film Music, andWorld Soundtrack Award for Best Original Score of the Year.
The soundtracks for his films have often brought renewed attention to the artists featured, most prominently in the case of "These Days", which was used inThe Royal Tenenbaums.[81]
Anderson's films feature many recurring actors, including the Wilson brothers (Owen,Luke, andAndrew),Bill Murray,Jason Schwartzman,Anjelica Huston,Willem Dafoe,Jeff Goldblum,Edward Norton,Adrien Brody,Bob Balaban,Tony Revolori, andTilda Swinton.[82][83]Robert Yeomanhas served as director of photography for all of Anderson's live-action films, whileMark Mothersbaughcomposed Anderson's first four films, andAlexandre Desplatthe next six, taking over withFantastic Mr. Fox.[84]Randall Posterhas served as music supervisor for all of Anderson's films sinceRushmore. Anderson has co-written films withNoah Baumbach,Roman Coppola, andHugo Guinness. His films have often been financed bySteven Ralesthrough his production companyIndian Paintbrush.[85]
Anderson is in a romantic relationship with Lebanese writer, costume designer, and voice actressJuman Malouf,[86][87]the daughter of novelistHanan al-Shaykh.[88]Malouf gave birth to the couple's daughter, Freya in 2016.[89]Bill Murray is the godfather.[90]
Anderson has maintained an apartment in Paris since 2005, after spending most of his adult life in New York City.[91][92][93]He is the brother of author, illustrator and actorEric Chase Anderson.[94]
Anderson's distinctive filmmaking style has led to numerous homages and parodies. Notable examples include:

Léa Seydoux was born on 1 July 1985,[9][10]the daughter of businessman Henri Seydoux and philanthropist Valérie Schlumberger. She was born inPassy, in the16th arrondissementof Paris, and grew up inSaint-Germain-des-Présin the6th arrondissement.[11]She had a strictProtestantupbringing,[12]but she is not religious.[13]Seydoux is one of seven children. She has three older half-siblings (Marine Bramly, Noé Saglio and Ondine Saglio) from her mother's first marriage to Christian Saglio, an older sister, stylistCamille Seydouxfrom her parents' marriage, and a further two paternal half-brothers, Ismaël Seydoux and Omer Seydoux, from her father's marriage to modelFarida Khelfa.[14]
Seydoux's parents are both partly ofAlsatiandescent. Her father is a great-grandson of businessman and inventorMarcel Schlumberger, while her mother is a granddaughter of Marcel's brother, Maurice Schlumberger.[15][16]The family name came to exist in 1902,[17]when Seydoux's great-great-grandfather Charles-Louis-Auguste-Jacques Seydoux (1870–1929) married Mathilde, daughter of Languedoc aristocrat François Fornier de Clausonne de Lédenon, whose family held thetitlesof Baron de Lédenon andseigneurde Clausonne, de Laugnac et de la Bastide d'Albe.[17][18][19][20][21]The Seydoux family is widely known in France and influential in the movie industry. Her grandfather,Jérôme Seydoux, is the chairman ofPathé;[22]her granduncle, Nicolas Seydoux, is the chairman ofGaumont;[22]her other granduncle,Michel Seydoux, also a cinema producer, is the chairman of theLille-based football clubLille OSC; and her father is the founder and CEO of the French wireless companyParrot.[23]She has stated that her family initially took no interest in her film career and did not help her, and that she and her influential grandfather were not close.[23][24][25]As a child, she had no desire to act. She instead wanted to be an opera singer,[13][26]studying music at theConservatoire de Paris.[27]Seydoux said: "I had a beautiful voice, but I lost it. I was too shy. I went to theConservatoire de Paris, and I tried to learn how to properly sing. It was too difficult. You have to do all the breathing exercises. You have to have a very strict regimen".[28]
Seydoux's parents divorced when she was three years old and they were often away,[24]her mother in Africa and her father on business, which, combined with her large family, meant that she "felt lost in the crowd... I was very lonely as a kid. Really, I always had the feeling I was an orphan".[23]Through her family involvement in media and entertainment, Seydoux grew up acquainted with prominent artists such as photographerNan Goldin, musiciansLou ReedandMick Jaggerand footwear designerChristian Louboutin, who is her godfather.[23]For six years, Seydoux went tosummer campinMaryland, at the behest of her father, who wanted her to learn to speak English.[29][30]
"My grandfather Jérôme has never felt the slightest interest in my career. [My family] have never lifted a finger to help me. Nor have I asked for anything, ever."
Her mother Valérie Schlumberger is a former actress-turned-philanthropist and the founder of the boutiqueCompagnie d'Afrique du Sénégal et de l'Afrique de l'ouest(CSAO), which promotes the work of African artists. Seydoux once worked as a model for their jewellery lineJokko. Schlumberger, who lived inSenegalas a teenager, is also the founder of the charitable organisationsAssociation pour le Sénégal et l'Afrique de l'Ouest(ASAO) andEmpire des enfants, a centre for homeless children inDakar, of which Seydoux is the "godmother".[13][23]
Seydoux describes her youthful self as short-haired, slightly dishevelled, and widely viewed as a bit strange: "People liked me, but I always felt like a misfit".[12]Still concerned for her shyness in adulthood, Seydoux has admitted to having had an anxiety crisis during the2009 Cannes Film Festival,[32]saying: 'I'll never beSophie Marceau, I'm too weird'. Later, she stated: "In the middle of the Cannes hysteria, I felt fragile and vulnerable. I made this comparison because I'll never be France's "petite fiancée".Sophie Marceaurepresents anything, while I don't have a definite place. But it's not a problem, it's an observation".[33]
Seydoux has stated that as a child she wanted to become anoperasinger, studying music at theConservatoire de Paris, but eventually her shyness compelled her to drop the idea.[34][35]It was not until the age of eighteen that she decided to become an actress.[36]One of her close friends was an actor, and Seydoux has said: "I found his life wonderful, I thought, 'Oh my God, you can travel, you're free, you can do what you want, you're the boss.'"[29][37]She fell in love with an actor and decided to become an actress to impress him.[29]Years later, Seydoux revealed that this actor was her longtime friend,Louis Garrel.[38]She took acting classes at French drama schoolLes Enfants Terribles,[22]having Jean-Bernard Feitussi as her close friend and mentor,[39]and in 2007 she took further training atNew York'sActors Studiowith Corinne Blue.

In 2009, she had a major part inJessica Hausner'sLourdes,[34]and a small role in her first Hollywood film,Quentin Tarantino'sInglourious Basterds. In 2010, she starred alongsideRussell CroweinRidley Scott'sRobin Hood, playingIsabella of Angoulême. That same year, she appeared inLouis Garrel's short-filmPetit Tailleur,[43]Rebecca Zlotowski'sBelle Épine,[44]which earned her a secondCésar Awardnomination forMost Promising Actress, andRaúl Ruiz'sMysteries of Lisbon.[45]Seydoux auditioned and was one of the four finalists,[46][47]to playLisbeth SalanderinThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, but the part ultimately went to actressRooney Mara.[35]Seydoux recalled in an interview: "I got upset, but I don't think I'd be able to do anything to get that part. It was totally against my nature. I worked hard, but Lisbeth was almost anorexic. I wasn't like that".[12][22]
In 2011, she played Gabrielle in the romantic comedyMidnight in Paris.[48]Later, Seydoux participated in another Hollywood production,Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, in which she played the assassin Sabine Moreau alongside starsTom CruiseandJeremy Renner.

More generally, Léa Seydoux's career accelerated from 2012 and allowed the actress to choose her projects from the requests she received, without necessarily having to go through screen tests.[50]According to the specialist press, the young woman then appeared as one of the "essential French actresses in Hollywood",[51]and even as "the most sought-after actress of her generation", who at only 26 years-old, "has always made the right choices and has tackled almost all genres".[52]In the process, she became the image of the perfumeCandyfor the Italian luxury groupPrada.[53]
In 2012, she starred inFarewell, My Queen. The film opened the62nd Berlin International Film Festival, where it was met with critical acclaim.[54][55]Critics praised directorBenoît Jacquot's decision to cast Seydoux in the key-role of Sidonie, stating "her luminous but watchful eyes suggest a soul wise beyond her years."[56]Kenneth Turan of theLos Angeles Timeswrote that Seydoux was an excellent choice for the part, calling her a remarkably versatile young actress and pointed to the stark difference in her characters from her previous roles inMidnight in ParisandMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.[57]That same year, she appeared in the Swiss drama film,Sister. The film competed in competition at the62nd Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Special Award, theSilver Bear, and was selected as the Swiss entry for theBest Foreign Language Oscarat the85th Academy Awards.[58][59][60]Critics again praised Seydoux for bringing a strong array of emotions to a highly unsympathetic part and called her performance intensely moving.[61][62]That year, Seydoux was attached to star inMichael Gondry'sMood Indigo, but had to drop out before filming due to scheduling conflicts withBlue Is the Warmest Colour, being replaced byCharlotte Le Bon. By the end of 2012, she had filmedBlue Is the Warmest ColourbyAbdellatif Kechiche, andGrand CentralbyRebecca Zlotowski, both exhibited at the66th Cannes Film Festival.
"It's true that I'm in high demand and I've learned to say no to higher-paying films so that I can work on projects that are close to my heart, like Sister. And then I had to give up Michel Gondry's Mood Indigo to finish Kechiche's film. In general, I try not to put too much pressure on myself. I know that I'm very lucky. And also that there will be times in my career when I'll have fewer offers."
In 2013, Seydoux was nominated forBest Actressat the38th César Awardsfor her role as Sidonie Laborde inBenoît Jacquot'sFarewell, My Queen. Later that year at the66th Cannes Film Festival,Blue Is the Warmest Colourwon thePalme d'Orand the jury, headed bySteven Spielberg, took the unusual move of awarding the prize not just to the directorAbdellatif Kechiche, but also to the film's two stars, Seydoux andAdèle Exarchopoulos.[36][64]Seydoux stated: "Winning that honor was such a thing. It's engraved in me". Also remarking that "attending theCannes Film Festivalwill always remind me of that big moment of my life".[65]

What holds you, as much as the actor's natural magnetism, is her ability to hold things back, her talent for emotional reserve".[93]Hansen-Løvedeclared herself to be a huge admirer of Seydoux as an actor, as well as her choices throughout her vast filmography, saying: "A lot of [her] characters are very sophisticated, very glamorous. In the past, it felt she was seen by male directors as a bit of a fantasy. I wanted her to be more down-to-earth, closer to us, closer to me. And I had the feeling there was a rawness about her that my film could maybe emphasize". In addition, Seydoux stated that "it's the first time that I really played a normal woman, the girl next door".[94]
In 2021, Seydoux reprised her role asMadeleine Swannin theJames BondfilmNo Time to Die.[95]The film's release was postponed worldwide due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.

Seydoux read the script in one sitting and quickly accepted the role out of admiration forDupieux, who she described as an "extraordinary filmmaker" whose style of humour "hides an increasingly social depth, through imperfect and clumsy characters". She described the film as amise en abymeabout "actors who play in a lousy film" and confront their characters and lines, and appraised it as "crazy" and "very, very funny".[112]Production for the film was kept fully secret from beginning to end.[113]The Second Actwas selected to be the opening film at the77th Cannes Film Festival, where it had its world premiere out-of-competition on 14 May 2024.

For most of the 2010s, the actress was dressed for her red carpet appearances by her own sister, fashion designerCamille Seydoux, whose career took off when she dressed Seydoux for theCésar Awardsceremony in 2011. The duo then appeared several times in the rankings of the best dressed actresses in France and abroad.[131]
Since 2016, Seydoux has been a brand ambassador forLouis Vuitton.[7][8]
Regularly present on the big screen in the 2010s and 2020s with nearly four films shot per year,[132]Léa Seydoux has earned a reputation for excelling in ambiguous and minimalist acting, in restraint, inviting the viewer to invest themselves in trying to unravel the mystery of her characters. Directors, screenwriters and on-screen partners see in her an actress who does a lot with little, and who makes her scenes richer than they appear through her presence and vulnerability.[133][134][135]At the beginning of her career, the actress oscillated between two types of characters in particular, "inconsolable melancholic" or "poisonous solar". The precision of her diction, despite the "machine-gun flow" she can adopt is noted, as is her indifference to having to sometimes undress in front of the camera, which she attributes to the fact of having been raised by a mother "with a loving gaze".[136]Her characters are regularly objects of desire, filmed from the point of view of a male fantasy;[137]since the filming ofBlue Is the Warmest Colour, however, she has been more attentive to the shots of these nude scenes and checks the shots on the monitor.[138]
According to her directors, the actress has a timeless physique that would allow her to project all kinds of narrative issues and social origins onto her characters,[139]and would particularly facilitate her casting in period films, whether she is a maid to Marie Antoinette or a chambermaid.[140]The variety in her choice of films and roles leadsThe New York Timesto recognize that it is difficult to place her in a single register, even if she is always identified with her "presence at once seductive and discreet".[141]
Seydoux is seen as a "director's actress", whose performance closely follows the direction adopted by the film's director to adapt to the chosen style.[142]This approach explains the fact that a large part of her filmography is made up of collaborations with the same people:Wes Anderson(four),Bertrand Bonello(three),Rebecca Zlotowski(two),Ildikó Enyedi(two),Benoît Jacquot(two),Arnaud Desplechin(two). Several directors design or write their films with Seydoux in mind, such asAnderson,DesplechinorMia Hansen-Løve.[143]She compares her philosophy to a statement byIsabelle Huppert, in which the actress said that she made her own film within each film she made,[144]and considers the actor as co-author of the film in the same way as the director.[145][146]The actress does not rely entirely on her instinct, as she continually searches for the character of her character,[147]demanding additional takes to move from one mood to another,[148]and is completely invested in satisfying the director's vision.[149][150]Ursula Meier, who won the Silver Bear in Berlin as a director inSister, said that "she has a grace, something unique. You can project whatever you want onto her, as a spectator or as a director. That's why she is so desired".[151]
Acting style
Seydoux is praised by her versatility and her bold choices as an actor. Yasmin Omar fromCurzonwrote in 2024: "You never know what you're going to get when you sit down to watch a Léa Seydoux film. She could be a tattoo-sleeved pothead, a sexually reawakened widow or a gun-toting assassin. She could be a misbehaving nun, a mentally unstable news anchor or a disfigured performance artist".[152]
"When I act, I enter a trance state. I don't know if it's a state of absolute self-forgetfulness or total self-awareness. It's very violent, sometimes it overwhelms me. I'm excessive in the way I feel the world."
The New York Timesplaces Seydoux in a line of actresses that includesJeanne MoreauandPaulette Goddard.[154]For the Swiss dailyLe Temps,the actress, "at ease in blockbusters and art films, with her undeniably feline beauty, a little lunar, even stubborn, and the veil of melancholy tempering the disapproval of her gaze, is as beautiful as a prey as a predator, as common as an aristocrat".[155]The Village Voicesees her as "always captivating", hiding layer after layer of vulnerability.[156]Physically,Libérationdetects in her "pale similarities toAnna Karina";[157]forTélérama, her complexion and her blondness evoke the young women in the paintings ofRenoirorBotticelli.[158]Her easily recognizable smile, with a space between the two central incisors, also reminded several newspapers of the appearance and presence ofBrigitte Bardot.[159][160][161]
Thierry Frémaux, general delegate of theCannes Film Festival, where Seydoux was one of the most frequent guests in the 2010s, states that she "owes nothing to a recognized lineage, she came out of nowhere and remains unpredictable, inventing herself, according to her wishes, the multiple requests of which she is the subject: from pure French auteur cinema to American blockbusters. Léa isBrigitte Bardot, plusJuliette Binoche, plusKate Moss, and sometimes all three at the same time".[162]
Seydoux says she is a big admirer ofCatherine Deneuve, whose acting she considers "full of instinctive intelligence and self-mockery",[163]andIsabelle Huppert, for the same intelligence, culture and sensitivity.[164]In return,Deneuvesent her congratulations in 2022 for her role inThe Story of My Wife.[165]In interviews, Seydoux says she watches few films, and generally films that are not from contemporary cinema,[166]such as her favourite film,A Place in the SunbyGeorge Stevens.[167]She mentionsStanley Kubrick,Ingmar Bergman,Robert Bresson,Éric RohmerandPedro Almodóvaras her favourite directors.[168]
In the media
The most sought-after French actress of her generation, Léa Seydoux is often compared toMarion Cotillard, ten years her senior, with whom she shares a similar international career and critical success.[169]Téléramaalso unites them by acclaiming them in 2021 as the "two best [French] exports".[170]In the French cinema landscape, the actress emerges as a discreet star, absent from the tabloid press[171]and social media, and uncomfortable in interviews.[172][173]When campaigning for her films, the actress can be disarming with her spontaneity and her tendency to go beyond promotional conventions, for example by talking about a film other than the one she is supposed to discuss with a journalist or expressing surprise at the marketing resources made available to promote a film.[174][175]
During the 2010s, the actress's career became almost inseparable from the prestigiousCannes Film Festival: the business magazinesLe Figaro,The Hollywood ReporterandDeadlinenoted that she had become one of its biggest regulars, presenting at least one film in competition almost every year, which often won one of the prizes at stake,[176]when she herself was not a member of the jury; appearing in four films selected for the festival in 2021 would also constitute a record of 18.[177]In 2021,Deadlinenoted that since Seydoux's first invitation to the festival, she had achieved the status of "one of France's most beloved exports".[178]The international news agencyAssociated Pressechoes many media in summarizing in 2022 that Léa Seydoux, who has become one of the most famous faces of European cinema and a notable actress in each of her forays into Hollywood, "reigns at Cannes".[179]
Seydoux's godfather is footwear designer,Christian Louboutin.[180]

Isaac Liev Schreiber was born on October 4, 1967, inSan Francisco,California,[1]the son of Heather Milgram,[2]a painter, and Tell Schreiber, an actor and carpenter.[3][4]His father wasProtestantand his mother isJewish.[5][6][7]His maternal grandfather, Alex Milgram, emigrated fromUkraine. Milgram, who was the most significant male in Schreiber's youth, played thecelloand ownedPierre-Auguste Renoiretchings, and made his living by delivering meat to restaurants.[8][9][10][11]His mother, who is an aficionada ofclassical musicandRussian literature, has said that she named Live after her favorite Russian author,Leo Tolstoy, while his father has stated that Schreiber was named after the doctor who saved his mother's life. His family nickname, adopted when Schreiber was a baby, is "Huggy".[12][8]
When Schreiber was one year old, his family moved to theunincorporated rural communityofWinlaw, in the southern interior ofBritish Columbia.[13]Over the next four years, his mother was hospitalized on several occasions and underwent therapy related to a bad experience onLSDthat she had near the beginning of her marriage (in San Francisco), according to Schreiber's father.[8]After Schreiber's father threatened to have Schreiber's mother admitted to amental institution, Schreiber was kidnapped by his mother, eventually leading to his mother gaining full custody of him.[14]Theysquattedon theLower East Sidein New York City.[15]
Schreiber has described his mother as a "far-outSocialist Labor Partyhippiebohemianfreakwho hung out withWilliam Burroughs".[8][16][17]She was "a highly cultured eccentric" who earned a living by splitting her time between driving a cab and creatingpapier-mâchépuppets." In 1983, his mother bought him amotorcycleon his 16th birthday to "promote fearlessness."[8]The criticJohn Lahrwrote in a 1999New Yorkerprofile that, "To a large extent, Schreiber's professional shape-shifting and his uncanny instinct for isolating the frightened, frail, goofy parts of his characters are a result of being forced to adapt to his mother's eccentricities. It's both his grief and his gift."[8]
Her bohemian proclivities led to actions such as making Schreiber take the Hindu name Shiva Das, wear yoga shirts, consume a vegetarian diet, and briefly attendSatchidanandaAshraminPomfret, Connecticut, when he was 12.[18]Schreiber's mother also forbade her son from seeing color films. As a result, his favorite actors wereCharlie Chaplin, Andrew Cartwright, andBasil Rathbone.

"I really made a conscious effort to mix it up, not because in itself it's not the job of an actor to do all different things, but for me that's what I'm interested in. You've got to be careful because you've got to work with what you have, not just for vanity's sake, but I think the best part of being an actor sometimes is the opportunity to transform yourself superficially, and deeply."
In 1997, Dafoe returned to playing a villainous role in the action thrillerSpeed 2: Cruise Control, expressing the necessity of appearing in both independent andblockbusterfilms.[55]The film starredSandra BullockandJason Patricas a couple vacationing on a luxury cruise that has been hijacked by Dafoe's character, Geiger, a hacker that has programmed the ship to crash into an oil tanker.Speed 2was met with negative reviews from critics,[56]with Dafoe himself receiving aRazzie Awardnomination forWorst Supporting Actor.[57]For his next film,Affliction(1997), Dafoe worked with Paul Schrader for a second time, playing the brother ofNick Nolte's character and served as the film's narrator.[58]Also in 1997, Dafoe took on a voice acting role in an episode of the animated sitcomThe Simpsonstitled "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", voicing the commandant of a military academy thatBartandLisa Simpsonare attending.[59]Following a villainous supporting role in the romantic mystery dramaLulu on the Bridge,[60]Dafoe starred alongsideChristopher WalkenandAsia ArgentoinAbel Ferrara'scyberpunkdramaNew Rose Hotelin 1998.

Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression".[78]Steven Scaife atVicewrote that Dafoe's Goblin "represents everything that's fun about superhero villains, as well as everything that's great about Raimi's campy films", also commending Dafoe's voice and body language, which helped overcome the bulky Green Goblin costume that he compared to that of aPower Rangersvillain.[79]

Huston was born on July 8, 1951, at 6:29 p.m., in theCedars of Lebanon Hospital, in Los Angeles,[3]to director and actorJohn Hustonandprima ballerinaand modelEnrica Soma.[4]According to Huston, "the news of my arrival was cabled promptly to the post office in the township ofButiaba, in WesternUganda[and two] days later, a barefoot runner bearing a telegram finally arrived atMurchison Falls", where her father was filmingThe African Queen(1951).[3]Huston's paternal grandfather was Canadian-born actorWalter Huston. Huston has Scottish, Irish, English and Welsh ancestry from her father, and Italian from her mother.[5]
When Huston was 2 years old, her family relocated to Ireland, where she spent much of her childhood and which she still considers home.[6]Her parents rented what Huston called the "Courtown House" — a tall stone Victorian manor inCounty Kildare— for three years, before John Huston bought St. Clerans, a 110-acre estate inCounty Galway, in 1954.[3]She attended school atKylemore Abbey,[7]and later attendedHolland Park Schoolafter relocating to England.[8]
Huston has a complex family because of her parents' multiple marriages and extramarital affairs. She has an older brother, Tony, and an adopted older brother, Pablo. She has a younger maternal half-sister namedAllegra, whom she called "Legs", and a younger paternal half-brother, actorDanny Huston. She is the aunt of actorJack Huston.[9]She once described herself as a "lonely child", explaining: "My brother Tony and I were never very close, neither as children nor as adults, but I was tightly bound to him. We were forced to be together because we were really quite alone. We were in the middle of the Irish countryside ... and we didn't see many other kids. We were tutored. Our father was mostly away [for filming]".[3]
Her father's filmA Walk with Love and Death(1969), where Huston played the 16-year-old French noblewoman Claudia oppositeAssi Dayan, marked her screen debut. She had been in the running to play Juliet in directorFranco Zeffirelli's adaptation ofRomeo and Juliet(1968), but Huston withdrew herself from consideration when her father decided to cast her as Claudia inA Walk With Love and Death. Huston felt that she was wrong for the role as Claudia, and has commented on the experience that her father "miscast me first time out and I think he realized that. I was ready to act, but I wasn't ready to act for him ... I was difficult, I didn't want to act with no makeup, although I'd have done it for Franco."[10]Father and daughter had a fractious relationship on set, with the young Anjelica having difficulty learning her lines and focusing, while her father grew more impatient and angry at directing her.[11]Critics derided her performance.
Huston and her mother were photographed by Arnaud De Rosnay —whom she met at age 16 inSwitzerland— in October 1968 forVogue.[12]Shortly afterwards, her mother died in a car accident, and the young Huston relocated to New York City as she "sort of fled London because of the memories; I didn't really know what to do with myself, and I wasn't quite sure what my father's intentions were for me —whether he was going to put me in a convent or launch me as an actress. Well, he'd already tried to do that, and we'd had a hard time on the making of that first film we did together".[12][13]Inspired by modelsJean ShrimptonandTwiggy, Huston decided to pursue modelling, and through photographerRichard Avedon, a friend of her parents, she metDiana Vreelandwho proposed to Huston her first AmericanVoguephotoshoot, which took place in Ireland.[12]She described it as "very innovative because they presaged the whole sort ofGypsylook".[12]

Along withPat Cleveland,Pat Ast,Elsa Peretti,Karen BjornsonandAlva Chinn, she became one of fashion designerHalston's favored troupe of models, nicknamed the Halstonettes.[15][16]
After breaking up with Richardson, Huston met actorJack Nicholsonand moved toCalifornia, to focus on acting.[12]While she "didn't do much there for three years", she filmed a small role inThe Last Tycoon(1976), based onF. Scott Fitzgerald'snovel of the same name.Bob Rafelson's remakeThe Postman Always Rings Twice(1981), based on thenovelbyJames M. Cain, featured Huston as the fling of a Depression-era drifter, played by Nicholson. She briefly appeared in the dramaFrances(1982) and the mockumentaryThis Is Spinal Tap(1984) before obtaining a larger role in the science fiction filmThe Ice Pirates(1984).
Her father cast Huston as Maerose, the daughter of a New York Mafia clan head whose love is scorned by a hit man, in the film adaptationPrizzi's Honor(1985), which also starred Nicholson. She was paid theSAG-AFTRAscale rate of US$14,000 for her role. When her agent called up the movie's producer to request if she could be paid more, she was told "Go to hell. Be my guest — ask for more money. We don't even want her in this movie." Huston, who was not only John Huston's daughter but also Jack Nicholson's girlfriend at the time, wrote in her 2014 memoirWatch Methat she later overheard a production worker saying: "Her father is the director, her boyfriend's the star, and she has no talent."[17]Nevertheless, Huston garnered positive notices for her performance.The New York Timesdescribed her part as a "wonderful character, far darker and more complex than is indicated by her self-deprecating wisecracks (I'm a family scandal. I got a reputation to keep up). She's a riveting presence and if Miss Huston, the daughter of the director, doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this performance, I'll be very surprised."[18]Indeed, she won theAcademy AwardforBest Supporting Actress, making her the third generation of her family to win an Oscar.
Huston starred oppositeMichael Jacksonin the 17-minute US$30 million3D filmCaptain EO, written byGeorge Lucasand directed byFrancis Ford Coppola, which ran from 1986 atDisneylandandEpcot, and later atTokyo DisneylandandEuro Disneyland.[19]Coppola next cast her as the girlfriend of an army platoon sergeant inGardens of Stone(1987), a film that dealt with the effect of theVietnam Waron the United States homefront.[20]Film criticRoger Ebertpraised her onscreen chemistry with co-starJames Caan, remarking that "the romance between Caan and Huston is one of the great adult love stories in recent movies".[21]
Huston starred in her father's last film, 1987'sThe Dead, as the wife of an academic. According to her, her father remained a filmmaking virtuoso despite his ill health: "He was so sick, but he could literally do it with his eyes closed. He knew when we were going to get a take way long before the camera rolled. I mean the timing was so precise that he could tell everything, exactly how it was going to go."[10]The pressures of filming and watching her father's health deteriorate had an adverse effect on Anjelica Huston's own health, developingEpstein-Barrsyndrome during production.[10]John  died nearly four months before the film's release date, upon which it received two nominations at the60th Academy Awards. For her performance, she won asBest Supporting Femaleat the3rd Independent Spirit Awards.
In 1988, Huston played the love interest of an engaging, multi-talented, middle-classYale Universitygraduate inMr. North, which was more of a family project, directed by half-brotherDanny Huston, and made a cameo appearance in the film adaptationA Handful of Dust. Despite her limited screen time,Vincent CanbyofThe New York Timespraised her portrayal in the latter as the "single most stunning performance" but called the film "both too literal and devoid of real point."[22]
Huston earned aBAFTAnomination forBest Supporting Actressfor her portrayal of a flight attendant having an affair with a respected family guy inWoody Allen's dramedyCrimes and Misdemeanors(1989). The dramaEnemies, A Love Story, also released in 1989, featured her as the long-vanished wife of aHolocaustsurvivor. In a positive review for the film, Roger Ebert asserted: "Parts, especially the scenes with Huston, are heartwarming in a strange way, because they show one human being accepting the weaknesses of another".[23]For her role, she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.
InThe Witches(1990), based on the 1983book of the same namebyRoald Dahl, Huston starred as theGrand High Witch, the all-powerful leader of the world's witches. She and the costume designerMarit Allenoriginally brought a different dress for the role, but the directorNicolas Roegrejected it as "not sexy". Huston recalled: "That was the first time I'd imagined that this horrible creature in a children's movie should have sex appeal. It simply had not occurred to me. But of course, Nic was absolutely right. His vision was diabolical and dark and brilliantly funny. If a witch was to be at the center of this plot, she needed to be sexy to hold the eye."[24]The character's monstrous version was prepared byJim Henson's Creature Shopand "took over six hours to apply and almost as much time to remove at the end of the day."[24]Despite a lackluster box office response, the film was applauded by critics and has obtained acult followingover the years; it has also remained one of Huston's favorite roles.[25]
Huston next portrayed a veteran con artist in theneo-noirthrillerThe Grifters(also 1990). DirectorStephen Frearsfirst contacted her about playing Lilly in 1989 while she was filmingCrimes and Misdemeanors, but after reading the script, she was unsure.[26]Although she was "transfixed" by the story and the character, the script alarmed her with its explicitness.[27]A few months later, Frears contacted Huston again to see if she was still interested.[26]Still wavering, Huston's talent agentSue Mengerstold her bluntly "Anjelica, if Stephen Frears tells you he wants you to shit in the corner, then that's what you must do." The next day Huston auditioned for the role in front of Frears at theChateau Marmont. Frears' initial reluctance to cast Huston because she looked too much like "a lady", was resolved with the decision to cheapen her look with a bleached blond wig and "vulgar clothes". To research her part, she studied women dealers at card parlors in Los Angeles County, California.[26]Her performance earned her a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Actress.
Huston obtained the part ofMorticia Addams, the stern, aloof matriarch of the titular family, inThe Addams Family(1991). She based aspects of her performance on her friendJerry Hallto give the character more warmth, and in her 2014 memoirWatch Me, she described the filming as "long and arduous".[28]It was decided that the character of Morticia should have eyes which slanted upwards at the sides, an effect which was achieved by attaching an elastic strap to the back of Huston's head via fabric tabs glued at her temples, which pulled the corners of her eyes upwards.[27]The bands caused extended discomfort to Huston, and would snap at the slightest turn of Huston's head, causing a grueling repair time. Eventually, she learned to pivot and turn on her feet without moving her upper body or head.[27]The Addams Familywas a commercial success, grossing over US$191 million worldwide,[29]and prompted a sequel,Addams Family Values(1993). For both installments, Huston garneredGolden Globe Awardnominations for Best Actress –Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.[30]
Following a small role in the satireThe Player(1992), Huston reunited with Woody Allen onManhattan Murder Mystery, in which she played the friend of a married couple investigating the death of their neighbor's wife, and also portrayed a mother struggling to parent her autistic child, in the ABC miniseriesFamily Pictures. She received aBAFTAnomination for Best Supporting Actress forManhattan Murder Mystery, and a nomination forBest Actress – Miniseries or Television Filmat the51stGolden Globe AwardsforFamily Pictures. In 1995, Huston portrayed a Cuban refuge attempting to stay in America in the comedyThe Perez Familyand the former wife of a tormented man (played byJack Nicholson) inSean Penn's sophomore directorial effort, the dramaThe Crossing Guard. Her performance in the latter was praised,[31]and she received nominations for Best Supporting Actress from theHollywood Foreign Pressand theScreen Actors Guild. Based on the1990 novel of the same name,[32]theCBSminiseriesBuffalo Girls—in which she starred as frontierswomanCalamity Jane, oppositeMelanie GriffithandReba McEntire— earned Huston anEmmy Awardnomination forOutstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie.
After contemplating the idea of following in her father's footsteps, Huston started to put out "discreet feelers" and pursue material in Hollywood she felt attracted to direct. The studios' overall response was "swift and positive, with the usual blinders", according to Huston. "What they offered me had invariably something to do with my father. I didn't want to do a sequel toPrizzi's Honor.Prizzibelongs to him. I wanted to do something that, succeed or fail, would be my own."[33]She found it in the dramaBastard Out of Carolina, based on anovelbyDorothy Allison, about an impoverished girl who endures physical and sexual abuse. It was screened in theUn Certain Regardsection at the1996 Cannes Film Festival,[34]and debuted as a television film onShowtime. She was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award forOutstanding Directing for a Miniseries or a Special.
InEver After: A Cinderella Story(1998), a modern,post-feministinterpretation of the Cinderella story[35]alongsideDrew BarrymoreandMelanie Lynskey, Huston appeared as Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent, the new wife of Auguste de Barbarac, a wealthy widower. The film was acclaimed by critics and made a respectable US$98 million globally.[36]Lisa Schwarzbaum fromEntertainment Weeklypraised her performance as a cruel stepmother: "Huston does a lot of eye narrowing and eyebrow raising while toddling around in an extraordinary selection of extreme headgear, accompanied by her two less-than-self-actualized daughters—the snooty, social-climbing, nasty Marguerite, and the dim, lumpy, secretly nice Jacqueline. "Nothing is final until you're dead", Mama instructs her girls at the dinner table, "and even then I'm sure God negotiates."
In 1998, Huston played a woman romantically involved with a compulsive gambler in the neo-noirPhoenix,[37]withRay Liotta, as well as the mother of a troubled man inVincent Gallo's independent dramedyBuffalo '66, which starred Gallo as her son and reunited her withChristina Ricci. The director had difficulties working with his cast and crew, and reportedly did not get along with Huston on set. He claimed she caused the film to be turned down by theCannes Film Festival.[38]
Her next directorial effort, the Irish dramedyAgnes Browne(1999) —in which she also starred as the title character— was released to mixed reviews.The New York Timesreviewer Stephen Holden found it "nothing more than a series of homey skits loosely woven into a portrait of aworking-classsaint."[39]Nevertheless, the film won the Youth Jury Award at the 1999San Sebastián International Film Festivaland received a Grand Prix nomination at the Ghent International Film Festival the same year.[citation needed]Huston appeared as an affluent English woman, alongsideJames Fox,Nick Nolte,Kate Beckinsale, andUma Thurman, inJames Ivory's period dramaThe Golden Bowl(2000), based on the 1904novel of the same namebyHenry James.[40]
InThe Royal Tenenbaums(2001), her first collaboration with directorWes Anderson, Huston took on the role the soft-spoken matriarch of an estranged family of former child prodigies, alongsideGene Hackman,Gwyneth Paltrow,Ben StillerandLuke Wilson. During production, Anderson gave Huston photographs of his mother who, like Etheline, was an archaeologist. Huston said, "Wes would send pictures of his mother in aviator jackets or on archaeological digs, and he very specifically wanted me to wear a certain locket. Finally, I asked him, 'Wes, am I playing your mother?'" Anderson replied this was not the case. Anderson and Huston had a tense relationship with Hackman, who was not always amiable on set.[41]On the first day Hackman and Huston appeared in a scene together, Huston had to slap him, and later said the slap was real and "I hit him a really good one. I saw the imprint of my hand on his cheek and I thought, he's going to kill me."[41]During young Margot's birthday scene in the opening scenes, Huston's hair caught fire from a birthday candle. Anderson creditedKumar Pallanawith extinguishing the blaze before Huston was seriously injured.[41]A positive critical response greetedThe Royal Tenenbaums, which made US$71.4 million worldwide.[42]
In 2001, Huston starred as Viviane,Lady of the Lake, in the TNT miniseriesThe Mists of Avalon, based on the 1983novel of the same titlebyMarion Zimmer Bradley. The production was watched by more than 30 million "unduplicated viewers" during its premiere, making it the highest-rated original movie of the summer on basic cable, and earned Huston nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and aScreen Actors Guild Award. In 2002, she portrayed the doctor of an ex-FBIagent (Clint Eastwood) chasing a sadistic killer (Jeff Daniels) in the thrillerBlood Work, loosely based on the 1998novel of the same namebyMichael Connelly,[43]as well as the longtime client of a man who runs an exclusiveescort serviceinGeorge Hickenlooper's black comedyThe Man from Elysian Fields, withAndy GarciaandMick Jagger. Despite both films' lukewarm critical and commercial responses, Todd McCarthy ofVarietyfelt that her character inElysian Fieldswas "played with invigorating relish" by the actress,[44]while Roger Ebert hailed the film as "one of the best films" of the year.[45]
Daddy Day Care(2003), co-starringEddie Murphy, featured Huston as the ruthless head of an expensive and over-academic preschool.Slant, in a critical review of the film, noted that Huston "brings embarrassing conviction to the role of stuffy day care proprietress ...Daddy Day Careseems to exist solely to sedate a theater-going public's offspring. And while the film's sense of sobriety should do the job, don't expectThe Witches".[46]Nevertheless, the release was a commercial success, grossing over US$160 million worldwide.[47]
In 2004, Huston took on the role ofwomen's suffrageleaderCarrie Chapman Cattin the HBO filmIron Jawed Angels, withHilary Swank,Frances O'ConnorandJulia Ormond. For her role, she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination forOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie, and won theGolden Globeand theSatellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film. InThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou(2004), her second film with Wes Anderson, Huston portrayed the estranged wife of an eccentric oceanographer. Roger Ebert observed that the actress "seems privately amused, which is so much more intriguing than seeming publicly amused", but noted that he "can't recommend [the film], but I would not for one second discourage you from seeing it".[48]As a member of the cast, she garnered nominations for Best Ensemble from theBoston Society of Film Criticsand theCritics' Choice Movie Awards.
Huston filmed her third directorial effort, theHallmark ChanneldramaRiding the Bus with My Sister(2005), inHamilton, Ontario, Canada.[49]It was adapted from the 2002memoirbyRachel Simon, and starredRosie O'DonnellandAndie MacDowell. Unlike the book, the film received negative reviews from critics, who generally criticised the film's "egregious" portrayal ofDown's Syndrome.[50]However, she said: "I think the movie comes from a pretty direct point of view".[51]
In 2006, Huston was featured as an art teacher in the dramedyArt School Confidential, thepresident of the United Statesin the made-for-CBS thrillerCovert One: The Hades Factor, a competing business owner in the comedyMaterial Girls, a vanishing con artist in therevisionist WesternSeraphim Falls, and an ebullient patroness in the romantic dramaThese Foolish Things. ExcludingSeraphim Falls, none of the aforementioned films performed well with critics nor audiences.[52]This changed with her third Wes Anderson film,The Darjeeling Limited(2007), in which Huston starred as the mother of three brothers who becomes a nun and moves to aChristian conventin theHimalayas.Peter Travers, forRolling Stonefound her to be a "dynamite" in the film, which he deemed "the fullest blossoming yet of Anderson's talents as a total filmmaker".[53]
Choke(2008), a black comedy directed byClark Greggand based on the 2001novel of the same namebyChuck Palahniuk, featured Huston as the hospitalized mother of a sex addict inColonial America. Reviews for the film were mixed, butEmpirecritic Philip Wilding wrote: "Huston is magnetic as [the] ailing mother Ida, both as a fading invalid or vibrant and deranged in flashback. She is the hook on which her son hangs his hopes and anxieties". Meanwhile, Roger Ebert felt that her role "resembled the criminal character" she played inThe Grifters(1990).[54]In 2008, Huston also voiced Queen Clarion inTinker Bell, which was released on DVD to outstanding commercial results.[55]She reprised the role infour sequels,a television specialand a short film, all released between 2009 and 2015.[56]
Huston took on significant roles in three 2011 live-action films. The first was that ofMiss Battle-Axe, a strict, sadistic schoolteacher who talks with a Scottish accent, in the 3D children's musical adventure comedyHorrid Henry: The Movie, directed byNick Moore. She found her character to be "irresistible", explaining toThe Guardian: "It's very British material to me, and I've always been strangely attracted to these extreme characters".[57]The film was panned by critics but was a commercial success in the UK.[58]Her second performance of 2011 was that of a mother of a man with a malignant cancerous tumor in the drama50/50, directed byJonathan Levineand co-starringJoseph Gordon-LevittandSeth Rogen. The film was a critical and commercial darling upon its release.[59]David Schmader, writing in theStranger, praised the "stellar" cast and felt that Huston "roars back to prominence with a twisty performance as Adam's barely contained mess of a mom".[60]The unsuccessfulThe Big Year, Huston's last live-action film of 2011, featured her as an "avid birder", who "captains ocean-going expeditions".[61]
Huston starred in theNBCtelevision seriesSmash(2012–2013), as Broadway producer Eileen Rand.[62]After her husband's death in 2008, Huston creditedSmash—her first regular venture into series television— with coming at a "vital time" and finally filling a void in her life.[63]The series aired for two seasons and was the subject of critical acclaim.[64]Huston subsequently appeared in the second and third seasons of theAmazon VideoseriesTransparent, as Vic, a cisgender woman who forms a connection with Maura, a retired college professor of political science atUCLA.

John DeFore ofThe Hollywood Reporterpraised the latter film, on which Huston was an executive producer, writing that "the cast goes a long way here, turningTroubleat times into the kind of small-town hangout film that will please fest auds."[65]Huston played the Director, a heavily bejeweled Russian ballet instructor, and whatVulturedescribed as a "small but memorable role", inJohn Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum(2019),[10]which made US$326 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics.[66]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
