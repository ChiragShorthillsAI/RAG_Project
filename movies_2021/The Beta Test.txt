In Los Angeles, California, a distressed Swedish woman calls 911 to report a domestic dispute. She then confesses to her wealthy husband that she recently received a purple invitation to an anonymous sexual encounter. She says that she accepted the offer and realized she's not happy in her marriage; she wants to leave him and asks for only $5,000 instead of half of his money. The husband stabs her repeatedly and throws her off a balcony.
After this prologue, Jordan Hines is introduced: a smooth-talking, hard-driving Hollywood agent with an ulcer who is five years sober and under constant stress at work. Although six weeks away from marrying his fiancée, Caroline Gaines, he constantly finds himself distracted by attractive women. He receives a purple envelope with an anonymous invitation to a no-strings-attached encounter at a hotel and a form to fill out about his sexual interests. He discards the letter but later retrieves it from a dumpster and fills out the invitation. After meeting with a potential, high-profile Chinese client named Raymond, who berates him for his agency's practices being obsolete and phony, Jordan receives a second purple envelope with a hotel room keycard. He goes to the hotel room, puts on a blindfold, and has fabulous sex with an anonymous woman who is also blindfolded.
Jordan obsessively investigates the source of the anonymous invitation and the identity of the woman. Raymond has also accepted a similar invitation with another man, but his wife shoots and kills him, and the wife of the man he slept with later poisons him and herself. Jordan tracks down the man delivering the anonymous invitations, whose bag is filled with purple envelopes. Jordan investigates one of the addresses and finds the addressee is dead. Jordan's friend PJ theorizes that someone with access to people's social media data, such as recent engagements, websites visited, and liked photos, could then have found the addresses of wealthy people who fit certain demographics and sent them letters to connect them for anonymous sex. He suggests it would be inexpensive to set up and potentially very lucrative.
Jordan and Caroline, having drifted apart as his secret becomes an obsession and his behavior becomes obnoxious, go to a cabin for a weekend to reconnect. However, he continues to rejects her suggestions that there is something wrong with him. That night, she leads him into passionate sex.
Jordan and Caroline stop at a coffee shop, where he recognizes the woman he slept with. She seems to recognize him at first but claims not to under an onslaught of embarrassing questions. The encounter disturbs Caroline, who drives away without Jordan.
Impersonating a federal agent, Jordan interviews the people who printed the purple envelopes. He tracks down and uses a hammer to attack the man behind the letters, who calls himself Johnny Paypal. Johnny confesses to sending them, based on addresses from the2014 Sony Pictures hackand further social media scrubbing, to match people with their perfect sexual partners. Johnny realizes that Jordan never received a third letter, which asked for a $5,000 wire transfer in exchange for the identity of the woman he had sex with. He mocks the now-shaken Jordan for being a nobody, initiates a computer program to send out hundreds of thousands of new letters that will generate hundreds of millions of dollars, and insists he will never reveal Jordan's perfect match. Unnerved, Jordan flees.
In their garage, Caroline catches Jordan preparing to burn the evidence of his hotel encounter. He breaks down and confesses, not only to infidelity, but also drinking, smoking, committing crimes, living a lie, and being a fraud. He accepts that Caroline is going to kill him with the scissors she's holding, but she forgives him, as she also received the anonymous letters.
Jordan and Caroline escape together and drive toward the Mexico border. At a diner, she tells him that other people are going to do everything they can to trip the two of them up, but that they can't let those people win. She then reads news that eight more people have been killed. Before they leave, their attractive waitress writes her name and number on the bill she hands to Jordan.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
