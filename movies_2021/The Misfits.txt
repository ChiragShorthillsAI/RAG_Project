It was released in South Korea on June 3, 2021, and was released in the United States on June 11, 2021, by The Avenue Entertainment. The film was abox-office bomband received negative reviews, receiving three nominations at the42nd Golden Raspberry Awards.
Richard Pace is a professional thief, and prison escapee. Schultz, owner of several private prisons (three of which Pace has escaped from), learns he is about to be released, but Pace escapes the day before Schultz's visit.
Pace stayed in the prison to learn about the wealthy 'The Prince', who is currently inLA. When he tries to steal the Prince's valuable watch collection, he suddenly realizes it is a trap set by The Prince. Forced to choose between Schultz and the FBI, Pace chooses the former, who takes him to his private plane. There, he meets three others: Ringo - a locksmith and master of disguise, Wick - an explosives expert, and Violet - a deadly martial artist--The Misfits.
En route to Abu Dhabi, the Misfits are briefed: Schultz laundered money taken from a Brotherhood, converting it into gold. He is hiding it in one of his prison's safes, located in 'Jazeristan'. They plan to steal it to block its use for terrorism, but they need Pace's help. Initially refusing, his daughter Hope changes his mind. Pace wants to keep 50% of the gold they steal, but is told noone is keeping it.
Preparing the Jazeristan prison infiltration, the Misfits learn the Brotherhood's leader Abu Hirawa sent his right-hand man Jason Quick to collect gold bars from Schultz. However, they swap the case. Enraged, Hirawa kills Quick, then warns Schultz he is coming to get the gold bars from him directly in Jagerstan, on the day of the heist.
Once in Jazeristan, Ringo disguises himself and convinces the warden to replace the kitchen ovens. On the day this happens, Pace and Wick switch places with The Prince's contacts, disguising themselves as prisoners. While moving the ovens, Pace damages a statue honoring Schultz.
The next day, they taint the prisoners' food, causing major vomiting and diarrhea in most, so multiple prisoners are relocated to a nearby hospital via ambulances. Suspicious, Schultz fears Pace is in Jazeristan to steal his gold, so orders a search.
Meanwhile, Ringo comes to the prison disguised as the owner of a sanitation company, sending in people in with hazmat suits. Pace and Wick enter the prisoners’ bathroom directly above the safe, as if to clean it, while Hope parks a car outside. Wick drills through the safe, fills it with gas then lights it, blowing open its door. Simultaneously, Hope’s car explodes to distract the guards.
Afterwards, Pace and Wick remove the gold from the safe room. Just before, Wick photographs it with his phone, attaching it to a security camera inside. Meanwhile Schultz, realizing the car explosion was a diversion, checks the safe’s camera. At first, they only see Wick’s photo, but when Schultz cannot zoom in, they discover the deception.
Finding the gold is gone, Schultz puts the prison in lockdown. A gurney moves past him, dropping a gold bar. Believing that Pace has used the gurneys and ambulances to move the gold, he orders his men to check them. However, they find nothing.
At the prison, when an unfamiliar sanitation truck passes, Schultz and his men follow it through the desert. It stops in front of The Prince's military plane. He opens the trunk, but finds it empty. Then The Prince, Ringo, and two masked others exit the truck. 
The livid Schultz is calmed when he believes his men have Hope. He gives the kill order, then hangs up. However, Hope removes her mask, and introduces herself. Schultz’s men had actually tied up Violet, who defeats them and leaves.
When the angry Schultz pulls a gun, the Prince’s military aim at him and escort him to Hirawa's car. Although understanding Schultz is not at fault, Hirawa tells him justice must be delivered.
A mold was made of Schultz’s statue, so Ringo, Wick, and two of the Prince’s men already in the prison, melted down the gold, creating a gold statue. After painting it, Ringo then removes the statue for repairs from the prison.
After reuniting in Abu Dhabi, Hope and Pace officially join the Misfits, as a news report mentions a large donation given to charity, and that the price of gold is on the rise.
According to Harlin, he and Brosnan had "been looking for a project to collaborate on for some time".[3][4]
The project was first announced on February 12, 2019 at theBerlin International Film Festival'sEuropean Film Market. Filming locations includeAbu Dhabi,DubaiandLos Angeles.[5][6]Principal photography commenced a week later.[6]
The Misfitshad its world premiere in South Korea on June 3, 2021.[7]The Avenue Entertainment in association with Highland Film Group distributed the film on June 11, 2021.[8][9]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval score of 17% based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 3.70/10.[10]OnMetacritic, the film has a score of 25 out of 100 based on 11 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[11]
The film has been controversial in Qatar due to some real life negative references to Qatar to"terror" financingand explicit references to theMuslim Brotherhoodas "terrorists" withYusuf al-Qaradawias their mastermind.[13]The film is financed as well as co-produced by anEmiratiproduction company, and given the involvement of Emirati media in propagating this narrative against Qatar at least since thefirst Qatar diplomatic crisiscombined withDoha Newsreporting anti-Qatar plot elements in the film's content.[14]Initially announced as "Coming Soon" in the Qatari subsidiary ofDubai-headquarteredVox Cinemas, the one half of film exhibition duopoly in Qatar, with the other half beingNovo Cinemaswhich is also Dubai-headquartered but wholly owned indirectly byDoha-based Elan Group (through their ownership of its parentGulf Film, a regional film distributor across West Asia and North Africa dealing mostly in foreign films, including but not limited to Hollywood releases)[15]lending to this being the speculated factor behind them not picking this film up for exhibition not just in Qatar, but across all of the national markets they operated in, including UAE. As the backlash grew with leakedstillsfrom South Korean release leading credence to discord over anti-Qatar "propaganda" embedded in the film, Emirati-owned Vox Cinemas ultimately shelved the film's planned release in Qatar, with press release confirming the move by 1 July 2021, the previously announced release date.[16]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
