Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdainis a 2021 American documentary film directed and produced byMorgan Neville. The film had its world premiere at theTribeca Film Festivalon June 11, 2021, and was released in the United States on July 16, 2021, byFocus Features. The film grossed $5.5 million at the box office and received critical acclaim, but also garnered controversy over its use ofartificial intelligencetechnology to reproduce Bourdain's voice for some audio clips.
The film follows the life and career of chef, author, andtravel documentarianAnthony Bourdain,[2]who died by suicide on June 8, 2018, at the age of 61 while on location in France for his CNN showParts Unknown.[3]The documentary features interviews withDavid ChangandÉric Ripert, as well as members of the production crew fromParts Unknown.[4]The title alludes to "Roadrunner", a song byThe Modern Lovers, that appears in the film.
The documentary is a blend of archival footage and new interviews with Bourdain's friends, family, and coworkers. It covers Bourdain's rise from chef, to best selling author of the memoirKitchen Confidential, to a world famous television presenter of food and travel shows.
As Bourdain traveled the globe, he developed a greater awareness of the hardships many people face in war zones,disaster areas,developing countries, andleast developed countries. Director and producer Tom Vitale remembers the most difficult trip was to theDemocratic Republic of the Congoduring the first season ofAnthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown.
Bourdain is remembered by those who knew him as charismatic and hardworking, yet also prone to moodiness and obsessive behavior. His frequent travel for work led to the end of both his marriages, first to Nancy Putkoski and then Ottavia Busia. His career also kept him from being a regular presence in the life of his daughter, Ariane Busia-Bourdain.David Chang, a friend and fellow chef, recalls how Bourdain hid his dark side behind a happy façade. Chang believes Bourdain never fully addressed personal issues that led to a past heroin addiction. Friend, artist, and fellow addict,David Choe, theorizes that Bourdain replaced heroin with a work addiction.
After Bourdain's marriage to Busia ended, his mental health declined. He questioned what his life's direction should be, and joked more frequently about death. He began dating actressAsia Argento, and threw himself entirely into the relationship. His insistence that Argento be a guest director onParts Unknownalienated crew members, and he fired his long-time cinematographer Zach Zamboni. Busia recalls that Bourdain distanced himself from her and Ariane. Chang was especially hurt when Bourdain claimed Chang would never be a good father. When Argento revealed that she had been raped byHarvey Weinstein, Bourdain supported theMeToo movementnearly to the point of militancy.Parts Unknowndirector, Morgan Fallon, thinks Argento may have pulled away from the relationship due to Bourdain's intense personality.
While filming inAlsace, France, Bourdain was distraught over a tabloid story about Argento being seen with another man. Bourdain died by suicide after hanging himself in his hotel room. The public turned Les Halles, a restaurant where Bourdain formerly worked, into a shrine of notes and flowers. Bourdain's friends, family, and coworkers reflect on their personal reactions to his suicide and their lingering grief. Choe defaces amuralof Bourdain because he believes Bourdain would have loved the act of rebellion.
In October 2019, it was announcedMorgan Nevillewould direct and produce a documentary film aboutAnthony Bourdain, withFocus Featuresset to distribute, whileCNN FilmsandHBO Maxwould produce.[5]
The film had its world premiere at theTribeca Film Festivalon June 11, 2021.[6]It was released on July 16, 2021, byFocus Features, after which it will air onCNNandHBO Maxon an unspecified date. It is currently available to view on Apple TV andAmazon Prime's online video streaming services.[2]CNN aired the documentary on April 10, 2022.[7]
The film debuted to $1.9 million from 927 theaters, finishing eighth at the box office and marking the best opening for both an indie film and documentary of 2021.[8]In its second weekend the film was leading in the specialty box office with $873,000.[9]
Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critics' consensus reads, "An emotionally raw and respectful portrait of Anthony Bourdain,Roadrunnermarks another unflinchingly honest documentary from director Morgan Neville."[10]OnMetacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[11]Audiences surveyed byPostTrakgave the film a 94% positive score, with 61% saying they would definitely recommend it.[8]
Writing forVariety,Owen Gleibermandescribed the film as "an intimate and fascinating portrait of the beloved celebrity chef and television globe-trotter" and "a spiritual investigation into why [Bourdain's] life ended". He concluded: "Bourdain's death was a tragedy, butRoadrunnersuggests it was a tragedy with a touch of destiny."[12]Richard Roeper, writing for theChicago Sun-Times, gave the film a score of 3.5 stars out of 4 and said that the film is an "insightful and exhilarating and profound and sometimes deeply sad documentary".[13]
Daniel Fienberg, writing forThe Hollywood Reporter, described the film as being "an intensely painful documentary, one closer to the center of a raw, thoroughly unhealed, and yet very public, wound than I think I've ever seen before", concluding: "I'm much more comfortable withRoadrunneras a portrait of an evolving, complicated, tragic TV personality … than I am with it as an attempt to make sense of a man who, for whatever reason, no longer wanted to continue living."[14]
Writing forRogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico gave the film a score of 3.5 stars out of 4, saying that the film is "a fascinating, moving documentary that transcends mere profile piece to reclaim a legacy, and it's as inspirational as its subject" and that it "never feels like it's invading the privacy of a very public figure, revealing how much can be learned about the man and why he mattered largely through what he chose to show us, not through some sort of series of personal revelations", but added that "Neville ... does seem to step back during the darker final year of Bourdain's life." Tallerico concluded: "The best thing I can say about "Roadrunner" is that it has the same impact of Bourdain's best work. ... It may be a story about a tragic death but it is as life-affirming as anything I've seen this year."[15]
Writing forCollider, Matt Goldberg was more critical of the film, giving it a grade of C− and saying: "as the movie nears its conclusion, Neville makes the horrendous mistake of trying to "answer" Bourdain's suicide when there's no answer to be found, nor would finding an answer make any difference", adding that the film "no longer feels like an attempt to understand a complex individual, but rather an attempt from production company CNN Films to salvage a successful CNN show from a narrative it couldn't handle." He concluded: "There are some moments of insight, and it's nice to have his loved ones sing the praises of a man who was widely admired, but in its worst moments,Roadrunnerfeels like a network's spin for its valuable travel shows rather than an honest attempt to grapple with a difficult legacy."[16]
Upon the film's wide release, directorMorgan Nevillestated in an interview withNew YorkerwriterHelen Rosnerthat he had hired a software company to create anartificial intelligence(AI) model of Bourdain's voice so that the film could emulate him reciting words that he had written, but for which no recordings of him speaking exist, such as an email he had written to friendDavid Choe. Neville said there were two other such uses of the technology in the film, but refused to specify what they were, stating, "If you watch the film [...] you probably don't know what the other lines are that were spoken by the A.I., and you're not going to know. We can have a documentary-ethics panel about it later."[17]
The disclosure of the film's use of AI technology, which had not been mentioned prior to the interview or acknowledged within the film itself, caused controversy, with critics saying that it constituted unethical behavior.[18]Neville defended his decision, saying, "There were a few sentences that Tony wrote that he never spoke aloud. With the blessing of his estate and literary agent we used AI technology. It was a modern storytelling technique that I used in a few places where I thought it was important to make Tony's words come alive."[18]Ottavia Busia, Bourdain's ex-wife and executor of his estate, denied that she had been consulted about the use of AI to reproduce Bourdain's voice,tweeting: "I certainly was NOT the one who said Tony would have been cool with that."[18][19]
Filmmaker and journalistAdam Benzinedescribed Neville's remark about "hav[ing] a documentary-ethics panel about it later" as being "as much problematic as the use of the technology", and added: "But the fact that he discussed it as an ethical debate seems to suggest that he himself knew that he was in dicey territory. And I think that's why so many people in the doc industry have had a hostile reaction to this." Filmmaker Alan Barker, who has lectured on documentary ethics, described the issue of the film's use of AI as being indicative of greater ethical concerns in the documentary field, saying: "There is an unwritten social contract that documentaries are comprised of actualities not contrivances. The Bourdain case is especially bad because so much of the information in a voice recording is non-verbal. That Morgan apparently concealed the fakery until confronted by a reporter makes it far worse."[18]
David Leslie, ethics lead of theAlan Turing Institute, said that the issue showed the importance of disclosing the use of AI in a film to the audience to avoid the possibility of people feeling deceived, but added that the use of AI in documentaries should not be ruled out, saying: "In a world where the living could consent to using AI to reproduce their voices posthumously, and where people were made aware that such a technology was being used, up front and in advance, one could envision that this kind of application might serve useful documentary purposes".[20]
On July 17, Rosner revealed that Neville wrote to her that the idea to use AI "was part of [his] initial pitch of having Tony narrate the film posthumously á laSunset Boulevard— one of Tony's favorite films and one he had even reenacted himself onCook's Tour", adding: "I didn't mean to imply that Ottavia thought Tony would've liked it. All I know is that nobody ever expressed any reservations to me." Rosner also revealed that Busia had told her via email that she did recall Neville bringing up the idea of using AI, but didn't realize that it had been used. Busia wrote to Rosner: "I do believe Morgan thought he had everyone's blessing to go ahead. I took the decision to remove myself from the process early on because it was just too painful for me."[21][22]

Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Neville's films focus on culture, and especially on music. Speaking about his 2016 filmThe Music of Strangers, Neville said "The best thing about it for me as a filmmaker ... is that not only do I get to indulge my musical love, but that music is, to me, the most amazing Trojan horse to tell any other kind of story. The best music films are not about music ... Music is just the language we're speaking to tell a story about culture."[4]
Since finding success with his music-related documentaries, Neville has focused on other aspects of culture, such as politics and media. In a 2014 blog post on the International Documentary Association's website, Neville wrote that he is drawn to "how a smaller story can be a perfect window into conflicts within the human condition."[5]His 2015 filmBest of Enemiesexamines the televised debates between Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley and serves as a timely investigation into politics and media. His filmWon't You Be My Neighbor, about legendary television host Fred Rogers, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to rave reviews, and focuses on the power that kindness and understanding can have in a community, whether real or imagined.
Neville lives in Pasadena, California with his wife and two children.[citation needed]

Bourdain was a 1978 graduate ofthe Culinary Institute of Americaand a veteran of many professional kitchens during his career, which included several years spent as an executive chef atBrasserie Les Hallesin Manhattan. In the late 1990s Bourdain wrote an essay about the ugly secrets of a Manhattan restaurant, but he was having difficulty getting it published. According to theNew York Times, his mother Gladys—then an editor and writer at the paper—handed her son's essay to friend and fellow editor Esther B. Fein, the wife ofDavid Remnick, editor of the magazineThe New Yorker.[5][6][7]Remnick ran Bourdain's essay[8]in the magazine, kickstarting Bourdain's career and legitimizing the point-blank tone that would become his trademark.[6]The success of the article was followed just a year later by the publication of aNew York Timesbest-selling book,Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly(2000).
Bourdain became a media darling almost overnight. His first food and world-travel television showA Cook's Tourran for 35 episodes on theFood Networkin 2002 and 2003.

Anthony grew up living with both of his parents and described his childhood in one of his books: "I did not want for love or attention. My parents loved me. Neither of them drank to excess. Nobody beat me. God was never mentioned so I was annoyed by neither church nor any notion of sin or damnation."[12]His father wasCatholicofFrenchdescent and his mother wasJewish. Bourdain stated that, although he was considered Jewish byhalacha's definition, "I've never been in asynagogue. I don't believe in a higher power. But that doesn't make me any less Jewish, I don't think". His family was not religious.[13][14]
At the time of Bourdain's birth, Pierre was a salesman at a New York City camera store, as well as a floor manager at a record store. He later became an executive forColumbia Records,[15][16]and Gladys was a staff editor atThe New York Times.[17][18][19][20][21]

The series was produced byWilliam Grant & Sonsto promote theirBalvenie distillery's products.[74]
In September 2011,Ecco Pressannounced that Bourdain would have his own publishing line, Anthony Bourdain Books, which included acquiring between three and five titles per year that "reflect his remarkably eclectic tastes".[75]The first books that the imprint published, released in 2013, includeL.A. Son: My Life, My City, My FoodbyRoy Choi, Tien Nguyen, and Natasha Phan,[76]Prophets of Smoked Meatby Daniel Vaughn,Pain Don't HurtbyMark Miller,[77]andGrand Forks: A History of American Dining in 128 ReviewsbyMarilyn Hagerty.
In describing the line, he said, "This will be a line of books for people with strong voices who aregoodat something—who speak with authority. Discern nothing from this initial list—other than a general affection for people who cook food and like food. The ability to kick people in the head is just as compelling to us—as long as that's coupled with an ability to vividly describe the experience. We are just as intent on crossing genres as we are enthusiastic about our first three authors. It only gets weirder from here."[78]
Shortly after Bourdain's death, HarperCollins announced that the publishing line would be shut down after the remaining works under contract were published.[79][80]
Bourdain appeared as himself in the 2015 filmThe Big Short, in which he used seafood stew as an analogy for acollateralized debt obligation.[81]He also produced and starred inWasted! The Story of Food Waste.[82][83]
Drew Magary, in a column forGQpublished on the day of Bourdain's death, reflected that Bourdain was heir in spirit toHunter S. Thompson.[84]Smithsonianmagazinedeclared Bourdain "the original rock star" of the culinary world,[85]while his public persona was characterized byGothamistas "culinary bad boy".[86]Due to his liberal use of profanity and sexual references in his television showNo Reservations, the network added viewer-discretion advisories to each episode.[87]
Bourdain was known for consuming exotic local specialty dishes, having eaten black-coloredblood sausagescalledmustamakkara(lit. "black sausage") inFinland[88][89]and also "sheep testiclesin Morocco,ant eggsinPuebla, Mexico, a raw seal eyeball as part of a traditionalInuitseal hunt, and an entire cobra—beating heart, blood, bile, and meat—in Vietnam".[90]Bourdain was quoted as saying that aChicken McNuggetwas the most disgusting thing he ever ate,[91]but he was fond ofPopeyeschicken.[92]He also declared that the unwashedwarthogrectum he ate in Namibia[93]was "the worst meal of [his] life",[94]along with thefermented sharkhe ate in Iceland.[95][96]
Bourdain was noted for his put-downs ofcelebrity chefssuch asPaula Deen,Bobby Flay,[97]Guy Fieri,Sandra Lee,[97]andRachael Ray,[98][99]and appeared irritated by both the overt commercialism of the celebrity cooking industry and its lack of culinary authenticity. He voiced a "serious disdain for food demigods likeAlan Richman,Alice Waters, andAlain Ducasse".[100]Bourdain recognized the irony of his transformation into a celebrity chef and began to qualify his insults; in the 2007 New Orleans episode ofNo Reservations, he reconciled withEmeril Lagasse, whom he had previously disparaged inKitchen Confidential. He later wrote more favorably of Lagasse in the preface of the 2013 edition.[101]He was outspoken in his praise for chefs he admired, particularlyFerran Adrià,Juan Mari Arzak,Fergus Henderson,José Andrés,Thomas Keller,Martin Picard,Éric Ripert, andMarco Pierre White,[102]as well as his former protégé and colleagues at Brasserie Les Halles.[103]He spoke very highly ofJulia Child's influence on him.[104]
Bourdain was known for his sarcastic comments aboutveganandvegetarianactivists, considering their lifestyle "rude" to the inhabitants of many countries he visited. He considered vegetarianism, except in the case of religious exemptions, a "First World luxury".[105][unreliable source?]However, he also believed that Americans eat too much meat, and admired vegetarians and vegans who put aside their beliefs when visiting different cultures in order to be respectful of their hosts.[100]

He declared fond appreciation for their music, as well that of other early punk bands such asDead BoysandThe Voidoids.[106]He said that the playing of music byBilly Joel,Elton John, orGrateful Deadin his kitchen was grounds for firing.[106]Joel was a fan of Bourdain's, and visited the restaurant.[107]
OnNo ReservationsandParts Unknown, he dined with and interviewed many musicians, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, with a special focus on glam and various rockers such asAlice Cooper,David Johansen,Marky Ramone, andIggy Pop.[108][109]He featured contemporary bandQueens of the Stone AgeonNo Reservationsseveral times, and they composed and performed the theme song forParts Unknown.[110]
In the 1970s, while attending high school atDwight-Englewood School, Bourdain dated Nancy Putkoski. He described her as "a bad girl", older than he was and "part of a druggy crowd". She was a year above him, and Bourdain graduated one year early in order to follow Putkoski toVassar Collegesince they had just started admitting men. He studied there between the ages of 17 and 19. He then attended theCulinary Institute of America, a 15-minute drive from Vassar. The couple married in 1985, and remained together for two decades, divorcing in 2005.[111]
On April 20, 2007, he married Ottavia Busia, who later became amixed martial artist.[112][113][114]The couple's daughter, Ariane, was born in 2007.[113]Bourdain said having to be away from his family for 250 days a year working on his television shows put a strain on the relationship.[115]Busia appeared in several episodes ofNo Reservations, notably the ones in Tuscany, Rome, Rio de Janeiro, Naples, and her birthplace ofSardinia. The couple separated in 2016.[116]
Bourdain met Italian actressAsia Argentoin 2016 while filming theRome episode ofParts Unknown.[117][118][119]In October 2017, Argento said in an article inThe New Yorkerthat she had beensexually assaultedbyHarvey Weinsteinin the 1990s. After being criticized for her account in Italian media and politics, Argento moved to Germany to escape what she described as a culture of "victim blaming" in Italy. Argento delivered a speech on May 20, 2018, following the2018 Cannes Film Festival, calling the festival Weinstein's "hunting ground", alleging that she was raped by Weinstein in Cannes when she was 21. She added, "And even tonight, sitting among you, there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women."[120]Bourdain supported her during that period. On June 3, 2018, Bourdain tweeted a video where the team was celebrating during the production of the show with Argento as director, him and Chris Doyle.[121]In August 2018, Argento said that Bourdain was behind the payment of $380,000 to Jimmy Bennett, who had accused Argento of sexually assaulting him. She stated the payment by Bourdain was one he "personally undertook to help Bennett economically, upon the condition that we would no longer suffer any further intrusions in our life.”[122]

He subsequently found Bourdain[130]dead bysuicidein his room at Le Chambard hotel inKaysersbergnearColmar.[131][132][133]He was 61 years old.
Bourdain's body bore no signs of violence[134][135]and the suicide appeared to be an impulsive act.[134]Rocquigny du Fayel disclosed that Bourdain's toxicology results were negative for narcotics, showing only a trace of a therapeutic non-narcotic medication.[136]Bourdain's body wascrematedin France on June 13, 2018, and his ashes were returned to the United States two days later and given to his brother Christopher.[137][138]

To make us a little less afraid of the unknown."[85][142]On the day of Bourdain's death, CNN airedRemembering Anthony Bourdain, a tribute program.[143]

In an assessment of Bourdain's life forThe Nation, David Klion wrote that, "Bourdain understood that the point of journalism is to tell the truth, to challenge the powerful, to expose wrongdoing. But his unique gift was to make doing all that look fun rather than grim or tedious." According to Klion, Bourdain's shows "made it possible to believe thatsocial justiceand earthly delights weren't mutually exclusive, and he pursued both with the same earnest reverence".[156]
Bourdain advocated for communicating the value of traditional orpeasant foods, including all of thevarietal bitsand unused animal parts not usually eaten by affluent 21st-century Americans.[157]He also praised the quality of freshly preparedstreet foodin other countries—especiallydeveloping countries—compared tofast-foodchains in the U.S.[158]Regarding Western moral criticism of cuisine in developing countries, Bourdain stated: "Let's call this criticism what it is:racism. There are a lot of practices from the developing world that I find personally repellent, from my privileged Western point of view. But I don't feel like I have such a moral high ground that I can walk around lecturing people in developing nations on how they should live their lives."[159]
With regard to criticism of the Chinese, Bourdain stated: "The way in which people dismiss whole centuries-old cultures—often older than their own and usually non-white—with just utter contempt aggravates me. People who suggest I shouldn't go to a country like China, look at or film it, because some people eat dog there, I find that racist, frankly. Understand people first: their economic, living situation."[159]Regarding the myth thatmonosodium glutamatein Chinese food is unhealthy, Bourdain said: "It's a lie. You know what causes Chinese restaurant syndrome? Racism. 'Ooh I have a headache; it must have been the Chinese guy.'"[160]
In an acceptance speech for an award given by theMuslim Public Affairs Council, Bourdain stated, "The world has visited many terrible things on the Palestinian people, none more shameful than robbing them of their basic humanity." He opened the episode ofParts Unknownon Jerusalem with the prediction that "By the end of this hour, I'll be seen by many as a terrorist sympathizer, a Zionist tool, a self-hating Jew, an apologist for American imperialism, an Orientalist, socialist, a fascist, CIA agent, and worse."[161]
He championed industrious Spanish-speaking immigrants—from Mexico, Ecuador, and other Central and South American countries—who are cooks and chefs in many United States restaurants, including upscale establishments, regardless of cuisine.[162][163]He considered them talented chefs and invaluable cooks, underpaid and unrecognized even though they have become the backbone of the U.S. restaurant industry.[164][165]
In 2017, Bourdain became a vocal advocate against sexual harassment in the restaurant industry, speaking out about celebrity chefsMario BataliandJohn Besh,[166][167]and in Hollywood,[168]particularly following his then-girlfriendAsia Argento's sexual abuse allegations againstHarvey Weinstein.[169]Bourdain accused Hollywood directorQuentin Tarantinoof "complicity" in theWeinstein sex scandal.[170]
Following the death ofElizabeth II, a 2018 video resurfaced on Twitter showing Bourdain refusing to complete a toast to the Queen, saying "I hate the aristocracy."[171]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
