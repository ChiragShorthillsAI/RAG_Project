Copshopis a 2021 Americanneo noirdark comedyaction thrillerfilm directed byJoe Carnahanand written by Kurt McLeod and Carnahan, based on a story by McLeod andMark Williams. The film starsGerard Butler,Frank Grillo, andAlexis Louder, and is set in a small-town police station that becomes the battleground between a hitman, a novice police officer, and a con artist.
Copshopwas released in the United Kingdom on September 10, 2021, bySTXfilms, and was released in the United States on September 17, 2021, byOpen Road Films. It received generally positive reviews from critics.
Con artist and fixer Teddy Murretto is on the run in a bullet-riddled unmarked police car, which breaks down near Gun Creek,Nevada. As rookie police officer Valerie Young breaks up a brawl outside a casino, Murretto sucker-punches her to intentionally be taken to jail, away from his pursuers. However, hitman Bob Viddick pretends to be a drunk driver, getting himself locked up at the same police station.
Placed in separate cells, Viddick reveals his identity to Murretto. Corrupt officer Huber has been coerced to steal drugs from the evidence locker, while Viddick has planted a small incendiary device disguised as an insulin pump, which sets off the fire alarm. In the confusion, Viddick beats a drunken man sharing his cell and incapacitates police sergeant Mitchell, taking his gun. Before he can kill Murretto, he is interrupted by Young, who returns Viddick to his cell and saves the wounded drunk with an impromptutracheotomy.
Murretto explains his situation to Young: on behalf of his criminal employers, he tried to buy off the state's attorney general, William Fenton, who refused to cooperate and was killed. Fenton had recorded their conversations, forcing Murretto to agree to work with the FBI, which led the mob to want him dead. He was nearly executed by corrupt Las Vegas cops who were caught in a shootout with the FBI, but escaped in the officers' unmarked car.
Young learns that Murretto's ex-wife and son have been killed from Las Vegas police detective Deena Schier, who secretly clears up the scene of the FBI shootout with her fellow corrupt officers. While Murretto and Viddick trade threats, rival hitman Anthony Lamb arrives, posing as a balloon delivery driver. Lamb quickly murders several police officers and EMTs, prompting Huber to kill Mitchell and the wounded drunk.
Rewriting the passcode for the bulletproof door to the holding cells, Young seals herself inside with Murretto and Viddick, but is hit in the abdomen by one of her own ricochets. She realizes Huber is in league with Lamb's employers, and Huber and Lamb attempt to break through the wall into Murretto's cell. Murretto convinces the gravely wounded Young to release him and takes her pistol, promising to return with medical supplies. She is forced to admit that his family is dead, and Viddick confirms that Lamb killed them.
Two officers return to the station and discover Huber and Lamb, who kill them before being ambushed by Murretto. Viddick persuades Young to free him as well, cutting off the power and filling the station with steam from the showers. Capturing Huber, Viddick tortures him with his own weapons, while Murretto stalks Lamb through the locker rooms. Lamb kills Huber by mistake before being stabbed by Viddick, who offers Murretto the chance to kill Lamb, but Murretto shoots Viddick before finishing Lamb off.
Instead of helping Young, Murretto sets fire to the station, but is confronted by the vengeful Young, who has attended to her gunshot wound. An intense gunfight ensues, and Young wounds Murretto with her last remaining round. She is shot by Schier but saved by her body armor, while Schier is shot dead by Viddick, who has somehow survived. Viddick finally kills Murretto, completing his contract, and escapes in a police car with Murretto's briefcase and Lamb's head in a bag. Being treated by paramedics, Young commandeers the ambulance and drives off in pursuit of Viddick, both of them singing to "Freddie's Dead" over the radio.
In addition, the opening actor credits specifically include Ben Hoffman, who served as a Viddick stunt double, and Michael Morales, who served as the stunt coordinator.
In September 2020, it was announced thatGerard ButlerandFrank Grillowould star in the action thriller film calledCopshop, which would be directed byJoe Carnahan. The screenplay was written by Kurt McLeod, based on a story by McLeod andMark Williams.[5][6]It is the first produced screenplay for McLeod, who works as a financial advisor inEdmonton,Alberta, Canada.[7]The most recent draft was written by Carnahan.[6]The film was produced by Williams and Tai Duncan through Zero Gravity Management, Warren Goz and Eric Gold through Sculptor Media, Butler and Alan Siegel through their company G-BASE Productions, and Carnahan and Grillo through their company WarParty Films.[6][8]
In October 2020,Alexis Louderwas cast in the third starring role.[9]Later that month,Ryan O'Nan,Kaiwi Lyman-MersereauandToby Husswere cast in supporting roles.[10][11]
Principal photographybegan in October 2020 at Blackhall Studios inAtlanta, Georgia.[12]Filming also took place inAlbuquerque, New Mexico.[13]On October 2, filming was shut down after three crew members tested positive forCOVID-19in the midst of theongoing pandemic.[14]Filming had resumed by October 5,[9]and had wrapped by November 20.[15]
According to Frank Grillo, director Joe Carnahan's cut of the film was rejected in favor of a different cut which did not include as much of his performance.[16][17]
Screenwriter Kurt McLeod entered into an agreement tooptionhis screenplay for the movie to Sculptor Media, with the purchase price linked to the film's budget (2.5% of the budget, with a floor of $75,000 and cap of $125,000). Initially informed that the budget would range from $3 million to $10 million, McLeod later discovered that it had significantly increased to approximately $43.5 million after Gerard Butler joined the project. In response, McLeod sued Zero Gravity Management in March 2022, alleging breach of contract and fiduciary duty, accusing them of not disclosing the substantial budget increase and failing to renegotiate his compensation. However, on January 9, 2024, U.S. District JudgeFred W. Slaughterissued an order grantingsummary judgmentin favor of Zero Gravity and its founders, Eric and Mark Williams, rejecting McLeod's claims, deeming it speculative to assert that McLeod would have received additional compensation based on the budget increase and emphasizing that McLeod had outside counsel during fee negotiations. Additionally, the court found that the Williams brothers were not personally involved in the deal between McLeod and Zero Gravity as producers of the movie. The legal saga also involved an arbitration with theWriters Guild of Americaover writing credits, resulting in credits for McLeod and Mark Williams for the story and McLeod and Joe Carnahan for the screenplay.[2]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
