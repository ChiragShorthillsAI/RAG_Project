Participant Media, LLCwas an American independentfilmand television production company founded in 2004 byJeffrey Skoll, dedicated to entertainment intended to spur social change.[1]The company financed and co-produced film and television content, as well asdigital entertainmentthrough its subsidiary SoulPancake, which the company acquired in 2016.[2]
The company was originally named Participant Productions and went on to become a well-known independent financier. The company's name descriptively politicizes[3]its basis on currentlytopicalsubjects presented to induce awareness of problematic social aspects.[4][5][6]
The company produced, financed, or co-produced 135 films and five television series. Its films have been nominated for 73 Academy Awards, and have won 18, including Best Picture forGreen BookandSpotlight.[7][8][9][10]
Participant, which earnedB Corpcertification in 2017,[11]was the largest company that exclusively produces and financessocial impact entertainment.[12]
On April16, 2024, Skoll announced that the company would be ceasing operations after two decades, with nearly all of its staff being dismissed and development of new content shutting down entirely.[13]
The company was founded in January 2004 asParticipant ProductionsbyJeffrey Skoll, the "second employee" ofeBay,[14][8]with $100 million in cash from his  personal funds.[4]Its goal was to produce projects that would be both commercially viable and socially relevant.[15]
Skoll was the company's first chief executive officer, but stepped down in August 2006.[4]The firm's initial plans were to produce four to six films per year, each with a budget of $40 million.[5][15]It focused on films in six areas –  the environment, health care, human rights, institutional responsibility, peace and tolerance, and social and economic justice.[4]It evaluated projects by running them past its creative executives first, only then assessing their cost and commercial viability, and  analyzing their social relevance last.[4][16]Once the decision was made to go ahead with production, the company askednon-profit organizationsto build campaigns around the release.[4][5]In some cases, the studio has spent years creating positive word-of-mouth with advocacy groups, which are often encouraged to use the film to push their own agendas.[17]
The new company quickly announced an ambitious slate of productions. Its first film was thedrama filmAmerican Gun(2005), withequity partnerIFC Films.[5][6]Two weeks later, the company announced aco-productiondeal withWarner Bros.on two films – thegeopoliticalthriller filmSyriana(2005) and the drama filmClass Action(later re-titledNorth Country)(2005).[6][18]Participant Productions contributed half the budget of each film.[6]Its fourth production, a documentary film, was announced in November 2004. TitledThe World According to Sesame Street(2005), the film examined the impact of the children's television showSesame Streeton world culture, focusing onKosovo,Bangladesh,South AfricaandEl Salvador.[19][20]At the same time, the company began to implement anenvironmentally friendlystrategy:Syrianawas the company's firstcarbon-neutralproduction, and the company createdcarbon offsetsfor the documentary filmAn Inconvenient Truth(2006).[21]
In 2005, the company suffered its first stumble. It again agreed to co-finance a picture with Warner Bros.,Vadim Perelman's second feature,Truce.[22]Although Perelman claimed he had "never been moved by a script to such an extent",[22]the film never went into production.[23]North Countrydid poorly at the box office despite recent Academy Award-winnerCharlize Theronin the lead.[7]The World According to Sesame Streetnever found a distributor for theatrical release, and eventually only aired onPBStelevision,Sesame Street's broadcast home.[7]
The company announced in March 2005 that it would executive produce the Warner Bros. drama filmGood Night, and Good Luck.[24]At theCannes Film Festivalin May, the company bought the right to distribute the forthcoming drama filmFast Food Nation(2006)  directed byRichard Linklaterin North America in return for an equity stake.[25][26]A month later, it bought distribution rights to the documentaryMurderballin return for an equity stake.[27]It also executive produced and co-financedAl Gore'sglobal-warmingdocumentary,An Inconvenient Truth.[20][28][29][30]
As heavier production scheduling grew, the company added staff. Ricky Strauss was named the first president in March 2005, with oversight ofproduction,marketingand business development.[31]Attorney and former non-profit chief executive Meredith Blake was hired in June as its Senior Vice President of Corporate and Community Affairs,[32]to oversee development of awareness and outreach campaigns around the social issues raised in the company's films in cooperation with non-profit organizations, corporations, andearned media.[32]Diane Weyermann, director of theSundance Institute's Documentary Film Program, joined the company in October 2005 as Executive Vice President of Documentary Production.[33]
The company's non-film-production efforts continued to grow. The company provided an undisclosed amount of financing in February 2005 to film distributorEmerging Picturesto finance that company's national network ofdigitally equipped cinemas(with Emerging Pictures distributing Participant's films).[34]The company also began its first socially relevant outreach project, helping to finance screenings of thebiographical filmGandhi(1982) in thePalestinian territoriesfor the first time as well as in the countries ofIsrael,Jordan,LebanonandSyria.[35]In support of its upcoming film,An Inconvenient Truth,the studio negotiated a deal for distributorParamount Classicsto donate five percent of its U.S. domestic theatrical gross box-office receipts (with a guarantee of $500,000) to theAlliance for Climate Protection.[36]

In June, the company announced it would partner withNew Line Cinema(a subsidiary of Warner Bros.) to produceThe Crusaders, a drama aboutBrown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), a landmark ruling of theSupreme Court of the United Stateswhich endedracial segregationinpublic schools.[39]But the film never got beyond the development stage. In September, the company entered into an agreement to co-produce the drama filmThe Visitor(2008) withGroundswell Productions,[40]and two months later agreed to co-produce (withSony Pictures Classics) a documentary film aboutthe Abu Ghraib torture scandal,Standard Operating Procedure(2008), directed byErrol Morris.[41]
The company also took an equity position in and a co-production credit forChicago 10(2007), ananimated documentaryfilm about the 1969Chicago Sevenconspiracy trial.[42][43]

The company also co-financed, withWarner Independent Pictures, the documentary filmDarfur Now(2007),[45]and, withUniversal Studiosand others, co-financed thebiographical filmCharlie Wilson's War(2007).[46]The film had the biggest budget of any of the company's films sinceSyriana.[7]
Three major corporate events also occurred in 2006.
The company's success continued through the 2006 awards season.An Inconvenient Truthwas nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Documentary Feature, and the song "I Need to Wake Up" (byMelissa Etheridge) nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Original Song.[51]The film and song won their respective categories in February 2007.[52][53]
Corporate growth continued in 2007. On January 8, the company hired motion-picture marketing veterans Buffy Shutt and Kathy Jones, both Executive Vice President of Marketing, to coordinate marketing of the company's films.[54]Eight days later, the company hiredTony Award- andEmmy Award-winning event producer John Schreiber as Executive Vice President of Social Action and Advocacy to enhance the company's earned media, non-profit and corporate outreach and advocacy campaigns.[55]
February saw the hire of Adrian Sexton as Executive Vice President to oversee digital and global media projects,[56]and April saw veteran production head Jonathan King join the company as Executive Vice President of Production.[57]Lynn Hirshfield was hired in May as Vice President of Business Development to launch the company's publishing division,[58]and saw Bonnie Abaunza and Liana Schwarz both Vice President of Social Action Campaign Development and Operations to assist with social outreach and advocacy campaigns in mid-June.[59]
In November, the company signed a deal with actressNatalie Portman's newly formed production company, Handsomecharlie Films, under which the two studios would co-produce socially relevant films for a two-year period. No films were produced under this agreement, however.[60]The same month, the company hired veteranShowtimeproducer John Moser to oversee development and production of original programs for television and home cable.[61]But despite the management activity and expansion, not all of the company's films did well.Chicago 10did not sell for several months after it premiered at Sundance, and only significant editing and a reduction in running time led to a distribution deal.[7]
The company also announced additional productions. In January, it said it was co-financing the drama filmThe Kite Runner(2007) withSidney Kimmel EntertainmentandDreamWorks Pictures, the latter company then owned byViacomviaParamount Pictures.[54]The Kite Runnerwas the first collaboration between both Participant and DreamWorks; the two companies would not collaborate again untilThe Helpin 2011. That spring, the company took an equity position inAngels in the Dust(2007), a documentary film about children orphaned byAIDS, and paid the filmmaker to update the film and shoot more footage.[7]
In April, it closed a deal with Warner Independent to turnRandy Shilts' biographical book,The Mayor of Castro Street(1982) into a film,[62]but the project entered development hell, as well as the feature-length documentary about the2007 Live Earthconcert later.[63]Five months later the company agreed   (withBroken Lizard) to co-produce and co-finance the company's first comedy film,Taildraggers, revolving around five pilots trying to stop oil extraction from an Alaskan preserve.[64]As of June 2009, however, the film had not been produced.[65]
Participant then signed a co-production deal with State Street Pictures to finance the biographical drama,Bobby Martinezaboutthe eponymous Latino surferin November.[66]The film entered development hell for nearly two years but hired Ric Roman Waugh to rewrite and direct in April 2009,[67]with supposed production by the beginning of 2012. By the end of 2007, the company was seen as a key player in documentary production.[68]
In March 2008, Participant Productions changed its name to Participant Media to reflect the firm's expansion into television and non-traditional entertainment media.[69]
The company continued to expand its social advocacy and outreach efforts in 2008. On January 16, 2008, it joined and made a financial contribution to a $100 millionUnited Nations-sponsored fund which would provide backing for films which combatted religious, ethnic, racial, and other stereotypes.[70]Fueling the company's expansion was the creation of a $250 million fund with Image Nation, a start-up film studio based in theUnited Arab Emirateswhich is a division of theAbu Dhabi Media Company.[71]Each company contributed roughly half of the fund's total (although some funding came from loans).[71]Participant and Image Nation agreed to produce 18 films over the next five years, which would add approximately four feature-length films per year to Participant's existing slate.[71][72]To boost its marketing efforts, the company also hired Jeffrey Sakson as Vice President of Publicity in April 2008.[73]In September 2008, Participant Media andPublicAffairs Bookssigned a deal under which PublicAffairs would publish four original paperback books designed to expand upon the social messages in Participant's films.[74]The first book to be published under the pact wasFood Inc.: A Participant Guide: How Industrial Food Is Making Us Sicker, Fatter, and Poorer—And What You Can Do About It.[74]The company also founded a new Web site,TakePart.com, to promote Participant Media's films as well as make viewers aware of the social advocacy efforts of Participant's outreach partners.[75]In 2009, the company signed a first look deal with Summit Entertainment.[76]

The 2007 awards season saw several more Academy Award nominations for the company's films. Its films had a combined sevenGolden Globe Awardnominations, although it won none.[80]Philip Seymour Hoffmanwas nominated for hissupporting actor roleinCharlie Wilson's War,Richard Jenkinswas nominated for Best Actor inThe Visitor, andAlberto Iglesiaswas nominated forbest original scoreforThe Kite Runner.[81]But the studio won no Oscars that year.[clarification needed]The success during awards season did not extend into 2008. The company had only three films released during the year (Every Little Step,Pressure Cooker, andStandard Operating Procedure), and none of them was nominated for an award from a major arts organization. However, on November 19, 2008, the Producers Guild of America gave Participant founder Jeff Skoll its Visionary Award.[82]

In January, it announced that it would producePaul Dinello'sMr. Burnout(about aburned outteacher seeking to rekindle his love of teaching)[83]andFurry Vengeance(a comedy starringBrendan Fraserabout anOregonreal estate developer who is opposed by animals).[78][84]But onlyFurry Vengeancewas produced. That same month Participant signed a five-year production and distribution deal with Summit Entertainment. The agreement, which covered titles financed by Participant's $250 million production agreement with Imagination Media, was nonexclusive (meaning Participant could seek distribution of films by other companies) and was limited to four projects a year.[50]The agreement allowed Summit to charge a distribution fee, and to co-finance titles if it wished.[50]The pact covered home video and pay-television distribution as well.[50]Furry Vengeancewas the first picture produced under the agreement.[84]In April, the company hired screenwriter Miles Chapman to pen an untitled environmentally themed action-adventure script about the hunt for a mystical gem in the heart of Africa.[85]The script went into development hell. The same month, the company agreed to co-finance (with Krasnoff/Foster Entertainment) a biographical drama titledHistory on Trial—which was intended to document the true story ofDeborah Lipstadt, a professor ofJewish studieswho was sued byHolocaust deniersDavid Irvingforlibel.[86][87]The film was not produced, but the company did go on to makeDenial, starring Rachel Weisz, about the same subject in 2016.

On June 5,The New York Timesran a major story about the studio, declaring: "Participant Media, the film industry's most visible attempt at social entrepreneurship, turned seven this year without quite sorting out whether a company that trades in movies with a message can earn its way in a business that has been tough even for those who peddle 3-D pandas and such."[106]AuthorMichael Cieplynoted thatThe Beaver, Participant's latest released, cost $20 million but had garnered just $1 million in gross box-office sales after a month in theaters –  making the film a "flop".[106]The company's biggest success to date, the newspaper noted, was 2007'sCharlie Wilson's War($66.7 million in gross domestic box office revenue).[106]Skoll was quoted as saying that he had poured "hundreds of millions to date [into the company], with much more to follow", and that the studio had yet to break even.[106]Skoll and Berk, however, noted that Participant Media performs slightly above-average when compared to similarly-sized peers.[106]The advantage came in three areas: home video sales, the company's long-term attempts to build social movements around its films, and its stake in Summit Entertainment (which allowed it to win more favorable distribution terms).[106]
TheTimessaid that audiences may be turned off by Participant's relentless focus on upsetting issues, quoting unnamed sources.[106]The company hoped that it would change this attitude about its films (and make money) with 2011'sThe Help(about racial reconciliation in the American South during the 1960s) andContagion(aSteven Soderberghpicture about the outbreak of a virulent, deadly disease).[106]Skoll also said that Participant had purchased the rights to aNew York Timesarticle about theDeepwater Horizonoil spillof 2010, and that the film would likely focus not simply on oil drilling, but on a number of critical issues, such as climate change and the ecological health of oceans.[106]
By year's end, however, there was less concern about the company's financial future. The studio's $25 million film about racial reconciliation (about a third of the production budget came from Participant),[107]The Help, cleared $100 million in late August,[108]and was just short of $200 million worldwide by late December.[109]The Helpwas the first film since 2010'sInceptionto be number one at the North American box office for three straight weekends in a row,[110]and was only unseated by another Participant Media film,Contagion.[111]The Helpwas nominated for fourAcademy Awards: The film for Best Picture,Viola Davisfor Best Actress, andJessica ChastainandOctavia Spencerfor Best Supporting Actress. Spencer won the Oscar for her role.[112]
Participant executives said on October 14, 2011 that the studio would expand its production to make seven to twelve films per year, would begin producing features and series for television, and would expand its online presence.[113]As part of this plan, in November the studio hired advertising executive Chad Boettcher to be executive vice president for social action and advocacy and20th Century Foxexecutive Gary Frenkel to be senior vice president for digital products and communities.[114]
In January 2012, Participant Media made its first investment in a non-English-language film, the forthcomingPablo Larraínmotion pictureNo(starringGael Garcia Bernal).[115]The semi-biographical film tells the story of a man who initiates an upbeat, innocuous advertising campaign that helps to unseatChileandictator GeneralAugusto Pinochetduring the 1988plebiscitethat led to theChilean transition to democracy. The same month, however, it lost its president, Ricky Strauss, who departed the studio to become head of worldwide marketing at Walt Disney Pictures.[116]
Three weeks later, on February 2, 2012, Participant Media announced that it was partnering with Summit Entertainment,Image Nation, Spanish production company Apaches Entertainment, and Colombian production company Dynamo to produce a supernatural horror film about an American oil company executive who moves his family into a house in a small city inColombia, only to find the home is haunted.

Shortly after winning multiple Oscars, including Best Picture, the Vatican's newspaper praisedSpotlightfor exposing these abuses.[129][130][131]The film, however, did face controversy including some criticism from an author ofThe New York Timescalling it, "a misrepresentation of how the Church dealt with sexual abuse cases", arguing that the movie's biggest flaw was its failure to portray psychologists who had assured Church officials that abusive priests could be safely returned to ministry after undergoing therapy treatments.[132]Another criticism was that the film falsely portrayed Jack Dunn, the public relations head and a member of the board atBoston College High School, as a member of the Boston Archdiocesan cover-up (for which the dialogue itself was mythologised).[133][134]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
