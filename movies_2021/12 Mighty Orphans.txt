The true story of the Mighty Mites, the football team of a Fort Worth orphanage who, during the Great Depression, went from playing without shoes, or even a football, to playing for the Texas state championships. Over the course of their winning season, these underdogs and their resilient spirit became an inspiration to their city, state, and an entire nation in need of a rebound, even catching the attention of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
The architect of their success was Rusty Russell, a legendary high school coach who shocked his colleagues by giving up a privileged position so he could teach and coach at an orphanage. Few knew Rusty's secret: that he himself was an orphan. Recognizing that his scrawny players could not beat the other teams with brawn, Rusty developed innovative strategies that would come to define modern football.

Lee, and a member of theLee Family of Virginia, while his father was a descendant of settlerMareen Duvall.[13]
Duvall was raised in theChristian Sciencereligion and has stated that, while it is his belief, he does not attend church.[14]He grew up primarily inAnnapolis, Maryland,[6]site of theUnited States Naval Academy. He recalled: "I was aNavy brat. My father started at the Academy when he was 16, madecaptainat 39 and retired as arear admiral." He attendedSevern SchoolinSeverna Park, Maryland, andThe PrincipiainSt. Louis, Missouri. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama fromPrincipia CollegeinElsah, Illinois, in 1953.[6][15]
His father had expected him to attend the Naval Academy, but Duvall said "I was terrible at everything but acting—I could barely get through school". He again defied his father by serving in theUnited States Army[16]after theKorean War, from August 19, 1953, to August 20, 1954, leaving the Army asprivate first class.[17]"That's led to some confusion in the press," he explained in 1984, "Some stories have me shooting it out with theCommiesfrom afoxholeover in Frozen Chosin.Pork Chop Hillstuff. Hell, I barely qualified with theM-1 rifleinbasic training".[6]While stationed at Camp Gordon, nowFort Eisenhower, inGeorgia, Duvall acted in an amateur production of the comedyRoom Servicein nearbyAugusta, Georgia.[15]
In the winter of 1955, Duvall attended theNeighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatrein New York City,[6]underSanford Meisner, on theG.I. Bill. During his two years there,Dustin Hoffman,Gene HackmanandJames Caanwere among his classmates.[6][18][19][20]While studying acting, he worked as a Manhattan post office clerk.

Duvall began his professional acting career with theGateway Playhouse, anEquitysummer theater based inBellport,Long Island, New York.

While appearing at the Gateway Theatre in the second half of the 1950s, Duvall was also appearing at the Augusta Civic Theatre, the McLean Theatre inVirginiaand theArena StageinWashington, D.C..

AfterTo Kill a Mockingbird, Duvall appeared in a number of films during the 1960s, mostly in midsized parts, but also in a few larger supporting roles. Some of his more notable appearances include the role of Capt. Paul Cabot Winston inCaptain Newman, M.D.(1963), Chiz inCountdown(1968), and Gordon inThe Rain People.

Duvall became an important presence in American films beginning in the 1970s. He drew a considerable amount of attention in 1970 for his portrayal of the malevolent MajorFrank Burnsin the filmMASHand for his portrayal of the title role inTHX 1138in 1971 where he plays a fugitive trying to escape a society controlled by robots. His first major critical success came portrayingTom HageninThe Godfather(1972) andThe Godfather Part II(1974), the 1972 film earning him an Academy Award nomination forBest Supporting Actor.

By the mid-1970s Duvall was a topcharacter actor;Peopledescribed him as "Hollywood's No. 1 No. 2 lead".[16]Duvall received another Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and won both a BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award for his role as Lt. Colonel Kilgore inApocalypse Now(1979). His line "I love the smell of napalm in the morning" fromApocalypse Nowis regarded as iconic in cinema history. The full text is:
You smell that? Do you smell that?Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for twelve hours. When it was all over I walked up. We didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' dink body. But the smell! You know – that gasoline smell... the whole hill! Smelled like... victory. (Pause) Some day this war is going to end...
Duvall received a BAFTA Award nomination for his portrayal of detestable television executive Frank Hackett in the critically acclaimed filmNetwork(1976) and garnered an Oscar nomination forBest Actor in a Leading RoleinThe Great Santini(1979) as the hard-boiledMarineLt.

He also co-starred with Laurence Olivier andTommy Lee JonesinThe Betsy(1978) and portrayed United States PresidentDwight D. Eisenhowerin the television miniseriesIke(1979).
Francis Ford Coppolapraised Duvall as "one of the four or five best actors in the world". Wantingtop billingin films, in 1977 Duvall returned to Broadway to appear as Walter Cole inDavid Mamet'sAmerican Buffalo, stating "I hope this will get me better film roles".[16]He received aDrama Desk Awardnomination forOutstanding Actor in a Play.
"You can't concoct or push ahead something other than what you have at that moment as yourself, as that character. It's you at that moment in time. ... Between action and cut, it's a nice world, but you can't force that any more than you can force it in life."
Duvall continued appearing in films during the 1980s, including the roles of a detective inTrue Confessions(1981), a disillusioned sportswriter Max Mercy inThe Natural(1984) and Los Angeles police officer Bob Hodges inColors(1988).

Duvall said, "What's the point if you're not going to do your own [singing]? They're just going to dub somebody else? I mean, there's no point to that."[37]
ActressTess Harper, who co-starred, said Duvall inhabited the character so fully that she only got to know Mac Sledge and not Duvall himself. DirectorBruce Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable to him that he could feel his skin crawling up the back of his neck the first day of filming with Duvall. Beresford said of the actor, "Duvall has the ability to completely inhabit the person he's acting. He totally and utterly becomes that person to a degree which is uncanny."[37]Duvall and Beresford did not get along well during the production and often clashed during filming, including one day in which Beresford walked off the set in frustration.[37]
In 1989, Duvall appeared in the miniseriesLonesome Dovein the role of CaptainAugustus "Gus" McCrae, Texas Rangers (retired).

Born and raised in the United States by a Galician father and an Irish mother, he adopted the stage name Martin Sheen to help him gain acting parts.[3]He is the father of four children, all of whom are actors. Sheen has directed one film,Cadence(1990), in which he appears alongside his sonsCharlieandRamón. He has narrated, produced, and directed documentary projects and has been active inliberal politics.
Sheen was born inDayton, Ohio, on August 3, 1940, to Mary-Ann (née Phelan) and Francisco Estévez Martínez.[4][5]During birth, Sheen's left arm was crushed byforceps, giving him limited lateral movement of that arm (Erb's palsy) and resulting in the arm being three inches (8 cm) shorter than his right.[6]Both of Sheen's parents were immigrants; his mother was Irish, fromBorrisokane,County Tipperary, and his father, who was Galician, was born inSalceda de Caselas,Galicia.[7][8]After moving to Dayton in the 1930s, his father was a factory worker/machinery inspector at theNational Cash Register Company.[9]Sheen's maternal uncle, Michael Phelan, fought in theIrish Civil Waras a volunteer in theAnti-Treaty Irish Republican Army, and was imprisoned inKilmainham Gaol,Dublin.[10]Sheen grew up on Brown Street in theSouth Parkneighborhood, the seventh of ten children (nine boys and a girl).[8]Due to his father's work, the family lived on the island ofBermudaon St. John's Road,Pembroke Parish, where five of his brothers were born.

His doctor's treatment usingSister Kenny's method helped him regain use of his legs.[8]
When he was eleven years old, Sheen's mother died, and the children faced the possibility of living in anorphanageorfoster homes. The family was able to remain together with the assistance of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Dayton.[12]Raised as aCatholic, he graduated fromChaminade High School(now Chaminade Julienne Catholic High School).[8][13]At fourteen years old he organized a strike of golf caddies while working at a private golf club in Dayton, Ohio. He complained about the golfers, saying: "They often used obscene language in front of us... we were little boys and they were abusive... anti-Semitic.... And they, for the most part, were upstanding members of the community."[14]
Sheen was drawn to acting at a young age, but his father disapproved of his interest in the field. Despite his father's opposition, Sheen borrowed money from a Catholic priest and moved to New York City in his early twenties, hoping to make it as an actor.[9]He spent two years in theLiving Theatrecompany. It was in New York that he met Catholic activistDorothy Day. Working with herCatholic Worker Movement, he began his commitment tosocial justice,[8][15]and would one day go on to playPeter Maurin, cofounder of theCatholic Worker Movement, inEntertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story. Sheen deliberately failed the entrance examination for theUniversity of Daytonso that he could pursue his acting career.[16]
He adopted hisstage name, Martin Sheen, from a combination of theCBScasting director, Robert Dale Martin, who gave him his first big break, and Catholic archbishop and broadcaster,Fulton J. Sheen.[17]In a 2003Inside the Actors Studiointerview, Sheen explained,
Whenever I would call for an appointment, whether it was a job or an apartment, and I would give my name, there was always that hesitation and when I'd get there, it was always gone. So I thought, I got enough problems trying to get an acting job, so I invented Martin Sheen. It's still Estevez officially. I never changed it officially. I never will. It's on my driver's license and passport and everything. I started using Sheen, I thought I'd give it a try, and before I knew it, I started making a living with it and then it was too late. In fact, one of my great regrets is that I didn't keep my name as it was given to me. I knew it bothered my dad.[8][9][17][18]
Sheen was greatly influenced by the actorJames Dean.[8]Speaking of the impact Dean had on him, Sheen stated, "All of his movies had a profound effect on my life, in my work and all of my generation. He transcended cinema acting. It was no longer acting, it was human behavior."[19]Sheen developed a theatre company with other actors in hopes that a production would earn him recognition. In 1963, he made an appearance in "Nightmare", an episode of the television science fiction seriesThe Outer Limits. In 1964, he co-starred in theBroadwayplayThe Subject Was Roses; he later reprised his role in the 1968filmof the same name, and was nominated for aGolden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.[20]Sheen also starred in the television productionTen Blocks on the Camino Real(1966), an adaptation ofTennessee Williams' playCamino Realdirected byJack Landauand presented byNET, a PBS predecessor.
