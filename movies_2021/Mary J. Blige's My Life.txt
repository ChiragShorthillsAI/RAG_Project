She has an older sister, LaTonya Blige-DaCosta, a younger half-brother, Bruce Miller, and a younger half-sister, Jonquell, both from a relationship Blige's mother had with another man after divorcing her first husband.[11][12]
Blige spent her early childhood inRichmond Hill, Georgia,[13][6]where she sang in aPentecostalchurch.[14]She and her family later moved back to New York and resided in the Schlobohm Housing Projects, located inYonkers.[15]The family subsisted on her mother's earnings as a nurse after her father left the family in the mid-1970s.[16]Her father was aVietnam Warveteran who suffered frompost-traumatic stress disorderandalcoholism.[15]
At age five, she wasmolestedby a family friend; as a teenager she endured years ofsexual harassmentfrom her peers.[17]She would eventually turn to alcohol, drugs and promiscuous sex to try to numb the pain.[18]Blige dropped out of high school in her junior year.[19]
Influenced by the music ofAretha Franklin,Chaka KhanandGladys Knight,[20][21]she began pursuing a musical career. Blige spent a short time in a Yonkers band namedPridewith band drummer Eddie D'Aprile. In early 1988, she recorded an impromptu cover ofAnita Baker's "Caught Up in the Rapture" at a recording booth in the Galleria Mall inWhite Plains, New York. Her mother's boyfriend at the time later played the cassette for Jeff Redd, a recording artist andA&Rrunner forUptown Records.[11]Redd sent it to the president andCEOof the label,Andre Harrell. Harrell met with Blige, and in 1989 at the age of 18, she was signed to the label as a backup vocalist for artists such asFather MC,[22]becoming the company's youngest and first female artist.[14]
After being signed to Uptown, Blige began working with record producerSean Combs, also known as Puff Daddy.[23]He became theexecutive producerand produced a majority of her first album.[24]The titleWhat's the 411?[25]was an indication by Blige of being the "real deal".[26]What's the 411?established Blige as a dynamic storyteller whose performances of love narrative drew upon both her musical influences and her lived experiences as an icon of the hip-hop-generation.[27]The music was described as "revelatory on a frequent basis".[19]Blige was noted for having a "tough girl persona and streetwise lyrics".[28]On July 28, 1992,Uptown/MCA RecordsreleasedWhat's the 411?,  to positive reviews from critics.[29]What's the 411?peaked at number six on theBillboard200and topped theTop R&B/Hip-Hop Albumschart.[30]It also peaked at number 53 on theUK Albums Chart.[31]It was certified three timesPlatinumby theRIAA.[32]According toEntertainment Weekly's Dave DiMartino, with the record's commercial success and Blige's "powerful, soulful voice and hip-hop attitude", she "solidly connected with an audience that has never seen a woman donew jack swingbut loves it just the same".[33]According toDave McAleer, Blige became the most successful new female R&B artist of 1992 in the United States.[34]
What's the 411?earned her twoSoul Train Music Awardsin 1993: Best New R&B Artist and Best R&B Album, Female.[35]It was also voted the year's 30th best album in thePazz & Jop—an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published byThe Village Voice.[36]By August 2010, the album had sold 3,318,000 copies in the US.[37]What's the 411?has since been viewed by critics as one of the 1990s' most important records.[29]Blige's combination of vocals over a hip hopbeatproved influential incontemporary R&B.[38]With the album, she was dubbed the reigning "Queen of Hip Hop Soul"
The album's success spun offWhat's the 411? Remix, a remix album released in December that was used to extend the life of theWhat's the 411?singles on the radio into 1994, as Blige recorded her follow-up album.
Following the success of her debut album and aremixed versionin 1993, Blige went into the recording studio in the winter of 1993 to record her second album,My Life.[39]The album was a breakthrough for Blige, who at this point was in aclinical depression, battling both drugs and alcohol – as well as being in an abusive relationship withK-Ci Hailey.[40][41]On November 29, 1994, Uptown/MCAreleasedMy Lifeto positive reviews. The album peaked at number seven on the USBillboard200and number one of theTop R&B/Hip-Hop Albumschart for selling 481,000 copies in its first week and remaining atop the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart for an unprecedented eight weeks. It ultimately spent 46 weeks on theBillboard200 and 84 weeks on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

Blige involved herself in several outside projects, recording a cover ofAretha Franklin's "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" for the soundtrack to theFOXseriesNew York Undercover, and "Everyday It Rains" (co-written by R&B singerFaith Evans) for the soundtrack to the hip hopdocumentary,The Show. Later in the year, she recorded theBabyface-penned and produced "Not Gon' Cry", for the soundtrack to the motion pictureWaiting to Exhale. The platinum-selling single rose to number two on theBillboardHot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in early 1996. Blige gained her first two Grammy nominations and won the1996 Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Groupfor her collaboration withMethod Manon "I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By". Shortly after, Blige was featured onJay-Z's breakthrough single, "Can't Knock the Hustle", from his debutReasonable Doubt(1996) and withGhostface Killahon "All That I Got Is You" from his debut,Ironman, which was also released that year.

What's the 411?highlights the featuring of woman centered narratives although in this album her narratives were regularly policed and told through male emcees. Nonetheless, it marked the start of a transition towards black women centered narratives that focused on the daily experiences and troubles of the black experience through the lens of women rather than necessarily singing about black trauma. Treva B. Lindsey, in her piece "If You Look in My Life: Love, Hip-Hop Soul, and Contemporary African-American Womanhood", highlights the regulating by men saying, "Although the lyrics onWhat's the 411?establish an African American woman-centered discourse, male artists' words of adoration and longing first introduce listeners to Blige as a hip-hop storyteller.What's the 411?, therefore, functions as an African American woman-centered storytelling space created largely by black men."[45]
On April 22, 1997, MCA Records (parent company to Uptown Records, which was in the process of being dismantled) released Blige's third album,Share My World. By then, she and Combs had dissolved their working relationship. In his place were theTrackmasters, who executive-produced the project along withSteve Stoute. Sharing production duties were producersJimmy Jam and Terry Lewis,R. Kelly,BabyfaceandRodney Jerkins. The album was made at a time when Blige was trying to "get her life together", by trying to overcome drugs and alcohol, as well as the ending of her relationship with Hailey. After an encounter with a person who threatened her life the previous year, she tried to quit the unhealthy lifestyle and make more upbeat, happier music. As a result, songs such as "Love Is All We Need" and "Share My World" were made.
Share My Worlddebuted at number one on theBillboard200and spawned five hit singles: "Love Is All We Need" (featuringNas), "I Can Love You" (featuringLil' Kim), "Everything", "Missing You" (UK only) and "Seven Days" (featuringGeorge Benson). In February 1997, Blige performed her hit at the time, "Not Gon' Cry", at the1997 Grammy Awards, which gained her a third Grammy Award nomination, her first forBest Female R&B Vocal Performance, as Blige was recording the follow-up toMy Life. In early 1998, Blige won an American Music Award for "Favorite Soul/R&B Album". That summer, she embarked on the Share My World Tour, which resulted in a Gold-certifiedlive albumreleased later that year, simply titledThe Tour. The album spawned one single, "Misty Blue".
On August 17, 1999, Blige's fourth album, titledMarywas released. It marked a departure from her more familiar hip hop-oriented sound; this set featured a more earthy, whimsical, andadult contemporary-tinged collection of songs, reminiscent of the 1970s to early 1980s soul. She also appeared onIn Concert: A Benefit for the Crossroads Centre at AntiguawithEric Claptonin 1999. On December 14, 1999, the album was re-released as a double-disc set. The second disc was enhanced with the music videos for the singles "All That I Can Say" and "Deep Inside" and included two bonus tracks: "Sincerity" (featuringNas, Andy Hogan andDMX) and "Confrontation" (a collaboration with hip hop duoFunkmaster Flex&Big Kaporiginally from their 1999 albumThe Tunnel).
TheMaryalbum was critically praised, becoming her most nominated release to date, and was certified double platinum. It was not as commercially successful as Blige's prior releases, though all of the singles: "All That I Can Say", "Deep Inside", "Your Child", and "Give Me You" performed considerably on the radio. In the meantime, MCA used the album to expand Blige's demographic into the nightclub market, as club-friendlydanceremixesof theMarysingles were released. The club remix of "Your Child" peaked at number-one on theBillboard'sHot Dance Club Playchart in October 2000. In 2001, a Japan-only compilation,Ballads, was released. The album featured covers ofStevie Wonder's "Overjoyed", and previous recordings ofAretha Franklin's "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" andDorothy Moore's "Misty Blue". In 1999,George Michaeland Mary J. Blige covered the song 'As' written by Stevie Wonder, and worldwide outside of the United States, it was the second single from George Michael's greatest hits albumLadies & Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael. It became a top ten UK pop hit, reaching number four on the chart. It was not released on the U.S. version of the greatest hits collection or as a single in the U.S. Michael cited Blige's record company president for pulling the track in America after Michael's arrest for committing a lewd act. In January 2001, Blige performed as a special guest in theSuper Bowl XXXV halftime show.[46]
On August 28, 2001, MCA released Blige's fifth studio album,No More Drama. The first single in the album, "Family Affair" (produced byDr. Dre) became her first and only number-one single on theBillboardHot 100, where it remained for six consecutive weeks. It was followed by two further hit singles, the European-only single "Dance for Me" featuringCommonwith samples from "The Bed's Too Big Without You" byThe Police, and theJimmy Jam and Terry Lewis-producedtitle track(originally recorded for theMaryalbum), which sampled "Nadia's Theme", the piano-driven theme song to the daytime dramaThe Young and the Restless. Though the album sold nearly two million copies in the U.S., MCA was underwhelmed by its sales, and subsequently repackaged and re-released the album on January 29, 2002. TheNo More Dramare-release featured a new album cover and deleted three of the songs from the original track listing, while adding two brand-new songs—one of which was the fourth single and top twenty Hot 100 hit "Rainy Dayz", (featuringJa Rule), plus two remixes; one of the title track, serviced by Sean Combs/Puff Daddy and the single version of "Dance for Me" featuring Common. Blige won a Grammy for 'Best Female R&B Vocal Performance' for the song "He Think I Don't Know". In April 2002, Blige performed withShakirawith the song "Love Is a Battlefield" onVH1 Divasshow live in Las Vegas, she also performed "No More Drama" and "Rainy Dayz" as a duet with the returningWhitney Houston.
On July 22, 2002, MCA releasedDance for Me, a collection of club remixes of some of her past top hits including theJunior Vasquezremix of "Your Child", and theThunderpussmix of "No More Drama". This album was released in a limited edition double pack 12" vinyl for DJ-friendly play in nightclubs.
On August 26, 2003, Blige's sixth albumLove & Lifewas released onGeffen Records(which had absorbed MCA Records.) Blige heavily collaborated with her one-time producer Sean Combs for this set. Due to the history between them onWhat's the 411?andMy Life, which is generally regarded as their best work, and Blige having just come off of a successful fifth album, expectations were high for the reunion effort.
Despite the album debuting at number one on theBillboard200 and becoming Blige's fourth consecutive UK top ten album,Love & Life's lead-off single, the Diddy-produced "Love @ 1st Sight", which featured Method Man, barely cracked the top ten on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, while altogether missing the top twenty on the Hot 100 (although peaking inside the UK top twenty).

Called the  "Queen of Hip-Hop Soul", Blige is credited with influencing the musical marriage of hip hop and R&B.[157]Ethan Brown ofThe New Yorkersays that albums "What's the 411?" and "My Life", in hindsight, invented "the sample-heavy sound that reinvigorated urban radio and became a blueprint for nineties hip-hop and R&B".[158]Tom Horan ofThe Daily Telegraphcomments that Blige, being an immensely influential figure in popular music, "invented what is now called R&B by successfully combining female vocals with muscular hip hop rhythm tracks. All over the world, that recipe dominates today's charts."[159]Called one of the "most explosive, coming-out displays of pure singing prowess"[160]and "one of the most important albums of the nineties",[161]What's the 411?saw Blige pioneer "the movement that would later becomeneo soul, generating gripping songs that were also massive radio hits".[162]
African American scholars have noted the implications of Blige's presentation and representation of black womanhood and femininity in the typically male-dominated and centric sphere of hip hop. Blending the vocal techniques of rapping in hip hop with aspirational messages in R&B, Blige is credited with articulating black women's experiences in a "more factual and objective"[163]manner than typicalstereotypes and tropes of black womenin the media. Using her personal experiences and struggles with her family as source material for her songs, Blige refutes notions of black female hypersexuality by "imploring women to love and empower themselves through both autonomy and intimacy."[164]This desire for love does more than connect to her audience members.

Alicia Augello Cook was born on January 25, 1981,[6][7]in theHell's Kitchenneighborhood ofManhattan, New York City.[12][13]She is the only child of Teresa Augello, who was aparalegaland part-time actress, and one of three children of Craig Cook, who was aflight attendant.[14][15]Keys's father is African American and her mother is of Italian and "Irish or Scottish" descent; her mother's paternal grandparents were immigrants fromSciacca,Sicily;[16][17]andLamezia Terme, inCalabria.[18]Named after herPuerto Ricangodmother,[19]Keys has said that she was comfortable with hermultiracialheritage because she felt she was able to "relate to different cultures".[12][20]Keys's father left when she was two years old. She was subsequently raised by her mother during her formative years atManhattan Plaza[21]in Hell's Kitchen.[22]Keys has stated that her parents never had a relationship, and her father was not in her life.[23]Although she did not like to speak about her father in order to not feed stereotypes, Keys remarked in 2001: "I'm not in contact with him. That's fine. When I was younger, I minded about that. [It] made me angry. But it helped show me what a strong woman my mother was, and made me want to be strong like her. Probably, it was better for me this way."[12]Keys and her mother lived in a one-bedroom apartment.[24]Her mother often worked three jobs to provide for Keys, who "learned how to survive" from her mother's example of tenacity and self-reliance.[25]
I grew up in the middle of everything. I walked the streets alone, I rode the trains alone, I came home at three in the morning alone, that was what I did ... The city had a huge influence on me because it's such a diverse place. As hard as [growing up in it was], I always felt very blessed about being able to recognize different cultures and styles, people and places. I feel like the concrete alone just gave me a certain drive. I really saw everything: every negative I could possibly see from the time I could walk until now; and also every positive, every bright future, every dream that I could possibly see. So growing up around this big dichotomy definitely influenced my music.
From a young age, Keys struggled with self-esteem issues, hiding little by little when her differences made her vulnerable to judgment, and later uninvited sexual attention.[27][28][29]Living in the rough neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen,[22][23]she was, from an early age, regularly exposed to street violence, drugs, prostitution, and subjected to sexual propositions in thesex trade- and crime-riddled area.[29][30][31]"I saw a variety of people growing up, and lifestyles, lows and highs. I think it makes you realize right away what you want and what you don't want," Keys said.[32]Keys recalled feeling fearful early on of the "animal instinct" she witnessed, and eventually feeling "high" due to recurrent harassment.[27][33]Her experiences in the streets had led her to carry a homemade knife for protection.[34][35]She became very wary,[35][36]emotionally guarded, and she began wearing gender-neutral clothing and what would become her trademarkcornrows.[39]Keys explained that she is grateful for growing up where she did as it prepared her for the parallels in the music industry, particularly as she was a teenager starting out; she could maintain a particular focus and not derail herself.[29][40]She credits her "tough" mother for anchoring her on a right path as opposed to many people she knew who ended up on the wrong path and in jail. Keys attributed her unusual maturity as a young girl to her mother, who depended on her to be responsible while she worked to provide for them and gave Keys as many opportunities as possible.[35][36]
Keys loved music and singing from early childhood. She recalled her mother playingjazzrecords of artists such asThelonious Monk,Billie Holiday,Ella Fitzgerald, andLouis Armstrongon Sunday mornings—early musical moments Keys considers influential in kindling her interest in and emotional connection to music.[12][25]Inpreschool, Keys sang in her school's production of the musicalCatsand was cast asDorothy Galein a production ofThe Wizard of Oz.[41]Keys discovered that she had a passion for the piano by age six, as she loved the sound and feel of the instrument and desired to play and learn it.[26][42]When Keys was ten,[43]a neighborhood friend who was moving home gave her family an old upright piano. This proved pivotal for Keys's musical development, which allowed her to practice, to play, and to benefit fully from music lessons at an early age.[23]Keys began receivingclassicalpiano lessons by age seven,[44]practicing six hours a day,[42]learning theSuzuki methodand playing composers such asBeethoven,Mozart,Chopin, andSatie.[23][45]She was particularly drawn to "blue, dark, shadowy" and melancholic compositions, as well as the passionate romanticism of "blue composers" like Chopin.[46]Inspired by the filmPhiladelphia, Keys wrote her first song about her departed grandfather on her piano by age 12. The scene in the film in whichTom Hanks's character listens tooperaon a record player notably affected Keys, who "never showed emotion very well".[26]After seeing the film, Keys, "for the first time, could express how [she] felt through the music."[23][42]
Classical piano totally helped me to be a better songwriter and a better musician ... I knew the fundamentals of music. And I understood how to put things together and pull it together and change it. The dedication that it took to study classical music is a big reason why I have anything in this life I think. ... [It] was a big influence on me. It opened a lot of doors because it separated me from the rest. [...] And it did help me structure my songs.
Keys's mother had encouraged her to participate in different extracurricular activities, including music, dance, theater, and gymnastics, so she could "find her muse".[41][47]Her extracurricular activities gave her focus and drive, and helped keep her out of trouble.[34][42][45]Keys remained so occupied with her various pursuits that she experienced her first burnout before adolescence. Before her 13th birthday, she expressed to her mother that she was too overwhelmed and wanted to disengage, at which point her mother took some time off with her and encouraged her to keep focusing on piano.[41]Keys would continue studying classical music until the age of 18.[42]Keys regards her education in classical piano and dedication to classical music as vital for her stability in her youth and her development as a musician and songwriter.[12][26]Keys later said of her classical background:
That type of studying, that type of discipline ... after a while, I realized what it provided me – focus, the ability to pay attention for a long enough period of time to make progress; the work ethic; the actual knowledge of music, that then unlocked the ability to write my own music, put my own chords and things I heard in my own head to different lyrics that I maybe felt, and I never, ever had to wait for anybody to write something for me.[48]
Keys enrolled in theProfessional Performing Arts Schoolat the age of 12, where she took music, dance, and theater classes and majored in choir.[29]In her preteen years, Keys and her bass-playing friend formed their first group, though neither "knew too much about how pop songs worked".[23][45]Keys would continue singing, writing songs, and performing in musical groups throughout junior high and high school.[25][41][44]She became an accomplished pianist; according to some sources, after her classical-music teacher had nothing left to teach her, she began studying jazz at age 14[47][49](this claim, however, was challenged by Keys's music teacher herself).[50]Living in the "musical melting pot" city, Keys had already been discovering other genres of music, includingsoul music,hip hop,R&B, and taken affinity to artists likeMarvin GayeandCurtis Mayfield. Keen on dissecting music, Keys continued developing her songwriting and finding her own 'flow and style" through her exploration of the intricacies in different music.[26][45][51]
Keys spent more time inHarlemduring her teenage years. She connected with the cultural and racial diversity in the neighborhood, where she expanded upon her musical exploration, and her character was also solidified. "Harlem raised me in a lot of ways," Keys remarked. "[It] taught me how to think fast, how to play the game ... taught me leadership, how to get out of bad situations when you need to, how to hold my own."[12][44]During this period, she met her good friend who would later become her long-term collaborator and boyfriendKerry Brothers Jr., also famously known as Krucial.[25][44]
In 1985, at the age of four, Keys appeared onThe Cosby Showas Maria, one of Rudy's slumber-party friends.[52]
In 1994, manager Jeff Robinson met 13-year-old Keys, who participated in his brother's youth organization called Teens in Motion.[41][53]Robinson's brother had been giving Keys vocal lessons inHarlem.[42]His brother had talked to him about Keys and advised him to go see her, but Robinson shrugged it off as he had "heard that story 1,000 times". At the time, Keys was part of a three-member band that had formed in theBronxand was performing in Harlem.[41][49]Robinson eventually agreed to his brother's request, and went to see Keys perform with her group at thePolice Athletic Leaguecenter in Harlem. He was soon taken by Keys, her soulful singing, playing contemporary andclassical musicand performing her own songs.[41][44]Robinson was excited by audiences' reactions to her. Impressed by her talents, charisma, image, and maturity, Robinson considered her to be the "total package", and took her under his wing.[47][49][53]By this time, Keys had already written two of the songs that she would later include on her debut album: "Butterflyz" and "The Life".[47][49]
Robinson wanted Keys to be informed and prepared for the music industry, so he took her everywhere with him, including all the meetings with attorneys and negotiations with record labels, while the teenager often became disgruntled with the process.[41]Robinson had urged Keys to pursue a solo career, as she remained reluctant, preferring the musical interactions of a group. She took Robinson's advice after her group disbanded, and contacted Robinson who in 1995 introduced her toA&RexecutivePeter Edge.
Robinson and Edge helped Keys assemble some demos of songs she had written and set up a showcases for label executives.[25][41][44]Keys performed on the piano for executives of various labels, and a bidding war ensued.[23][44]Edge was keen to sign Keys himself but was unable to do so at that time due to being on the verge of leaving his present record company,Warner Bros. Records, to work atClive Davis'Arista Records.[23][41][54]During this period,Columbia Recordshad approached Keys for a record deal, offering her a $26,000 white baby grand piano; after negotiations with her and her manager, she signed to the label, at age 15. Keys was also finishing high school, and her academic success had provided her opportunity for scholarship and early admission to university.[23][41][54]That year, Keys accepted a scholarship to study atColumbia Universityin Manhattan.[25]She graduated from high school early asvaledictorian, at the age of 16, and began attending Columbia University at that age while working on her music.[23][47]Keys attempted to manage a difficult schedule between university and working in the studio into the morning, compounding stress and a distant relationship with her mother. She often stayed away from home, and wrote some of the most "depressing" poems of her life during this period. Keys decided to drop out of college after a month to pursue music full-time.[25][38][47]
Columbia Recordshad recruited a team of songwriters, producers and stylists to work on Keys and her music. They wanted Keys to submit to their creative and image decisions.[25]Keys said they were not receptive to her contributions and being a musician and music creator.[47][48]While Keys worked on her songs, Columbia executives attempted to change her material; they wanted her to sing and have others create the music, forcing big-name producers on her who demanded she also write with people with whom she was not comfortable.[12][42]She would go into sessions already prepared with music she had composed, but the label would dismiss her work in favor of their vision.[48]"It was a constant battle, it was a lot of -isms", Keys recalled. "There was the sexism, but it was more the ageism – you're too young, how could you possibly know what you want to do? – and oh God, that just irked me to death, I hated that."[25]"The music coming out was very disappointing", she recalled. "You have this desire to have something good, and you have thoughts and ideas, but when you finish the music it's shit, and it keeps on going like that."[44]Keys would be in "perpetual music industry purgatory" under Columbia, while they ultimately "relegated [her] to the shelf".[49]She had performed "Little Drummer Girl" forSo So Def'sChristmas compilationin 1996,[49]and later co-wrote the song "Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)" for theMen in Black(1997)film soundtrack, the only released recording Keys made with Columbia.[38][42]
Keys "hated" the experience of writing with the people Columbia brought in. "I remember driving to the studio one day with dread in my chest," she recalled.[23]Keys said the producers would also sexually proposition her.[12][29][47]"It's all over the place. And it's crazy. And it's very difficult to understand and handle," she said.[47]Keys had already built a "protect yourself" mentality from growing up in Hell's Kitchen, which served her as a young teen then in the industry having to rebuff the advances of producers and being around people who "just wanted to use [her]".[29][40]Keys felt like she could not show weakness.[29]Executives at Columbia also wanted to manufacture her image, with her "hair blown out and flowing", short dresses, and asking her to lose weight; "they wanted me to be the same as everyone else," Keys felt.[23]"I had horrible experiences," she recalled. "They were so disrespectful ... I started figuring, 'Hey, nothing's worth all this.'"[12]As months passed, Keys had grown more frustrated and depressed with the situation, while the label requested the finished tracks.[23][44][47]Keys recalled, "it was around that time that I realized that I couldn't do it with other people. I had to do it more with myself, with the people that I felt comfortable with or by myself with my piano."[47]Keys decided to sit in with some producers and engineers to ask questions and watch them technically work on other artists' music.[44]"The only way it would sound like anything I would be remotely proud of is if I did it," Keys determined. "I already knew my way around the keyboard, so that was an advantage. And the rest was watching people work on other artists and watching how they layer things."[44]
Her partnerKerry "Krucial" Brotherssuggested to Keys she buy her own equipment and record on her own.[47]Keys began working separately from the label, exploring more production and engineering on her own with her own equipment.[44]She had moved out of her mother's apartment and into a sixth-floorwalk-upapartment in Harlem with Brothers, where she fit a recording studio into their bedroom and worked on her music.[47]Keys felt being on her own was "necessary" for her sanity. She was "going through a lot" with herself and with her mother, and she "needed the space"; "I needed to have my own thoughts, to do my own thing."[44]Keys and Brothers later moved toQueensand together they turned the basement into KrucialKeys Studios.[47]Keys would return to her mother's house periodically, particularly when she felt "lost or unbalanced or alone". "She would probably be working and I would sit at the piano," she reminisced.[47]During this time, she composed the song "Troubles", which started as "a conversation with God", working on it further in Harlem. Around this time the album "started coming together", and she composed and recorded most of the songs that would appear on her album.[36][44][47]"Finally, I knew how to structure my feelings into something that made sense, something that can translate to people", Keys. "That was a changing point. My confidence was up, way up."[44]The different experience reinvigorated Keys and her music.[47]While the album was nearly completed, Columbia's management changed and more creative differences emerged with the new executives. Keys brought her songs to the executives, who rejected her work, saying it "sounded like one long demo". They wanted Keys to sing over loops,[44]and told Keys they will bring in a "top" team and get her "a more radio-friendly sound". Keys would not allow it; "they already had set the monster loose", she recalled. "Once I started producing my own stuff there wasn't any going back."[47]Keys stated that Columbia had the "wrong vision" for her. "They didn't want me to be an individual, didn't really care," Keys concluded. "They just wanted to put me in a box."[12]Control over her creative process was "everything" to Keys.[48]
Keys had wanted to leave Columbia since they began "completely disrespecting [her] musical creativity".[23]Leaving Columbia was "a hell of a fight," she recalled. "Out of spite, they were threatening to keep everything I'd created even though they hated it. I thought I'd have to start over again just to get out, but I didn't care."[23]Keys said in 2001: "It's been one trial, one test of confidence and faith after the next." To Keys, "success doesn't just mean that I'm the singer, and you give me my 14 points, and that's all. That's not how it's going to go down."[55]Edge, who was by that time head of A&R at Arista Records,[25]said, "I didn't see that there was much hands-on development at Columbia, and she was smart enough to figure that out and to ask to be released from her contract, which was a bold move for a new artist."[47]Edge introduced Keys to Arista's then-president, Clive Davis, in 1998.[25][56]
Robinson and Keys, with Davis's help, were able to negotiate out of the Columbia contract and she signed to Arista Records in late 1998.[42][47][54]Keys was also able to leave with the music she had created.[23]Davis gave Keys the creative freedom and control she wanted, and encouraged her to be herself.[12][56]Keys said of Davis's instinct: "he knows which artists are the ones that maybe are needing to craft their own sound and style and songs, and you just have to let an artist go and find that space. And I think he somehow knew that and saw that in me and really just let me find that."[49]After signing with Davis, Keys continued honing her songs.[12]Keys almost chose Wilde as her stage name at the age of 16 until her manager suggested the name Keys after a dream he had. She felt that name embodied her both as a performer and person.[57]Keys contributed her songs "Rock wit U" and "Rear View Mirror" to the soundtracks of the filmsShaft(2000) andDr. Dolittle 2(2001).[58][59]
In 2000, Davis wasousted from Arista, and the release of Keys's album was put on hold. Later that year, Davis formedJ Recordsand immediately signed Keys to the label.[23]"He didn't try to divert me to something else," Keys said on following Davis to his new label. He understood that she wants to be herself and not "made into what somebody else thinks I should be."[38]
Keys played small shows across America, performed at industry showcases for months and then on television.[44][56]Davis thought "pop stations might feel she's too urban. Urban might feel she's too traditional", and as he felt Keys was a "compelling, hypnotic performer" best experienced in person, he had Keys perform her music to different crowds in different places to spread the word.[41][44][56]"I created opportunities for those who saw her to spread the word", Davis recalled. "She is her own ambassador."[41]Davis wanted to "let people discover her, and you can only do that with a few artists."[25][51]Keys later performed onThe Tonight Showin promotion for her upcoming debut.[44]Davis wrote a letter toOprahasking her to have Keys,Jill Scott, andIndia.Arieperform on her show to promote new women in music.[44]Oprah booked Keys the day she heard her song"Fallin'", her debut single.[12][41]Keys performed the song on Oprah's show the week prior to the release of her debut album.[49]"Fallin'", released as a single in April, went to No. 1 on theBillboardHot 100, and stayed atop the chart for six consecutive weeks.[49][60]Ebonymagazine wrote that at the time "the music that was pumping on the airwaves was hip-hop andrap– not Alicia's unique blend of classical meets soul, meets hip-hop, meets, well, Alicia. What could have been a recipe for disaster ... turned into the opportunity of a lifetime."[41]Keys as an artist since her early days, Davis said, "does her own thing. She has set out her own vision. That's the way it is for artists of her ilk ... They don't try to fit in. They try to establish their own paths ... [she has] sure natural instinct and sure vision" and "a respect for musical history."[25][41]
Songs in A Minor, which included material that Columbia Records had rejected, was released on June 5, 2001,[47][49]to critical acclaim.[63][64][65]Musically, it incorporated classical piano in an R&B, soul and jazz-fused album.[66]Jam!described the music as "old-school urban sounds and attitude set against a backdrop of classical piano and sweet, warm vocals".[67]USA Todaywrote that Keys "taps into the blues, soul, jazz and even classical music to propel haunting melodies and hard-driving funk".[68]Songs in A Minorwould be "lauded for its mix of traditional soul values and city-girl coolness", wroteThe Guardian.[36]PopMatterswrote that "Keys'sSongs in A Minoris a testament to her desire (and patience) to create a project that most reflects her sensibilities as a 20-year-old woman and as a musical, cultural, and racial hybrid."[51]

The title derived from one of her poems, "Love and Chains", from the line: "I don't mind drinking my tears for water."[95]She said the title is the foundation of her writing because "everything I have ever written has stemmed from my tears of joy, of pain, of sorrow, of depression, even of question".[96]The book sold over US$500,000 and Keys madeThe New York Timesbestseller list in 2005.[32][97]The following year, she won a second consecutive award for Best R&B Video at the MTV Video Music Awards for the video "Karma".[98]Keys performed "If I Ain't Got You" and then joinedJamie FoxxandQuincy Jonesin a rendition of "Georgia on My Mind", theHoagy Carmichaelsong made famous byRay Charlesin 1960 at the2005 Grammy Awards.[99]That evening, she won four Grammy Awards: Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for "If I Ain't Got You", Best R&B Song for "You Don't Know My Name", Best R&B Album forThe Diary of Alicia Keys, andBest R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals" for "My Boo" withUsher.[100]
