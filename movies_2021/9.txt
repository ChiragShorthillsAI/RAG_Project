The studio was founded in 1993 byAvi Aradas part ofMarvel Entertainment Groupand has been led by producerKevin Feige, who serves as its president since 2007. The studio originally licensed thefilm rightsto several Marvel characters before beginning to produce its own films in 2004, and has since regained many of those rights.The Walt Disney Companyacquired Marvel Studios' parent company,Marvel Entertainment, in 2009. Marvel Studios was transferred in 2015 tothe Walt Disney Studios, which has been a part of theDisney Entertainmentdivision since 2023.Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictureshas distributed most of the studio's films sinceThe Avengers(2012).
Since 2008, Marvel Studios has released35 films within the MCU, fromIron Man(2008) toCaptain America: Brave New World(2025);13 television seriessince 2021, fromWandaVision(2021) toDaredevil: Born Again(2025–present); andtwo television specials:Werewolf by Night(2022) andThe Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special(2022). The television seriesWhat If...?(2021–2024) is the first animated property produced solely by the studio. It was created by the smallerMarvel Studios Animationteam.[7]These films, television series, and television specials all sharecontinuitywith each other, along with five short films calledMarvel One-Shotsproduced by the studio that were released from 2011 to 2014. From 2013 until 2020,Marvel Televisionreleased12 television series, which also acknowledge the MCU continuity. These were produced before that company was folded into Marvel Studios in December 2019 and became a production label.
Eleven of Marvel Studios' filmsare among the50 highest-grossing filmsof all time. These include:The Avengers,Iron Man 3(2013),Avengers: Age of Ultron(2015),Captain America: Civil War(2016),Black Panther(2018),Avengers: Infinity War(2018),Captain Marvel(2019),Avengers: Endgame(2019),Spider-Man: Far From Home(2019),Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021), andDeadpool & Wolverine(2024);[8]Avengers: Endgamewas thehighest-grossing film of all timefrom July 2019 until March 2021.[9][10]In addition to the MCU, Marvel Studios has also been involved with the production of other Marvel-based film franchises that have grossed over $1 billion at the box office, including theX-MenandSpider-Manmulti-film franchises, as well as eight direct-to-video short films withMarvel AnimationcalledMarvel Animated Featuresthat were released from 2006 until 2011. Since 2024, Marvel Studios has used "Marvel Television" and "Marvel Animation" banners to release its television and animated projects, respectively.
During what is known as Marvel's "Timely era",Captain Americawas licensed out toRepublic Picturesfora 1944 serial filmonly for the free advertising. Timely failed to provide any drawing of Captain America withhis shieldor any further background, and Republic created a whole new background for the character and portrayed the character using a gun.[11]From the late 1970s through the early 1990s,Marvel Comics GroupandMarvel Entertainment Group(MEG) sold options to studios to produce films based onMarvel Comics characters. One of Marvel's superheroes,Spider-Man, was optioned in the late 1970s, and rights reverted to Marvel without a film having been produced within the allocated time frame. From 1986 to 1996, most of Marvel's major characters were optioned, including theFantastic Four,X-Men,Daredevil, theHulk,Silver Surfer, andIron Man.[12]Marvel's first big-screen adaptation of one of its properties was the 1986 filmHoward the Duck,[13]which was abox-office bomb.[14]MEG was purchased byNew World Entertainmentin November 1986[15]and moved to produce films based on the Marvel characters. It releasedThe Punisher(1989) before MEG was sold toRonald Perelman'sAndrews Group. Two other films were produced:Captain America(1990) released in the United Kingdom on screens and direct to video in the United States, andThe Fantastic Four(1994), not intended for release.[16]
After MEG acquiredToyBizin 1993,Avi Aradof ToyBiz was named president and chief executive officer (CEO) of both the Marvel Films division andNew World Family Filmworks, aNew World Entertainmentsubsidiary. New World was MEG's former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group.[17][18]Marvel ProductionsbecameNew World Animationby 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films, includingMarvel Films Animation.[17][19][20]Marvel Films Animation sharedTom Tataranowiczwith New World Animation as head of development and production.[21]New World Animation (The Incredible Hulk),Saban(X-Men: The Animated Series) and Marvel Films Animation (Spider-Man) each produced a Marvel series for television for the 1996–1997 season.[22][20][23]By the end of 1993, Arad and20th Century Foxstruck a deal to make a film based on theX-Men.[24]In August 1996, New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation were sold along with the rest of New World by the Andrews Group toNews Corporationand theFox Entertainment Group. As part of the deal, Marvel licensed the rights to Captain America, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer to be on theFox Kids Networkand produced by Saban. New World Animation continued producing a second season ofThe Incredible HulkforUPN.[22][25]
On August 7, 1996, Marvel Studios was created by Marvel. Filing with theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionto raise money to finance the new corporation, Marvel,Isaac Perlmutter's Zib, Inc. and Avi Arad sold ToyBiz stocks.[12][26]ToyBiz filed an offering of 7.5 million shares with a closing price of $20.125 at the time, making the offering worth approximately $150 million. ToyBiz sought to sell 1 million shares.[27]Jerry Calabrese, the president of Marvel Entertainment Group, and Avi Arad, head of Marvel Films and a director of ToyBiz, were assigned tandem control of Marvel Studios. Under Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to controlpre-productionby commissioning scripts, hiring directors, and casting characters, providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution. Arad said of the goal for control, "When you get into business with a big studio, they are developing a hundred or 500 projects; you get totally lost. That isn't working for us. We're just not going to do it anymore. Period."[12]Marvel Studios arranged a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox to cover markets in the United States and internationally.[28]
In December 1996, Marvel Entertainment Group underwent aChapter 11 bankruptcyreorganization plan, including Marvel Studios as part of its strategic investment.[29]By 1997, Marvel Studios was actively pursuing various film productions based on Marvel characters, including the eventual filmsX-Men(2000),Daredevil(2003),Elektra(2005), andFantastic Four(2005). Unproduced projects includedPrince Namor, based on the characterNamorand to be directed byPhilip Kaufman, andMort the Dead Teenager, based on the comic book of the same name and written by John Payson andMortcreatorLarry Hama.[30]Marvel's Captain America animated series with Saban Entertainment for Fox Kids Network was set to premiere in late 1998. However, due to the bankruptcy, the series was canceled after only character designs and a one-minute promotional reel were made.[31][32][33]
The first film packaged and licensed by Marvel Studios wasBlade(1998), based on the vampire hunterBlade. The film was directed byStephen Norringtonand starredWesley SnipesasBlade. It was released on August 21, 1998, grossing $70,087,718 in the United States and Canada and $131,183,530 worldwide.[34]Bladewas followed byX-Men, which was directed byBryan Singerand was released on July 14, 2000.X-Mengrossed $157,299,717 in the United States and Canada and $296,250,053 worldwide.[35]BladeandX-Mendemonstrated that widely popular films could be made out of comic book characters not familiar to the general public.[36]Leading up toX-Men'srelease, Marvel Studios negotiated a deal with then-functionalArtisan Entertainment, successful with the low-budgetThe Blair Witch Project, for a co-production joint venture that included rights to 15 Marvel characters including Captain America,Thor(as a television series),Black Panther(with Snipes attached to produce and star),Deadpool,Iron Fist,Morbius, the Living Vampire,Longshot,Power Pack,Mort the Dead Teenager,Ant-Man,[37]and thePunisher.[38]Artisan would finance and distribute while Marvel would develop licensing and merchandising tie-ins. The resulting production library, which would also include television series, direct-to-video films, and internet projects, would be co-owned.[37]By 2001, the success of Marvel Entertainment'sUltimate Marvelimprint comics created leverage in Hollywood for Marvel Studios, pushing more properties into development.[39]
The next film licensed from Marvel Studios wasSpider-Man(2002) byColumbia Pictures, directed bySam Raimiand starringTobey MaguireasSpider-Man. The film was released on May 3, 2002, grossing $403,706,375 in the United States and Canada and $821,708,551 worldwide.[42]The early success ofSpider-Manled the film's studio to issue a seven-figure advance for a sequel. Arad spoke of the deal, "Movies make sequels. Therefore, it's a big economic luxury to know that a movie's going to get a second and third. This is a business of precedence."[43]According to aLehman Brothersanalysis, Marvel Studios made only $62 million for the first twoSpider-Manfilms.[44]Marvel was making more from half the consumer product licensing fees while making relatively little from the films, but it was enough for Marvel to regain its financial footing.[41]In October 2002, Marvel Studios announced deals for the Sub-Mariner andPrimewithUniversal Pictures.[45]
In contrast to the original storylines ofDC Comics'SupermanandBatmanfilms, Marvel films often emphasized more fidelity to its comics, applying set pieces, scenes, plots, and dialogue drawn from them.[36]In 2003,David Maiselapproached Arad about earning Marvel more for its films. Maisel, Arad, and Perlmutter met, leading to Maisel being hired as president andchief operating officer(COO). The studio's office was small onSanta Monica Boulevard, with around a dozen staff members.Kevin Feige, who later became the president of Marvel Studios, was then a junior executive generating script notes for the licensed studios.[41]In January 2003, Marvel, theSci-Fi Channel, andReveille Productionsagreed to develop two pilot films based onBrother VoodooandStrikeforce: Morituri.[46]In December 2003,Lionsgatepurchased Artisan Entertainment and they decided to let all of the character rights Artisan held, except Punisher, revert to Marvel.[47][48]: 279Marvel Studios partnered with Lionsgate in 2004 to produce eight animated films, calledMarvel Animated Features, for the direct-to-DVD market withLionsgate Home Entertainmenthandling distribution.[49][50]The line was a proof of concept for Maisel's later plan.[41]Eric Rollman was hired by Marvel as Executive Vice President of home entertainment & TV production for Marvel Studios to oversee the deal with Lionsgate.[51]
Maisel was hired in 2004 as president and chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self-finance its films.[40][41]Marvel entered into anon-recourse debtstructure withMerrill Lynchthat was collateralized by certainfilm rightsto a total of ten characters from Marvel's vast vault. Marvel received $525 million to make a maximum of ten films based on the company's properties over eight years, according to the parameters of the original deal. Those characters wereAnt-Man,the Avengers, Black Panther, Captain America,Cloak & Dagger,Doctor Strange,Hawkeye,Nick Fury,Power Pack, andShang-Chi.[52]Ambacinsured the films would succeed or they would pay the interest payment on the debt and get the film rights as collateral.[44]Initially, Marvel Studios was in talks with Universal Pictures as a possible distributor, because Universal owned the film rights to both the Hulk and Namor during that time.[53][54]Negotiations dragged on, so the studio began talks withParamount Pictures. In the second quarter of 2005, Merrill attempted to back out of full financing of each film, demanding that Marvel finance one-third of the budget. Marvel took back rights in five foreign territories from Paramount for pre-sell to meet that demand.[41]In September 2005, Marvel announced the Merrill Lynch financing deal with Paramount was on as marketer and distributor. Marvel Studios' parent company Marvel Enterprises, Inc. then changed its name toMarvel Entertainment, Inc.to reflect the change to self-production.[52]
The studio moved to a new location over aMercedes-Benzdealership inBeverly Hills, California. Maisel was also named vice-chairman of the studio, but reported to Marvel Entertainment CEOIsaac Perlmutter.[41]In November 2005,Michael Helfantjoined the studio as president and chief operating officer.[55]Also that month, Marvel gained the film rights to Iron Man fromNew Line Cinema. Marvel then revealed that it had regained the film rights to the Hulk from Universal in February 2006,[56]in exchange for letting Universal own the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulk(2008) and the right of first refusal to pick up the distribution rights to any future Marvel Studios-producedHulkfilms.[57]In April 2006, Thor was announced to be a Marvel Studios production,[58]while Lions Gate Entertainment subsequently dropped theBlack Widowfilm it had in development since 2004 and returned the rights to Marvel.[59]
Maisel and Arad fought over the rate of film releases and the strength of characters in the film lineup. Perlmutter supported Maisel and thus, in May 2006, Arad quit as studio chair and CEO.[40][60]In March 2007, Helfant was "forced out" of the studio while Maisel was named chairman and Kevin Feige was named president of production to replace Helfant asIron Man(2008) began filming.[61][62]In January 2008,Marvel Animationwas incorporated to direct Marvel's efforts in animation and home entertainment markets including then animation efforts with Lionsgate andNickelodeon.[51]In March, the company agreed to a five-picture basic cable distribution withFXfor the filmsIron ManandThe Incredible Hulk, with additional films to be named later.[63]Following the successful opening weekend ofIron Manin May 2008, Maisel had his contract extended through 2010 and Feige was promoted to president of Marvel Studios.[64]In November, Marvel Studios signed a lease withRaleigh Studiosto host its headquarters and production offices and film the next four films on the studios' slate, includingIron Man 2(2010) andThor(2011), at itsManhattan Beach Studios Media Campusfacilities.[65]By September 2008, Paramount added five additional Marvel films' foreign distribution to its domestic film distribution contract.[66]
In 2009, producer Stephen Broussard was tasked with forming a writers program for the studio. The writers were hired for a year to be on call to do emergency script polishes for films in production,[48]: 165as well as develop scripts based on some lesser-known properties, such as Black Panther,Cable, Iron Fist,Nighthawk, andVision.[48]: 165[67]Writers included: Edward Ricourt, who was encouraged to write a script forLuke Cageas it was of high interest to the studio;[48]: 165Nicole Perlman, who chose to write a script based on the2008 Guardians of the Galaxy team;[48]: 167Christopher Yost, who was asked to pitch a Black Panther film for his interview,[48]: 166and took interest in writing scripts about theThunderbolts,Power Pack, andBrian Braddock / Captain Britain;[48]: 173Joe Robert Cole, who initially pitched aWar Machinefilm before joining the writers program where he created scripts for theInhumans;[48]: 169andEric Pearson, who was asked to pitch aCloak and Daggerfilm and also worked to rewrite a Luke Cage script.[48]: 171After Broussard moved on to the production ofCaptain America: The First Avenger(2011), Marvel Studios hired Nate Moore to oversee the writers program, who at times was assisted by the also newly hired executive Jodi Hildebrand. Particular properties Feige was interested in having screenplays for were Black Panther, Iron Fist, and Blade.[48]: 167–168, 171The program was shut down in 2014 before being revived in 2016.[48]: 172In early 2009,Sonyreturned all Spider-Man television rights (including live-action) in exchange for an adjustment to the film rights.[68]
On August 31, 2009,the Walt Disney Companyannounced that it had reached a deal to acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion.[69]The deal was completed on December 31, with Marvel Entertainment becoming a subsidiary of Disney.[70]Both Marvel and Disney stated that the merger would not affect any pre-existing deals with other film studios for the time being,[71]although Disney said they would distribute future Marvel projects withits own studioonce the deals expired.[72]Maisel stepped down from the studio following the sale to Disney.[73]In April 2010, rumors circulated that Marvel was looking to create $20–40 million films based on properties such as Doctor Strange,Ka-Zar, Luke Cage,Dazzler, and Power Pack.[74]Feige responded by saying, while budgets are generally never discussed early in development, Marvel was considering films for all characters mentioned in the rumor, except Dazzler, whose rights were at Fox.[75]
In June 2010, Marvel Entertainment set up a television division within Marvel Studios calledMarvel Televisionto be headed up byJeph Loebas Executive Vice President,[76]under which Marvel Animation would be operated.[77]In October,Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesacquired the distribution rights forThe Avengers(2012) andIron Man 3(2013) from Paramount Pictures[78]with Paramount's logo and credit remaining on those films.[79]In August 2011, at Disney's behest, the studio dismissed most of its marketing department, including EVP of Worldwide Marketing Dana Precious, VP of Worldwide Marketing Jeffrey Stewart, and Manager of Worldwide Marketing Jodi Miller. Disney subsequently began marketing Marvel's films.[80]In April 2012, the Walt Disney Company China, Marvel Studios, andDMG Entertainmentannounced an agreement to co-produceIron Man 3in China. DMG partly financed, produced in China with Marvel, and handled co-production matters. DMG also distributed the film in China in tandem with Disney.[81]
In April 2013, Marvel Studios moved its executive production offices from the Manhattan Beach Studios Media Campus tothe Walt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California.[82]In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights toIron Man,Iron Man 2,Thor, andCaptain America: The First Avengerfrom Paramount.[83][84]In September 2014,TNTacquired the cable rights forAvengers: Age of Ultron(2015),Captain America: Civil War(2016), and three other films, to air on the network two years after their theatrical releases. The films had previously aired on FX since 2008.[85]
In August 2015, Marvel Studios was placed intoWalt Disney Studios, with Feige reporting directly to Walt Disney Studios chairmanAlan F. Horninstead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter. Marvel Television and subsidiary Marvel Animation were left under Marvel Entertainment and Perlmutter's control.[86][87]As of April 2017, Marvel Studios was housed on the second floor of theFrank G. Wells Buildingat the Disney studio lot.[1][2]Fast Companyranked Marvel Studios number eleven on its 2018 World's Most Innovative Companies list.[88]
In September 2018, it was reported that Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for the streaming serviceDisney+, to be centered on "second tier" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films. Characters being considered for series includedLokiandScarlet Witch, with the actors who portrayed the characters in the films expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes, with a "hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a "hands-on role" in each series' development.[89]In October 2019, Feige was given the title ofChief Creative Officer, Marvel, and would oversee the creative direction of Marvel Television andMarvel Family Entertainment, with both being returned to being under the Marvel Studios banner.[90]Two months later, Marvel Television was folded into Marvel Studios, with Marvel Studios overseeing development of all the Marvel Television series in production at the time of its closing.Karim Zreik, Marvel Television's senior vice president of current programming and production, would join Marvel Studios alongside his team to oversee the production of the Marvel Television series inherited by Marvel Studios.[91]
In May 2022, Marvel Studios signed a 20-year licensing deal with Stan Lee Universe to license the name and likeness of Lee for use in future films, television series, Disney theme parks and cruises, various "experiences", and merchandising. A digitally recreated Lee was not expected to make cameo appearances in future projects, rather the deal allows Marvel to use Lee's name, voice, likeness, signature, and existing images and archival material.[92]In June 2023, the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulkreverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.[93]
By October 2023, Marvel Studios was planning to hire dedicated executives to focus on its television efforts, as part of a larger plan tochange its approach to its television series.[94]Production and development executive Richie Palmer was serving as a television executive by January 2024.[95]In May 2024, Marvel Studios revealed that its live-action Disney+ series would be released under a new "Marvel Television" banner, separate from the previous company of the same name, starting withAgatha All Alonglater in 2024.[96]
In June 2021, ahead of Marvel Studios' first solely produced animated seriesWhat If...?, executive vice president of film productionVictoria Alonsonoted that the studio was creating an "animation branch and mini-studio" to focus on more animated content beyondWhat If...?.[97]Marvel Studios outsources the animation for its animated series to third-party animation studios, though executive Brad Winderbaum indicated Marvel would work with fellow Disney studiosPixarandWalt Disney Animation Studios"under the right circumstances".[98]In September 2021, Alonso was promoted to President of Physical, Post Production, VFX and Animation.[99]In November 2021, Marvel Studios announced the animated seriesX-Men '97(2024–present), arevivalofX-Men: The Animated Series(1992–1997) that is set in that series' continuity.[100]The animation branch of Marvel Studios and "mini-studio" is known as Marvel Studios Animation.[7]By April 2022, Marvel Studios had taken over production of the preschool animated seriesSpidey and His Amazing Friends, starting from its second season; the first season was produced under the Marvel Entertainment banner.[101]The "Marvel Animation" name and banner was used for the division's projects by May 2024.[96]
In March 2023, Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios by a group includingDisney Entertainmentco-chairmanAlan Bergmanand Disney's human resources and legal departments for serving as a producer on theAmazon StudiosfilmArgentina, 1985(2022); this was a breach of a 2018 agreement between Alonso and Disney which stated employees would not work for a competing studio.[102][103]Alonso reportedly did not seek permission to work on the film, and was asked by Disney to stop working on the film, as well as not to promote or publicize it, with the situation "deemed serious enough" that Disney requested a new agreement be signed. Despite this, Alonso continued to promote the film following its September 2022 premiere, and was consistently reminded of her agreement and breach of contract, ultimately leading to her firing.[102]Alonso's lawyers refuted this claim, stating Disney was aware of, and agreed to, Alonso's work onArgentina, 1985, and that she was instead "silenced[... and] was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible";[104]this incident was reported to be a disagreement with a Disney executive over the censoring ofgay pride elementsinAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania(2023) to release the film in Kuwait and comply withits restrictive anti-LGBTQ laws.[105][106]A Disney spokesperson reiterated the notion that she was fired due to "an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy" among other "key factors".[104]Disney and Alonso reached a multimillion-dollar compensation settlement in April.[107]
Also at the time of Alonso's firing, criticism from VFX workers was noted,[103]who had raised complaints of Marvel's "demanding post-production schedules". Alonso was described by some as a "kingmaker",[103][7]and "challenging to work with",[105]with Chris Lee atVulturereporting that Alonso was "singularly responsible for Marvel's toxic work environment" with VFX workers.[108][7]Alonso reportedly took days off to produceArgentina, 1985instead of her post-production commitments for the various MCU projects, which in turn resulted in the need to delay several projects in 2022 and 2023.[105]However, Alonso was also described as the "epitome of professional" and supportive on set, with Joanna Robinson ofThe Ringerdescribing the reports as a "gross mischaracterization" and the opposite of Alonso's work.[103][109]Following Alonso's firing, visual effects vendors for the various MCU projects were working with producer Jen Underdahl, the vice president of visual effects and stereo.[102][110]
In August 2023, a group of 52 on-set VFX workers at Marvel Studios filed a petition with theNational Labor Relations Boardfor an election to join theInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees(IATSE) labor union theVFX Union. This was the first time any workers in the visual effects industry had petitioned for union recognition. Lee believed if this group of workers were able to secure union recognition, it "would stand as proof of concept for the overall viability of an industry-wide unionization push", particularly at the post-production effect houses.[111]All of the workers who participated in the election vote that concluded in early September voted unanimously to form a union with IATSE, with the union then set to enter into collective bargaining negotiations with Marvel, beginning at an unspecified date.[112]
Marvel had licensed out the film rights to many of its characters to other studios in the 1990s, starting with theX-Men,[24]theFantastic Four,Spider-Man, andDaredevil, which were followed byCaptain America,Iron Man,Thor, theHulk,Ant-Manand theWasp,Black Widow,Luke Cage, thePunisher,Blade,Ghost Rider,Man-Thing,Black Panther,Deadpool, andPrime, among others.[45][113]
In February 2015, Marvel Studios andSony Pictures Entertainmentannounced that Spider-Man would appear in the MCU, with the character appearing inCaptain America: Civil War(2016) and Sony releasingSpider-Man: Homecoming, produced by Feige andAmy Pascal, in July 2017. As part of the deal, Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films.[114]In June 2015, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal did not allow Spider-Man to appear in any of theMCU television series, as it was "very specific... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed."[115]In September 2019, it was announced that Disney and Sony had reached a new agreement allowing for Spider-Man to appear in athird standalone film(produced by Marvel Studios and Feige) and a future Marvel Studios film.[116]Disney was reported to be co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of the film's profits in the new agreement, while retaining the merchandising rights to the character.[116][117]In November 2021, Pascal announced plans for a fourthSpider-Manfilm set in the MCU, in addition to long-term plans for a new trilogy of films with Marvel Studios, with said film entering active development the following month.[118][119]Sony's agreement specifies that production has to start on a film within three years and nine months of the previous one, and release within five years and nine months, otherwise the rights revert to Marvel.[48]: 295Sony has access to 856 characters within its agreement,[48]: 297includingKingpin, who is able to be used by both Sony and Marvel Studios.[120]
In March 2023,Citigroupfinancial analystJason Bazinet felt Disney may try to include the distribution rights to the Hulk and Namor in any potential sale of the streaming serviceHulutoComcast, the owner ofUniversal PicturesthroughNBCUniversal.[121]In June 2023, the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulkreverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.[93]
The following table details the rights that have returned to Marvel along with the studios from which they returned and the year in which they returned.
The "Marvel Studios Parliament", otherwise known as "The Parliament", is the creative decision-making committee at Marvel Studios and a "brain trust" of long-time executives who help to elevate each other's projects where possible.[150][151][152][94]The following executives are members of the Parliament:[153]
A number of other executives serve as lead producers on films and television series, working on each project from their inception through their release as managers alongside other executives,[152][162]as part of the Production and Development group. Some of these executives include:[153]
The Visual Development group is an in-house group of artists who work on a film from its start to provide a consistent look for the studio.[157][additional citation(s) needed]
In addition to Meinerding, the group includesAndy Park, Director of Visual Development and Production Illustrator[172][173]
Additionally,Sarah Halley Finnhas served as a frequent casting director for several MCU films and television series.[179]
Starting with the release ofSpider-Manin 2002, Marvel Studios introduced its "flipbook"production logo, created by Imaginary Forces.[191]This logo was accompanied by music from the film's score, sound effects or a song, to lead into the beginning of the film. This was the logo seen in front of all of the studio's films until 2013, when the logo was updated with the release ofThor: The Dark World, again created by Imaginary Forces. Feige stated that since Marvel was now its own entity within the Walt Disney Company, it "felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features" instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel's studio or distribution partners' logos. Feige added that they "didn't want to re-invent the wheel [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel."[192]Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002. They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, and ultimately chose 120 that were "universal and not specific to one character" and created a narrative "where each image spoke to the one before it and after."[191]The new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within theMarvel Cinematic UniversethroughCaptain America: Civil War. With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed byBrian Tyler, who wrote the scores toIron Man 3,Thor: The Dark World, andAvengers: Age of Ultron.[192]It was featured on the filmsThor: The Dark World,Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014), andGuardians of the Galaxy(2014).
In July 2016, another new logo and opening were introduced, featuring an updated fanfare, composed this time byMichael Giacchino, who first worked with Marvel Studios on the score toDoctor Strange(2016). The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.[193]It was first seen in front ofDoctor Strange.[194]The updated logo was created byPerception, which was first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update its logo. Feige specifically requested Perception "to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image, showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo." The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed "How to Build a Universe", which "was designed to pay tribute to [the filmmaking] process by touching on" how a film's origins are inspired by the comics, which then results in a script, followed by concept art, resulting in the final film. Perception looked to the initial "flipbook" logo for inspiration, and paid tribute to it in the new opening, as it opens identically to the flipbook logo. Next, the opening includes "various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays", with Perception picking "both iconic fan-favorites, as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe." To add in the concept art images, Perception looked "through a massive archive of concept art and "The Art Of..." books, to select the most iconic images for each beloved character. Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves, the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch. The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them." Finally, over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had been released at that time were included, with Perception arranging them in a way they called the "vault" "where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the "Marvel" logotype."[195]
A modified version of Perception's logo was introduced at the 2017D23Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU.[196]The logo debuted withAvengers: Infinity Waron April 26, 2018, and was used again inAnt-Man and the Wasp(2018). With the release ofCaptain Marvel, the current Perception logo was altered at Marvel Studios' behest in honor ofStan Lee; Lee died on November 12, 2018, just a few months before the release of the film.[197]The logo was altered, replacing the characters with Stan Lee's MCU cameos and other public appearances related to the MCU, accompanied by a black screen reading "Thank You Stan".[198]Similarly, the logo was retroactively modified for theDisney+version ofBlack Panther(2018) in honor ofChadwick Boseman, who died on August 28, 2020. The logo was altered, replacing the characters with images and footage ofT'Challaand Boseman. The logo premiered on November 29, 2020, which would have been Boseman's 44th birthday.[199][200]Additional modifications include having the characters who disappeared in the Blip removed forAvengers: Endgame; an additional Boseman tribute one forBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever(2022); and an all-Guardians of the Galaxy opening forGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3(2023). A shortened sequence opening was used for the Disney+ seriesSecret Invasion(2023).[201]"What If... Strange Supreme Intervened?" (2023), theWhat If...?season twofinale, replaced the live-action footage of the logo with animated images fromWhat If...?.[202]Captain America: Brave New World(2025) was the first Marvel Studios film to not feature the studio's logo animation sequence.[203]
Television specialsfrom Marvel Studios, which are marketed as "Marvel Studios Special Presentation", feature a special multicolored intro with bongo drum music, reminiscent of theCBS Special Presentationtheme featured before animated holiday specials of the 1980s and 1990s.[204][205]The intro was also designed by Perception,[206]with Giacchino (who directed and composed for the specialWerewolf by Night) once again creating the music.[205]Jamie Lovett atComicBook.comcalled the Marvel Studios Special Presentation intro "more colorful" and its fanfare "more playful" than the normal Marvel Studios intro.[207]
Marvel Knights was a production arm of Marvel Studios intended to produce some of Marvel's darker and lesser-known titles. The name originated from the "Marvel Knights" imprint ofMarvel Comics. The first film produced under the Marvel Knights banner wasPunisher: War Zone(2008), which served as arebootof thePunisherfranchise. This was followed byGhost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance(2011), which was the second and final title to be released under the Marvel Knights banner.[210]

Raymond Andrew Winstone(/ˈwɪnstən/; born 19 February 1957)[2]is an English television, stage, and film actor with a career spanning five decades. Having worked with many prominent directors, includingMartin ScorseseandSteven Spielberg, Winstone is perhaps best known for his "hard man" roles, usually delivered in his distinctive London accent. The first of these wasThat Summer!(1979), for which he received a nomination for theBAFTA Award for Best Newcomer. He rose to prominence starring asWill Scarletin the seriesRobin of Sherwoodfrom 1984 to 1986.
Winstone received aBAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Rolenomination for his performance inNil by Mouth(1997). He also starred in the British independent filmsScum(1979),Quadrophenia(1979),The War Zone(1999),Last Orders(2001), andSex & Drugs & Rock & Roll(2010). Winstone's other notable films includeSexy Beast(2000),Ripley's Game(2002),Cold Mountain(2003),King Arthur(2004),The Departed(2006),Beowulf(2007),Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull(2008),Hugo(2011),Snow White and the Huntsman(2012),Black Widow(2021), andDamsel(2024).
Winstone was born on 19 February 1957 inHackney Hospital, London.[2]He first lived in Caistor Park Road,StratfordE15,[3]and attended Portway infants and junior school. He moved toEnfieldwhen he was seven.[2]His mother, Margaret (née Richardson; 1932–1985) had a job emptyingfruit machines, and his father, Raymond J. Winstone (1933–2015), ran a fruit-and-vegetable business.[4][2]
Winstone has recounted how, as a child, he used to play with his friends on bomb sites (empty plots of land with rubble fromSecond World Warbombs).[3]He joinedBrimsdown Primary Schooland in 1968, enrolled toEdmonton County School,[5]which had changed from agrammar schoolto acomprehensiveupon his arrival.[5]He also attendedCorona Theatre School.[2]He did not take to school, eventually leaving with a singleCSE(grade 2) in drama.[6]
He recounted an early encounter with a notorious gangster:
"I was still a baby the dayRonnie Kraycame round to see Dad, but I've been told this story so many times I can see it unfolding in my mind. Everyone was on their best behaviour, but then Ronnie picked me up, and by all accounts I pissed all over him. He had a new mac on, which had probably cost a few bob, and I absolutely covered it. The room fell silent, then Ronnie cracked up, so everyone knew it was safe to join in."[3]
Winstone had an early affinity for acting; his father would take him to the cinema every Wednesday afternoon. Later, he viewedAlbert FinneyinSaturday Night and Sunday Morning, and said: "I thought, 'I could be that geezer'." His other major influences includedJohn Wayne,James Cagney, andEdward G. Robinson. After borrowing extra tuition money from a friend's mother, a drama teacher, Winstone took to the stage, appearing as aCockneynewspaper seller in a production ofEmil and the Detectives.
Winstone was also aboxer.[7]Known to his friends as Winnie, he was called Little Sugs at home (his father already being known as Sugar, afterSugar Ray Robinson). At the age of 12, Winstone joined theRepton Amateur Boxing Club.[2]Over the next 10 years, he won 80 out of 88 bouts.[7]He was London schoolboy champion atwelterweighton three occasions,[7]and fought twice for England.[7]The experience gave him a perspective on his later career: "If you can get in a ring with 2,000 people watching and be smacked around by another guy, then walking onstage isn't hard."[7]
Deciding to pursue drama, Winstone enrolled at theCorona Stage AcademyinHammersmith, when he was aged "about 17".[6][8][3]At£900 a term, it was expensive considering the average wage was then about £36 a week.
Winstone was not popular with the establishment at his secondary school, who considered him a bad influence. When he discovered that he was the only pupil not invited to the Christmas party, he decided to take revenge for this slight. Hammering some pins through a piece of wood, he placed it under the wheel of his headmistress's car and blew out the tyre, for which he was expelled.[6]As a joke, he went up to theBBC, where his schoolmates were involved in an audition, and got one of his own by flirting with the secretary.[2]The audition was for one of the most notorious plays in history –Alan Clarke'sScum– and, because Clarke liked Winstone's cocky, aggressive boxer's walk,[2]he got the part, though it had been written for aGlaswegian.[6]
The play, written byRoy Mintonand directed by Clarke, was a brutal depiction of a young offender's institution. Winstone was cast in the leading role of Carlin, a young offender who struggles against both his captors and his fellow cons to become the "Daddy" of the institution. Hard hitting and often violent (particularly during the infamous "billiards" scene in which Carlin uses two billiard balls stuffed in a sock to beat one of his fellow inmates over the head), the play was judged unsuitable for broadcast by the BBC, and was not shown until 1991. The banned television play was entirely refilmed in 1979 for cinematic release with many of the original actors playing the same roles, including Winstone. In a commentary for theScumDVD, Winstone cites Clarke as a major influence on his career and laments the director's death in 1990 from cancer.[9]
While Winstone has portrayed many characters who share the "hard man" nature of his performance inScum, he has also explored a variety of other roles, including comedy (Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence) and as the romantic lead (Fanny and Elvis). His favourite role wasHenry VIIIin the2003 TV serial of the same name, remarking at the time: "It's really flattering for me to be asked to play a king. I mean, I'm a kid out ofPlaistow, and I'm playing one of the most famous kings of England. It's fantastic!"[10]
In 1975, Winstone landed his first professional role inWhat a Crazy Worldat theTheatre Royal,Stratfordin London.[11]One of his first TV appearances came in the 1976 "Loving Arms" episode of the popular police seriesThe Sweeney,[12]where he was credited as "Raymond Winstone" (as he was inWhat a Crazy World[11]) and played a minor part as an unnamed young thug. After a short run in the TV seriesFox(1980), and a role inLadies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains(1982),[12]alongsideDiane LaneandLaura Dern. He starred in the opening episode of the third season ofBergerac(1983), asWill ScarletinRobin of Sherwood.[6]He again teamed up withJason Conneryin a film which also featuredAmanda DonohoeandMaria Whittaker, inTank Malling(1984).[12]

During this period, he was increasingly drawn to the theatre, playing inHinkemannin 1988,Some Voicesin 1994, andDealer's ChoiceandPale Horsethe following year. Ray also added his London accent to a dance track in 1982 by Marsha Raven called "I Like Plastic".
Winstone was asked to appear inMr Thomas,[6]a play written by his friend and fellow LondonerKathy Burke. The reviews were good, and led to Winstone being cast, alongside Burke, inGary Oldman's dramaNil By Mouth(1997).[12]He was widely lauded for his performance as an alcoholicwife-batterer, receiving aBAFTAnomination (17 years after his Best Newcomer award forThat Summer).[12]He continued to play "tough guy" roles inFaceandThe War Zone– the latter especially controversial, as he played a man who rapes his own daughter – but that obvious toughness also allowed him to play loved-up nice-guys in romantic comediesFanny and ElvisandThere's Only One Jimmy Grimble. InLast Christmas, he played a dead man, now a trainee angel, who returns from heaven to help his young son cope with his bereavement which was written byTony Grounds. In 1995, he played the sinister and mysterious Thane in the comedy drama seriesThe Ghostbusters of East Finchley. The series was also written by Grounds, with whom Winstone worked again onBirths, Marriages & DeathsandOur Boy, the latter winning him theRoyal Television SocietyBest Actor Award. They worked together again in 2006 onAll in the Gamewhere Winstone portrayed afootballmanager. He did a series ofHolsten Pilsadvertisementswhere he played upon the phrase "Who's the Daddy", coined in the filmScum.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
