The Green Knightis a 2021epicmedieval fantasyadventure[5]film written, produced, directed and edited byDavid Lowerythat is an adaptation from the 14th-century poemSir Gawain and the Green Knight. The film starsDev PatelasGawain, who sets out on a journey to test his courage and face theGreen Knight. It also starsAlicia Vikander,Joel Edgerton,Sarita Choudhury,Sean Harris, andRalph Ineson.
The Green Knightwas theatrically released in the United States on July 30, 2021, byA24. The film received acclaim from critics for its cinematography, music, acting (particularly Patel's), production values, and Lowery's originality, direction, and writing. It grossed over $20 million against a budget of $15 million.
OnChristmasmorning inWales,[6]Gawainis awakened in a brothel by his lover, a common woman named Essel. He returns to the king's court, where he is scolded by his mother. Gawain attends a feast at theRound Tablewith his uncle,King Arthur, who invites Gawain to sit at his right hand though he has yet to acquire a story to tell of himself, the mark of a true knight. Elsewhere, in a tower, Gawain's mother performs amagicrite that summons the mysteriousGreen Knight.[7]He barges into the king's court and states that any knight who lands a blow on him will win his green axe but must travel to the Green Chapel and receive an equal blow in return on the following Christmas. Gawain takes up the challenge, and the king stresses to Gawain that it is only a game. The knight yields, and Gawain, now uncertain as to the nature of this game but wieldingthe king's sword, decapitates him. The knight rises, retrieves his severed head, repeats the requisite date to Gawain, and rides away laughing.
Gawain lives on the story of his deed and revels all year. King Arthur reminds him to uphold his side of the challenge as time draws near, again reminding him that it is only a game. Gawain departs on horseback for the Green Chapel. He takes the green axe and he wears a green girdle given to him by his mother. She says that as long as he wears it, he shall suffer no harm.
On his journey, he crosses a battlefield littered with dead warriors, where he meets a scavenging boy. The boy directs Gawain to a stream that leads to the Green Chapel and requests payment. Gawain flips him a single coin. Shortly afterward, the boy and two others ambush Gawain and steal the axe, girdle, and horse, leaving Gawain tied up. After hallucinating his own death from poison mushrooms, he crawls to his sword and uses it to cut himself free before pursuing the thieves.
At nightfall, Gawain arrives at an abandoned cottage and falls asleep in its bed. He is awakened by a young woman namedWinifred, who asks him to retrieve something that she has lost from a nearby spring. He asks what he will receive in return, but is rebuffed. She asks Gawain to find her skull and Gawain realizes she is a ghost. He asks her if she is a spirit or a person, to which she asks "What's the difference?" He finds her skull and reunites it with her skeletal remains. The next morning, he finds the axe has been returned to him.
Gawain befriends a fox who accompanies him on his journey and they encounter a group ofgiants. They reach a castle inhabited by a Lord who informs him that the Green Chapel is nearby and invites Gawain to stay until closer to Christmas. The Lord'sladyresembles Essel; she makes seductive moves toward Gawain and during one of these efforts steals his token from Essel. The Lord and Gawain agree that the Lord will trade any prize from his hunt for whatever Gawain receives at the castle.
The next morning, the Lady presents Gawain with the protective green girdle, which she claims to have made herself. In exchange for the girdle, Gawain allows her to masturbate him andstains the girdlein the process. Gawain hurriedly flees the castle, but encounters the Lord in the forest, who gives him a kiss. The Lord reveals that he has captured Gawain's fox on his hunt and releases it to Gawain, but Gawain does not offer him the girdle.
Gawain reaches a stream where a boat is waiting. The fox speaks to Gawain, imploring him to turn back. Gawain chases off the fox and takes the boat to the chapel where the Knight sits in hibernation for Christmas day. Gawain waits through the night and the Green Knight awakens on Christmas morning. The Green Knight swings the axe and Gawain flinches. Gawain kneels for the blow again. At the last moment, he scrambles away apologizing on the way out. He flees back to the king's court on the horse he found.
Sometime later, Gawain becomes king after his uncle's death. Essel bears him a son, but Gawain abandons her and takes the child. He marries a noblewoman instead, still wearing the green girdle whileconsummating the marriage. His son comes of age and dies in battle. Gawain becomes a reviled king afterwards. Sometime later, his castle is under siege by unknown enemies and his family slowly leaves him. When the enemies start to break in, Gawain removes the green girdle, which he had worn the entire time, and his head falls from his shoulders.
It then turns out the entire series of events is just a vision and Gawain is still standing in the lair of the Green Knight. Gawain kneels, removes the girdle, and tells the Knight that he is ready. The Green Knight then states, "Well done, my brave knight." He gently runs his finger across Gawain's neck, points past him, and playfully states, "Now, off with your head," as he smiles warmly.
Near the end of the credits, a little girl picks up a crown she finds on the ground and playfully puts it on.

It was announced in November 2018 thatDavid Lowerywould direct and write a modern retelling of the 14th-century taleSir Gawain and the Green Knight, withA24, Ley Line Entertainment, andBron Studiosset to finance.[11]
In March 2019,Dev Patelwas announced to be in negotiations to star in the film.[12]That month,Barry KeoghanandRalph Inesonjoined the cast.[13]In April 2019, it was announcedAlicia VikanderandErin Kellymanhad been cast.[14][15]Principal photographybegan in Ireland in March 2019.Ardmore StudiosandCahir Castle, County Tipperary, were used as filming locations, as wasCharleville CastleinTullamore, County Offaly.[16]Weta Digitalcreated the visual effects.[17]
Lowery was inspired by fantasy films of the 1980s such asWillowandExcalibur.[18]Initially, while writing the script, Lowery did not intend for Morgan le Fay to be Gawain's mother, but felt that altering the story this way allowed for her to be more naturally introduced into the narrative. Lowery stated that the intercut scenes of le Fay casting the spell that summons the Green Knight were not part of the original screenplay. However, Lowery was impressed with actress Sarita Choudhury's work with the character and the scene was written and storyboarded to be included in the Round Table scene. Lowery spent well over a year editing the scene together. The decision to design le Fay's spell in the form of a handwritten letter was also due to Lowery's fondness for letter writing, found in his other works as well.[7]The inclusion of Saint Winifred was inspired by the mention of the Holy Head (Holywell) in the original poem.[18]The highway robbery is an allusion to the 1975 filmBarry Lyndon, while the battlefield where Gawain first encounters the robber is inspired by theBattle of Badon.[18]While Gawain's ultimate fate is left ambiguous at the end of the film, Lowery originally shot a more "explicit" and "definitive" ending, but felt that it would affect audiences' feelings coming away from the film.[18]
Set designs, such as the scene at the Round Table, included hand painted matte paintings to extend the set, a technique Lowery favored from films in the '80s and '90s. Time constraints with shooting forced cinematographer Andrew Palermo and production designerJade Healyto plan how lighting would be built into the Round Table scene ahead of time.[7]
Costume designer Malgosia Turzanska drew upon South American designs when designing the crowns worn by Arthur and Guinevere. Lowery also felt the designs reinforced the "saintly" status of Arthur and Guinevere as representations of Christendom in the West. The decorative plaques on Arthur's cloak referenced the creative team's various interpretations of King Arthur, and also included references to Lowery's other works, such asA Ghost Story.[7]Turzanska also designed the golden cape worn by Gawain to represent the character's golden mantle from the original poem.[18]
No digital visual effects were used in creating the Green Knight during the Round Table scene. Lowery preferred this in order to give the character presence on set. Actor Ralph Ineson wore prosthetics designed by Barry Gower. Scenes involving the horse alternated with a false mount that was wheeled around with a dolly, after the initial horse used for the scenes would not cooperate with Ineson. Lowery stated that the crew used practical effects to make the Green Knight appear larger, such as mounting Ineson on platforms.[7]Digital effects were later used during the Green Knight's hibernation scene, including subtly transforming the knight's face into that of the other cast members.[18]Speaking about the subtle humor and lightness incorporated into the otherwise dark script, Lowery stated that near the end of the film, he directed Ineson to portray the Green Knight asSanta Claus.[19]
Lowery describes the film as being about the importance of comporting oneself with integrity and goodness over being concerned with one's legacy.[7]Though the question of Gawain's ultimate fate is left intentionally ambiguous, Lowery stated that he wanted the possibility of Gawain being beheaded to be "a positive thing... He faces his fate bravely, and there's honor and integrity in that. But that doesn't mean that he's dead, he's killed. He received the blow that he was dealt, and all is set right within the universe of the film."[18]The after-credits scene showing a young girl putting on a crown has been seen as "a tease of an alternate life that Gawain leads as king of Camelot, with his daughter (possibly even mothered by Essel) a sign of the happiness he found."[20]
The complicated relationship between Morgan le Fay and Gawain written for the film also evoked Lowery's experiences with his mother and needing to be pushed to stand on his own as an adult.[18]
The film also deals with the conflict between mankind and nature.[18][19]Lowery stated that monologue by Vikander's Lady Bertilak reflects both the symbolism of Arthurian Christian civilization being in conflict with paganism and nature and his own sentiment that nature will inevitably win over civilization and bring peace. The Green Knight's depiction as a tree-like entity also depicts nature and paganism invading the dull sanctum of the Round Table and Arthur's kingdom.[21]This is further emphasized by Lowery's decision to portray Arthur and Guinevere as sickly, alluding to the waning control of the civilization they represent.[18]
Originally,The Green Knightwas scheduled to have its world premiere at theSouth by Southwestfilm festival (SXSW) on March 16, 2020,[22]with a full theatrical release following on May 29.[23]TheCOVID-19 pandemic, however, forced the cancellation of SXSW and a mass closure of movie theatres worldwide. With no timeframe for when cinemas might reopen, some studios opted to release their new films throughvideo on demand(VOD). Lowery told theA24 Projectpodcast andIndieWirethat he would preferThe Green Knightto see a theatrical release, but that he was ultimately not in control over whether or not it opened on VOD.[24]
Later, Lowery revealed that he would have been unhappy with the cut ofThe Green Knightthat was set to debut at SXSW, and that he spent six months during the pandemic re-editing the film into something with which he could be satisfied.[25]In December 2020, A24 announced thatThe Green Knightwould receive a theatrical-only release, opening in US cinemas on July 30, 2021.[26]One streaming video option was available in the US: The A24 Screening Room allowed viewers to purchase a $20 ticket that allowed them to streamThe Green Knight, with an additional Q&A session with the cast and crew, during a four-hour window of their choice on the night of August 18.[27]Although the US release progressed as planned,Entertainment Film Distributorschose to pullThe Green Knightfrom UK cinemas two weeks before its scheduled theatrical release on August 6, citing the surge in COVID-19 cases from theDelta variant.[28]After some deliberation, Entertainment opted to releaseThe Green Knightsimultaneously in theaters and throughAmazon Prime Videoon September 24 in the UK.[29]
As part of a partnership between A24 andIMAX, the film was re-released exclusively in IMAX theaters for one night only on December 11, 2024.[30]
The Green Knightwas released on4K Ultra HD Blu-ray,Blu-ray,DVD, and digitally throughLionsgate Home Entertainmenton October 12, 2021.[31]While the Blu-ray release contained a number of special features that highlighted certain elements of the film's production, no deleted or alternate scenes fromThe Green Knightwere included.[32]
The Green Knightgrossed $17.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $2.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $20 million.[4][3]
In the United States and Canada,The Green Knightwas released alongsideJungle CruiseandStillwater, and was projected to gross around $4 million from 2,790 theaters in its opening weekend.[33]The film made $2.9 million on its first day, including $750,000 from Thursday night previews. It ended up slightly over-performing, debuting to $6.8 million and finished second at the box office behindJungle Cruise. The film played best in big markets such as New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.[34][35]The film fell 62% to $2.6 million in its second weekend, finishing sixth, then made $1.6 million in its third weekend.[36][37]
On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 89% based on 332 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critics consensus reads, "The Green Knighthonors and deconstructs its source material in equal measure, producing an absorbing adventure that casts a fantastical spell."[38]Metacriticassigned the film a weighted average score of 85 out of 100 based on 56 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[39]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale.[34]
Writing forVulture, Alison Willmore said that the film "is about someone who keeps waiting for external forces to turn him into the gallant, heroic figure he believes he should be", and added: "at the film's heart is a lesson that's as timeless as any legend — travel as far as you like, but you'll never be able to leave yourself behind."[40]Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comgave the film a score of 4 out of 4 stars, describing the film as "one of the most memorable films of the year, a fascinating swirl of masculinity, temptation, heroism, and religion", adding: "It's a film that embeds the concept of storytelling and performance into its narrative ... while also weaving its own enchanting spell on audiences."[41]Barry Hertz ofThe Globe and Maildescribed the film as "a beautiful, haunting and enigmatic work that reckons with the folklore's grave and tragic elements to deliver a masterpiece of blood, sex and magic", and praised Patel's performance as Gawain.[42]John Nugent ofEmpiregave the film a score of 5 out of 5 stars, describing it as "a rivetingly weird and exceptionally beautiful fantasy film that offers no easy answers but ponders the biggest questions", and wrote that the film was "Revisionist Fantasy, doing for the genre what the likes ofRobert AltmanorAlejandro Jodorowskydid with their Revisionist Westerns: bringing an avant-garde flair and an ambiguous morality to a previously occasionally cheesy and childlike world."[43]
Keith Watson ofSlant Magazinegave the film a score of 2.5 out of 4 stars, describing it as "a self-consciously revisionist take onCamelotlore", and wrote that the film "smooths out the enduring mysteries, opaque psychology, and narrative idiosyncrasies ofSir Gawain and the Green Knight, resulting in a work that's only superficially more daring and enigmatic than its source material."[44]Simon Abrams ofTheWrapwrote that "while there's a lot of commendable chutzpah and curious longing baked intoThe Green Knight, the movie's never as compelling as it is unusual."[45]
In December 2024,Colliderranked the film at number 2 on its list of the "10 Best Fantasy Movies of the 2020s," with Robert Lee III writing "David Lowery has always succeeded in this type of somber, yet undeniably large-scale filmmaking, withThe Green Knighteasily being the director's magnum opus."[46]

In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
