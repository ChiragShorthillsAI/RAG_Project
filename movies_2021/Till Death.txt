Emma is unhappily married to her cold and controlling husband, Mark, who works as acriminal attorney. After ending her affair with Tom, a partner at her husband's firm, Emma goes out with Mark to celebrate their anniversary. Mark surprises Emma with a necklace made of steel and drives her to a secluded lake house, which they used to visit early in their relationship. That evening, Mark apologizes for his past behavior, and they make love.
The next morning, Emma wakes to find herself handcuffed to Mark, who abruptly commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. Forced to drag his corpse everywhere she goes, Emma discovers that Mark destroyed her phone and removed every sharp item from the house. She eventually finds the keys to their SUV and reaches the garage. When she tries to start the vehicle, the engine won't turn over, and she sees that Mark hassiphonedout the gas tank. The car's audio plays a taunting message from Mark that reveals that he knew of her affair with Tom.
Hours later, Tom arrives at the lake house. He tells Emma that he was summoned by texts from her phone and that Mark was facingdisbarmentfor illegal activities at his practice. They both realize that Mark sent the messages to lure Tom just as a mysterious truck is seen approaching the house. Emma hides while Tom greets a man named Jimmy from the truck. Jimmy says that he is there to fix the plumbing and refuses to leave, despite Tom's attempts to dissuade him. Jimmy's brother, Bobby, gets out of the truck and stabs Tom to death. It is revealed that Bobby was a stalker who once attacked Emma and just got out of prison after he served 10 years.
Emma manages to evade the men and makes it to the boat shed. She uses an anchor to cut herself free from Mark's corpse and hides just as the men enter the shed. Emma overhears them reveal that Mark hired them to kill her and that they must find the diamonds that they were promised. Bobby suspects the diamonds are in the bedroom safe, which requires Mark's fingerprints and a code that Emma would know.
As the men search the house, Emma finds a fuel can and tries refueling the SUV, but Bobby slashed the tires. Emma then makes her way to the attic and lures the men there. She knocks Bobby out with a golf club and locks Jimmy into a nearby room. She attempts to escape in Tom's car, but Bobby intervenes. Emma manages to dial 911 on Tom's phone before she is knocked unconscious. She later wakes up in the bedroom and is once again cuffed to Mark's body.
Bobby tells Emma the safe's code is the date that Mark proposed to her. When she refuses to cooperate, Bobby threatens to torture her. Jimmy objects and points Mark's gun at Bobby. Emma agrees to reveal the code if she is set free first. Emma is uncuffed and tells them the code. Bobby opens the safe, only to find a hacksaw inscribed with a clue that implies the diamonds are in Emma's necklace, which has no latch and is impossible to remove. Bobby realizes that the necklace can be retrieved only by decapitating Emma. Jimmy tries wrestling the saw away from Bobby but is accidentally impaled on a coat hook, which kills him. Enraged, Bobby attacks Emma and stabs her in the leg. She manages to fight him off and cuff Bobby to Mark's body.
Emma makes it to Tom's SUV, with Bobby in pursuit. She hits Bobby with the SUV but crashes into the boat shed, getting the truck stuck in the snow. Emma exits the truck and fights Bobby on the frozen lake. She stabs Bobby in the shoulder just as the ice gives way. Mark's corpse falls into the lake and drags Bobby with him. Bobby manages to grab Emma and to pull her in as well. As they sink, Emma grabs the knife out of Bobby's shoulder and stabs him in the eye. Mark's body drags Bobby down to his death as Emma swims up to the surface.
Lying atop the ice, Emma removes herwedding ringand lets it roll into the lake as sirens are heard approaching in the background.

Writing forThe New York Times, Beatrice Loayza said that "this straightforward romp focuses its attention on its cunning and no-nonsense scream queen. And what Fox lacks in dramatic prowess, she makes up for in pure, wicked magnetism."[14]In his review forVariety, Manuel Betancourt said that, "Even as the twists and turns get ever more preposterous ... Dale’s direction and Fox’s commitment go a long way toward makingTill Deatha glossy, entertaining lark."[1]Waldemar Dalenogare Netodeclared that the film works because of Fox and said that he hoped that because of the "positive repercussions she would look for better roles ... [this] is an interesting film for those who like thriller."[15]

In a review forCommon Sense Media, Jeffrey M. Anderson said that "after a shaky start, this taut, vicious horror/thriller crackles to life with a dark sense of logic, a harrowing depiction of mental and emotional abuse, and a woman's boundless strength... it ultimately makes more sense than anySaw-related deathtraps."[20]The previously mentionedMovieWebreview called SK Dale's debut "brilliant" and said, "He nails theHitchcockianaspects of the narrative."[17]Tomris Laffly, ofRogerEbert.com, called the film "undemanding, a little silly, but a thoroughly engrossing and handsomely paced edge-of-your-seat experience all the same."[21]

Millennium Media(formerlyNu ImageandMillennium Films) is an American independent film production and financing company that was founded byAvi Lerner, Trevor Short, Danny Dimbort and Danny Lerner in 1992, and is one of Hollywood's[1]longest running independent film companies.[2]Millennium creates, produces, finances, and sells[3]films worldwide. The company producesaction films, most of which are filmed primarily inSouth AfricaandBulgaria(by 2005, it acquiredNu Boyana Film Studios),[4]among other locations.
In the mid-1980s,The Cannon Group, Inc.began expanding its operation into Africa, taking advantage of cheap locations and labor in countries such asZimbabweandSouth Africa.Avi Lerneropened Nu Metro Entertainment, a film production company based inJohannesburgto accommodate production demands in the countries.[5]During this time, Lerner executive produced many films, such asAmerican Ninja 2: The ConfrontationandRiver of Deathfor Cannon as well asHowling IV: The Original NightmareforHarry Alan Towers.
After pressure from anti-apartheid forces, Cannon closed its African operations in 1988,[6]Lerner created a new company, Nu Image, to produce original, low budget films alongside his brother Danny Lerner and otherCannonemployees Trevor Short, Danny Dimbort andBoaz Davidson.[5]
From 1992, Nu Image began producing multiple films a year, mainly in the action genre. Many of its films wentdirect-to-video, however some, such asShark Attackdebuted ontelevision. Many stars, writers and directors fromThe Cannon Group, Inc.appeared in films for Nu Image, includingDavid Bradley,Michael Dudikoff,Sam FirstenbergandBilly Drago. They also built a new generation of action talent such asBryan Genesse[7]andJoe Lara.[8]
However, their efforts to break into the mainstream withmockbusterssuch asFreefallstarringEric Roberts,Jeff FaheyandPamela Gidley, created to capitalise on the success ofSylvester Stallone'sCliffhangerfailed to make much of an impact.Freefallended up goingdirect-to-video.[9]
After the successes ofcreature featuressuch asAnacondaandDeep Blue Seareleased in the late 1990s, Nu Image produced a spate of low budget franchises to capitalise on the trend including;Tobe Hooper'sCrocodile,Shark Attack,Spiders,Killer Rats,OctopusandRaging Sharksand various sequels were produced from 1999 to 2005. While not critically successful, the films were extremely successful on television and home media.
In 1999, Nu Image formed a subsidiary label, Millennium Films, for higher-budget productions. From the mid-2000s, the main Nu Image company gradually began producing fewer films, with Millennium Films releasing more with a greater level of financing than previously.
In 2005, it purchasedNu Boyana Film Studiosin Bulgaria.[10]
In March 2007, Nu Image acquired a controlling 52% stake in independent film and home video companyFirst Look Studios. As a result, Nu Image and Millennium Films were given an additional outlet for home video and theatrical distribution.[11]
One of the first films to be produced by Millennium Films was the remakeThe Wicker ManstarringNicolas Cage.[12]The film was a critical and commercial failure.[13][14]They continued on with a focus onsequelsandremakesof notable properties such asDay of the Dead[15]andRambo.[16]After the commercial success ofRambo,[17][18]Millennium Films entered into a multi-year deal withLionsgateto produce several big-budgeted films, the first of which wasConan the Barbarian.[19]The deal would be extended over the years with successful box-office hits (The Mechanic[20]) andbox office bombs(The Legend of Hercules[21]). Another notable success wasOlympus Has FallenstarringGerard Butler.[22]
In November 2010, First Look filed for bankruptcy. Nu Image formed Millennium Entertainment, LLC to assume the assets of First Look.[23]
Millennium Entertainment was sold in August 2014. The company's library and distribution assets had been sold to a consortium consisting of its current management and Virgo Investment Group. The new owners renamed the companyAlchemyin January 2015, finally cutting ties to its former sister company Millennium Films, which remained under the control ofAvi Lerner.[24]Alchemy filed forChapter 7 Bankruptcyon June 30, 2016.[25]
In 2017, a deal was reached withThe Recon Group, a Chinese investment firm, for them to purchase a majority stake in the Millennium Films subsidiary.[26]The deal was signed and a $20 million downpayment was secured.[27]However, this deal was later announced to be off in August 2017 due to the Chinese government clamping down on overseas business investments.[28]The same year, Millennium Films was merged into Nu Image to form Millennium Media.
In 2017, Millennium faced sexual harassment allegations alleging hostile workplace and rampant sexual harassment and gender disparity.[29]
In 2018, actor Terry Crews testified in front of Congress that he had been threatened by Avi Lerner of Millennium Media not to testify in his sexual assault case.[30]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
