Corey Todd Taylor was born on December 8, 1973, inDes Moines, Iowa.[5][6]He was mostly raised by his single mother inWaterloo, Iowa, and described it as a "hole in the ground with buildings around it".[6]He is of German, Irish and Native American descent on his father's side, and Dutch and Irish on his mother's side.[7]Taylor, along with his mother and younger half-sister, would often move around the country in search for job prospects. By the time he was 15, he had "already lived in 25 states".[8]Around 1979, Taylor and his mother saw thesci-fiseriesBuck Rogers in the 25th Century. Before the series, there was a trailer for the 1978 horror filmHalloween. Taylor said this "developed some sense of Slipknot in [himself]".[6]WhileHalloweenintroduced Taylor to masks and horror themes, Taylor's grandmother introduced him torock music, showing him a collection ofElvis Presleyrecords from the 1950s to 1970s. He especially found songs like "Teddy Bear", "In the Ghetto", and "Suspicious Minds" to appeal to his interests the most, describing them as "good times".[6]Taylor also began listening toBlack Sabbathat a young age, beginning with their early work.[6]He decided he wanted to become a singer when he and his cousin were singing along toJourney's "Separate Ways".[9]
In 1983, when he was nine years old, his mother and her boyfriend moved toFort Lauderdale, Florida, to become security guards forBurt Reynolds' ranch. However, as they were driving there, they got stranded inGeorgiaand he lost some of his possessions.[8]By age 15, he had developed a drug addiction and had overdosed oncocainetwice.[10][11]By this time, he was living inWaterloo, but some time after this overdose, he returned to visit his grandmother in Des Moines, and according to Taylor, "stayed and never went back [to his mother's house]." She took legal custody of him so that he could continue going to school, and she helped him buy musical equipment. He would later describe his grandmother as his "strongest influence" as well as his "rock, foundation and stability."[12][1][13]When Taylor was 18, he left his grandmother's house and went to various places in Iowa, Des Moines being a place to which he frequently returned.[14]Taylor attendedLincoln High Schoolin Des Moines but did not graduate. He later earned hisGED.[15][9]
In 2017, on an episode ofViceland'sThe Therapist, Taylor revealed that he wassexually abusedat the age of 10 by a 16-year-old friend. Taylor stated that he never told anyone about the incident until he was "probably 18" because his abuser had "...threatened to hurt me and threatened to hurt my mom".[16]At age 18, when Taylor was living with his grandmother, he attempted suicide by way of overdose. His ex-girlfriend's mother drove him to the hospital in Des Moines and doctors were able to resuscitate him.[1]He describes this as the lowest point in his life.[17]
Taylor is a founding member of Americanhard rockbandStone Sour. After he formed the band in 1992[18]with drummer Joel Ekman,Shawn Economakijoined filling in the bass position, leaving the electric guitar position to be filled byJosh Rand. Stone Sour recorded ademo albumin 1993, and another in 1994. In 1997, Taylor was approached by the metal band, Slipknot, resulting in him abandoning Stone Sour while they were recording a demo album with Sean McMahon at SR studios.[19][20]Taylor did not return until five years later to record their debut album,Stone Sourin 2002. Both Taylor and guitarist Josh Rand contactedJim Root, Slipknot's guitarist, and Shawn Economaki, Stone Sour's original bassist, to begin writing songs for their debut album.[21]Drummer Joel Ekman came back on board as well.[22][23]This "reformation" later resulted in Stone Sour recording at Catamount Studios inCedar Falls, Iowa.[22][24]
Their self-titled debut album was released August 27, 2002, and it debuted at number 46 on theBillboard200.[25]Their second album,Come What(ever) Maydebuted at number four on the Billboard 200.[25]It was released August 1, 2006, and charted on several different charts.[25][26][27]Live in Moscowis currently their only album specifically released only for download.[28]During the recording of the album, drummerJoel Ekmanleft the band for personal reasons. As a result, drummerRoy Mayorgawas recruited, taking his place.[29]The group released their third studio album,Audio Secrecy, on September 7, 2010.[30]
Later, Corey Taylor announced the release of a concept double album with Stone Sour. The albums are titled "House of Gold & Bones".

Thefirst partwas released in October 2012 and thesecond partin April 2013. There are 23 songs in total, 11 on the first part and 12 on the second. In addition to these two albums is a four-part comic book series written by Taylor and published byDark Horse Comics, which went on sale in 2013. With these albums came a story that was written by Taylor that coincide with the album. Fans can also construct a miniature "house of gold and bones" from the packaging design of the physical versions of the two albums. Taylor has also said that he would like to finish off the project by making the story into a movie but nothing has come of this yet.[31][32][33]
In Des Moines, Iowa,Joey Jordison,Shawn Crahan, andMick Thomsonapproached him asking him to join Slipknot.[19]He agreed to go to one of their practices, and ended up singing in front of them.

Performing with Slipknot, he would also come to be known as "Number Eight", since the band follows a numbering scheme for its members, ranging from 0–8. According toShawn Crahan, Corey wanted number eight, because it symbolizesinfinity.[34]
Feeling he could expand more inside Slipknot than in Stone Sour, Taylor temporarily quit Stone Sour, even though they were recording an album with Sean McMahon.[20]Taylor's first gig with Slipknot was on August 24, 1997,[35]which according to band members did not go well. During his first gig, Taylor was performing with facepaint instead of a mask; however, for his second show on September 12, he wore a mask that resembles hisdebut albummask.[36]Taylor has recorded with Slipknot since the release of their seconddemo album, a self-titled demo used to promote the band to prospective labels and producers.[37]As their permanent vocalist, he recorded with Slipknot at Indigo Ranch inMalibu, California, and releasedSlipknot, the band's debut album that peaked at number one on theTop Heatseekerschart,[38][39]went double platinum in the United States,[40]and was included in the 2006 book1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.[41]Taylor was accused ofcopyright infringementregarding the lyrics of the song "Purity", but no action was taken.[42]Taylor began recording for their second studio album,Iowa, in 2001 at Sound City and Sound Image inVan Nuys, Los Angeles.[43]It was released August 28, 2001, and peaked at number one on theUK Albums Chart,[44]as well as number three on theBillboard200.[45]While writingVol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses), Taylor decided to write lyrics that would not warrant an explicit label.[46]It peaked at number two on theBillboard200.[47]All Hope Is Gonewas the first Slipknot album to peak at number one on theBillboard200.[48]

Taylor recently admitted that he tried out for the vacant singer spot in the bandVelvet Revolver, but said that it just did not work out.[62]However, according to a recentBillboardarticle, it seems likely that he may in fact become the vocalist for Velvet Revolver, though no official confirmation has been made.[63]Duff McKaganadded that they can neither "confirm or deny" Taylor's membership in the band but believes that Taylor is the "real deal".[64]Slashhas since ruled Taylor out as the possible new vocalist explaining that "[it] just wasn't right" although he does love him.[65]Taylor has, however, recorded 10 new songs with the band, although drummerMatt Sorumstated it is unlikely they will ever be released.[66]Taylor explained toMark HoppusonHoppus on Musicthat he and McKagan were writing new music for a possible new supergroup.[67]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
