Filming was initially set to begin in April 2020 inMassachusetts, but it was delayed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic; it eventually began in November 2020 and wrapped in February 2021.[8][9]
Don't Look Upbegan a limited theatrical release on December 10, 2021, before streaming on Netflix on December 24. It was praised for the cast's performances and the musical score, but critics were divided on the merits of McKay's satire; some found it deft, while others criticized it as smug and heavy-handed.Don't Look Upwas named one of the top ten films of 2021 by theNational Board of ReviewandAmerican Film Institute. It received fourAcademy Awardnominations (includingBest Picture), fourGolden Globe Awardnominations (includingBest Picture – Musical or Comedy), sixCritics' Choice Awardnominations, (includingBest Picture), and also wonBest Original Screenplayat the74th Writers Guild of America Awards. The film set a new record for the most viewing hours in a single week on Netflix, and went on to become thesecond-most-watched movie on Netflixwithin 28 days of release.
Kate Dibiasky, a doctoral candidate inastronomyatMichigan State University, discovers an unknowncomet. Her professor, Doctor Randall Mindy, confirms that it will collide with Earth in approximately six months and is large enough to cause a globalextinction event.NASAverifies the findings, and Dr. Teddy Oglethorpe, head of theirPlanetary Defense Coordination Office, accompanies Dibiasky and Mindy to present their findings to theWhite House. However, they are met with apathy fromPresidentJanie Orlean and herChief of StaffJason Orlean, who is also her son.
Oglethorpe encourages Dibiasky and Mindy to leak the news to the media, which they then do, onThe Daily Rip, a popularmorning talk show. When hosts Jack Bremmer and Brie Evantee treat the topic lightly, Dibiasky loses her temper and angrily rants about the threat before she flees the scene. Mindy receives public approval for his looks, while Dibiasky becomes the subject of negativememesfor her on-air behavior. Actual news about the comet's threat receives little public attention, and the danger is denied by Orlean's NASA Director Jocelyn Calder, a topdonorto Orlean with no background in astronomy. When news of Orlean'ssex scandalwith her Supreme Court nominee Sheriff Conlon is exposed, she distracts from the bad publicity by finally confirming the threat and announcing a project tostrike and divert the cometusingnuclear weapons.
The mission successfully launches, but Orlean abruptly aborts it when Peter Isherwell, the billionaire CEO of BASH Cellular and another top donor, discovers that the comet contains trillions of dollars worth ofrare-earth elements. The White House agrees to commercially exploit the comet by fragmenting and recovering it from the ocean, using technology proposed by BASH in a scheme that has not undergonepeer review. Orlean sidelines Dibiasky and Oglethorpe while hiring Mindy as theNational Science Advisor. Dibiasky attempts to mobilize public opposition to the scheme but gives up under threat from Orlean's administration. Mindy becomes a prominent voice advocating for the comet's commercial opportunities and begins an affair with Evantee.
World opinion is divided among people who believe the comet is a severe threat, those who decry alarmism and believe that mining a destroyed comet will create jobs, and those who deny that the comet even exists. When Dibiasky returns home toIllinois, her parents kick her out of the house and she begins a relationship with a young man named Yule, a shoplifter she meets at her retail job. After Mindy's wife confronts him about his infidelity, she returns to Michigan without him. Mindy questions whether Isherwell's technology will be able to break apart the comet, angering the billionaire. Becoming frustrated with the administration, Mindy finally breaks down and rants on national television, criticizing Orlean for downplaying the impending apocalypse and questioning humanity's indifference.
Cut off from the administration, Mindy reconciles with Dibiasky as the comet becomes visible from Earth. Mindy, Dibiasky, and Oglethorpe organize a protest campaign onsocial media, telling people to "Just Look Up" and call on other countries to conduct comet interception operations. Simultaneously, Orlean starts an anti-campaign telling people "Don't Look Up". Orlean and BASH cutRussia,India, andChinaout of the rights for the comet-mining deal, so they prepare their own joint deflection mission, only for their spacecraft to explode. As the comet becomes larger in the sky, Orlean's supporters start turning on her administration. BASH's attempt at breaking the comet apart goes awry and everyone realizes that humanity is doomed.
Isherwell, Orlean, and others in their elite circle board asleeper spaceshipdesigned to find anEarth-like planet, inadvertently leaving Jason behind. Orlean offers Mindy two places on the ship, but he declines, choosing to spend a final evening with his friends and family. As expected, the comet strikes off the coast ofChile, causing a worldwide disaster and triggering anextinction-level event. In amid-credits scene, the 2,000 people who left Earth before the comet's impact land on a lush alien planet 22,740 years later, ending their period ofsuspended animation. They exit their spacecraft naked and admire the habitable world. However, Orlean is suddenly killed by a bird-like predator (a death predicted by BASH's algorithms), one of a pack that surrounds the planetary newcomers. In apost-credits sceneback on Earth, it is revealed that Jason managed to survive the impact. He records himself, declaring himself the "last man on Earth" and asking any viewers still alive to "like and subscribe".
Other cast members include Kevin Craig West as theSecretary of State; Erik Parillo as Sheriff Conlon, Orlean's choice forSupreme CourtJustice who ends up in a sex scandal with Orlean;Jon Glaseras Meow Man; Sarah Nolen as the puppeteer of Sammy; Allyn Burrows as Mr. Dibiasky, the father of Kate; and Tori Davis Lawlor as Mrs. Dibiasky, the mother of Kate.

Produced byHyperobject IndustriesandBluegrass Films, the film was announced in November 2019 and sold byParamount PicturestoNetflixseveral months later. Lawrence became the first member of the cast to join, with DiCaprio signing on after his discussions with McKay on adjustments to the script; the rest of the cast was added through 2020.
This movie came from my burgeoning terror about the climate crisis and the fact that we live in a society that tends to place it as the fourth or fifth news story, or in some cases even deny that it's happening, and how horrifying that is, but at the same time preposterously funny.[12]
AfterVicewas released,David SirotaaskedAdam McKayto use his "superpowers of humor and writing" to create aclimate changemovie that would be different from theMad Max-type post-apocalyptic films that had previously been released.[13]In an interview withEntertainment Weekly, McKay described how he and Sirota came up with the premise ofDon't Look Upwhile discussing the existential threat ofclimate changeand their frustration over the lack ofmedia coverageit was receiving:
I started talking to a lot of [climate] scientists. I kept looking for good news, and I never got it. Everything I was hearing was worse than what I was hearing on the mainstream media. So I was talking to [David Sirota], and we were both just like, "can you believe that this isn't being covered in the media? That it's being pushed to the end of the story? That there's no headlines?" And Sirota just offhandedly said, "it's like a comet is heading to Earth and it's going to destroy us all and no one cares." And I was like, "that's the idea!"[14]
McKay has described the film as a "blend of broad comedy" with elements of disaster films and horror films.[15]
AstronomerAmy Mainzer, principal investigator ofNASA'sNEOWISEmission that tracksnear-Earth objects, served as an "astrotech adviser" for the film. She provided scientific advice and supported with writing scenes from an early stage of production.[16][17]
On November 8, 2019, it was announced thatParamount Pictureswould distribute the film, withAdam McKaywriting, directing, and producing under hisHyperobject Industriesbanner.[18]On February 19, 2020, Netflix acquired the film from Paramount andJennifer Lawrencewas cast in the film.[19]On May 12, 2020, it was announced thatCate Blanchetthad joined the film.[20]In September 2020,Rob Morganjoined the cast.[21]In October 2020,Leonardo DiCaprio,Meryl Streep,Jonah Hill,Himesh Patel,Timothée Chalamet,Ariana Grande,Kid Cudi (Scott Mescudi), andTomer Sisleywere added.[22][23]McKay wrote the part of Dibiasky specifically for Lawrence, and spent four to five months going over ideas with DiCaprio, tweaking the script before the actor ultimately signed on.[24]In November 2020,Tyler Perry,Melanie Lynskey, andRon Perlmanjoined the cast.[25]Mark RylanceandMichael Chikliswere revealed as part of the cast in February 2021.[26]Paul Guilfoylewas announced in May.[27]Matthew Perrywas also cast and had scenes filmed with Hill that were ultimately cut from the final film due to health issues.[28]Gina Gershonalso filmed a scene with DiCaprio and Blanchett that was cut from the film.[29]Leonardo DiCaprio receivedtop billingon the film's posters and the trailers while Jennifer Lawrence was accorded top billing at the beginning of the film itself. This was also the case with earlier productionsThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance(1962) withJames StewartandJohn WayneandAll the President's Men(1976) withRobert RedfordandDustin Hoffman.
Principal photographywas delayed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[30]Filming commenced on November 18, 2020, at various locations inBoston, Massachusetts.[31]Part of the film takes place inNew York Citywith Boston standing in as New York. Filming also took place in other Massachusetts cities includingBrockton,Framingham, andWestborough.[a][32][33]On February 5, 2021, Jennifer Lawrence was mildly injured during filming when a controlled glass explosion went awry.[34]Filming wrapped on February 18, 2021.[35]
On December 6, 2023, Adam McKay, along with Netflix, was sued for copyright infringement overDon't Look Up. William Collier, an author from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, claimed that he is the original writer of the story, set in Baton Rouge, called "Stanley's Comet", which he self-published in 2012. Collier's daughter worked for Jimmer Miller Entertainment, part of McKay's management team until 2015. Collier alleges that his daughter submitted the text to Mosaic Media Group and it was then received by McKay's manager. "Since Stanley’s Comet was received by McKay’s manager, custom and practice in the entertainment industry dictates that this constitutes receipt by McKay," writes Steven Lowe, a lawyer for Collier, in the suit. "Furthermore, upon information and belief, the Novel was transmitted via courier, email or hand-delivery (or via other means) to McKay himself."[36]
"The movie, like the novel, makes a strong political critique of the media, the government, and the cultural elite by showcasing their shallowness and reliance on popular opinion polls and social media algorithms," writes USC professor of comparative literature David Roman. "McKay’s film is also full of satire and humor and — like Stanley’s Comet — moves toward the absurd. In each case, the irony drives the humor and the social critique and does so in the same style and method."[36]
To promote the film, on December 3, 2021, Ariana Grande and Kid Cudi released the single "Just Look Up", which is also performed in the film.[37]The original score for the film is composed byNicholas Britell, who previously scored McKay'sThe Big Short(2015),Vice(2018) and theHBOtelevision seriesSuccession(2019–2022); McKay served as an executive producer of the latter. He used a wide range of instrumentation that reflect varied music styles and genres.[38][39]He did this so as to give a remainder on the existential crisis on the planet following a catastrophic event as well as the absurdity of how people react to it.[40]Apart from "Just Look Up", the film also featured "Second Nature" byBon Iver, which was released along with Britell's score album on December 10, byRepublic Records, and "Doorman" bySlowthai.[41]
On February 19, 2020, it was announced thatNetflixplanned to release the film in 2020.[19]Due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, filming and release of the film were delayed.[42]The film premiered inNew York Cityon December 5, 2021.[43]It received alimited theatrical releaseon December 10, and began streaming on Netflix on December 24.[44][45]The film made an estimated $260,000 from 500 theaters on its first day, and a total of $700,000 in its opening weekend.[46]
Don't Look Upwas the most-streamed English-language film on Netflix during its first week of release with a viewership of 111.03 million hours,[47]the second highest viewership for a movie during its debut weekend on Netflix.[48]It was the second most-streamed-film of the week in the United States according toTV Time.[49]PerNielsen, the film had a viewership of 1.6 billion minutes in the United States.[50]In the second week, it retained its first position with a viewership of 152.29 million hours,[51]which also set the record for highest weekly viewership for any film ever on Netflix.[52][53]
For its first 28 days, the film culminated a viewership of 359.8 million hours, making it the second most-watched film within 28 days of release on Netflix during this period of time.[54]By March 20, the film had been streamed in 10.3 million households in the United States according toSamba TV, including 641,000 since the Oscar nomination announcements on February 8.[55]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 55% of 305 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's consensus reads: "Don't Look Upaims too high for its scattershot barbs to consistently land, but Adam McKay's star-studded satire hits its target of collective denial square on."[56]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 49 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[57]
TheSan Francisco Chronicle'sMick LaSallepraised the film, "Don't Look Upmight be the funniest movie of 2021. It's the most depressing too, and that odd combination makes for a one-of-a-kind experience. ... McKay gives you over two hours of laughs while convincing you that the world is coming to an end."[58]Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars and said: "From Streep and DiCaprio and Lawrence through the supporting players,Don't Look Upis filled with greatly talented actors really and truly selling this material—but the volume remains at 11 throughout the story when some changes in tone here and there might have more effectively carried the day."[59]In theLos Angeles Times,Justin Changwrote, "Nothing about the foolishness and outrageousness of what the movie shows us—no matter how virtuosically sliced and diced by McKay's characteristically jittery editor, Hank Corwin—can really compete with the horrors of our real-world American idiocracy."[60]Amit Katwala ofWiredconcluded that "Don't Look Upnails the frustration of being a scientist."[61]Linda Marric ofThe Jewish Chroniclegave the film 4/5 stars, writing: "There is something genuinely endearing about a film that doesn't seem to care one bit about coming across as silly as long as its message is heard".[62]
In a negative review, David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reportercalled it "A cynical, insufferably smug satire stuffed to the gills with stars that purports to comment on political and media inattention to the climate crisis but really just trivializes it.Dr. Strangeloveit ain't."[63]Peter Debruge ofVarietycalled it a "smug, easy-target political satire" and wrote, "Don't Look Upplays like the leftie answer toArmageddon—which is to say, it ditches theBruckheimerapproach of assembling a bunch of blue-collar heroes to rocket out to space and nuke the approaching comet, opting instead to spotlight the apathy, incompetence and financial self-interest of all involved."[64]InThe Guardian, Charles Bramesco wrote that the "script states the obvious as if everyone else is too stupid to realize it and does so from a position of lofty superiority that would drive away any partisans who still need to be won over."[65]InThe Sociological Review, Katherine Cross accused the film of "smug condescension" and wrote it "is designed to flatter a certain type of liberal viewer into feeling like they're the last sane person in the world, surrounded by morons."[66]
Reviews from right-wing publications were nearly unanimously negative. Madeline Fry Schultz of theAmerican conservativepublicationWashington Examinerwrote "McKay manages to deliver nothing more than a derivative and meandering 'satire' of capitalism, Donald Trump, and climate deniers that will be forgotten in less than six months."[67]Kyle Smithof theNational Reviewwrote it "expends 140 brain-injuriously unfunny minutes... propelling low-velocity spitballs at social media, Washington, tech moguls,Trumpism, and (this detail feels thrown in last minute) anti-vaxxers."[68]
Nathan J. Robinson, editor of American progressive publicationCurrent Affairs, believes that "critics were not only missing the point of the film in important ways, but that the very way they discussed the film exemplified the problem that the film was trying to draw attention to. Some of the responses to the movie could have appeared in the movie itself."[69]Slavoj Žižek, writing inCompact, said "critics were displeased by the light tone ofDon't Look Up!, claiming it trivializes the ultimate apocalypse. What really bothered these critics is the exact opposite: The film highlights trivialization that permeates not only the establishment, but even the protesters."[70]InThe Guardian,Catherine Bennettviewed the film as astute and was caustic about the critical reviews.[71]Journalist and environmental activistGeorge Monbiotwrote that "no wonder journalists have slated it ... it's about them" and added that for environmental activists like himself, the film, while fast‑paced and humorous, "seemed all too real".[72]Author and activistNaomi Kleinmentions it in her 2023 bookDoppelganger: A Trip Into the Mirror Worldby saying that "Kate's plight perfectly mirrors the bizarre contradictions of our high-stakes moment in planetary history: we are all trapped inside economic and social structures that encourage us to obsessively perfect our miniscule selves even as we know, if only on a subconscious level, that we are in the very last years when it might still be possible to avert an existential planetary crisis."[73]
Bong Joon-ho, director ofParasite, includedDon't Look Upas one of his favorites of 2021.[74]
Since the film's release, numerousclimate scientistsandclimate communicatorshave offered positive opinions on the film.[75][76][77]
In an opinion piece published inThe Guardian, climate scientistPeter Kalmusremarked, "Don't Look Upis satire. But speaking as a climate scientist doing everything I can to wake people up and avoid planetary destruction, it's also the most accurate film about society's terrifying non-response to climate breakdown I've seen."[78]Climate scientistMichael E. Mannalso expressed support for the film, calling it "serious sociopolitical commentary posing as comedy".[79]In an article forScientific American,Rebecca Oppenheimerquestioned the film's use of a comet impact as an effective metaphor for climate change, given the large differences in timescale of these differing potentialextinctioncrisis events and the nature of their impacts, but praised its depiction of sciencedenialismand depiction of a botched attempt to address a "planet-killer" comet.[16]Climate policy expertAyana Elizabeth Johnsonand McKay wrote a joint op-ed inThe Guardianadvocating for the value of humour in promoting action on climate change, in contrast with othermedia coverage.[80]
Writing inPhysics World, Laura Hiscott said that this "genuinely funny and entertaining film" would appeal to scientists, who would appreciate the "nods to academia such as the importance ofpeer review, the 'publish or perish' problem and the issue of senior academics getting the credit for their PhD students' discoveries".[81]
One of the scenes in the film was compared on social media to a situation inBrazil. In that situation,microbiologistand science communicatorNatália Pasternak Taschnercriticized a news report made byTV Culturaon a live broadcast in December 2020. They told the Brazilian population to face theCOVID-19 pandemicwith "lightness", minimizing the risks. They also put pressure on the public to be content and uncritical of theJair Bolsonaroadministration's lack of effective response to the pandemic.[82]Hearing about the comparisons, Pasternak thanked McKay, DiCaprio and Lawrence onTwitter, with the video subtitled in English, for the "incredible" film.[83]
The topic ofscience communicationis at the forefront of the film, as it revolves around Mindy and Dibiasky, two scientists, struggling to share the news of their discovery with politicians, talk show hosts, and civilians who are ignorant about the scientific facts of humanity's impending destruction by Comet Dibiasky. Many academic scholars of media and communication have written commentaries that analyze and critique the portrayal of science communication in the film.[citation needed]
In theJournal of Science Communication, Niels G. Mede writes "the film depicts sharp partisan divides, strong affective polarization, high distrust toward science within certain social milieus, and pronounced news mediasensationalism, which have been found to be characteristic of the United States but not, or to a lesser extent, of several countries other than the US."[143]From the same journal, writer Julie Doyle remarked that, "yet, as the film critiques existing structures and systems it does not imagine an alternative set of realities, nor explain the comet's cause. In focusing upon the fictional stories of scientists, politicians, and media celebrities, the film fails to center any marginalized voices, continuing to privilege global north perspectives, even as these are satirised."[144]Doyle comments that "climate communication needs to keep in place both climate mitigation and adaptation, making the historical and structural inequalities of capitalism and colonialism the interconnected stories of both."[144]
One solution to Mindy and Dibiasky's failed attempts to communicate the severity of the impending comet is undergoingmedia training, which was brought up in the film multiple times, such as at the conference room at theNew York Heraldwhere the Chief Editor proposes media training to Mindy before the show. The concept of media training can come in different forms. Samer Angelone, in a commentary journal on science communication, writes, "The style that scientists use to communicate science to peer scientists is mostly objective, complex, and full of technical jargon, which is difficult for the general public to connect to—even if it is in the same language."[145]Another way to mitigate science skepticism is through storytelling. Mede writes, "The film also illustrates that storytelling can be a promising strategy to mitigate these reservations ... showing how Mindy is advised before a TV interview that he is 'just telling a story' and must 'keep it simple.'"[143]
Gendered discourse on emotions and mental health make its way into the film through the portrayal of the public's reaction to Mindy and Dibiasky's various media appearances. The scientists share their discovery on a morning talk show,The Daily Rip, in which Dibiasky has an emotional outburst over the show hosts' persistent attempts to sugarcoat the devastating news of the doomsday comet. Professor of media and communication Julie Doyle writes, "Gendered normsaffect Mindy and Dibiasky's public credibility and the mitigatory comet actions they promote. Following his own emotional outburst on TV, Mindy is subsequently recuperated through processes of celebritisation ... hailed as a 'sexy' scientist offering rational and calm advice to the viewers; becoming chief science advisor to the White House to monitor the drone activities of tech billionaire Peter Isherwell; and embarking on a sexual affair with Evantee. In contrast, Dibiasky is discredited and side-lined from rational public commentary through (climate) memes."[144]
Throughout the film, many historic figures from science and politics can be spotted, adding to the film's nuanced discussion about the relationship between science and politics.
The opening scene of the film features a figure ofCarl Saganon Dibiasky's desk. In a journal commentary forScience Communication, Samer Angelone writes that "Sagan was an astronomer, planetary scientist, cosmologist, astrophysicist, and astrobiologist but, above all, he was an upholder of scientific credibility and communication."[145]Sagan advocated for the urgency to battle climate change, and many viewers see the film as an allegory for him, but his image is juxtaposed by a painting ofGeorge W. Bush, "who later tried to downplay this urgency."[143]The film also "references the affinity of anti-science resentment and populism, showing how President Orlean and her team slander Mindy and Dibiasky using populist rhetoric ... and gather in an Oval Office that has a portrait of the anti-establishment science skeptic Andrew Jackson."[143]
The film ends with a scene that reflects theLast Supper. Dr. Mindy, his family, Kate, Yule, and Teddy all sit around a dinner table and engage in a hand-held prayer, spoken by Yule. After the prayer, Kate Dibiasky gives Yule a kiss, and moments later Comet Dibiasky destroys Earth.[146]

Lynskey was born inNew Plymouth, New Zealand, to Kay Barbara (Mahoney), a real estate agent, and Tim Lynskey, an orthopedic surgeon.[7]She has Irish, English, and Scottish ancestry; her surname originates in Ireland.[8][9]Lynskey played an active role in the raising of her siblings;[10]she is the eldest of five children, and has three brothers and one sister.[9]She was raised in theBaptistfaith.[11]
When she was six, Lynskey's family moved to England for one year before returning to New Zealand.[9][12]She recalls moving "a lot" due to her father's profession: "My dad was a medical student when I was born, so he was studying and going to different universities. And then he was doing his residency, so I was always the new kid in school".[13]She later attendedNew Plymouth Girls' High School, where she was involved in the drama department and school plays.[9]She has spoken about being shy at school and finding comfort in acting: "It was so freeing, having someone give me the words to say and not being myself for a minute. It just felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders".[14]After graduating high school, Lynskey studied for a year and a half atVictoria University of Wellington, majoring in English literature,[15]but dropped out to focus on her film career.[16]
Lynskey's professional debut came at age 15 with a starring role inHeavenly Creatures, a psychological drama based on a 1950smurder case.[17]Lynskey portrayed Pauline Parker, a schoolgirl who conspires to kill her mother. She auditioned for the role when a casting director visited her high school;[18]prior to this, five hundred girls had been considered for the part, but "none were right".[19]Fran Walsh, who co-wrote the screenplay, admired Lynskey's "quiet intensity" and said, "We knew immediately that she was right for the role".[19]Lynskey turned 16 during the making ofHeavenly Creaturesand was 17 by the time of its release in 1994.[17]Critics were effusive about the performances, especially those of Lynskey and her co-star,Kate Winslet.[20][21][22]Roger Ebertcomplimented the film's director,Peter Jackson, on picking "the right two actresses", noting that "There is a way Lynskey has of looking up from beneath glowering eyebrows that lets you know her insides are churning"[23]whileRichard Corlisswrote in his review forTime:
The film's serendipitous stroke was to find Winslet and, especially, Lynskey, a first-time actress. They are perfect, fearless in embodying teenage hysteria. They declaim their lines with an intensity that approaches ecstasy, as if reading aloud fromWuthering Heights. The giggles that punctuate the girls' early friendship are not beneath Winslet and Lynskey. The screams that end the film are not beyond them.[24]
Heavenly Creaturesis recognised as a milestone in New Zealand cinema.[25][26][27]It was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplay,[28]while Lynskey was named Best Actress at the 1995New Zealand Film Awards.[5]She regards working with Jackson and Winslet as an important learning experience.[29][30]She grew particularly close to Winslet during filming, who later toldThe Irish Times, "Mel is like the left side of my body. [We] had the exact relationship in terms of communication and love that Pauline andJuliethad. From the minute we saw each other".[31]Despite the film's success, its creators tried to discourage Lynskey from pursuing a full-time acting career, as it was not thought to be realistic.[32]She later revealed, "[People were] looking out for me ...  'Thanks for doing this movie for us, and now be sure that you go to university and get a normal job.' No one wanted to be responsible for me being like, 'I'm gonna run off to Hollywood!' ... New Zealanders are very practical. Everybody was kind of like, 'That was fun [but] it's not what your life is gonna be'".[32]
Over the next three years, Lynskey continued her education while auditioning for various film parts.[33][30]She also had a minor role as a policewoman in Peter Jackson's first project afterHeavenly Creatures,The Frighteners(1996),[34]and starred in a production ofJean Genet'sThe Maidsfor theNew Zealand Fringe Festival.[35]Her return to substantial film roles came with the independent dramaForeign Correspondents, where she played Melody, a timid receptionist who strikes up an unusual bond with an overseaspen pal.[36]The director,Mark Tapio Kines, contacted Lynskey to offer her the part after reading online that she was eager to work in America.[37]Filming took place in Los Angeles in 1997,[38]with the project drawing attention for its "breakthrough" use ofcrowdfunding.[37]Her next film was the period fairytale romanceEver After(1998), a feminist reimagining ofCinderellathat was shot in the south of France;[39][40]Lynskey playedDrew Barrymore's "charming and funny" stepsister, Jacqueline De Ghent.[41]She attributes her growth in self-confidence around this time, as well as the advancement of her career, to the support and advice she received from Barrymore and their co-star,Anjelica Huston, during the making of the film.[42]
Lynskey appeared in four features in 1999: teen comedyDetroit Rock City, period dramaThe Cherry Orchard, British gangster dramaShooters, and thecult hitsatireBut I'm a Cheerleader—considered to be one of the foremost examples ofLGBTQcinema—where she played a lesbian undergoing conversion therapy.[43][44][45]Next, she wore "big hair and fake nails" to portray Gloria,[46]a girl from New Jersey, in the musical romantic comedyCoyote Ugly(2000), withSalon'sStephanie Zacharekcalling her "a bridge-and-tunnelBetty Boop, full of google-eyed charm".[47]She then returned to New Zealand to star in the independent thrillerSnakeskin(2001), which premiered at theCannes Film Festivaland earned Lynskey a Best Actress nomination at that year'sNew Zealand Film Awards.[48][49]Variety'sDavid Strattonfelt that her work inSnakeskin, where she played Alice, a free-spirited drifter who embarks on a dangerous road trip, was "excellent".[50]
In 2002, Lynskey re-teamed with directorAndy Tennant—whom she previously worked with onEver After—to play a key role in the romantic comedySweet Home Alabama, withThe Austin Chroniclementioning her as a highlight among the ensemble cast.[51]The scene in which her character, Lurlynn, nurses her baby in a crowded bar has since been recognised for its cultural relevance.[52]Next, she had a supporting role inAbandon, the directorial debut ofStephen Gaghan. In his review of the psychological thriller,Variety'sTodd McCarthypointed out that Lynskey did "some self-conscious scene stealing" with her portrayal of a mousy librarian.[53]She made her television debut that same year in theStephen KingminiseriesRose Red, playing the protective older sister of a girl with supernatural powers.[54]
InShattered Glass(2003), a drama depicting the downfall of disgraced ex-journalistStephen Glass, Lynskey appeared as Amy Brand, a writer forThe New Republic. CriticAndrew Sarrisnoted that "the performances [of] Ms.Sevigny, Ms.Dawsonand Ms. Lynskey do more than [just] complement Mr.Christensen's central characterization; they provide a sane backdrop for [his] pathological deceptions to steadily unravel against".[55]Later that year, she began playing the part ofRose, an endearingly devious stalker, on theCBSsitcomTwo and a Half Men.Having initially made a one-off appearance in the pilot episode, she was invited by the producers to become a series regular and went on to feature in various storylines throughout the first two seasons.[56]Worried about beingtypecastas a result of her involvement with the series,[57]Lynskey decided to leave the main ensemble in 2005 to concentrate on film work, a move that showrunnerChuck Lorresaid he had "a lot of respect for", despite "not [being] happy at first".[58]She returned infrequently toTwo and a Half Menas a guest star up until its final episode, which aired in February 2015.[59]"Doing three or four episodes a year enabled me to pay my mortgage and do independent films", she later said. "People in [the indie world] didn't know I was on this huge sitcom. Then, [others] would recognise me from [the show] and think that I never had another job. But I couldn't have done one without the other".[60]
Lynskey played Pauline Harnois, the fame-hungry fiancée of soldierRene Gagnon, inClint Eastwood's epic war filmFlags of Our Fathers(2006).[61]She then joined the main ensemble of the short-livedFoxseriesDrive(2007),[62]withLos Angeles TimescriticMary McNamaradescribing her work as Wendy Patrakas, a new mother desperate to get away from her abusive husband, as "especially compelling".[63]Her next project was the Western miniseriesComanche Moon, which aired on CBS in January 2008. In their critique of the show,Peoplefelt that Lynskey's portrayal of Pearl Coleman, a settler whose marriage falls apart after she is raped, was among the best in the cast.[64]Later that year, she returned once again to New Zealand to headline the romantic dramaShow of Hands,[65]earning strong notices and a Best Actress nomination at theQantas Film Awardsfor playing Jess, a single parent who enters a gruelling endurance competition to win a car.[66][67][68]
In theSam Mendes–directed dramedyAway We Go(2009), Lynskey appeared as Munch, an adoptive mother dealing with the effects of repeated pregnancy loss. The performance was roundly praised,[69][70]with critics finding the moment her character performs a grief-stricken pole dance in front of her husband to be particularly poignant;[71]writing forThe Boston Globe,Wesley Morrisstated, "Lynskey dramatizes sadness and dysfunction with quiet, moving physicality. [Her] whole life is there in her long face and drooping limbs. It's the best performance in the movie."[72]She co-starred that same year as Ginger, the foolishly devoted wife of thieving whistleblowerMatt Damon'sMark Whitacre, inSteven Soderbergh's darkly comedic biopicThe Informant!.[73]Writing forThe Independent, Geoffrey Macnab felt that Lynskey provided "sterling support" to Damon.[74]During promotion of the film in September that year, Soderbergh told theLos Angeles Times:
She is so watchable. You never quite know what you're going to get, you just know it's going to be good. Her rhythms are really unusual, like her cadence and her reaction times to things, and the way [she] lays out a sentence. It's just really, really interesting.[75]
While making the film, Soderbergh discouraged Lynskey from contacting the real Ginger Whitacre, as he wanted Lynskey to reach her own conclusion about whether she had been complicit in her husband's crimes. "I decided she had no idea what was going on", she later said. "She was trusting, she [thought her job was] to stay in the house and take care of the kids ... She wasn't asking too many questions".[76]Lynskey counts her time working onThe Informant!as one of her favourite professional experiences.[58]
Also in 2009, Lynskey appeared as the pregnant girlfriend of a cannabis farmer inTim Blake Nelson'sLeaves of Grass, withRogerEbert.combelieving her performance to be one of the key contributors to the black comedy's "quirky charm".[77]Nelson said of her casting, "Melanie came in and read for me and, though she's from New Zealand, she was by far the most credible version of an Oklahoma girl I saw. And I probably auditioned 50 actresses for that role".[78]Next, she received positive notices for her work as Julie Bingham,[79][80]a soon-to-be bride, in theOscar-nominateddramedyUp in the Air.[81]With his previous films, directorJason Reitmanhad always rejected the idea of casting non-American actors in American roles,[75]but Lynskey said that she "tricked" him into giving her the part by avoiding conversation with him during her audition, thus concealing her real accent; Reitman admitted to being "thrilled" by this.[82]In October 2009, she was presented with a Spotlight Award at theHollywood Film Festival.[83][84]
Lynskey played an insecure wife inHelena from the Wedding(2010), withThe Hollywood Reporterstating in their review, "The actors form a seamless ensemble, but [the film] belongs to [Lynskey]".[85]She then appeared in the sports dramaTouchback(2011), receiving praise for her role as the childhood sweetheart of an ex-football prodigy,[86][87]and garnered positive notices the same year for her portrayal of drug addict Cindy Timmons inTom McCarthy's dramedyWin Win.[88][89]Writing forThe Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney noted that Lynskey brought "welcome soft shadings to the story's disruptive element",[90]while Mary Pols stated in her review forTime, "[Lynskey] has become one of the most reliably intriguing supporting actresses in film ... she had [parts in]Away We Go,The Informant!andUp in the Air[and was] wonderful in all three. InWin Winshe gives a very different kind of performance and is even better."[91]
In 2012, Lynskey appeared briefly as the flirtatious Karen indoomsdayromantic comedySeeking a Friend for the End of the Worldand had a key role as Aunt Helen, the sexually abusive relative of the teenage protagonist, in coming-of-age dramaThe Perks of Being a Wallflower.[92]Due to the nature of her character inPerks, she said that agreeing to take on the part had been a difficult decision.[93]Her next role was that of love interest Sally in the same year'sPutzel, an independent romcom.[94]In their critique of the film, theTallahassee Democratstated that Lynskey "steals the show ... [Putzel] sparks to life whenever [she] arrives on the screen",[95]whileRedefinedescribed her as "delightful" and "deftly believable".[96]
Lynskey's portrayal of Amy Minsky inHello I Must Be Going(2012), an unemployed divorcee who finds herself living back at home with her parents, was met with critical acclaim.[97][98]For the first time in her career, Lynskey appeared in every scene throughout the film; she described the experience as "a lot of pressure" and said that, because of her lack ofbankabilityat the time, she had assumed the part would be given to somebody likeMichelle WilliamsorMaggie Gyllenhaal.[99]Speaking of his decision to cast Lynskey, directorTodd Louisosaid, "I knew if I cast her, the film had the potential to resonate on a thousand different levels".[99]In his review for theLos Angeles Times,Kenneth Turanwrote:
If you know the name Melanie Lynskey, you're already planning to see her inHello I Must Be Going. If you don't, this film will have you making up for lost time. That's how good an actress she is ... Though there is something of the sad sack about [Amy], Lynskey inhabits the role so completely, brings such exquisite naturalness to her performance, that she becomes someone we root for unreservedly.[100]
In a similar appraisal,USA Todaynoted that "Lynskey brings dimension and intelligence" and a "sympathetic blend of humor [and] dignity to the role".[101]The performance earned her a nomination for theGotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Actor,[102]whileScreen Rantplaced it at #6 in their rundown of the best film acting of the early 2010s.[103]The following year, Lynskey took on a lead role inThe Big Ask, an independent black comedy. Her work as Hannah was praised,[104][105]with Brian Tallerico stating in his review forRogerEbert.com, "[she] so often finds ways to elevate lackluster screenwriting, and does so again here. She's the best thing about the movie."[106]
In April 2014, Lynskey was named an Emerging Master honouree at theRiverRun International Film Festival.[107]Her first film project that year wasHappy Christmas, where she played Kelly, a creatively bored novelist whose passion for writing is rekindled when her disruptive sister-in-law comes to visit. The film drew attention for being almost entirelyimprovised,[108]withStephen HoldenofThe New York Timesstating, "The performances [are] so natural that the actors melt into their characters";[109]while other critics singled out Lynskey as a highlight.[110][111]She then had a supporting role inDavid Wain's satirical romcomThey Came Together, and played the female leads inWe'll Never Have Paris—the directorial debut ofSimon Helberg—andAngus MacLachlan'sGoodbye to All That. In his review ofGoodbye to All That,Bilge Ebirisaid that Lynskey's portrayal of frustrated wife Annie was "fantastic",[112]whileVarietydescribed her as "heartbreaking ... This is what falling out of love looks like. It's not screaming matches and altercations; it's apathy and indifference."[113]Towards the end of 2014, she provided the voice of Beatrice, an ill-tempered bluebird, forCartoon Network'sOver the Garden Wall.[114][115]In their appraisal of the animated miniseries, which has since been recognised as a cult classic,[116][117]The A.V. Clubcommented, "Lynskey steals the show with her amazing putdowns and passive-aggressiveness, smartly avoiding overdone sass or sarcasm."[118]
Between 2015 and 2016, Lynskey played Michelle Pierson onHBO'sTogetherness, which focused on the lives of two couples living under the same roof. Created by theDuplass brothers, the heavily improvised dramedy series was a "dream" job for Lynskey,[119][120]who referred to its co-writer and director,Jay Duplass, as her "creative soulmate".[11]The show's performances were commended, with critics paying particular attention to Lynskey.[121][122]Writing for theLos Angeles Times, Robert Lloyd said, "[Lynskey] is all deep waters and live wires; soft and steely, trying on new personas for size, her Michelle becomes the series' gravitational center. You can feel her feeling".[123]The performance earned her a nomination for theCritics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress,[124]and was singled out by numerous publications as being worthy of anEmmy nomination.[125][126][127]It was announced in March 2016 that HBO would not be renewingTogethernessfor a third season;[128]Lynskey compared this to having her "heart broken by someone I'm still in love with".[129]
For her starring role inThe Intervention(2016), Lynskey received theU.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Individual Performanceat theSundance Film Festival.[130]In his review forIndieWire, Russ Fischer pointed out Lynskey's "tremendously good comic timing",[131]while Ethan Anderton of/Filmnoted, "Lynskey is the standout, delivering a performance that is genuine, funny and touching all at the same time."[132]The film was the directorial debut ofClea DuVall, who wrote the character of Annie, an uptight alcoholic, specifically for Lynskey.[133]She sought the help of a therapist before the film went into production to prepare herself for working with DuVall, a close friend of several years: "I didn't want anything to happen to our friendship and a big challenge was being able to stick up for myself and my perspective in regard to the script and this character."[133]Also that year, she starred in the one-offBBC TwocomedyOur Ex-Wife,[134]which was followed by prominent roles in the independent featuresRainbow Time,Little Boxes, andThe Great & the Small.Variety'sJoe Leydondescribed her work inThe Great & the Small—where she played Margaret, a schoolteacher grieving the loss of her only son—as  "quietly devastating".[135]
Lynskey's performance in theNetflixcrime thrillerI Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore(2017) was roundly praised by critics.[136][137]The film's director,Macon Blair, wrote the character of Ruth, an aggrieved nursing assistant who takes the law into her own hands after her house is burgled, with Lynskey in mind.[138]The role proved to be physically challenging, as it involved stunt work and the use of prosthetics.[138][139]Peter Debruge ofVarietycommended Blair for giving Lynskey "something unforgettable to do" and felt that she delivered her "best work yet",[140]whileTime Outdescribed her as "seething and magnetic".[141]In his review forRogerEbert.com,Matt Zoller Seitzsaid:
[Lynskey is] one of those actresses I'm never not glad to see, and it's a treat to see her front-and-center here, carrying an entire movie mainly with her eyes, face and shoulders. A performance like this one can be quite tricky—you're essentially reactive a lot of the time, more of a sponge for the film than the motor driving it along—but Lynskey makes everything active by letting you feel Ruth's emotions and sense her train of thought as she puts various pieces together in her head, drawing correct or wrongheaded conclusions. She's also just a terrific audience surrogate. When she snarls or snaps, I wanted to cheer.[142]
I Don't Feel at Homewon theGrand Jury Prizeat the2017 Sundance Festivalwhile Lynskey received a nomination for that year'sGotham Independent Film Award for Best Actress.[143][144]Next, she headlined the controversial independent dramaAnd Then I Go,[145]withParade's Samuel R.

InSadie(2018), Lynskey starred as Rae, a woman bringing up her daughter in the confines of a trailer park while her husband serves in the military.Varietydescribed her work in the drama as "compelling",[150]whileFrank ScheckofThe Hollywood Reporterstated, "It's no surprise that Lynskey, who has quietly [been] establishing herself as one of indie cinema's finest actors, is once again superb in her emotionally complex turn".[151]Next, she appeared in the principal role of troubled psychic Molly Strand on the first season ofCastle Rock, a supernatural horror series based on characters and settings from thebooks of Stephen King.[152]It premiered onHuluin July 2018, with critics pointing out the strong work of the cast:Pastereferred to Lynskey as "delicately complex",[153]whileAlan SepinwallofRolling Stonefelt the show was "the latest example of how much humanity and grounding [Lynskey] can bring to the most surreal and macabre of stories – it's a tradition that goes back to when she was a teenager inHeavenly Creatures."[154]Earlier that same year, theSeattle International Film Festivalhosted a tribute event in celebration of Lynskey's career.[155]
Between April and May 2020, Lynskey appeared as Rosemary Thomson in theFX on Huluperiod miniseriesMrs. America, a political drama centred on the life and career of conservative activistPhyllis Schlafly(played byCate Blanchett). Her portrayal of the real-life Thomson,[156]an ambitious champion of Schlafly and staunch opposer of theEqual Rights Amendment, was described by critics as "delightful" and a "standout" among the cast.[157][158]Despite not sharing her beliefs, Lynskey said that her ownBaptistupbringing enabled her to empathize with Rosemary's position[11]and called working with Blanchett "one of the great experiences of my life".[159]
Lynskey agreed to star as a layabout stoner inLady of the Manor(2021), the directorial debut ofJustin Long, because "the thought of being in sweatpants [and] acting like I was high for a whole movie was so freeing".[160]Her performance was well received, withThe Hollywood Reportercommenting that she "brings the same airtight commitment to hot mess Hannah that she does to all her varied roles",[161]whileScreen Rantfelt she "unabashedly embraces physical humor [and] really commits to the gags".[162]Adam McKay's satirical tackling of theclimate crisis,Don't Look Up, was Lynskey's second film project that year: her portrayal of June Mindy,Leonardo DiCaprio's put-upon wife, was described as "terrific" byThe Hollywood Reporter,[163]whileIndieWirecalled her "low-key brilliant" and felt she brought a "clear-headed" presence to the narrative.[164]She said that working onUpand bonding with DiCaprio had been "beautiful".[165]
OnShowtime'sYellowjackets, Lynskey playsShauna Sadecki, a suburban housewife carrying grim secrets about a plane crash that occurred twenty-five years ago. The series premiered in November 2021, withRolling Stonefeeling that Lynskey was the "standout" among its ensemble cast: "She's always great, but [this] feels like the kind of dark, messy, and charismatic part she's been waiting her whole career to play."[166]In a similar review,The Guardianagreed that "Lynskey does by far the most emotional heavy lifting of the series".[167]She admitted it was Shauna's "internalized rage" that attracted her to the role, as well as "a real dark streak [that I] loved and was also terrified of".[168]For her work onYellowjackets, Lynskey wonBest Actress in a Drama Seriesat the27th Critics' Choice Awards, where her acceptance speech drew attention for paying tribute to her daughter's nanny.[169][170]Her subsequent accolades for playing Shauna include two nominations for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress, in 2022 and 2023, respectively.[171][172]

In thePeacockhistorical drama seriesThe Tattooist of Auschwitz, Lynskey portrayed New Zealand social workerHeather Morris, a fledgling novelist who befriends an elderlyHolocaust survivor, played byHarvey Keitel, and pitches him her idea fora book about his time spent imprisoned at a concentration camp. The show was released in May 2024, withThe Daily Beast's Nick Schager pointing out Lynskey's chemistry with Keitel but criticising the quality of the wig she had to wear in an effort to resemble the real Morris.[185]Other reviewers believed her work to be "understated [and] endlessly empathetic",[186]as well as "measured, nuanced, textured, and altogether beautiful".[187]Owing to the nature of the material, Lynskey described the filming experience as "heavy", but said she felt it was "important to tell as many stories as we can from this period in history".[188]
Lynskey described herself as acharacter actressin the early stages of her career, but has since renounced the term.[189]
Regarding her acting technique, Lynskey has said, "I don't have any [professional] training ... so the only thing I have to go on is my own instinct. So if a director gives me a note that doesn't feel like it's in line with my instinct, it's very hard for me to do something that ... feels like a lie. So, I'll argue it, and I can get kind of feisty because I feel it in my body, I know what is right".[190]
Asked by a journalist in 2012 about how she felt being cast—up to that point in her career—as a supporting player rather than a lead, Lynskey said it was something she had thought about a lot, and that the "meaty" parts are mostly written for men, or actresses likeMeryl Streep.[99]She told a different journalist the same year, "It's been a big issue that I'm not [famous] ... I'll audition for something and then the feedback has been, 'The director wants you, the creative people want you, but the studio is saying no' ... but I understand. People are investing a lot of money and they want somewhat of a guarantee".[191]She has subsequently taken on leading roles in numerous independent films and been labelled an "indie queen".[192][193][194][195]
Speaking in 2017 about taking risks in her film work, Lynskey said, "I want to tell stories about women who are interesting and complicated and not like people you've seen before ... There aren't that many opportunities [to do that] except in the independent film world. I've made films that have cost $50,000 for the entire film. If you're willing to work like that, you get chances to do really creative, interesting stuff".[6]
Lynskey is often complimented on her ability to perform an American accent.[196][197][198][199][4][200]She attributes this to staying withJoss Whedonwhen she first moved to Los Angeles: "When I came here, I stayed in his guest bedroom ... I watched movie after movie and learned American accents".[201]Tim Blake Nelsonrecalled that when she auditioned for the part of Colleen inLeaves of Grass, "She came in and auditioned for me and then ... opened [her] mouth and started talking in a New Zealand accent and I just couldn't believe it, because her south-eastern Oklahoma accent was so spot on, and it's a very specific accent."[202]
Lynskey is known for herimprovisationskills, which she attributes to classes she attended in her youth.[108][203]She regularly employsdreamworkto help her get into character,[203][204]as well music:[205]"Every movie I've done I have a particular song I keep going back to that puts me in the right emotional place."[206]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
