The film premiered in France on September 5, 2021 when it was screened out of competition at theDeauville American Film Festivalwhere Depp was a guest of honor. The film received mixed reviews from critics.
In 2015,Los Angeles Timesinvestigative reporterDarius "Jack" Jackson is assigned to write about themurder of the Notorious B.I.G.[Christopher Wallace], and meets with the retired and disgracedLos Angeles Police Department(LAPD)detectiveRussell Poole. In a series offlashbacks, Poole reveals his theory thatDeath Row RecordsCEOSuge Knightpaid corrupt LAPD officers to murder Wallace andcover it up.
In 1997, just weeks after the Wallace murder, Poole is tasked with investigating the shooting of off-duty black police officerKevin Gainesby a white detective,Frank Lyga. Poole faces pressure from upper management in relation to themedia frenzyinvolving other recent race-related incidents in Los Angeles, namely the beating ofRodney Kingand themurder trial of O. J. Simpson. During the course of the investigation, Poole learns that Gaines was on Knight's payroll and hadBloodsgang affiliation. Poole's superior officer, Lieutenant O'Shea, refuses to give credence to this theory and orders Poole to close the Gaines-Lyga shooting. Lyga is exonerated but faces acivil suit, with the Gaines family being represented by attorneyJohnnie Cochran. Poole confirms from an undercoverFBIagent the connection between Knight and Gaines, and he is transferred to the Robbery-Homicide Division to investigate the Wallace murder.
Poole and his partner Fred Miller obtain the names of suspects includingDavid Mack, another LAPD officer in Knight's employ, as well asNation of Islammember Amir Muhammad and Blood member Wardell Fouse. Poole learns Mack worked security for Wallace and has also been recently tied to a bank robbery. Mack is arrested but does not give up any information related to Wallace's death. Poole begins investigating yet another LAPD officer,Rafael Pérez, after learning that he has been stealingcocainefrom the evidence room. Poole tails Pérez and watches him shoot a drug dealer but Poole intervenes and shoots Pérez in self-defense. Pérez is criminally charged and implicates himself and other officers in variouscriminal activities. Poole is granted his own task force and also prepares to take the stand in Lyga's civil trial where he intends to claim, on the record, that Mack was involved in Wallace's death and that the LAPD is covering it up, but the city settles before the trial commences. Lyga is unable to clear his name and Poole is shunned by the LAPD.
Voletta Wallacefiles awrongful deathclaim against Los Angeles based on the evidence championed by Poole. Mack and Amir Muhammad were named as defendants, but were dropped shortly before the trial began after the LAPD and FBI dismissed them as suspects. Poole resigns in disgrace one month before he was eligible for hispension, which ultimately costs him his family.
Jackson meets with Poole and Voletta who have developed a friendship in the decades since her son's murder. Jackson apologizes to her for previously writing an article implicating her son in themurder of Tupac Shakur; which she accepts. Voletta reveals that she is thankful for Poole's sacrifice in his attempts to solve the murder. Poole informs Jackson that Wallace's earning potential was estimated at $1 billion, and that a civil suit would bankrupt the city. One day, Poole goes to the L.A. Sheriff's Department in an attempt to reopen his investigation, but suffers a heart attack and dies some time after.
Out of guilt, Jackson, using the information he has learned, writes an article about Russell Poole declaring him as a forgotten hero. Jackson's article is received with acclaim, however, he soon resigns from his job, finding the system too hypocritical to celebrate worthy men like Poole. Both the murders of Wallace and Tupac remain unsolved.
On February 4, 2013, Miriam Segal's British production company Good Films was reported to have bought the film rights toRandall Sullivan'snon-fiction bookLAbyrinth.

On August 23, 2018, theDaily Beastreported that Depp's legal trouble was used as a scapegoat. It suggested that the Los Angeles Police Department may have been trying to suppress the film, in which it is negatively portrayed, or that there were other major players who did not want the film released.[19]In July 2020, Adam Tod Brown argued that the film was suppressed so Voletta Wallace cannot reopen theNotorious B.I.G. murder caseto sue the LAPD.[20]On August 29, 2018,Bank Leumifiled another lawsuit against Miramax over millions of dollars in unpaid guarantees caused by pulling the film from release.[21]

Miramax, LLC, formerly known asMiramax Films, is an American independentfilmandtelevision productionanddistributioncompany owned bybeIN Media GroupandParamount Global. Based inLos Angeles,California, it was founded on December 19, 1979, by brothersBobandHarvey Weinstein.
It was a leading producer and distributor of independent films until it was acquried byThe Walt Disney Companyon June 30, 1993. In 2010, Disney sold it toFilmyard Holdings, a joint venture ofColony NorthStar,Tutor-Saliba CorporationandQatar Investment Authority.[1][2]In March 2016, the company was sold to thebeIN Media Group, which later sold a 49% stake toParamount Global(previously known as ViacomCBS) on April 3, 2020.
Miramax was founded as Miramax Films by the Weinstein brothers, Bob and Harvey along with executive Corky Burger inBuffalo, New York, in 1979, and was named by combining the first names of their parents, Miriam and Max.[3]It was created to distributeindependent filmsdeemed commercially unfeasible by themajor studios.
The company's first major success came when the Weinsteins teamed up with British producerMartin Lewisand acquired the U.S. rights to two concert films Lewis had produced ofbenefit showsforhuman rightsorganizationAmnesty International. The Weinsteins worked with Lewis to distill the two films into one film for the American marketplace. The resulting film, the American version ofThe Secret Policeman's Other Ball, was a successful release for Miramax in the summer of 1982. This release presaged amodus operandithat the company would undertake later in the 1980s of acquiring films from international filmmakers and reworking them to suit American sensibilities and audiences. In its early years, Miramax Films had to focus primarily as a catalyst for music and decided to do a licensing agreement withThorn EMI Videoto release several of Miramax's early films.[4]
Among the company's other breakthrough films as distributors in the late 1980s and early 1990s werePulp Fiction,Scandal,Sex, Lies, and Videotape,Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!,The Crying Game,andClerks. The company also made films such asFlirting with Disaster,Heavenly Creatures, andShakespeare in Love.
Miramax Films acquired and/or produced many other films that did well financially. The company became one of the leaders of the independent film boom of the 1990s. Miramax Films produced or distributed seven films with box office grosses totaling more than $100 million; its highest grossing title,Chicago, earned more than $300 million worldwide.[5]
The company was also successful in securingAcademy Awardnominations for its releases, many of which resulted inOscarwins.
On June 30, 1993,The Walt Disney Companypurchased Miramax Films for $60 million and assumed all of the company's debt, which was more than $40 million. The acquisition gave Disney entry to the independent film market.[6]Harvey and Bob Weinstein continued to operate Miramax Films until they left the company on September 30, 2005. During their tenure, the Weinstein brothers ran Miramax Films independently of other Disney subsidiaries and, as a result, had more autonomy than the other Disney-owned companies. Disney, however, had the final say on what Miramax Films could release (for example, Disney had banned Miramax Films from releasingKids,DogmaandFahrenheit 9/11).[7]Disney'sBuena Vista Home Entertainmentdivision released Miramax output on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray Disc under the nameMiramax Home Entertainmentin some countries, including the United States; elsewhere, the overall distribution of Miramax Films' output was passed to the regional licensees of Miramax International, a distribution arm of Miramax Films that was fully autonomous from Disney's own distribution operations.
With a more stable budget, Miramax Films began moving beyond acquisitions and distribution and into film production. Until September 30, 2005, the company also operated the labelDimension Films, which was solely founded by Bob to specialize in teen, horror, and other genre films,[8]and created theScreamandScary Moviefilm franchises. Harvey funded larger projects from up-and-coming directors, includingRobert Rodriguez,Gus Van Sant, andQuentin Tarantino. Some of the films earned Oscars.[8]At times the studio tried to release a film almost weekly.[9]
In 1997, Miramax Films joinedPeter Jacksonas a primary financial backer in attempting to get theLord of the Ringsfilms produced. Disney disliked the cost of a two-parter, requesting that it be produced as a single film. Jackson andSaul Zaentzrejected Disney's request and looked for another studio or financier. Thus, Miramax Films sold the rights forThe Lord of the RingsandThe HobbittoNew Line Cinemain August 1998 for about $12 million, which ledThe Lord of the Ringsto be produced as a trilogy. Miramax Films retained a 5% stake in the films' gross and then gave 2.5% to the Weinsteins.[10]
Through Miramax Films, Harvey foundedTalkmagazine withTina Brownin 1998 (it shut down in 2002), albeit without the approval of then-Disney chiefMichael Eisner, which upset Eisner. Also that year, 30 former employees filed suit over unpaid overtime wages.[8]
By 2003, Miramax Films was less operative in the independent film market and became more of a mini-major as the company only acquired 3 films while producingCold Mountainfor $80 million. The Weinsteins claimed the company was profitable, but Walt Disney Company presidentRobert Igerindicated in June 2004 that they were not properly accounting for "account standard overhead, distribution fees, bonuses that we pay Harvey and Bob. Nor are they applying current accounting rules."[8]
After extensive negotiations and much media and industry speculation, on March 30, 2005, Disney and the Weinsteins announced that they would not renew their contractual relationship when their existing agreements expired at the end of September 2005. The primary source of dispute was over distribution ofFahrenheit 9/11by Michael Moore.[11]Disney's film studio consortium,Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, assumed control of Miramax Films, which was projected to have a smaller annual production budget. The Weinsteins started a new film production company calledThe Weinstein Company(TWC) and took theDimension Filmslabel with them. The Miramax Films name remained with the film studio owned by Disney. Production at Miramax Films was taken over byDaniel Battsek,[11]who had been head ofBuena Vista Internationalin theUK. Battsek refocused Miramax Films to produce films of high quality but low budget.Maple Picturesheld the rights to distribute Miramax films in Canada from 2008 up until August 10, 2011, when Maple Pictures was acquired byAlliance Films.[12]At the time, the company was criticized for delaying or withholding release of Asian films to which it acquired the U.S. distribution rights.[13]Previously, in 2003, the company was criticized for trying to bar retailers from legally exporting authentic DVDs of the films.[14]
On October 3, 2009, Disney announced that the staff of Miramax Films was to be reduced by 70%, and the number of releases would be reduced by half to just three films per year. The label's marketing, distribution, and administrative functions, which had operated independently, would be folded into the parent studio in Burbank. The move became effective in January 2010.[15]On October 30, 2009, Disney announced the resignation of Daniel Battsek as President of Miramax Films, effective when the transition from the studio in New York toBurbankwas completed.[16]The company merged its operations with The Walt Disney Studios on January 28, 2010, shutting down Miramax Films' separate New York and Los Angeles offices.[11][17]
Though Disney Studio ChairmanDick Cookwas a staunch supporter of Miramax Films, the brand was less of a priority for CEOBob Iger, whose strategy was to focus on Disney's branded mass entertainment that could be exploited across Disney's theme parks, television, and consumer products. Following Disney's $4 billion acquisition ofMarvel Entertainmentin 2009, Cook was succeeded byRich Ross.[18]As a result, Miramax Films was relegated to the status of distribution label within the Walt Disney Company.[19]The company confirmed that it was looking into selling the Miramax label on February 9, 2010, with Bob Iger explaining "We determined that continuing to invest in new Miramax movies wasn't necessarily a core strategy of ours".[20]
On December 3, 2010, Disney closed the sale of Miramax for US$663 million toFilmyard Holdings, an investment group and joint venture ofColony NorthStar,Tutor-Saliba Corporation, andQatar Investment Authority. The sale included 700 film titles, books, development projects, and the "Miramax" name.Mike Lang, the formerNews Corporationbusiness development executive who was selected as the CEO of Miramax,[21]indicated that the company would focus on their existing library, though they would continue making original content.[22][23]
After the sale was closed, some films already developed at Miramax, includingThe TempestandGnomeo & Juliet, were eventually released by Disney under itsTouchstone Picturesbanner, and theatrical distribution ofDon't Be Afraid of the Dark[24]andThe Debt[25]were shifted toFilmDistrictandFocus Featuresrespectively.
On December 16, 2013, Miramax entered into a deal with Harvey and Bob Weinstein'sThe Weinstein Companyto develop and distribute select derivative works of films from the former studio. Sequels, television series, or stage productions of titles such asRoundersandShakespeare in Lovewere among the projects said to be part of this agreement.[26][27][28]
On July 17, 2015, Qatar and Colony NorthStar put Miramax up for sale for an offer of $1 billion.[29][30][31]Harvey and Bob Weinstein had reportedly regained interest in reacquiring the studio via TWC in September.[32][33][34][35][36][37]On March 2, 2016, Miramax was sold tobeIN Media Group, a spinoff ofAl Jazeera Media Network(which formerly owned its namesakebeIN Sports).[38][39][40]
On a July 21, 2016, interview, Harvey Weinstein stated that he was still interested in combining TWC's film library with Miramax's, after the acquisition of the latter by beIN.[41]
After Miramax's founder Harvey Weinsteinwas accused of sexual assaultin October 2017, Miramax became one of 60 parties bidding on The Weinstein Company on January 16, 2018.[42]On April 27, Miramax and Lantern Capital emerged as the strongest contenders to acquire TWC's assets. Ultimately, it wasLanternthat acquired TWC's library.[43]
On June 7, 2019, beIN began the process of selling approximately 50% of Miramax in an effort to offer it for growth.[44]Lionsgate(which distributed Miramax's titles on home video),Spyglass Media Group(owners of the Weinstein Company library, inherited via their deal with Lantern) andViacom(Paramount's parent company whore-mergedwithCBS Corporationon December 4, 2019, to form ViacomCBS) were seen as the leading contenders to acquire a stake in the company.[45]By August 19, 2019, Lionsgate and Viacom were the only contenders, as Spyglass Media Group dropped out of contention.[46]On September 11, 2019, it was announced Lionsgate had dropped their bid, making Viacom the only bidder for the stake in Miramax.[47]On November 8, 2019, Viacom exited the negotiations to acquire them.[48]After merging with CBS Corporation to become ViacomCBS, the combined firm resumed talks with Miramax.[49]
On December 20, 2019, ViacomCBS (now known asParamount Global) announced it would acquire a 49% stake in Miramax for at least $375 million, withParamount Picturesgaining exclusive worldwide distribution rights to its film and television library. Paramount Pictures and Miramax will also co-produce new content based on titles from the library.[50]The deal officially closed on April 3, 2020.[51]
On June 24, 2020, Miramax and ViacomCBS announced their first co-production,The Turkish Detective, a television series based on theCetin Ikmennovels byBarbara Nadel.[52]
On October 2, 2023, it was announced that CEO Bill Block would be leaving the company that week following the end of his contract with them, starting his own production company, BlockFilm, later that month.[53][54]In January 2024,Jonathan Glickmanwas reported to be in talks to join Miramax as CEO, with his company Panoramic Media expected to be acquired by Miramax if talks were successful.[55]On April 2, 2024, Glickman was officially named Miramax's new CEO effective immediately. As part of the deal, Miramax also acquired certain film and TV projects from Glickman's company Panoramic Media.[56]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
