Summer of Soul (...or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)is a 2021 Americanindependent[3][4]documentary filmabout the 1969Harlem Cultural Festival, directed byAhmir "Questlove" Thompsonin his directorial debut.[5][6]It had its world premiere at the2021 Sundance Film Festivalon January 28, 2021, where it won the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award in the documentary categories. It had alimited theatrical releasein the U.S. bySearchlight Pictureson June 25, 2021, before expanding and being released for streaming onHuluthe next weekend.
The second half of the movie's title is taken from the 1970 poem and song "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised", written byGil Scott-Heron. It offered a sharp and satirical critique of the media's lack of coverage ofcivil rightsactivism and the reality of change and revolution taking place in the streets and on campuses across America.
The film received acclaim from critics, with particular praise given to the restoration of the footage used. It won numerous awards, includingBest Documentary Featureat the6th Critics' Choice Documentary Awards, where it won in all six categories in which it was nominated,Best Documentaryat the75th British Academy Film Awards,Best Documentary Featureat the94th Academy Awards,[7][8]andBest Music Filmat the64th Annual Grammy Awards. It has been consideredone of the best filmsof the 21st century.[9][10]
The film examines the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, which took place on six Sundays between June 29 and August 24 atMount Morris Park(now Marcus Garvey Park) inHarlem, using professional footage of the festival that was filmed as it happened,stock news footage, and modern-day interviews with attendees, musicians, and other commentators to provide historical background and social context. Despite its large attendance and performers such asStevie Wonder,Mahalia Jackson,Max Roach,Nina Simone,The 5th Dimension,The Staple Singers,Gladys Knight & the Pips,Mavis Staples,Blinky Williams,Sly and the Family Stone, andthe Chambers Brothers, the festival is much less well known in the 21st century than isWoodstock(which took place on the same weekend as one of the days of the Harlem Cultural Festival). The filmmakers investigate this, among other topics.
At the request of festival organizer and hostTony Lawrence, television producerHal Tulchinrecorded about 40 hours of footage of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival on videotape,[11]excerpts from which were packaged as two one-hour TV specials that were broadcast in 1969, one onCBSin July, and one onABCin September.[12]The tapes were then placed in a basement,[13]where they sat for the next 50 years.[14]Tulchin attempted to interest broadcasters in the recordings for several years, but had little success, though some of the footage of Nina Simone was eventually used in documentaries about her.[15]
In 2004,Joe Lauro, a film archivist at theHistoric Films Archive, discovered the existence of the footage and contacted Hal Tulchin, hoping to work on a film about the festival. He digitized and cataloged the footage[16]and, in 2006, entered into a deal withRobert GordonandMorgan Nevilleto make the film,[11]but the project never saw the light of day, as Tulchin discontinued his agreement with Lauro.[16]Producer Robert Fyvolent, who had originally sought to work with Lauro, then acquired film and television rights to the footage from Tulchin.[15][17]Fyvolent began collaborating with producer David Dinerstein in 2016, and together they engagedRadicalMediaand editor Josh Pearson, and added a third producer,Joseph Patel.[18]
Director Ahmir Thompson has expressed surprise that the footage sat for so long, and that he had never heard of the festival before the producers approached him about making the film.[19]Discussing its obscurity, he said: "What would have happened if this was allowed a seat at the table? How much of a difference would that have made in my life? That was the moment that extinguished any doubt I had that I could do this."[20]
The film premiered on January 28, 2021, at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award in the US Documentary Competition.[21]It was acquired bySearchlight PicturesandHulu, and was released in the United States at theEl Capitan TheatreinLos Angelesand theAMCMagic JohnsonHarlem 9 multiplex inNew York Cityon June 25, 2021, before expanding nationwide and being released for streaming on Hulu the next weekend.[22]The film was distributed internationally in theaters and onDisney+ Hotstaron July 30, 2021, and onDisney+andStar+on November 19, 2021,[23][24]and was made available on the U.S. version of Disney+ on February 8, 2022, in time forBlack History Month.[25]It made its broadcast television premiere onABCon February 20, 2022.[26]On February 8, 2022,20th Century Studiosreleased a hard copy on Standard Definition DVD. In a bonus feature interview, Thompson mused about expanding the film with the wealth of material he had to cut for time.
On April 22, 2021, it was announced that Thompson would introduce the first trailer for the film during the93rd Academy Awards, for which he served as music director. The trailer debuted on April 25, 2021.[27]
Summer of Soulgrossed $2.3 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $1.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $3.7 million.[1]
In the film's first weekend in wide release, it grossed $650,000 from 752 theaters (for a per-venue average of $865).[28]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 99% (based on 222 reviews), with an average rating of 9.1/10; the website's critics consensus reads: "Deftly interweaving incredible live footage with a series of revealing interviews,Summer of Soulcaptures the spirit and context of a watershed moment while tying it firmly to the present."[29]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted average scoreof 96 out of 100 (based on 38 critics), indicating "universal acclaim".[30]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film a rare "A+" average grade.[28]
Rolling Stonepraised the film as "the Perfect Movie to Kick Off Sundance 2021" and said it was "an incredible, vital act of restoration—and reclamation".[31]The Guardiangave it five stars, writing that there is "a moment so striking and rich with power at the center of Ahmir 'Questlove' Thompson'sSummer of Soul (…Or, When The Revolution Could Not Be Televised)that, while watching it, I actually forgot to breathe."[32]
British criticMark Kermodecalled the film "the best music documentary I've ever seen" in his review forKermode and Mayo's Film ReviewonBBC Radio 5 Live.[33]
In 2024,Looperranked it number 3 on its list of the "50 Best PG-13 Movies of All Time," writing "The 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival was a milestone event that featured countless Black artists performing music from all genres, but for decades, it faded into obscurity. Fortunately, director Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson's documentary,Summer of Soul, reaffirms the existence, presence, and joy of this seemingly forgotten moment with restored archival footage of the performances that comprised this event."[34]
On January 21, 2022,Legacy Recordsreleased an officialsoundtrack album.[70]In an interview, Thompson said he considered including songs not in the film, but decided to stick with the music that had already been cleared for release.[71]The digital version of the soundtrack contains 17 songs, while the physical version contains 16, as it does not featureAbbey Lincoln'sandMax Roach'sperformance of "Africa".
On February 8, 2022,20th Century Studiosreleased the film on Standard Definition DVD. Bonus features include audio commentary by Thompson, who muses about re-editing a longer version that would include footage he had to cut for time, and two behind-the-scenes featurettes ("Soul Searching" and "Harlem: Then & Now").[72]

The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

Nina Simone(/ˈniːnəsɪˈmoʊn/NEE-nə sim-OHN;[1]bornEunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21, 1933 – April 21, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, composer, arranger, andcivil rights activist. Her music spanned styles includingclassical,folk,gospel,blues,jazz,R&B, andpop. Her piano playing was strongly influenced bybaroqueand classical music, especiallyJohann Sebastian Bach,[2][3]and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in hercontraltovoice.[4][5]
The sixth of eight children born into a poor family inNorth Carolina, Simone initially aspired to be aconcert pianist.[6]With the help of a few supporters in her hometown, she enrolled in theJuilliard School of Musicin New York City.[7][8]She then applied for ascholarshipto study at theCurtis Institute of MusicinPhiladelphia, where, despite a well receivedaudition, she was denied admission,[9]which she attributed toracism.[10]In 2003, just days before her death, the institute awarded her anhonorary degree.[11]
Early in her career, to make a living, Simone played piano at anightclubinAtlantic City. She changed her name to "Nina Simone" to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play "the devil's music" or so-called "cocktail piano".[9]She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her ownaccompaniment, which effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist.[12]She went on to record more than 40 albums between 1958 and 1974, making her debut withLittle Girl Blue. She released her first and biggest hit single in the United States in 1959 with "I Loves You, Porgy", which peaked inside the top 20 of theBillboardHot 100 chart.[6]Simone also became known for her work in thecivil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s,[13]and she later fled the United States and settled in France followingthe assassination of her friend Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968.[14]She lived and performed inEurope,Africa, and theCaribbeanthroughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.[15]In 1991, Simone published her autobiography,I Put a Spell on You(taking the title fromher famous 1965 album), and she continued to perform and attract audiences until her death.[16]
Rolling Stonehas ranked Simone as one of the greatest singers of all time on various lists.[17][18]
Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon on February 21, 1933, inTryon, North Carolina. Her father, John Divine Waymon, worked as abarberanddry-cleaneras well as an entertainer. Her mother, Mary Kate Irvin, was a Methodist preacher.[19]The sixth of eight children[20]in a poor family, she began playing piano at the age of three or four; the first song she learned was "God Be With You, Till We Meet Again".[21]Demonstrating a talent with the piano, she performed at her local church. Her concert debut, a classicalrecital, was given when she was 12. Simone later said that during this performance, her parents, who had taken seats in the front row, were forced to move to the back of the hall to make way for white people.[22]She said that she refused to play until her parents were moved back to the front,[23][24]and that the incident contributed to her later involvement in thecivil rights movement.[25]Simone's music teacher helped establish a special fund to pay for her education.[26]Subsequently, a local fund was set up to assist her continued education. With the help of this scholarship money, she was able to attendAllen High School for GirlsinAsheville, North Carolina.[citation needed]
After her graduation, Simone spent the summer of 1950 at theJuilliard Schoolas a student ofCarl Friedberg, preparing for an audition at theCurtis Institute of MusicinPhiladelphia.[27]Her application, however, was denied. Only three of 72 applicants were accepted that year,[28]but as her family had relocated to Philadelphia in the expectation of her entry to Curtis, the blow to her aspirations was particularly heavy. For the rest of her life, she suspected that her application had been denied because of racial prejudice, a charge the staff at Curtis have denied.[29]Discouraged, she took private piano lessons withVladimir Sokoloff, a professor at Curtis, but never could re-apply. At the time the Curtis Institute did not accept students over 21. She took a job as a photographer's assistant, found work as an accompanist atArlene Smith's vocal studio, and taught piano from her home in Philadelphia.[27]
In order to fund her private lessons, Simone performed at the Midtown Bar & Grill on Pacific Avenue inAtlantic City,New Jersey, whose owner insisted that she sing as well as play the piano, which increased her income to $90 a week. In 1954, she adopted the stage name "Nina Simone". "Nina", derived fromniña, was a nickname given to her by a boyfriend named Chico,[27]and "Simone" was taken from the French actressSimone Signoret, whom she had seen in the 1952 movieCasque d'Or.[30]Knowing her mother would not approve of her playing "the Devil's music," she used her new stage name to remain undetected. Simone's mixture of jazz,blues, and classical music in her performances at the bar earned her a small but loyal fan base.[31]
In 1958, she befriended and married Don Ross, abeatnikwho worked as afairground barker, but quickly regretted their marriage.[32]Playing in small clubs in the same year, she recordedGeorge Gershwin's "I Loves You, Porgy" (fromPorgy and Bess), which she learned from aBillie Holidayalbum and performed as a favor to a friend. It became her onlyBillboardtop 20 success in the United States, and her debut albumLittle Girl Bluefollowed in February 1959 onBethlehem Records.[33][34][35]Because she had sold herrightsoutright for $3,000, Simone lost more than $1 million in royalties (notably for the 1980s re-release of her version of thejazz standard"My Baby Just Cares for Me") and never benefited financially from the album's sales.[36]
After the success ofLittle Girl Blue, Simone signed a contract with producerHecky KrasnowatColpix Recordsand recorded a multitude ofstudioandlive albums. Colpix relinquished allcreative controlto her, including the choice of material that would be recorded, in exchange for her signing the contract with them. After the release of her live albumNina Simone at Town Hall, Simone became a favorite performer inGreenwich Village.[37]By this time, Simone performedpop musiconly to make money to continue her classical music studies and was indifferent about having a recording contract. She kept this attitude toward the record industry for most of her career.[38]
Simone married Andrew Stroud, adetectivewith theNew York Police Department, in December 1961. In a few years he became hermanagerand the father of her daughterLisa, but Simone later claimed that he abused her psychologically and physically.[9][39]Simone said that Stroud treated her "like awork horse" in an interview with the BBC in 1999.[14]
In 1964, Simone changed record distributors from Colpix, an American company, to the DutchPhilips Records, which meant a change in the content of her recordings. She had always included songs in her repertoire that drew on her African-American heritage, such as "Brown Baby" byOscar Brownand "Zungo" byMichael Olatunjion her albumNina at the Village Gatein 1962. On her debut album for Philips,Nina Simone in Concert(1964), for the first time she addressed racial inequality in the United States in the song "Mississippi Goddam". This was her response to the June 12, 1963, murder ofMedgar Eversand the September 15, 1963,bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Churchin Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four young black girls and partly blinded a fifth. She said that the song was "like throwing ten bullets back at them", becoming one of many other protest songs written by Simone. The song was released as a single, and it was boycotted in some[vague]southern states.[40][41]Promotional copies were smashed by a Carolina radio station and returned to Philips.[42]
She later recalled how "Mississippi Goddam" was her "first civil rights song" and that the song came to her "in a rush of fury, hatred and determination". The song challenged the belief that race relations could change gradually and called for more immediate developments: "me and my people are just about due." It was a key moment in her path to Civil Rights activism.[43]"Old Jim Crow", on the same album, addressed theJim Crow laws. After "Mississippi Goddam", acivil rightsmessage was the norm in Simone's recordings and became part of her concerts. As her political activism rose, the rate of release of her music slowed.[citation needed]
Simone performed and spoke at civil rights meetings, such as at theSelma to Montgomery marches.[44]LikeMalcolm X, her neighbor inMount Vernon, New York, she supportedblack nationalismand advocated violent revolution rather thanMartin Luther King Jr.'s non-violent approach.[45]She hoped that African Americans could use armed combat to form a separate state, though she wrote in her autobiography that she and her family regarded all races as equal.[46]
In 1967, Simone moved from Philips toRCA Victor. She sang "Backlash Blues" written by her friend, Harlem Renaissance leaderLangston Hughes, on her first RCA Victor album,Nina Simone Sings the Blues(1967). OnSilk & Soul(1967), she recordedBilly Taylor's "I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free" and "Turning Point". The album'Nuff Said!(1968) contained live recordings from theWestbury Music Fairof April 7, 1968, three days after theassassination of Martin Luther King Jr.She dedicated the performance to him and sang "Why? (The King of Love Is Dead)," a song written by her bass player,Gene Taylor.[47]In 1969, she performed at theHarlem Cultural Festivalin Harlem'sMount Morris Park. The performance was recorded and is featured inQuestlove's 2021 documentarySummer of Soul.[48][49]
Simone andWeldon Irvineturned the unfinished playTo Be Young, Gifted and BlackbyLorraine Hansberryinto a civil rights song ofthe same name. She credited her friend Hansberry with cultivating her social and political consciousness. She performed the song live on the albumBlack Gold(1970). A studio recording was released as a single, and renditions of the song have been recorded byAretha Franklin(on her 1972 albumYoung, Gifted and Black) andDonny Hathaway.[40]When reflecting on this period, she wrote in her autobiography: "I felt more alive then than I feel now because I was needed, and I could sing something to help my people."[50]
In an interview forJetmagazine, Simone stated that her controversial song "Mississippi Goddam" harmed her career. She claimed that the music industry punished her by boycotting her records.[51]Hurt and disappointed, Simone left the US in September 1970, flying toBarbadosand expecting her husband and manager Stroud to communicate with her when she had to perform again. However, Stroud interpreted Simone's sudden disappearance, and the fact that she had left behind her wedding ring, as an indication of her desire for a divorce. As her manager, Stroud was in charge of Simone's income. When Simone returned to the United States, she learned that a warrant had been issued for her arrest for unpaid taxes (allegedly unpaid asa protestagainst her country's involvement with theVietnam War) and fled to Barbados to evade the authorities and prosecution.[52]Simone stayed in Barbados for quite some time and had a lengthy affair with the Prime Minister,Errol Barrow.[53][54]A close friend, singerMiriam Makeba, then persuaded her to go toLiberia.[55]When Simone relocated, she abandoned her daughter Lisa inMount Vernon.[56]Lisa eventually reunited with Simone in Liberia, but, according to Lisa, her mother was physically and mentally abusive.[57]Theabusewas so unbearable that Lisa became suicidal and she moved back to New York to live with her father.[56][57]
Simone recorded her last album for RCA,It Is Finished, in 1974, and did not make another record until 1978, when she was persuaded to go into the recording studio byCTI RecordsownerCreed Taylor. The result was the albumBaltimore, which, while not a commercial success, was fairly well received critically and marked a quiet artistic renaissance in Simone's recording output.[58]Her choice of material retained its eclecticism, ranging from spiritual songs toHall & Oates' "Rich Girl". Four years later, Simone recordedFodder on My Wingson a French label,Studio Davout.[citation needed]
During the 1980s, Simone performed regularly atRonnie Scott's Jazz Clubin London, where she recorded the albumLive at Ronnie Scott'sin 1984. Although her early on-stage style could be somewhat haughty and aloof, in later years, Simone particularly seemed to enjoy engaging with her audiences sometimes, by recounting humorous anecdotes related to her career and music and by soliciting requests.[citation needed]By this time she stayed everywhere and nowhere. She lived in Liberia, Barbados and Switzerland and eventually ended up in Paris. There she regularly performed in a small jazz club calledAux Trois Mailletzfor relatively small financial reward. The performances were sometimes brilliant and at other times Nina Simone gave up after fifteen minutes. Often she was too drunk to sing or play the piano properly. At other times she scolded the audience,[59]so that manager Raymond Gonzalez, guitarist Al Schackman and Gerrit de Bruin, a Dutch friend of hers, decided to intervene.[citation needed]
In 1987, Simone scored a major European hit with the song "My Baby Just Cares for Me". Recorded by her for the first time in 1958, the song was used in a commercial forChanel No. 5perfume in Europe, leading to a re-release of the recording. The song reached number 4 on the UK'sNMEsingles chart, giving Simone a brief surge in popularity in the UK and elsewhere.[59]
In the spring of 1988, Simone moved toNijmegenin theNetherlands. She bought an apartment next to the Belvoir Hotel with views of theWaalbrugand Ooijpolder, with the help of her friend Gerrit de Bruin, who lived with his family a few corners away. Simone was diagnosed withbipolar disorderby a friend of De Bruin, who prescribedTrilafonfor her. Despite the illness, it was generally a happy time for Simone in Nijmegen, where she could lead a fairly anonymous life. Only a few recognized her; most Nijmegen people did not know who she was. Slowly but surely her life started to improve, and she was even able to make money from the Chanel commercial after a legal battle. In 1991 Nina Simone exchanged Nijmegen forAmsterdam, where she lived for two years with friends and Hammond.[60][unreliable source?][61]
In 1993, Simone settled nearAix-en-Provencein southern France (Bouches-du-Rhône).[62]In the same year, her final album,A Single Woman, was released. She variously contended that she married or had a love affair with a Tunisian around this time, but that their relationship ended because, "His family didn't want him to move to France, and France didn't want him because he's a North African."[63]During a 1998 performance inNewark, she announced, "If you're going to come see me again, you've got to come to France, because I am not coming back."[64]She suffered frombreast cancerfor several years before she died in her sleep at her home inCarry-le-Rouet(Bouches-du-Rhône), on April 21, 2003, at the age of 70. Her Catholic funeral service at the local parish was attended by singersMiriam MakebaandPatti LaBelle, poetSonia Sanchez, actorsOssie DavisandRuby Dee, and hundreds of others. Simone's ashes were scattered in several African countries. Her daughterLisa Celeste Stroudis an actress and singer who took the stage name Simone, and who has appeared onBroadwayinAida.[65]
Simone's consciousness on the racial and social discourse was prompted by her friendship with the playwrightLorraine Hansberry.[66]Simone stated that during her conversations with Hansberry "we never talked about men or clothes. It was always Marx, Lenin and revolution – real girls' talk."[67]The influence of Hansberry planted the seed for the provocative social commentary that became an expectation in Simone'srepertoire. One of Nina's more hopeful activism anthems, "To Be Young, Gifted and Black", was written with collaboratorWeldon Irvinein the years following the playwright's passing, acquiring the title of one of Hansberry's unpublished plays. Simone's social circles included notable black activists such asJames Baldwin,Stokely CarmichaelandLangston Hughes: the lyrics of her song "Backlash Blues" were written by Hughes.[67]
Simone's social commentary was not limited to thecivil rights movement; the song "Four Women" exposed theEurocentricappearance standards imposed on Black women in America,[68]as it explored theinternalized dilemma of beautythat is experienced between four Black women with skin tones ranging from light to dark. She explains in her autobiographyI Put a Spell on Youthat the purpose of the song was to inspire Black women to define beauty and identity for themselves without the influence of societal impositions.[69]Chardine Taylor-Stone has noted that, beyond the politics of beauty, the song also describes the stereotypical roles that many Black women have historically been restricted to: themammy, thetragic mulatto, thesex worker, and theangry Black woman.[67]
Simone assembled a collection of songs that became standards in her repertoire. Some were songs that she wrote herself, while others were new arrangements of other standards, and others had been written especially for the singer. Her first hit song in America was her rendition ofGeorge Gershwin's "I Loves You, Porgy" (1958). It peaked at number 18 on theBillboardmagazine Hot 100 chart.[70]
During that same period, Simone recorded "My Baby Just Cares for Me", which would become her biggest success years later, in 1987, after it was featured in a 1986Chanel No. 5perfume commercial.[71]Amusic videowas also created byAardman Studios.[72]Well-known songs from her Philips albums include "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" onBroadway-Blues-Ballads(1964); "I Put a Spell on You", "Ne me quitte pas" (a rendition of aJacques Brelsong), and "Feeling Good" onI Put a Spell On You(1965); and "Lilac Wine" and "Wild Is the Wind" onWild is the Wind(1966).[73]
"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" and her takes on "Sinnerman" (Pastel Blues, 1965) and "Feeling Good" have remained popular incover versions(most notably a version of the former song byThe Animals), sample usage, and their use on soundtracks for various movies, television series, and video games. "Sinnerman" has been featured in the filmsThe Crimson Pirate(1952),The Thomas Crown Affair(1999),High Crimes(2002),Cellular(2004),Déjà Vu(2006),Miami Vice(2006),Golden Door(2006),Inland Empire(2006),Harriet(2019) andLicorice Pizza(2021), as well as in TV series such asHomicide: Life on the Street(1998, "Sins of the Father"),Nash Bridges(2000, "Jackpot"),Scrubs(2001, "My Own Personal Jesus"),Chuck(2010, "Chuck vs. the Honeymooners"),Boomtown(2003, "The Big Picture"),Person of Interest(2011, "Witness"),Shameless(2011, "Kidnap and Ransom"),Love/Hate(2011, "Episode 1"),Sherlock(2012, "The Reichenbach Fall"),The Blacklist(2013, "The Freelancer"),Vinyl(2016, "The Racket"),Lucifer(2017, "Favorite Son"), andThe Umbrella Academy(2019, "Extra Ordinary"), and sampled by artists such asTalib Kweli(2003, "Get By"),Timbaland(2007, "Oh Timbaland"), andFlying Lotus(2012, "Until the Quiet Comes"). The song "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" was sampled byDevo Springsteenon "Misunderstood" fromCommon's2007 albumFinding Forever, and by little-known producers Rodnae and Mousa for the song "Don't Get It" onLil Wayne's 2008 albumTha Carter III. "See-Line Woman" was sampled byKanye Westfor "Bad News" on his album808s & Heartbreak. The 1965 rendition of "Strange Fruit", originally recorded byBillie Holiday, was sampled byKanye Westfor "Blood on the Leaves" on his albumYeezus.[74][75]
Simone's years at RCA spawned many singles and album tracks that were popular, particularly in Europe. In 1968, it was "Ain't Got No, I Got Life", a medley from the musicalHairfrom the album'Nuff Said!(1968) that became a surprise hit for Simone, reaching number 2 on theUK Singles Chartand introducing her to a younger audience.[76][77]In 2006, it returned to the UK Top 30 in a remixed version by Groovefinder.[citation needed]
The following single, a rendition of theBee Gees' "To Love Somebody", also reached the UK Top 10 in 1969. "The House of the Rising Sun" was featured onNina Simone Sings the Bluesin 1967, but Simone had recorded the song in 1961 and it was featured onNina at the Village Gate(1962).[78][79]
Simone's bearing and stage presence earned her the title "the High Priestess of Soul".[80]She was a pianist, singer and performer, "separately, and simultaneously".[citation needed]As a composer and arranger, Simone moved fromgospelto blues, jazz, andfolk, and to numbers with European classical styling. Besides usingBach-stylecounterpoint, she called upon the particular virtuosity of the 19th-centuryRomanticpiano repertoire—Chopin,Liszt,Rachmaninoff, and others. Jazz trumpeterMiles Davisspoke highly of Simone, deeply impressed by her ability to play three-part counterpoint and incorporate it into pop songs and improvisation.[29]Onstage, she incorporated monologues and dialogues with the audience into the program, and often used silence as a musical element.[81]Throughout most of her life and recording career she was accompanied by percussionist Leopoldo Fleming and guitarist and musical directorAl Schackman.[82]She was known to pay close attention to the design and acoustics of each venue, tailoring her performances to individual venues.[29]Rolling Stoneonce said that Simone could "channel every facet of lived experience." Simone was often credited for her ability to express an expansive emotional range in her music, from immeasurable rage to limitless joy.[83]
Simone was perceived as a sometimes difficult or unpredictable performer, occasionally hectoring the audience if she felt they were disrespectful. Schackman would try to calm Simone during these episodes, performing solo until she calmed offstage and returned to finish the engagement. Her early experiences as a classical pianist had conditioned Simone to expect quiet attentive audiences, and her anger tended to flare up at nightclubs, lounges, or other locations where patrons were less attentive.[29]Schackman described her live appearances as hit or miss, either reaching heights of hypnotic brilliance or on the other hand mechanically playing a few songs and then abruptly ending concerts early.[citation needed]
Simone is regarded as one of the most influential recording artists of 20th-century jazz, cabaret and R&B genres.[84]According toRickey Vincent, she was a pioneering musician whose career was characterized by "fits of outrage and improvisational genius". Pointing to her composition of "Mississippi Goddam," Vincent said Simone broke the mold, having the courage as "an established black musical entertainer to break from the norms of the industry and produce direct social commentary in her music during the early 1960s".[85]
Rolling Stonewrote that "her honey-coated, slightly adenoidal cry was one of the most affecting voices of the civil rights movement," while making note of her ability to "belt barroom blues, croon cabaret and explore jazz—sometimes all on a single record".[86]In the opinion ofAllMusic's Mark Deming, she was "one of the most gifted vocalists of her generation, and also one of the most eclectic".[87]Creed Taylor, who wrote the liner notes for Simone's 1978Baltimorealbum, said the singer possessed a "magnificent intensity" that "turns everything—even the most simple, mundane phrase or lyric—into a radiant, poetic message".[88]Jim Fusilli, music critic forThe Wall Street Journal, writes that Simone's music is still relevant today: "it didn't adhere to ephemeral trends, it isn't a relic of a bygone era; her vocal delivery and technical skills as a pianist still dazzle; and her emotional performances have a visceral impact."[89]
"She is loved or feared, adored or disliked,"Maya Angelouwrote in 1970, "but few who have met her music or glimpsed her soul react with moderation."[90]
Simone was diagnosed withbipolar disorderin the late 1980s.[91]She was known for her temper and outbursts of aggression.[92]In 1985, Simone fired a gun at a record company executive, whom she accused of stealingroyalties. Simone said she "tried to kill him" but "missed."[93]In 1995, while living in France, she shot and wounded her neighbor's son with anair gunafter the boy's laughter disturbed her concentration and she perceived his response to her complaints as racial insults;[94][95]she was sentenced to eight months in jail, which wassuspendedpending apsychiatric evaluationandtreatment.[29]
According to a biographer, Simone took medication from the mid-1960s onward, although this was supposedly only known to a small group of intimates.[96]After her death, the medication was confirmed as the anti-psychoticTrilafon, which Simone's friends and caretakers sometimes surreptitiously mixed into her food when she refused to follow her treatment plan.[29]This fact was kept out of public view until 2004 when a biography,Break Down and Let It All Out, written by Sylvia Hampton andDavid Nathan(of her UK fan club), was published posthumously.[97]Singer-songwriterJanis Ian, a one-time friend of Simone's, related in her own autobiography,Society's Child: My Autobiography, two instances to illustrate Simone's volatility: one incident in which she forced a shoe store cashier at gunpoint to take back a pair of sandals she'd already worn; and another in which Simone demanded a royalty payment from Ian herself as an exchange for having recorded one of Ian's songs, and then ripped apay telephoneout of its wall when she was refused.[98]
Simone was the recipient of aGrammy Hall of Fame Awardin 2000 for her interpretation of "I Loves You, Porgy". OnHuman Kindness Day1974 inWashington, D.C., more than 10,000 people paid tribute to Simone.[99][100]Simone received twohonorary degreesin music and humanities, fromAmherst CollegeandMalcolm X College.[101][102]She preferred to be called "Dr. Nina Simone" after these honors were bestowed upon her.[103]She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.[104]
Two days before her death, Simone learned she would be awarded an honorary degree by theCurtis Institute of Music, the music school that had refused to admit her as a student at the beginning of her career.[11]
Simone has received four careerGrammy Awardnominations,[105]two during her lifetime and two posthumously. In1968, she received her first nomination forBest Female R&B Vocal Performancefor the track "(You'll) Go to Hell" from her thirteenth albumSilk & Soul(1967). The award went to "Respect" byAretha Franklin.[citation needed]
Simone garnered a second nomination in the category in 1971, for herBlack Goldalbum, when she again lost to Franklin for "Don't Play That Song (You Lied)". Franklin would again win for her cover of Simone's "Young, Gifted and Black" two years later in the same category. In2016, Simone posthumously received a nomination forBest Music Filmfor theNetflixdocumentaryWhat Happened, Miss Simone?and in2018she received a nomination forBest Rap Songas a songwriter forJay-Z's "The Story of O.J." from his4:44album, which contained a sample of "Four Women" by Simone.[citation needed]
In 1999, Simone was given a lifetime achievement award by theIrish Music Hall of Fame, presented bySinead O'Connor.[106]

The documentaryNina Simone: La légende(The Legend) was made in the 1990s by French filmmakers and based on her autobiographyI Put a Spell on You. It features live footage from different periods of her career, interviews with family, various interviews with Simone then living in the Netherlands, and while on a trip to her birthplace. A portion of footage fromThe Legendwas taken from an earlier 26-minute biographical documentary by Peter Rodis, released in 1969 and entitled simplyNina. Her filmed 1976 performance at theMontreux Jazz Festivalis available on video courtesy of Mercury Studios and is screened annually in New York City at an event called "The Rise and Fall of Nina Simone: Montreux, 1976", which is curated by Tom Blunt.[113]

Plans for a Simonebiographical filmwere released at the end of 2005, to be based on Simone's autobiographyI Put a Spell on You(1992) and to focus on her relationship in later life with her assistant, Clifton Henderson, who died in 2006; Simone's daughter,Lisa Simone Kelly, has since refuted the existence of a romantic relationship between Simone and Henderson on account of his homosexuality.[114]Cynthia Mort(screenwriter ofWill & GraceandRoseanne), wrote thescreenplayand directed the 2016 filmNina, starringZoe Saldana, who since openly apologized for taking the controversial title role.[115][116][117][118]
In 2015, two documentary features about Simone's life and music were released. The first, directed byLiz Garbus,What Happened, Miss Simone?was produced in cooperation with Simone's estate and her daughter, who also served as the film's executive producer. The film was produced as a counterpoint to the unauthorized Cynthia Mort film (Nina, 2016), and featured previously unreleased archival footage. It premiered at theSundance Film Festivalin January 2015 and was distributed byNetflixon June 26, 2015.[119]It was nominated on January 14, 2016, for a 2016Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.[120]
The second documentary in 2015,The Amazing Nina Simoneis an independent film written and directed byJeff L. Lieberman, who initially consulted with Simone's daughter,Lisabefore going the independent route and then worked closely with Simone's siblings, predominantly Sam Waymon.[121][122]The film debuted in cinemas in October 2015, and has since played more than 100 theaters in 10 countries.[123]

Sly and the Family Stonewas an Americanfunkband formed inSan Francisco, Californiain 1966 and active until 1983. They are considered to be pivotal in the development offunk,soul,R&B,rock, andpsychedelic music. Their core line-up was led by singer-songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalistSly Stone, and included Stone's brother and singer/guitaristFreddie Stone, sister and singer/keyboardistRose Stone, trumpeterCynthia Robinson, drummerGreg Errico, saxophonistJerry Martini, and bassistLarry Graham. The band was the first major American rock group to have aracially integrated, mixed-gender lineup.[2]
Formed in 1966, the group's music synthesized a variety of disparate musical genres to help pioneer the emerging "psychedelic soul" sound.[1][4]They released a series of Top 10BillboardHot 100hits such as "Dance to the Music" (1968), "Everyday People" (1968), and "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)" (1969), as well as critically acclaimed albums such asStand!(1969), which combined pop sensibility with social commentary.[5]In the 1970s, it transitioned into a darker and less commercial funk sound on releases such asThere's a Riot Goin' On(1971) andFresh(1973), proving as influential as their early work.[2]By 1975, drug problems and interpersonal clashes led to dissolution,[6]though Sly continued to record and tour with a new rotating lineup under the name "Sly and the Family Stone" until drug problems forced his effective retirement in 1987.[7]
The work of Sly and the Family Stone influenced the sound of subsequent American funk, pop, soul,R&B, andhip hop music. Music criticJoel Selvinwrote, "there are two types of black music: black music before Sly Stone, and black music after Sly Stone".[8]In 2010, they were ranked 43rd inRolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time,[9]and three of their albums are included on the most recent version ofRolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The band was inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Famein 1993.
Sylvester Stewart was born into theDallas, Texas, family of K.C. and Alpha Stewart, followers of theChurch of God in Christ(COGIC), who encouraged musical expression in the household.[10]After the Stewarts moved toVallejo, California, the youngest four children (Sylvester,Freddie,Rose, andVaetta) formed "The Stewart Four", who released a local78 RPM single, "On the Battlefield of the Lord"b/w"Walking in Jesus' Name".
While attending high school, Sylvester and Freddie joined student bands. One of Sylvester's high school musical groups was adoo-wopact calledThe Viscaynes. The Viscaynes released a few localsingles, and Sylvester recorded several solo singles under the name "Danny Stewart".
By 1964, Sylvester had become Sly Stone. He became a disc jockey for San Mateo, California-located R&B radio station KSOL, where he included white performers such asthe Beatlesandthe Rolling Stonesin his playlists. During the same period, he worked as a record producer forAutumn Records, producing for San Francisco-area bands such asthe Beau Brummelsandthe Mojo Men. One of the Sylvester Stewart-produced Autumn singles,Bobby Freeman's "C'mon and Swim", was a national hit.[11]Stewart recorded unsuccessful solo singles while at Autumn.[12]
In 1966, Sly Stone formed a band called Sly & the Stoners, which included acquaintance Cynthia Robinson on trumpet. Around the same time, Freddie founded a band called Freddie & the Stone Souls, which included Greg Errico on drums, and Ronnie Crawford on saxophone. At the suggestion of Stone's friend, saxophonist Jerry Martini, Sly and Freddie combined their bands, creating Sly and the Family Stone in November 1966. At first the group was called Sly Brothers and Sisters but after their first gig at the Winchester Cathedral, a night club inRedwood City, California, they changed the name to Sly & the Family Stone. Since both Sly and Freddie were guitarists, Sly appointed Freddie the official guitarist for the Family Stone, and taught himself to play the electronic organ. Sly also recruited Larry Graham, Robinson's cousin, to play bass guitar.
Vaetta Stewart wanted to join the band as well. She and her friends,Mary McCrearyandElva Mouton, had agospelgroup calledthe Heavenly Tones. Sly recruited the teenagers directly out of high school to becomeLittle Sister, Sly and the Family Stone's background vocalists.[13]
After a gig at the Winchester Cathedral,CBS Recordsexecutive David Kapralik signed the group to CBS'sEpic Recordslabel. The Family Stone's first album,A Whole New Thing, was released in 1967 to critical acclaim, particularly from musicians such asMose AllisonandTony Bennett.[14]However, the album's low sales restricted their playing venues to small clubs, and caused Clive Davis and the record label to intervene.[14][15]Some musicologists believe theAbaco Dreamsingle "Life And Death in G & A", recorded forA&M Recordsin 1967 and peaking at No. 74 in September 1969,[16]was performed by Sly and the Family Stone.[17]
Davis talked Sly into writing and recording a record, and he and the band reluctantly provided the single "Dance to the Music".[18]Upon its February 1968 release, "Dance to the Music" became a widespread ground-breaking hit, and was the band's first charting single, reaching No. 8 on theBillboardHot 100.[19]Just before the release of "Dance to the Music", Rose Stone joined the group as a vocalist and a keyboardist. Rose's brothers had invited her to join the band from the beginning, but she initially had been reluctant to leave her steady job at a local record store.[18]
TheDance to the Musicalbum went on to decent sales, but the follow-up,Life, was not as successful commercially.[20]In September 1968, the band embarked on its first overseas tour, to England. It was cut short after Graham was arrested for possession of marijuana and because of disagreements with concert promoters.[21]
In late 1968, Sly and the Family Stone released the single "Everyday People", which became their first No. 1 hit.[19]"Everyday People" was a protest against prejudice of all kinds[22]and popularized thecatchphrase"different strokes for different folks".[23]With itsB-side"Sing a Simple Song", it served as the lead single for the band's fourth album,Stand!, which was released on May 3, 1969. TheStand!album eventually sold more than three million copies; its title track peaked at No. 22 in the U.S.Stand!is considered one of the artistic high points of the band's career.[24]It contained the above three tracks as well as the songs "I Want to Take You Higher" (which was the B-side of the "Stand!" single), "Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey", "Sex Machine", and "You Can Make It If You Try".[24]
The band headlined theHarlem Cultural Festivalbefore tens of thousands of spectators inMount Morris Parkin 1969, several weeks before the more widely known Woodstock festival. The concert series is the subject of a 2021 documentary film directed by Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson calledSummer of Soul.[25][26]The success ofStand!secured Sly and the Family Stone a performance slot at the landmarkWoodstock Music and Art Festival. They performed their set during the early-morning hours of August 17, 1969; their performance was said to be one of the best shows of the festival.[15]A new non-album single, "Hot Fun in the Summertime", was released the same month and went to No. 2 on the U.S. pop chart (peaking in October, after the summer of 1969 had already ended).[19]In 1970, following the release of theWoodstockdocumentary, the single of "Stand!" and "I Want to Take You Higher" was reissued with the latter song now the A-side; it reached the Top 40.[19]
With the band's new-found fame and success came numerous problems. Relationships within the band were deteriorating; there was friction in particular between the Stone brothers and Larry Graham.[27]Epic requested more marketable output.[28]TheBlack Panther Partydemanded that Sly replace Gregg Errico and Jerry Martini with black instrumentalists and fire managerDavid Kapralik.[29][30]
After moving to the Los Angeles area in fall 1969, Sly Stone and his fellow band members became heavy users of illegal drugs, primarily cocaine andPCP.[31]As the members became increasingly focused on drug use and partying (Sly Stone carried a violin case filled with illegal drugs wherever he went),[32]recording slowed significantly. Between summer 1969 and fall 1971, the band released only one single, "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)"/"Everybody Is a Star", released in December 1969. "Thank You" reached the top of theBillboardHot 100 in February 1970.[19]
During 1970, Sly Stone spent most of his waking hours on drugs.[33]He became erratic and moody, and missed nearly a third of the band's concerts that year.[34]The band did close out theStrawberry Fields Festivalnear Toronto, Ontario, in August, but live appearances on television talk shows such asThe Mike Douglas ShowandThe Dick Cavett Showwent unpredictably.[35]Meanwhile, Sly hired his streetwise cohorts, Hamp "Bubba" Banks and J.B. Brown, as his personal managers; they in turn brought in gangsters such as Edward "Eddie Chin" Elliott andMafiosoJ.R. Valtrano to be Sly's bodyguards. Sly enlisted these individuals to handle his business dealings, to retrieve drugs, and to protect him from those he considered his enemies, some of whom were his own bandmates and staff.[36]A rift developed between Sly and the rest of the band;[37]in early 1971, drummer Errico became the first to leave the band for other ventures. He was replaced with a succession of drummers until Sly settled on Gerry Gibson, who only remained with the band for a year before being replaced byAndy Newmarkin 1973.
To appease fan demand for new songs, Epic began re-releasing material.A Whole New Thingwas reissued with a new cover, and several of the Family Stone's most popular recordings were packaged into the band's firstGreatest Hitsalbum.Greatest Hitsreached number two on theBillboard200in 1970.
During this period, Sly Stone negotiated a production deal withAtlantic Records, resulting in his own imprint,Stone Flower Productions. Stone Flower released four singles, including one by R&B artist Joe Hicks, one by a group called 6IX, and two pop Top 40/R&B Top 10 singles by Little Sister: "You're the One" and "Somebody's Watching You", a cover of a song fromStand!. For unclear reasons, Sly gradually withdrew his attention from Stone Flower, and the label was closed in 1971. Little Sister's "Somebody's Watching You" is the first popular recording to feature the use of adrum machinefor its rhythm track.[38]
In 1971, Sly and the Family Stone returned with a new single, "Family Affair", which became a number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. "Family Affair" was the lead single from the band's long-awaitedThere's a Riot Goin' On.
Instead of the optimistic, rock-laced soul that had characterized the Family Stone's 1960s output,There's a Riot Goin' Onwas urbanblues, filled with dark instrumentation, filtered drum machine tracks, and plaintive vocals representing the hopelessness Sly and many other people were feeling in the early 1970s.[39][40]The album is characterized by a significant amount of tape hiss – the result of Sly's extensive re-recording andoverdubbingduring production.[41]Allegedly, most of the album's instrumentation is performed by Sly alone, who enlisted the Family Stone for some of the additional instrumental parts and friends such asBilly Preston,Ike Turner, andBobby Womackfor others.[42]"(You Caught Me) Smilin'" and "Runnin' Away" were also released as singles, and performed well on the charts.
After the release ofRiot, additional lineup changes took place. In early 1972, reacting to Jerry Martini's probing about his share of the band's earnings, Sly hired saxophonistPat Rizzoas a potential replacement[43]though both ended up remaining in the band.[43]Later that year, the tension between Sly Stone and Larry Graham reached its peak. A post-concert brawl broke out between the Graham and Sly entourages; Bubba Banks and Eddie Chin, having heard that Larry had hired ahit manto kill Sly, assaulted Graham's associates.[44]Graham and his wife climbed out of a hotel window to escape, and Pat Rizzo gave them a ride to safety.[44]Unable to continue working with Sly, Graham immediately quit the Family Stone and went on to startGraham Central Station, a successful band in the same vein as Sly and the Family Stone.[45]Graham was replaced in the interim by Bobby Womack, and then by nineteen-year-oldRustee Allen.[44]
Despite the loss of the original rhythm section and Sly's escalating cocaine use, the band's next album,Fresh, was released in 1973. By this time, Sly's sound had become more stripped down, yet moresyncopatedand rhythmically complex.[46]Sly obsessively overdubbed themasters, as he had done withRiot.[47]Although the record received mixed reviews at its release and did not attract the attention enjoyed by the band's earlier work,Freshhas become recognized as one of the most important funk albums ever made.[46]Rose Stone sang lead on a gospel-styledcoverofDoris Day's "Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)", and the single "If You Want Me to Stay" became a Top 20 hit in the U.S.[19]Its follow-up,Small Talk, was released in 1974 to mixed reviews and low sales.[48][49]The firstSmall Talksingle, "Time For Livin'", became the band's final Top 40 hit single. "Loose Booty", the second single, peaked at No. 84.
During the 1970s, Sly or another of the band members would often miss a gig, refuse to play, or pass out from drug use, impacting their live bookings.[50]At many gigs, concert-goers rioted if the band failed to appear or if Sly walked out before finishing his set. Ken Roberts became the group's promoter, and later their general manager, when other representatives would not work with the band because of their erratic attendance.[51]In January 1975, the band booked itself atRadio City Music Hall. The famed music hall was only one-eighth filled, and Sly and company had to scrape together money to return home.[52]Following the Radio City engagement, the band was dissolved.[52]
Rose Stone was pulled out of the band by Bubba Banks, who was then her husband. She began a solo career, recording a Motown-style album under the name Rose Banks in 1976. Freddie Stone joined Larry Graham's group,Graham Central Station, for a time; after collaborating with his brother one last time in 1979 forBack on the Right Track, he retired from the music industry and eventually became the pastor of the Evangelist Temple Fellowship Center in Vallejo. Little Sister was also dissolved; Mary McCreary marriedLeon Russelland worked with him on music projects.[53]Andy Newmark became a successful session drummer, playing withRoxy Music,Pink Floyd,B. B. King,Steve Winwoodand others.[54]
Sly recorded two more albums for Epic:High on You(1975) andHeard You Missed Me, Well I'm Back(1976).High on Youwas billed as a Sly Stone solo album;Heard You Missed Mewas a Sly and the Family Stone album in name only. Although Sly continued to collaborate with some of the original Family Stone members on occasion, the actual band no longer existed. Sly played most of the instruments on the record himself; he maintained a band to support him for live shows. Among his main collaborators were Cynthia Robinson and Pat Rizzo from the Family Stone, and background vocalistsLynn MabryandDawn Silva, who parted with Sly in 1977 and formedThe Brides of Funkensteinin 1978. Epic released Stone from his contract in 1977, and in 1979 released10 Years Too Soon, aremixalbum featuringdiscoversions of the 1960s Family Stone hits.
Sly signed withWarner Bros.and recordedBack on the Right Track(1979). Although the album featured contributions from Freddie and Rose Stone, Sly remained unable to return to the success of his late '60s and early '70s fame.[7]He toured withGeorge Clintonand Funkadelic during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and also appeared on the 1981 Funkadelic albumThe Electric Spanking of War Babies. That year, Clinton and Sly began work on a new Sly Stone album; however, recording halted when Clinton and Funkadelic disputed with and left Warner Bros. Records in late 1981.[55]When Sly disappeared into seclusion, producerStewart Levinecompleted the album, which was released asAin't But the One Wayin 1982. The album sold poorly and received mixed critical reception, but Sly made an appearance onLate Night With David Lettermanthat year.[55]Overcome by drug addictions, Sly Stone toured the United States with various backup acts. In June 1983 in Ft. Myers, Florida, he was arrested on drug possession and entered court-ordered drug rehabilitation in 1983. Once released, Sly continued sporadically releasing new singles and collaborations until a 1987 arrest and conviction for cocaine possession and use. Afterwards, he stopped releasing music.
In 1992, Sly and the Family Stone appeared on theRed Hot Organization's dance compilation album,Red Hot + Dance, contributing an original track, "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) (Todds CD Mix)". The album attempted to raise awareness and money in support of the AIDS epidemic, and all proceeds were donated to AIDS charities.
In 2009 the documentaryComing Back for Morewas released. Sly tells directorWillem Alkemaabout his conflicts with his managerJerry Goldsteinand that because of this he is forced to live in hotels.
On August 16, 2011, the albumI'm Back! Family & Friendswas released. The album features re-recorded versions of Sly and the Family Stone's greatest hits with guest appearances fromJeff Beck,Ray Manzarek,Bootsy Collins,Ann Wilson,Carmine Appice, andJohnny Winter, as well as three previously unreleased songs.
One month later, on September 25, 2011, theNew York Postreported that Sly Stone was now homeless and living out of a white camper-van in Los Angeles: "The van is parked on a residential street in Crenshaw, the rough Los Angeles neighborhood whereBoyz n the Hoodwas set. A retired couple makes sure he eats once a day, and Stone showers at their house."[56]
Sly Stone produced for and performed with black and white musicians during his early career, and he integrated music by white artists into black radio station KSOL's playlist as a DJ. Similarly, the Sly and the Family Stone sound was amelting potof many influences and cultures, includingJames Brownfunk,Motownpop,Staxsoul, Broadway showtunes, andpsychedelicrock music.[7]Wah-wahguitars,distorted fuzzbasslines,church-styled organ lines, and horn riffs provided the musical backdrop for the vocals of the band's four lead singers.[20][24]Sly Stone, Freddie Stone, Larry Graham, and Rose Stone traded off on various bars of each verse, a style of vocal arrangement unusual and revolutionary at that time in popular music.[57]Cynthia Robinson shouted ad-libbed vocal directions to the audience and the band; for example, urging everyone to "get on up and 'Dance to the Music'" and demanding that "all thesquaresgo home!"[58]
The lyrics for the band's songs were often pleas for peace, love, and understanding among people. These calls against prejudice andself-hatewere underscored by the band's on-stage appearance. White musicians Gregg Errico and Jerry Martini were members of the band at a time when integrated performance bands were virtually unknown;integrationhad only recently become enforced by law. Female members Cynthia Robinson and Rosie Stone played instruments onstage, rather than just providing vocals or serving as visual accompaniment for the male members.[59]The band's gospel-styled singing endeared them to black audiences; their rock music elements and wild costuming—including Sly's largeAfroand tight leather outfits, Rose's blond wig, and the other members' loud psychedelic clothing—caught the attention of mainstream audiences,[unreliable source?][60]and helped the group enjoy success as a pop act.[61]
Although "Dance to the Music" was the band's only hit single until late 1968, the impact of that single and theDance to the MusicandLifealbums reverberated across the music industry.[57]The smooth, piano-based "Motown sound" was out; "psychedelic soul" was in,[57]and the band would become a leading exponent of the sound.[1][4]Rock-styled guitar lines similar to the ones Freddie Stone played began appearing in the music of artists such asThe Isley Brothers("It's Your Thing") andDiana Ross & the Supremes("Love Child"). Larry Graham invented the "slapping technique" of bass guitar playing, which became synonymous with funk music.[45]Some musicians changed their sound completely to co-opt that of Sly and the Family Stone, most notably Motown in-house producerNorman Whitfield, who took his main actThe Temptationsinto "psychedelic soul" territory starting with theGrammy-winning "Cloud Nine" in 1968.[62]The early work of Sly and the Family Stone was also a significant influence on the music ofMichael Jackson&The Jackson 5and soul/hip-hop groups such asGeorge Clinton&Parliament/Funkadelic,Arrested Development, andThe Black Eyed Peas.[63]
The later work of Sly and the Family Stone was as influential as the band's early work.There's a Riot Goin' On,Fresh, andSmall Talkare considered among the first and best examples of the matured version of funk music, after prototypical instances of the sound in the band's 1960s work.[7][64]A 2003 article forRolling Stonecommented; "Sly and the Family Stone created a musical utopia: an interracial group of men and women who blended funk, rock and positive vibes... Sly Stone ultimately discovered that his utopia had a ghetto, and he brilliantly tore the whole thing down onThere's a Riot Goin' On, which does not refute the joy of his earlier music."[65]In a retrospective review, Zeth Lundy ofPopMatterscalledThere's a Riot Goin' On"a challenging listen, at times rambling, incoherent, dissonant, and just plain uncomfortable" with "some episodic moments of pop greatness to be found" and viewed it as a radical departure from the band's previous work:
[It] sank their previously burgeoning idealism at a time when social disillusionment was all the rage. Sly had found something else to take him higher and, as a result,Riotis a record very much informed by drugs, paranoia, and a sort of halfhearted malcontent [...] listening to it isn't exactly a pleasurable experience. It's significant in the annals of pop and soul because it is blunt and unflinching, because it reflects personal and cultural crises in a manner unbecoming for pop records at the time.Riotcan be classified as avant-soul only after being recognized as a soul nightmare—the 'nightmare', so to speak, being a reflection of an unfortunate and uncompromised reality, not a glossed-over pop-music approximation of reality.[66]
WriterColin Larkindescribed the album as "unlike anything heard before in black music".[67]Herbie Hancockwas inspired by Sly's new funk sound to move towards a more electric sound with his material,[68]resulting inHead Hunters(1973).Miles Daviswas similarly inspired by the band and worked with Sly Stone on his recordings, resulting inOn the Corner; the sartorial and band lineup changes hallmarkedjazz fusion.[69]Davis was particularly impressed with material from Stone's 1973 albumFresh.[70]British musician andambient musicpioneerBrian EnocitedFreshas having heralded a shift in the history ofrecording, "where the rhythm instruments, particularly the bass drum and bass, suddenly [became] the important instruments in the mix."[71]Artists such as Michael Jackson,Stevie Wonder,Prince,Outkast,Chuck D, theRed Hot Chili Peppers, andJohn Mayerhave also shown significant inspiration from the post-1970 work of Sly and the Family Stone.[72][73]
Sly and the Family Stone were inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Famein 1993. The original members of the Family Stone were in attendance, except Sly. Just as the band took the podium to receive their awards, Sly suddenly appeared. He accepted his award, made some very brief remarks ("See you soon"), and disappeared from public view.[74]In December 2001, Sly and the Family Stone were awarded the R&B Foundation Pioneer Award.

The version of "Family Affair" won the 2007 R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal Grammy.[81]
The group was inducted into theVocal Group Hall of Famein 2007.[82]
A Sly and the Family Stone tribute took place at the2006 Grammy Awardson February 8, 2006. The original plan, to have been a surprise for audiences, was to feature a reunion performance by the original Sly and the Family Stone lineup as the highlight of the tribute. However, the Grammy Award show's producers were worried that Sly Stone, who missed some of the rehearsals and belatedly arrived for others, would miss the show.[83]
The tribute began halfway through the Grammy Awards ceremony, and was introduced by comedianDave Chappelle. It featuredNile Rodgers, Joss Stone, Van Hunt, andJohn Legendperforming "Family Affair";FantasiaandDevin Limaperforming "If You Want Me to Stay";Adam LevineandCiaraperforming "Everyday People"; will.i.am performing "Dance to the Music"; and Steven Tyler andJoe PerryofAerosmithwith Robert Randolph performing "I Want to Take You Higher".[84]
After the first half of "I Want to Take You Higher", the Family Stone took the stage alongside the other musicians, and Tyler called backstage "Hey, Sly; let's do it the way we used to do it!" Sporting a blondemohawkhairdo, sunglasses, and a silverlamésuit, Sly Stone emerged and contributed vocals and keyboards to a continuation of "I Want To Take You Higher." Three minutes into the performance, Sly tossed a wave to the audience and exited the stage, leaving the Family Stone and the guest performers to complete the number alone.[83]
Sly's unusual appearance and brief performance garnered highly mixed reviews and was covered throughout the press. OneAssociated Pressreport referred to Sly as the "J. D. Salingerof funk" and simply referred to the performance as being "bizarre".[83]Another AP report stated that "nineteen years after his last live performance, Sly Stone proved he's still able to steal the show."[85]MTV Newswas much less complimentary: "The Grammy performance—Sly's first with the original Family Stone since 1971—was a halting, confused affair and a complete disservice to his music."[34]
This listing features the lineup from 1967 to 1975. After 1975, the lineup changed with each of the last four LPs.

Gladys Knight & the Pipswere an AmericanR&B,soul, andfunkfamily music group fromAtlanta, Georgia, that remained active on the music charts and performing circuit for over three decades starting from the early 1950s.
Starting out as simplyThe Pipsin 1952, derived from a cousin's nickname, the founding members wereGladys Knight, brotherMerald "Bubba" Knight, sister Brenda Knight and cousins Eleanor Guest andWilliam Guest. After a couple of years performing in talent shows, the group signed withBrunswick Recordsin 1957, recording a couple of singles that failed to chart. Brenda Knight and Eleanor Guest eventually left the group and were replaced by another cousin,Edward Patten, and a non-relative, Langston George in 1959. This lineup produced the group's first hit single, "Every Beat of My Heart". After the single was released on three different labels, they changed their name toGladys Knight & the Pipsin 1961. Langston George left the same year and Gladys Knight left in 1962 to start a family with musician Jimmy Newman. Knight rejoined in 1964 and this lineup continued until the group's disbandment in 1989.
The group reached commercial success after signing withMotown Recordsin 1966. After a year and a half, the group recorded the first hit single version of "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" in 1967, which led to several hit singles for Motown's Soul Records label, including "Nitty Gritty", "Friendship Train", "If I Were Your Woman", "I Don't Want to Do Wrong" and the Grammy-winning "Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)", before leaving the label forBuddah Recordsin 1973.  At Buddah, they recorded the hits "Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me", "I've Got to Use My Imagination", "I Feel a Song (In My Heart)" and their Grammy-winning and number-one hit single, "Midnight Train to Georgia". In 1974, they recorded thesoundtrackto the successful filmClaudinewith producerCurtis Mayfield, which included the songs "On and On", "The Makings of You" and "Make Yours a Happy Home".  Contractual difficulties with their labels forced the group to record side projects from 1977 until 1980 when they signed withColumbia Records. Later hits included "Landlord", "Save the Overtime (For Me)" and the Grammy-winning single "Love Overboard". In 1989, the group disbanded with the Pips retiring and Knight embarking on a successful solo career.
Gladys Knight & the Pips are multipleGrammyandAmerican Music Awardwinners and are inductees into theRock and Roll Hall of Fame[1]and theVocal Group Hall of Famein 1996 and 2001 respectively.[2]
Gladys Knight performed onTed Mack'sOriginal Amateur Hourin 1952 at the age of eight, winning first prize. On September 4, 1952, Gladys, Bubba, sister Brenda and their cousins William and Eleanor Guest began performing together during Bubba's tenth birthday party after a record player malfunctioned. Shortly afterwards, the quintet agreed to form a group under the insistence of Gladys' mother Elizabeth Knight. They settled on the name The Pips,[3]inspired by the nickname of their cousin James "Pip" Woods. By 1955, the group began performing on the talent show circuit in their hometown of Atlanta, winning each talent show they entered. This success allowed them to get a record contract withBrunswick Recordsin 1957.[3]At Brunswick, the group released two recordings that failed to chart. Despite this, the group was now opening for top recording acts such asJackie WilsonandSam Cooke.
By 1959, Brunswick dropped the group and both Brenda Knight and Eleanor Guest left the group to begin families.[3]They were replaced by another cousin, Edward Patten, and a friend, Langston George.[3]Patten and George were involved in another group before joining the Pips.
In 1961, the Pips recorded theJohnny Otis-penned "Every Beat of My Heart".[3]Because the group was without a record label, a local Atlanta label, Huntom Records, pushed the single and got a distribution deal withVee-Jay Recordsto release the single.[3]During this time, the group moved to New York where they auditioned forBobby Robinson'sFury Records.[3]Upon learning that "Every Beat of My Heart" was already becoming a hit and cutting the group out of profits, Robinson had the group re-record the song and re-release it on Fury Records.[3]Both versions made the Billboard charts, with the Huntom/Vee-Jay version reaching number six on theBillboardHot 100. Prior to the re-release on Fury Records, the group changed their name to Gladys Knight & the Pips.[4]Later in 1961, the newly christened quintet released the single, "Letter Full of Tears", which became another top 40 hit in early 1962.[3]After a string of single releases on Fury Records, Langston George left the group in 1962.[5]
The group's success was halted by Gladys Knight's sudden departure in 1962 to start a family with husband Jimmy Newman, a musician. Knight gave birth to the couple's son James Gaston Newman III in August 1962. A daughter, Kenya Maria Newman, was born in November 1963. During this period, the Pips kept performing and recording to little fanfare, and eventually each Pip took odd jobs while Gladys Knight began performing solo with Newman, now her musical director. Eventually Gladys reunited with the Pips and signed with a local New York label, Maxx Records, that year.[3]During that time, Newman served as the group's musical director. During this period, the group were mentored by Maurice King andCholly "Pops" Atkins; their association with King going back to the group's early years traveling to Detroit. The group recorded a third top 40 single withVan McCoy's "Giving Up" in 1964.  Other notable songs they released on Maxx on theGladys Knight and the Pipsalbum include "Lovers Always Forgive", "(There Will Never Be) Another Love", "Either Way I Lose", "Go Away, Stay Away", "Maybe Maybe Baby", ""Stop and Get a Hold of Myself", "Who Knows? (I Just Can't Trust You)" and "If I Should Ever Fall in Love".
The group developed a reputation for exciting and polished live performances, that enabled them to work even without the benefit of bestselling records. Choreographer Atkins designed "fast-stepping" dance routines that became a signature of the Pips' stage presentation; Atkins later described his working and personal relationship with the group in his autobiography,Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins: "The one thing that I was pleased about was a stipulation in my contract that allowed me to keep working with Gladys Knight & the Pips as personal clients even though I would be an employee of Motown Records. To tell the truth, Gordy wasn't too happy about it at first, but this is something that I would not compromise under any circumstances. By that time, Gladys and the guys were like my own children!"[6]
By the end of 1965,Berry Gordywas scouting to get the group signed to hisMotownlabel. Knight initially refused to sign due to her fears that the label would overlook them for the more popular artists on his roster, but she was outvoted by the Pips. They would sign with Motown in 1966, being assigned to Motown's Soul Records label, a label which featured acts who had more of an R&B flavor than a pop one. Their first Motown single, "Just Walk in My Shoes", was a hit in the UK, but the group was disappointed in Motown havingThe Andantessing over the Pips' signatureharmonyin the song, resulting in the group demanding that the Andantes not be featured on anymore of the group's recordings. They also were one of the few Motown acts that did not regularly perform on the label's Motortown Revues, with an exception being a Christmas showcase at the Fox Theater in Detroit, recorded for the album,Motortown Revue Live. A second single, "Take Me in Your Arms and Love Me", also reached the charts in the UK.
Their third single, "Everybody Needs Love", became the group's first American charted single in two years, reaching number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number three R&B after its release in 1967. On theA&E Networktelevision programBiography, Knight stated that she and the Pips were regarded as a second-string act, and that "Diana (Ross) & the Supremes,The Temptations, andMarvin Gayewere given all the hits, while we took the leftovers." In Knight's autobiography,Between Each Line of Pain and Glory: My Life Story,[7]she stated thatDiana Rosshad the group removed from being The Supremes' opening act on a 1968 tour for, according to Knight, being 'too good'. The group finally scored a career breakthrough with their fourth Motown single, "I Heard It Through the Grapevine", which reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the R&B chart.[3]The group's recording became Motown's bestselling single ever to that point, selling over 2.5 million copies.[8]Marvin Gaye's version of the song, released in 1968, outsold the group's version, selling four million copies and reaching number one on the Hot 100. While at Motown in 1968, Knight was the first person to suggest thatBerry Gordysign the up-and-coming group calledThe Jackson Five(thoughBobby Taylorof the Vancouvers also had a role), after appearing with them on a concert held inGary, Indiana, to help elect MayorRichard Hatcher, despite the claim that Diana Ross discovered them.
Following the success of "Grapevine", the group worked frequently withNorman Whitfield.[3]Whitfield produced them the hits, "The End of Our Road", "It Should've Been Me", "Friendship Train", "Nitty Gritty" and "You Need Love Like I Do (Don't You)".[3]They also recordedAshford & Simpson's "Didn't You Know (You'd Have To Cry Sometime)" in 1969. They scored their second million-selling Motown single with the ballad "If I Were Your Woman" in 1970.[3]Another ballad, the self-composed "I Don't Want to Do Wrong", became another million-selling single. Both singles were featured on their first number one album, also titledIf I Were Your Woman. In late 1971, they released a soulful version ofKris Kristofferson's "Help Me Make It Through the Night", which became an international hit. The group released theJim Weatherlyballad, "Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)", in December 1972, the single would become their last single released while still with the label.[3]As the single was charting, the group tried to negotiate a better contract with Motown.[3]Negotiations fell through weeks later and, in February 1973, the group left Motown and signed withBuddah Records.[9]"Neither One of Us" became their biggest selling single at Motown, reaching number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and winning the group a Grammy forBest Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.
Following the signing with Buddah Records, the label issued another Weatherly ballad, "Where Peaceful Waters Flow", released around the same time "Neither One of Us" and a Motown single, "Daddy Could Swear, I Declare", was charting. The song became a modest success as a result. The group reached its popular and critical peak soon afterwards, starting with the release of another Weatherly song, "Midnight Train to Georgia", in August 1973.[3]The song eventually hit number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B singles charts, becoming theirsignature song.
They followed that single with the release of the million-selling album,Imagination, which released two more top ten singles, "I've Got to Use My Imagination" and "Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me".[3]The release ofImaginationsparked a consecutive series of million-selling albums for the label including thesoundtrackto the movie,Claudine;[3]I Feel a Songand2nd Anniversary.[3]In 1975, the group scored a mid-season variety series,The Gladys Knight & the Pips Show, that aired for four episodes on NBC.[3]During this time, the group recorded more hit singles, including "I Feel a Song (In My Heart)", "Part-Time Love", "Love Finds Its Own Way" and the live recording, "The Way We Were/Try to Remember".[3]
By 1977, the group ran into contract disputes with both Motown and Buddah Records.[3]After asking to be released from their contract from Buddah, the label forced the band to record side projects while the dispute was settled.[3]Between 1978 and 1980, Knight released two solo albums and the Pips released two side albums.[3]In a segment forRichard Pryor's TV special, the Pips (minus Gladys) appeared on his show performing their backup verses for the songs "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" and "Midnight Train to Georgia"; during parts where Gladys would sing, the camera panned on a lone-standing microphone. The group still performed together during this period, which ended with the group signing withColumbia Recordsin 1980.[3]
In 1980, having signed with Columbia, the group reunited with their old Motown collaborators Ashford & Simpson, recording and releasing the album,About Love, which included the charted singles "Taste of Bitter Love", "Bourgie, Bourgie" and "Landlord".[3]They continued the collaboration with the duo on their 1981 follow-up,Touch, which included the single "I Will Fight", and a cover of "I Will Survive". Also in 1981, the group provided prominent backing vocals forKenny Rogerson his remake of Bobby "Blue" Bland's "Share Your Love with Me". The group had appeared on Rogers' television show with the First Edition several times in the early 1970s, and Knight guested on Rogers' TV special,Kenny Rogers Classic Weekendin 1986, performing a duet of "Am I Too Late?", a song both singers had previously recorded. Three years later she also collaborated with Rogers on the US Billboard AC top ten single "If I Knew Then What I Know Now".
Following a year-long international tour, the group recorded their third Columbia album,Visions, in 1983.[3]The leading single, "Save the Overtime (For Me)", gave the group their first number one R&B single in eight years.[3]The video accompanying the song became among the earliest R&B videos to incorporate elements of hip-hop culture. The album also included the R&B hit "You're Number One (In My Book)".[3]After Knight partook in solo projects, including a No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 and R&B hit collaboration on the song, "That's What Friends Are For", the group signed withMCA Recordsand released their final albumAll Our Lovein 1987.  The album was certified gold and included the hits "Lovin' On Next to Nothin'" and their Grammy-winning number-one single, "Love Overboard".[3]In 1988 the band also won aSoul Train Music Award for Career Achievement. Gladys Knight & the Pips embarked on their final tour in 1988 and disbanded upon its conclusion, as Knight decided she wanted to pursue a solo career, ending a 37-year tenure.[3]
Following the group's amicable disbandment in 1989, Edward Patten and William Guest formed their own production company in Detroit, titled Guest and Patten Productions, later renamed the Crew Entertainment Company. Patten was diagnosed withdiabetes, which led to amputations of his legs and being confined to a wheelchair. He died of complications from the disease on February 25, 2005, inLivonia, Michigan. William Guest continued to lead the company with members of Patten's family until his death from congestive heart failure in Detroit on December 24, 2015.[10]Two years prior, Guest and his sister, Dame Dhyana Ziegler, PhD, released his autobiography,Midnight Train FROM Georgia: A Pip's Journey(Branden Books, Boston, MA, USA), about his life and career. In 2007, Bubba Knight and Guest, along with a third man, Neil Taffe (one of Gladys Knight's background singers), appeared in a commercial forGeico.[11][12]On August 23, 1997, original Pips member Eleanor Guest died of heart failure.[13][14][15]Langston George died on March 19, 2007, from congestive heart failure.[5]
Bubba Knight still continues to oversee his sister's career, by being her tour manager and occasionally joining Gladys onstage during performances. Gladys Knight recorded the theme song for theJames Bondfilm,Licence to Killin 1989, which became a top ten single in the UK.[3]Two years later, she released her 1991 album,Good Woman, which included the top five R&B hit, "Men", and Grammy-nominated duet version of "Superwoman", recorded withDionne WarwickandPatti LaBelle. A 1994 album,Just for You, featured the hits "I Don't Wanna Know" and her cover ofBoyz II Men's "End of the Road", and went gold. Knight still records and performs today. As a member ofthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, she sometimes leads theSaints Unified Voiceschoir.
The group was inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Famein 1996, theVocal Group Hall of Famein 2001 and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rhythm & Blues Foundation in 1998. Gladys Knight & the Pips are ranked as the ninth most successful act inThe Billboard Top 40 Book of R&B and Hip-Hop Hits(2005). They were also ranked No. 91 onVH1'sTop 100 Artists of Rock n' Roll.

Linked page for 'Mahalia Jackson' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalia_Jackson):
Mahalia Jackson(/məˈheɪliə/mə-HAY-lee-ə; bornMahala Jackson; October 26, 1911 – January 27, 1972)[a]was an Americangospel singer, widely considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century. With a career spanning 40 years, Jackson was integral to the development and spread ofgospel bluesin black churches throughout the U.S. During a time whenracial segregationwas pervasive in American society, she met considerable and unexpected success in a recording career, selling an estimated 22 million records and performing in front of integrated and secular audiences in concert halls around the world, making her one of the best-sellinggospel music artists.
The granddaughter ofenslaved people, Jackson was born and raised in poverty inNew Orleans. She found a home in her church, leading to a lifelong dedication and singular purpose to deliver God's word through song. She moved to Chicago as an adolescent and joined the Johnson Singers, one of the earliest gospel groups. Jackson was heavily influenced by musician-composerThomas DorseyandbluessingerBessie Smith, adapting Smith's style to traditionalProtestanthymnsand contemporary songs. After making an impression in Chicago churches, she was hired to sing at funerals, political rallies, andrevivals. For 15 years, she functioned as what she termed a "fish and bread singer", working odd jobs between performances to make a living.
Nationwide recognition came for Jackson in 1947 with the release of "Move On Up a Little Higher", selling two million copies and hitting the number-two spot onBillboardcharts, both firsts for gospel music. Jackson's recordings captured the attention ofjazzfans in the U.S. and France, and she became the first gospel recording artist to tour Europe. She regularly appeared on television and radio, and performed for many presidents and heads of state, including singing the national anthem atJohn F. Kennedy's Inaugural Ball in 1961. Motivated by her experiences living and touring in the South and integrating a Chicago neighborhood, she participated in thecivil rights movement, singing for fundraisers and at theMarch on Washington for Jobs and Freedomin 1963. She was a vocal and loyal supporter ofMartin Luther King Jr.and a personal friend of his family.
Throughout her career, Jackson faced intense pressure to recordsecular music, but she turned down high-paying opportunities to concentrate on gospel. Completely self-taught, Jackson had a keen instinct for music, her delivery marked by extensive improvisation with melody and rhythm. She was renowned for her powerfulcontraltovoice, range, an enormous stage presence, and her  ability to relate to her audiences, conveying and evoking intense emotion during performances. Passionate and at times frenetic, she wept and demonstrated physical expressions of joy while singing. Her success brought about international interest in gospel music, initiating the "Golden Age of Gospel" making it possible for many soloists and vocal groups to tour and record. Popular music as a whole felt her influence and she is credited with inspiringrhythm and blues,soul, androck and rollsinging styles. AGrammy Lifetime Achievement Awardrecipient, she won three competitiveGrammy Awardsand was inducted into theGrammy Hall of Fame, theNational Recording Registry, and theRock & Roll,Gospel, andR&BHalls of Fame, as well as theHollywood Walk of FameandBlack Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame. She was also named one ofNPR's50 Great Voices, and ranked amongRolling Stone's200 Greatest Singers of All Time.
Mahalia Jackson was born to Charity Clark and Johnny Jackson, astevedoreand weekend barber. Clark and Jackson were unmarried, a common arrangement among black women in New Orleans at the time. He lived elsewhere, never joining Charity as a parent. Both sets of Mahalia's grandparents were born intoslavery, her paternal grandparents on a rice plantation and her maternal grandparents on a cotton plantation inPointe Coupee Parishabout 100 miles (160 km) north ofNew Orleans.[1][2][b]Charity's older sister, Mahala "Duke" Paul, was her daughter's namesake, sharing the spelling without the "I".[c]Duke hosted Charity and their five other sisters and children in her leaky three-roomshotgun houseon Water Street in New Orleans'Sixteenth Ward. The family called Charity's daughter "Halie"; she counted as the 13th person living in Aunt Duke's house. As Charity's sisters found employment as maids and cooks, they left Duke's, though Charity remained with her daughter, Mahalia's half-brother Peter, and Duke's son Fred. Mahalia was born withbowed legsand infections in both eyes. Her eyes healed quickly but her Aunt Bell treated her legs with grease water massages with little result. For her first few years, Mahalia was nicknamed "Fishhooks" for the curvature of her legs.[1][2][3]
The Clarks were devoutBaptistsattending nearby Plymouth Rock Baptist Church.Sabbathwas strictly followed, the entire house shut down on Friday evenings and did not open again until Monday morning. As members of the church, they were expected to attend services, participate in activities there, and follow a code of conduct: no jazz, nocard games, and no "high life": drinking or visiting bars orjuke joints. Dancing was only allowed in the church when one was moved by the spirit. The adult choir at Plymouth Rock sang traditionalProtestanthymns, typically written byIsaac Wattsand his contemporaries. Jackson enjoyed the music sung by the congregation more. These songs would belined out: called out from the pulpit, with the congregation singing it back. They had a stronger rhythm, accentuated with clapping and foot-tapping, which Jackson later said gave her "the bounce" that carried with her decades later. She dutifully joined the children's choir at age four.[1][2][4]Next door to Duke's house was a smallPentecostalchurch that Jackson never attended but stood outside during services and listened raptly. Music here was louder and more exuberant. The congregation included "jubilees" or uptempospiritualsin their singing. Shouting and stomping were regular occurrences, unlike at her own church. Jackson later remembered, "These people had no choir or no organ. They used the drum, the cymbal, the tambourine, and the steel triangle. Everybody in there sang, and they clapped and stomped their feet, and sang with their whole bodies. They had a beat, a rhythm we held on to from slavery days, and their music was so strong and expressive. It used to bring tears to my eyes."[5][3]
When Jackson was five, her mother became ill and died, the cause unknown. Aunt Duke took in Jackson and her half-brother at another house on Esther Street. Duke was severe and strict, with a notorious temper. Jackson split her time between working, usually scrubbing floors and making moss-filled mattresses andcane chairs, playing along theleveescatching fish and crabs and singing with other children, and spending time at Mount Moriah Baptist Church where her grandfather sometimes preached.  The full-time minister there gave sermons with a sad "singing tone" that Jackson later said would penetrate to her heart, crediting it with strongly influencing her singing style.[6]Church became a home to Jackson where she found music and safety; she often fled there to escape her aunt's moods. She attended McDonough School 24, but was required to fill in for her various aunts if they were ill, so she rarely attended a full week of school; when she was 10, the family needed her more at home. She dropped out and began taking in laundry.[7][8][3]
Jackson worked, and she went to church on Wednesday evenings, Friday nights, and most of the day on Sundays. Already possessing a big voice at age 12, she joined the junior choir. She was surrounded by music in New Orleans, more often blues pouring out of her neighbors' houses, although she was fascinated withsecond line funeral processionsreturning from cemeteries when the musicians played brisk jazz. Her older cousin Fred, not as intimidated by Duke, collected records of both kinds. The family had aphonographand while Aunt Duke was at work, Jackson played records byBessie Smith,Mamie Smith, andMa Rainey, singing along while she scrubbed floors. Bessie Smith was Jackson's favorite and the one she most-often mimicked.[7][8][3]
Jackson's legs began to straighten on their own when she was 14, but conflicts with Aunt Duke never abated. Whippings turned into being thrown out of the house for slights and manufactured infractions and spending many nights with one of her nearby aunts. The final confrontation caused her to move into her own rented house for a month, but she was lonely and unsure of how to support herself. After two aunts, Hannah and Alice, moved to Chicago, Jackson's family, concerned for her, urged Hannah to take her back there with her after a Thanksgiving visit.[7][9][d]
In a very cold December, Jackson arrived in Chicago. For a week she was miserably homesick, unable to move off the couch until Sunday when her aunts took her to Greater Salem Baptist Church, an environment she felt at home in immediately, later stating it was "the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me".[10]When the pastor called the congregation to witness, or declare one's experience with God, Jackson was struck by the spirit and launched into a lively rendition of "Hand Me Down My Silver Trumpet, Gabriel", to an impressed but somewhat bemused audience. The power of Jackson's voice was readily apparent but the congregation was unused to such an animated delivery. She was nonetheless invited to join the 50-member choir, and a vocal group formed by the pastor's sons, Prince, Wilbur, and Robert Johnson, and Louise Lemon. They performed as a quartet, the Johnson Singers, with Prince as the pianist: Chicago's first black gospel group. Initially they hosted familiar programs singing at socials and Friday night musicals. They wrote and performed moral plays at Greater Salem with offerings going toward the church.[11][12][13]
Jackson's arrival in Chicago occurred during theGreat Migration, a massive movement of black Southerners to Northern cities. Between 1910 and 1970, hundreds of thousands of rural Southern blacks moved to Chicago, transforming a neighborhood in theSouth SideintoBronzeville, a black city within a city which was mostly self sufficient, prosperous, and teeming in the 1920s. This movement causedwhite flightwith whites moving to suburbs, leaving established white churches and synagogues with dwindling members. Their mortgages were taken over by black congregations in good position to settle in Bronzeville. Members of these churches were, in Jackson's term, "society Negroes" who were well educated and eager to prove their successful assimilation into white American society. Musical services tended to be formal, presenting solemnly delivered hymns written by Isaac Watts and other European composers. Shouting and clapping were generally not allowed as they were viewed as undignified. Special programs and musicals tended to feature sophisticated choral arrangements to prove the quality of the choir.[14][15][16]
This difference between the styles in Northern urban churches and the South was vividly illustrated when the Johnson Singers appeared at a church one evening and Jackson stood out to sing solo, scandalizing the pastor with her exuberant shouts. He accused her ofblasphemy, bringing "twisting jazz" into the church. Jackson was momentarily shocked before retorting, "This is the way wesingdown South!"[17]The minister was not alone in his apprehension. She was often so involved in singing she was mostly unaware how she moved her body. To hide her movements, pastors urged her to wear loose fitting robes which she often lifted a few inches from the ground, and they accused her of employing "snake hips" while dancing when the spirit moved her.[18]Enduring another indignity, Jackson scraped together four dollars (equivalent to $73 in 2024) to pay a talented black operatictenorfor a professional assessment of her voice. She was dismayed when the professor chastised her: "You've got to learn to stop hollering. It will take time to build up your voice. The way you sing is not a credit to the Negro race. You've got to learn to sing songs so that white people can understand them."[19]
Soon Jackson found the mentor she was seeking.Thomas A. Dorsey, a seasoned blues musician trying to transition to gospel music, trained Jackson for two months, persuading her to sing slower songs to maximize their emotional effect. Dorsey had a motive: he needed a singer to help sell hissheet music. He recruited Jackson to stand on Chicago street corners with him and sing his songs, hoping to sell them for ten cents a page. It was not the financial success Dorsey hoped for, but their collaboration resulted in the unintentional conception of gospel blues solo singing in Chicago.[12][20][21][e]
Steadily, the Johnson Singers were asked to perform at other church services andrevivals. When larger, more established black churches expressed little interest in the Johnson Singers, they were courted by smaller storefront churches and were happy to perform there, though less likely to be paid as much or at all. Newly arrived migrants attended these storefront churches; the services were less formal and reminiscent of what they had left behind. Jackson found an eager audience in new arrivals, one calling her "a fresh wind from the down-home religion."[22]Black Chicago was hit hard by theGreat Depression, driving church attendance throughout the city, which Jackson credited with starting her career.[23]Gradually and by necessity, larger churches became more open to Jackson's singing style. As many of them were suddenly unable to meet their mortgage notes, adapting their musical programs became a viable way to attract and keep new members.[24]
When she first arrived in Chicago, Jackson dreamed of being a nurse or a teacher, but before she could enroll in school she had to take over Aunt Hannah's job when she became ill. Jackson became a laundress and took a series of domestic and factory jobs while the Johnson Singers began to make a meager living, earning from $1.50 to $8 (equivalent to $28 to $151 in 2024) a night. Steady work became a second priority to singing. Jackson began calling herself a "fish and bread singer", working for herself and God.[25]She made her first recordings in 1931, singles that she intended to sell atNational Baptist Conventionmeetings, though she was mostly unsuccessful.[12][f]But as her audiences grew each Sunday, she began to get hired as a soloist to sing at funerals and political rallies forLouis B. AndersonandWilliam L. Dawson. In 1932, on Dawson's request, she sang forFranklin D. Roosevelt's presidential campaign. She had become the only professional gospel singer in Chicago. Sometimes she made $10 a week (equivalent to $230 in 2024) in what historian Michael Harris calls "an almost unheard-of professionalization of one's sacred calling".[26]
As opportunities came to her, an extraordinary moral code directed Jackson's career choices. Her lone vice was frequenting movie andvaudevilletheaters until her grandfather visited one summer and had a stroke while standing in the sun on a Chicago street. Jackson pleaded with God to spare him, swearing she would never go to a theater again. He survived and Jackson kept her promise, refusing to attend as a patron and rejecting opportunities to sing in theaters for her entire career. She furthermore vowed to sing gospel exclusively despite intense pressure. In 1935, Jackson met Isaac "Ike" Hockenhull, a chemist working as a postman during the Depression. Impressed with his attention and manners, Jackson married him after a year-long courtship. Hockenhull's mother gave the couple 200 formulas for homemade hair and skincare products she had sold door to door. Hockenhull and Jackson made cosmetics in their kitchen and she sold jars when she traveled. It was not steady work, and the cosmetics did not sell well. At one point Hockenhull had been laid off and he and Jackson had less than a dollar between them. He saw that auditions forThe Swing Mikado, a jazz-flavored retelling of theGilbert and Sullivan opera, were taking place. He demanded she go; the role would pay $60 a week (equivalent to $1,360 in 2024). Plus, he saw no value in singing gospel. He did not consider it artful. He had repeatedly urged her to get formal training and put her voice to better use. She refused and they argued about it often. Wracked by guilt, she attended the audition, later calling the experience "miserable" and "painful". When she got home she learned that the role was offered to her, but when Hockenhull informed her he also secured a job she immediately rejected the role to his disbelief. She furthermore turned downLouis ArmstrongandEarl "Fatha" Hineswhen they offered her jobs singing with their bands.[27][28]
In 1937, Jackson metMayo "Ink" Williams, a music producer who arranged a session withDecca Records. She recorded four singles: "God's Gonna Separate the Wheat From the Tares", "You Sing On, My Singer", "God Shall Wipe Away All Tears", and "Keep Me Every Day". Jackson told neither her husband or Aunt Hannah, who shared her house, of this session. The records' sales were weak, but were distributed to jukeboxes in New Orleans, one of which Jackson's entire family huddled around in a bar, listening to her again and again. Decca said they would record her further if she sang blues, and once more Jackson refused.[29][30]
The Johnson Singers folded in 1938, but as the Depression lightened Jackson saved some money, earned a beautician's license fromMadam C. J. Walker's school, and bought a beauty salon in the heart of Bronzeville. It was almost immediately successful and the center of gospel activity. Singers, male and female, visited while Jackson cooked for large groups of friends and customers on a two-burner stove in the rear of the salon. It was located across the street fromPilgrim Baptist Church, where Thomas Dorsey had become music director. Dorsey proposed a series of performances to promote his music and her voice and she agreed. They toured off and on until 1951. It was regular and, they felt, necessary work. Dorsey accompanied Jackson on piano, often writing songs specifically for her. His background as a blues player gave him extensive experience improvising and he encouraged Jackson to develop her skills during their performances by handing her lyrics and playing chords while she created melodies, sometimes performing 20 or more songs this way. She was able to emote and relate to audiences profoundly well; her goal was to "wreck" a church, or cause a state of spiritual pandemonium among the audience which she did consistently. At one event, in an ecstatic moment Dorsey jumped up from the piano and proclaimed, "Mahalia Jackson is the Empress of gospel singers! She's theEmpress! The Empress!!"[31][32]
A constant worker and a shrewd businesswoman, Jackson became the choir director at St. Luke Baptist Church. She bought a building as a landlord, then found the salon so successful she had to hire help to care for it when she traveled on weekends. On tour, she counted heads and tickets to ensure she was being paid fairly.[g]What she was able to earn and save was done in spite of Hockenhull. A compulsive gambler, he took home a large payout asking Jackson to hide it so he would not gamble it. She laid the stash in flat bills under a rug assuming he would never look there, then went to a weekend performance in Detroit. When she returned, she realized he had found it and used it to buy a race horse. In 1943, he brought home a newBuickfor her that he promptly stopped paying for. She paid for it entirely, then learned he had used it as collateral for a loan when she saw it beingrepossessedin the middle of the day on the busiest street in Bronzeville. They divorced amicably.[27][33]
Each engagement Jackson took was farther from Chicago in a nonstop string of performances. In 1946 she appeared at theGolden Gate BallroominHarlem. In attendance was Art Freeman, a music scout forApollo Records, a company catering to black artists and audiences concentrating mostly on jazz and blues. Apollo's chief executiveBess Bermanwas looking to broaden their representation to other genres, including gospel. Berman signed Jackson to a four-record session, allowing Jackson to pick the songs. Her first release on Apollo, "Wait 'til My Change Comes" backed with "I'm Going to Tell God All About it One of These Days" did not sell well. Neither did her second, "I Want to Rest" with "He Knows My Heart". Berman asked Jackson to record blues and she refused. Berman told Freeman to release Jackson from any more recordings but Freeman asked for one more session to record the song Jackson sang as a warmup at the Golden Gate Ballroom concert. "Move On Up a Little Higher" was recorded in two parts, one for each side of the 78 rpm record.[34][35]
Meanwhile, Chicago radio hostLouis "Studs" Terkelheard Jackson's records in a music shop and was transfixed. He bought and played them repeatedly on his show. Terkel introduced his mostly white listeners to gospel music and Jackson herself, interviewing her and asking her to sing live. "Move On Up a Little Higher" was released in 1947, selling 50,000 copies in Chicago and two million nationwide.[36]It landed at the number two spot on theBillboardchartsfor two weeks, another first for gospel music.[37]The best any gospel artist could expect to sell was 100,000. Berman set Jackson up for another recording session, where she sang "Even Me" (one million sold), and "Dig a Little Deeper" (just under one million sold). Instantly Jackson was in high demand. A position as the official soloist of the National Baptist Convention was created for her, and her audiences multiplied to the tens of thousands. She participated in theHarry S. Truman 1948 presidential campaign, earning her first invitation to theWhite House. Time constraints forced her to give up the choir director position at St. Luke Baptist Church and sell the beauty shop. True to her own rule, she turned down lucrative appearances in New York City at theApollo TheaterandVillage Vanguard, where she was promised $5,000 a week (equivalent to $70,000 in 2024).[38]
The next year promoter Joe Bostic approached her to perform in a gospel music revue atCarnegie Hall, a venue most often reserved for classical and well established artists such asBenny GoodmanandDuke Ellington. Jackson was intimidated by this offer and dreaded the approaching date. Gospel had never been performed at Carnegie. Jackson was the final artist to appear that evening. After a shaky start, she gave multiple encores and received voluminous praise: Nora Holt, a music critic with the black newspaperThe New York Amsterdam News, wrote that Jackson's rendition of "City Called Heaven" was filled with "suffering ecstasy" and that Jackson was a "genius unspoiled".[39]John Hammond, critic at theDaily Compass, praised Jackson's powerful voice which "she used ... with reckless abandon".[40]The revue was so successful it was made an annual event with Jackson headlining for years. The show that took place in 1951 broke attendance records set by Goodman andArturo Toscanini.[41][42]
By chance, a French jazz fan namedHugues Panassiévisited the Apollo Records office in New York and discovered Jackson's music in the waiting room. He bought her records, took them home and played them onFrench public radio. TheAcadémie Charles Crosawarded Jackson theirGrand Prix du Disquefor "I Can Put My Trust in Jesus"; Jackson was the first gospel singer to receive this award.[43]During the same time, Jackson and blues guitaristJohn Lee Hookerwere invited to a ten-day symposium hosted by jazz historianMarshall Stearnswho gathered participants to discuss how to define jazz. Jackson was accompanied by her pianist Mildred Falls, together performing 21 songs with question and answer sessions from the audience, mostly filled with writers and intellectuals. As Jackson's singing was often considered jazz or blues with religious lyrics, she fielded questions about the nature of gospel blues and how she developed her singing style. Toward the end, a participant asked Jackson what parts of gospel music come from jazz, and she replied, "Baby, don't you know the Devil stole the beat from theLord?"[44]Those in the audience wrote about Jackson in several publications. Her records were sent to the UK, traded there among jazz fans, earning Jackson a cult following on both sides of the Atlantic, and she was invited to tour Europe.[45]
Jackson had her first television appearance onToast of the TownwithEd Sullivanin 1952. As she prepared to embark on her first tour of Europe, she began having difficulty breathing during and after performances and had severe abdominal cramping. She continued with her plans for the tour where she was very warmly received. In jazz magazineDownBeat, Mason Sargent called the tour "one of the most remarkable, in terms of audience reaction, ever undertaken by an American artist".[46]Her appearance at theRoyal Albert Hallin London made her the first gospel singer to perform there since theFisk Jubilee Singersin 1872, and she pre-sold 20,000 copies of "Silent Night" in Copenhagen.[32]She played numerous shows while in pain, sometimes collapsing backstage. She lost a significant amount of weight during the tour, finally having to cancel. When she returned to the U.S., she had ahysterectomyand doctors found numerousgranulomasin her abdomen. She was diagnosed withsarcoidosis, a systemic inflammatory disease caused by immune cells forming lumps in organs throughout the body. Sarcoidosis is not curable, though it can be treated, and following the surgery, Jackson's doctors were cautiously optimistic that with treatment she could carry on as normal.[47][48]
In 1954, Jackson learned that Berman had been withholdingroyaltiesand had allowed her contract with Apollo to expire.Mitch Milleroffered her a $50,000-a-year (equivalent to $590,000 in 2024) four-year contract, and Jackson became the first gospel artist to sign withColumbia Records, a much larger company with the ability to promote her nationally. Miller attempted to make her repertoire more appealing to white listeners, asking her to record ballads and classical songs, but again she refused. "Rusty Old Halo" became her first Columbia single, andDownBeatdeclared Jackson "the greatest spiritual singer now alive".[49]Columbia worked with a local radio affiliate in Chicago to create a half hour radio program,The Mahalia Jackson Show. Although it got an overwhelmingly positive reception and producers were eager to syndicate it nationally, it was cut to ten minutes long, then canceled. She appeared on a local television program, also titledThe Mahalia Jackson Show, which again got a positive reception but was canceled for lack of sponsors. Despite white people beginning to attend her shows and sending fan letters, executives atCBSwere concerned they would lose advertisers from Southern states who objected to a program with a black person as the primary focus.[50][51]
If they're Christians, how in the world can they object to me singing hymns? How in the world can they take offense to that? In the name of the Lord, what kind of people could feel that way?
Jackson attracted the attention of theWilliam Morris Agency, a firm that promoted her by booking her in large concert halls and television appearances withArthur Godfrey,Dinah Shore,Bing Crosby, andPerry Comoin the 1950s. Her reverence and upbeat, positive demeanor made her desirable to progressive producers and hosts eager to feature a black person on television. She appeared at the1956 Democratic National Convention, silencing a rowdy hall of attendees with "I See God". Miller, who was in attendance, was awed by it, noting "there wasn't a dry eye in the house when she got through".[53]Jackson broke into films playing a missionary inSt. Louis Blues(1958), and a funeral singer inImitation of Life(1959). As demand for her rose, she traveled extensively, performing 200 dates a year for ten years. She and her entourage of singers and accompanists toured deeper into the South, encountering difficulty finding safe, clean places to sleep, eat, and buy gas due toJim Crow laws. Sometimes they had to sleep in Jackson's car, aCadillacshe had purchased to make long trips more comfortable. Jackson remembered, "The looks of anger at the sight of us colored folks sitting in a nice car were frightening to see... It got so we were living on bags of fresh fruit during the day and driving half the night, and I was so exhausted by the time I was supposed to sing, I was almost dizzy."[54]Jackson began to gain weight. She also developed peculiar habits regarding money. As a black woman, Jackson found it often impossible to cash checks when away from Chicago. Her contracts therefore demanded she be paid in cash, often forcing her to carry tens of thousands of dollars in suitcases and in her undergarments.[55]
Each event in her career and personal life broke another racial barrier. She often asked ushers to allow white and black people to sit together, sometimes asking the audiences to integrate themselves by telling them that they were all Christian brothers and sisters. After years of receiving complaints about being loud when she practiced in her apartment, even in the building she owned, Jackson bought a house in the all-white Chatham Village neighborhood of Chicago. When this news spread, she began receiving death threats. The day she moved in her front window was shot. Jackson askedRichard Daley, the mayor of Chicago, for help and Daley ordered police presence outside her house for a year. A few months later, Jackson appeared live on the television specialWide Wide Worldsinging Christmas carols from Mount Moriah, her childhood church in New Orleans. The broadcast earned excellent reviews, and Jackson received congratulatory telegrams from across the nation. Yet the next day she was unable to get a taxi or shop alongCanal Street.[55][56][h]
While attending the National Baptist Convention in 1956, Jackson metMartin Luther King Jr.andRalph Abernathy, both ministers emerging as organizers protesting segregation. Jackson often sang to support worthy causes for no charge, such as raising money to buy a church an organ, robes for choirs, or sponsoring missionaries. She extended this to civil rights causes, becoming the most prominent gospel musician associated with King and the civil rights movement. She raised money for theUnited Negro College Fundand sang at thePrayer Pilgrimage Breakfastin 1957. She later stated she felt God had especially prepared King "with the education and the warmth of spirit to do His work".[57][58]Motivated  by her sincere appreciation that civil rights protests were being organized within churches and its participants inspired by hymns, she traveled toMontgomery, Alabamato sing in support of theongoing bus boycott.[59]She and Mildred Falls stayed at Abernathy's house in a room that was bombed four months later. After hearing that black children in Virginia were unable to attend school due tointegration conflicts, she threw them an ice cream party from Chicago, singing to them over a telephone line attached to apublic address system. She similarly supported a group of black sharecroppers in Tennessee facing eviction for voting.[60][61]
As gospel music became more popular – primarily due to her influence – singers began appearing at non-religious venues as a way to spread a Christian message to nonbelievers. Jackson appeared at theNewport Jazz Festivalin 1957 and 1958, and in the latter'sconcert film,Jazz on a Summer's Day(1959).[62]Her continued television appearances withSteve Allen,Red Skelton,Milton Berle, andJimmy Durantekept her in high demand. She toured Europe again in 1961 with incredible success, mobbed in several cities and needing police escorts. All dates in Germany were sold out weeks in advance. InEssen, she was called to give so many encores that she eventually changed into her street clothes and the stage hands removed the microphone. Still she sang one more song. The highlight of her trip was visiting theHoly Land, where she knelt and prayed atCalvary.[63][64]
When King was arrested and sentenced to four months hard labor, presidential candidateJohn F. Kennedyintervened, earning Jackson's loyal support. She began campaigning for him, saying: "I feel that I'm a part of this man's hopes. He lifts my spirit and makes me feel a part of the land I live in."[65][66]Her clout and loyalty to Kennedy earned her an invitation to sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" at his inaugural ball in 1961. Months later, she helped raise $50,000 for theSouthern Christian Leadership Conference. Jackson lent her support to King and other ministers in 1963 after their successfulcampaign to end segregation in Birminghamby holding a fundraising rally to pay for protestors' bail. By this time she was a personal friend of King and his wifeCoretta, often hosting them when they visited Chicago, and spending Thanksgiving with their family in Atlanta. King considered Jackson's house a place that he could truly relax.[67][68]She appeared at theMarch on Washington for Jobs and Freedomto sing "I've Been 'Buked and I've Been Scorned" on King's request, then "How I Got Over".[i]Three months later, while rehearsing for an appearance onDanny Kaye's television show, Jackson was inconsolable upon learning that Kennedy had beenassassinated, believing that he died fighting for the rights of black Americans.[69]
Jackson toured Europe again in 1964, mobbed in several cities and proclaiming, "I thought I was the Beatles!" in Utrecht.[70]She appeared in the filmThe Best Man(1964), and attended a ceremony acknowledgingLyndon Johnson's inaugurationat the White House, becoming friends withLady Bird. When at home, she attempted to remain approachable and maintain her characteristic sincerity. Mostly in secret, Jackson had paid for the education of several young people as she felt poignant regret that her own schooling was cut short.[71][72]Stories of her gifts and generosity spread. Her phone number continued to be listed in the Chicago public telephone book, and she received calls nonstop from friends, family, business associates, and strangers asking for money, advice on how to break into the music industry, or general life decisions they should make. Her house had a steady flow of traffic that she welcomed. Jackson had thoroughly enjoyed cooking since childhood, and took great pleasure in feeding all of her visitors, some of them staying days or weeks on her request.[73][j]
Through friends, Jackson met Sigmond Galloway, a former musician in the construction business living inGary, Indiana. Despite Jackson's hectic schedule and the constant companions she had in her entourage of musicians, friends, and family, she expressed loneliness and began courting Galloway when she had free time. As a complete surprise to her closest friends and associates, Jackson married him in her living room in 1964. Only a few weeks later, while driving home from a concert in St. Louis, she found herself unable to stop coughing. She checked herself into a hospital in Chicago. Since the cancellation of her tour to Europe in 1952, Jackson experienced occasional bouts of fatigue and shortness of breath. As her schedule became fuller and more demands were placed on her, these episodes became more frequent. This time, the publicly disclosed diagnosis was heart strain and exhaustion, but in private Jackson's doctors told her that she had had a heart attack and sarcoidosis was now in her heart.[74]
Jackson's recovery took a full year during which she was unable to tour or record, ultimately losing 50 pounds (23 kg). From this point on she was plagued with near-constant fatigue, bouts oftachycardia, andhigh blood pressureas her condition advanced. Jackson was often depressed and frustrated at her own fragility, but she took the time to send Lyndon Johnson a telegram urging him to protect marchers inSelma, Alabama, when she saw news coverage ofBloody Sunday. Galloway proved to be unreliable, leaving for long periods during Jackson's convalescence, then upon his return insisting she was imagining her symptoms. He tried taking over managerial duties from agents and promoters despite being inept. They argued over money; Galloway attempted to strike Jackson on two different occasions, the second one thwarted when Jackson ducked and he broke his hand hitting a piece of furniture behind her. The marriage dissolved and she announced her intention to divorce. He responded by requesting a jury trial, rare for divorces, in an attempt to embarrass her by publicizing the details of their marital problems. When Galloway's infidelities were proven in testimony, the judge declined to award him any of Jackson's assets or properties.[75]
Her doctors cleared her to work and Jackson began recording and performing again, pushing her limitations by giving two- and three-hour concerts. She performed exceptionally well belying her personal woes and ongoing health problems. When not on tour, she concentrated her efforts on building two philanthropies: the Mahalia Jackson Foundation which eventually paid tuition for 50 college students, and the culmination of a dream she had for ten years: a nondenominational temple for young people in Chicago to learn gospel music. As she organized two large benefit concerts for these causes, she was once more heartbroken upon learning of theassassination of Martin Luther King Jr.She attendedthe funeral in Atlantawhere she gave one of her most memorable performances of "Take My Hand, Precious Lord". With this, Jackson retired from political work and personal endorsements.[76][77]
Branching out into business, Jackson partnered with comedianMinnie Pearlin a chain of restaurants called Mahalia Jackson's Chicken Dinners and lent her name to a line of canned foods.[78]She purchased a lavish condominium in Chicago overlookingLake Michiganand set up room for Galloway, whom she was considering remarrying. At 58 years old, she returned to New Orleans, finally allowed to stay as a guest in the upscaleRoyal Orleanshotel, receivingred carpettreatment. She embarked on a tour of Europe in 1968, which she cut short for health reasons, but she returned in 1969 to adoring audiences. Now experiencing inflammation in her eyes and painful cramps in her legs and hands, she undertook successful tours of theCaribbean, still counting the house to ensure she was being paid fairly, andLiberiain West Africa. In 1971, Jackson made television appearances withJohnny CashandFlip Wilson. For three weeks she toured Japan, becoming the first Western singer since the end of World War II to give a private concert for theImperial Family. TheU.S. State Departmentsponsored a visit to India, where she played Kolkata, New Delhi, Madras, and Mumbai, all of them sold out within two hours. In New Delhi, she had an unexpected audience with Prime MinisterIndira Gandhiwho declared, "I will never hear a greater voice; I will never know a greater person."[79][80]While touring Europe months later, Jackson became ill in Germany and flew home to Chicago where she was hospitalized. In January 1972, she received surgery to remove abowel obstructionand died in recovery.[81][82]
Although news outlets had reported on her health problems and concert postponements for years, her death came as a shock to many of her fans. She received a funeral service at Greater Salem Baptist Church in Chicago where she was still a member. Fifty thousand people paid their respects, many of them lining up in the snow the night before, and her peers in gospel singing performed in her memory the next morning. The day after, Mayor Richard Daley and other politicians and celebrities gave their eulogies at theArie Crown Theaterwith 6,000 in attendance. Her body was returned to New Orleans where shelay in stateat Rivergate Auditorium under a military and police guard, and 60,000 people viewed her casket. On the way to Providence Memorial Park inMetairie, Louisiana, the funeral procession passed Mount Moriah Baptist Church, where her music was played over loudspeakers.[83][84][85][86]
[Jackson would] sometimes build a song up and up, singing the words over and over to increase their intensity... Like Bessie, she would slide up or slur down to a note. She would also break up a word into as many syllables as she cared to, or repeat and prolong an ending to make it more effective: "His love is deeper and deeper, yes deeper and deeper, it's deeper! and deeper, Lord! deeper and deeper, Lord! it's deeper than the se-e-e-e-a, yeah, oh my lordy, yeah deeper than the sea, Lord." And the last two words would be a dozen syllables each.
Though the gospel blues style Jackson employed was common among soloists in black churches, to many white jazz fans it was novel. As she was the most prominent — and sometimes the only gospel singer many white listeners knew — she often received requests to define the style and explain how and why she sang as she did. Jackson was mostly untrained, never learning to read or write musical notation, so her style was heavily marked by instinct. She answered questions to the best of her ability though often responded with lack of surety, saying: "All I ever learned was just to sing the way I feel... off-beat, on the beat, between beats — however the Lord lets it come out."[81]When pressed for clearer descriptions, she replied: "Child, I don't know how I do it myself."[88]
Jackson's voice is noted for being energetic and powerful, ranging fromcontraltotosoprano, which she switched between rapidly. She resisted labeling her voice range instead calling it "real strong and clear".[81]She usedbent or "worried" notestypical of blues, the sound of which jazz aficionado Bucklin Moon described as "an almost solid wall of blue tonality". She moaned, hummed, and improvised extensively with rhythm and melody, often embellishing notes with a prodigious use ofmelisma, or singing several tones per syllable. AuthorAnthony Heilbutcalled it a "weird ethereal sound, part moan, part failed operatics".[88]Gospel historianHorace Boyerattributes Jackson's "aggressive style and rhythmic ascension" to the Pentecostal congregation she heard as a child, saying Jackson was "never a Baptist singer". He continues: "bending a note here, chopping off a note there, singing through rest spots and ornamenting the melodic line at will, [Jackson] confused pianists but fascinated those who played by ear".[89]Bucklin Moon was enamored with her singing, writing that the embellishments Jackson added "take your breath away. As a member of a Sanctified Church in Mount Vernon once told me: 'Mahalia, she add more flowers and feathers than anybody, and they all is exactly right.' She breaks every rule of concert singing, taking breaths in the middle of a word and sometimes garbling the words altogether, but the full-throated feeling and expression are seraphic."[90]WriterRalph Ellisonnoted how she blended precise diction with a thick New Orleans accent, describing the effect as "almost of the academy one instant, and of the broadest cotton field dialect the next".[91]
By her own admission and in the opinion of multiple critics and scholars, Bessie Smith's singing style was clearly dominant in Jackson's voice. InMelody Maker,Max Jonescontrasted the two: "Whereas Bessie's singing can sound harsh and unlovely, even to jazz students, on first acquaintance, Mahalia's voice is obviously an instrument of uncommon beauty... Her bursts of power and sudden rhythmic drives build up to a pitch that leave you unprepared to listen afterwards to any but the greatest of musicians."[92]Other singers made their mark. In her early days in Chicago, Jackson saved her money to buy records by classical singersRoland Hayes,Grace Moore, andLawrence Tibbett, attributing her diction, breathing, and she said, "what little I know of technique" to these singers.[93]
Improvisation was a significant part of Jackson's live performances both in concert halls and churches. She often stretched what would be a five-minute recording to twenty-five minutes to achieve maximum emotional effect. In black churches, this was a regular practice among gospel soloists who sought to evoke an emotional purging in the audience during services. White and non-Christian audiences also felt this resonance. After one concert, criticNat Hentoffwrote: "The conviction and strength of her rendition had a strange effect on the secularists present, who were won over to Mahalia if not to her message. Most of them were amazed at the length of time after the concert during which the sound of her voice remained active in the mind."[94]Jackson explained that as God worked through her she became more impassioned during a song, and that what she felt was right to do in the moment was what was necessary for the audience. As her career advanced, she found it difficult to adjust to the time constraints in recording and television appearances, saying: "When I sing I don't go by the score. I lose something when I do. I don't want to be told I can sing just so long. I make it 'til that passion is passed. When I become conscious, I can't do it good."[95]
Jackson estimated that she sold 22 million records in her career.[96]Her four singles for Decca and seventy-one for Apollo are widely acclaimed by scholars as defining gospel blues.[97]The earliest are marked by minimal accompaniment with piano and organ. Apollo added acoustic guitar, backup singers, bass, and drums in the 1950s. Her singing is lively, energetic, and emotional, using "a voice in the prime of its power and command", according to author Bob Darden.[98]Although hearing herself on Decca recordings years later prompted Jackson to declare they are "not very good",Viv Broughtoncalls "Keep Me Every Day" a "gospel masterpiece", and Anthony Heilbut praises its "wonderful artless purity and conviction", saying that in her Decca records, her voice "was at its loveliest, rich and resonant, with little of the vibrato and neo-operatic obbligatos of later years". Likewise, he calls Jackson's Apollo records "uniformly brilliant", choosing "Even Me", "Just As I Am", "City Called Heaven", and "I Do, Don't You" as perfect examples of her phrasing and contralto range, having an effect that is "angelic but never saccharine".[99][4][100]The New Grove Gospel, Blues, and Jazzcites the Apollo songs "In the Upper Room", "Let the Power of the Holy Ghost Fall on Me", and "I'm Glad Salvation is Free" as prime examples of the "majesty" of Jackson's voice. According to musicologistWilfrid Mellers, Jackson's early recordings demonstrate a "sound that is all-embracing, as secure as the womb, from which singer and listener may be reborn. The breathtaking beauty of the voice and superbly controlled transitions from speech to prayer to song heal and anneal."[98]
Columbia Records, then the largest recording company in the U.S., presented Jackson as the "World's Greatest Gospel Singer" in the 28 albums they released. She was marketed to appeal to a wide audience of listeners who, despite all her accomplishments up to 1954, had never heard of her. In contrast to the series of singles from Apollo, Columbia released themed albums that includedliner notesand photos.[101]Compared to other artists at Columbia, Jackson was allowed considerable input in what she would record, but Mitch Miller and producerGeorge Avakianpersuaded her with varying success to broaden her appeal to listeners of different faiths. Though her early records at Columbia had a similar sound to her Apollo records, the music accompanying Jackson at Columbia later included orchestras, electric guitars, backup singers, and drums, the overall effect of which was more closely associated with light pop music. She was marketed similarly to jazz musicians, but her music at Columbia ultimately defied categorization. Her albums interspersed familiar compositions by Thomas Dorsey and other gospel songwriters with songs considered generally inspirational. These included "You'll Never Walk Alone" written byRodgers and Hammersteinfor the 1945 musicalCarousel, "Trees" based on the poem byJoyce Kilmer, "Danny Boy", and the patriotic songs "My Country 'Tis of Thee" and "The Battle Hymn of the Republic", among others.The Cambridge Companion to Blues and Gospel Musicdescribes Jackson's Columbia recordings as "toned down and polished" compared to the rawer, more minimalist sound at Apollo.[102]Scholar Mark Burford praises "When I Wake Up In Glory" as "one of the crowning achievements of her career as a recording artist", but Heilbut calls her Columbia recordings of "When the Saints Go Marching In" and "The Lord's Prayer", "uneventful material".[103][104][105]Jackson agreed somewhat, acknowledging that her sound was being commercialized, calling some of these recordings "sweetened-water stuff".[106][107]When the themes of her songs were outwardly religious, some critics felt the delivery was at times less lively. John Hammond, who helped secure Jackson's contract with Columbia, told her if she signed with them many of her black fans would not relate well to the music. This turned out to be true and as a result, Jackson created a distinct performing style for Columbia recordings that was markedly different from her live performances, which remained animated and lively, both in churches and concert halls.[108][86]
She roared like a Pentecostal preacher, she moaned and growled like the old Southern mothers, she hollered the gospel blues like a sanctified Bessie Smith and she cried into the Watts' hymns like she was back in a slave cabin. They say that, in her time, Mahalia Jackson could wreck a church in minutes flat and keep it that way for hours on end."
In live performances, Jackson was renowned for her physicality and the extraordinary emotional connections she held with her audiences.The New York Timesstated she was a "massive, stately, even majestic woman, [who] possessed an awesome presence that was apparent in whatever milieu she chose to perform."[86]So caught up in the spirit was she while singing, she often wept, fell on her knees, bowed, skipped, danced, clapped spontaneously, patted her sides and stomach, and particularly in churches, roamed the aisles to sing directly to individuals. All of these were typical of the services in black churches though Jackson's energy was remarkable.[109]An experiment wearing a wig with her robes went awry during a show in the 1950s when she sang so frenetically she flung it off mid-performance.[110]Anthony Heilbut writes that "some of her gestures are dramatically jerky, suggesting instant spirit possession", and called her performances "downright terrifying. At her best, Mahalia builds these songs to a frenzy of intensity almost demanding a release in holler and shout. When singing them she may descend to her knees, her combs scattering like so many cast-out demons."[111]Jackson defended her idiosyncrasies, commenting: "How can you sing of amazing grace, how can you sing prayerfully of heaven and earth and all God's wonders without using your hands? My hands, my feet, I throw my whole body to say all that is within me. The mind and the voice by themselves are not sufficient."[112][k]
In line with improvising music, Jackson did not like to prepare what she would sing before concerts, and would often change song preferences based on what she was feeling at the moment, saying: "There's something the public reaches into me for, and there seems to be something in each audience that I can feel. I can feel whether there's a low spirit. Some places I go, up-tempo songs don't go, and other places, sad songs aren't right."[113]She had an uncanny ability to elicit the same emotions from her audiences that she transmitted in her singing.[85][114][22]People Todaycommented that "When Mahalia sings, audiences do more than just listen—they undergo a profoundly moving emotional experience."[115]Jackson used "house wreckers", or songs that induced long tumultuous moments with audiences weeping, shouting, and moaning, especially in black churches. Gospel singer Evelyn Gaye recalled touring with her in 1938 when Jackson often sang "If You See My Savior Tell Him That You Saw Me", saying: "and the people, look like they were just awed by it, on a higher plane, gone. She had that type of rocking and that holy dance she'd get into—look like the people just submitted to it."[116]White audiences also wept and responded emotionally. According to jazz writer Raymond Horricks, instead of preaching to listeners Jackson spoke about her personal faith and spiritual experiences "immediately and directly... making it difficult for them to turn away".[117]Promoter Joe Bostic was in the audience of the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival, an outdoor concert that occurred during a downpour, and stated: "It was the most fantastic tribute to the hypnotic power of great artistry I have ever encountered. Nothing like it have I ever seen in my life. Those people sat... they forgot... they were completely entranced."[118]
She didn't say it, but the implication was obvious. Mahalia Jackson doesn't sing to fracture any cats, or to capture any Billboard polls, or because she wants her recording contract renewed. She sings the way she does for the most basic of singing reasons, for the most honest of them all, without any frills, flourishes, or phoniness.
A significant part of Jackson's appeal was her demonstrated earnestness in her religious conviction. Bostic spoke of her abiding faith: "Mahalia never became so sophisticated that she lost her humility, her relationship with God as a divine being. She never got beyond that point; and many times, many times, you were amazed — at least I was, because she was such a tough business woman."[120]During her tour of the Middle East, Jackson stood back in wonder while visitingJericho, and road manager David Haber asked her if she truly thoughttrumpets brought down its walls. Jackson replied honestly: "I believe Joshua did pray to God, and the sun stood still. I believe everything."[121]Gospel singerCleophus Robinsonasserted: "There never was any pretense, no sham about her. Wherever you met her it was like receiving a letter from home. She was a warm, carefree personality who gave you the feeling that you could relax and let your hair down whenever you were around her — backstage with her or in her home where she'd cook up some good gumbo for you whenever she had the time. A lot of people tried to make Mahalia act 'proper', and they'd tell her about her diction and such things but she paid them no mind. She never denied her background and she never lost her 'down home' sincerity."[81]Television host Ed Sullivan said, "She was just so darned kind to everybody. When Mahalia sang, she took command. The band, the stage crew, the other performers, the ushers — they were all rooting for her. When she came out, she could be your mother or your sister. I mean, she wasn't obsequious, you know; she was a star among other stars. Other people may not have wanted to be deferential, but they couldn't help it. This woman was just great."[122]Commenting on her personal intimacy, Neil Goodwin ofThe Daily Expresswrote after attending her 1961 concert at the Royal Albert Hall: "Mahalia Jackson sang toMElast night." Others wrote of her ability to give listeners goosebumps or make the hair on their neck tingle.[123]
Until 1946, Jackson used an assortment of pianists for recording and touring, choosing anyone who was convenient and free to go with her. As her career progressed, she found it necessary to have a pianist available at a moment's notice, someone talented enough to improvise with her yet steeped in religious music. Jackson found this in Mildred Falls (1921–1974), who accompanied her for 25 years. Falls is often acknowledged as a significant part of Jackson's sound and therefore her success. She was born Mildred Carter inMagnolia, Mississippi, learning to play on her family's upright piano, working with church choirs, and moving to California with a gospel singing group. A broken marriage resulted in her return to Chicago in 1947 when she was referred to Jackson who set up a brief training withRobert Anderson, a longtime member of Jackson's entourage.[38]Falls  accompanied her in nearly every performance and recording thereafter.[124]
Always on the lookout for new material, Jackson received 25 to 30 compositions a month for her consideration. Falls played these so Jackson could "catch the message of the song".[125]Once selections were made, Falls and Jackson memorized each composition, though while touring with Jackson, Falls was required to improvise as Jackson never sang a song the same way twice, even from rehearsal to a performance hours or minutes later. Falls found it necessary to watch Jackson's mannerisms and mouth instead of looking at the piano keys to keep up with her. At the beginning of a song, Falls might start in one key and receive hand signals from Jackson to change until Jackson felt the right key for the song in that moment. Falls remembered, "Mahalia waited until she heard exactly what was in her ear, and once she heard it, she went on about her business and she'd tear the house down."[126]
Studs Terkel compared Falls toPaul UlanowskyandGerald Moorewho played for classical singing starsLotte LehmannandDietrich Fischer-Dieskau, respectively.[127]Ralph Ellison called Falls and Jackson "the dynamic duo", saying that their performance at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival created "a rhythmical drive such as is expected of the entire Basie band. It is all joy and exultation and swing, but it is nonetheless religious music." Falls' right hand playing, according to Ellison, substituted for the horns in an orchestra which was in constant "conversation" with Jackson's vocals. Her left hand provided a "walking bass line that gave the music its 'bounce'", common instrideandragtimeplaying.[114]Similarly, television host Dinah Shore called Falls' left hand "the strongest thing in the whole world", giving Jackson's music a prominent beat usually missing from religious music. When Shore's studio musicians attempted to pinpoint the cause of Jackson's rousing sound, Shore admonished them with humor, saying: "Mildred's got a left hand, that's what your problem is."[128]Anthony Heilbut explained: "By Chicago choir standards her chordings and tempos were old-fashioned, but they always induced a subtle rock exactly suited to Mahalia's swing."[129]
Jackson's influence was greatest in black gospel music. Beginning in the 1930s,Sallie Martin,Roberta Martin,Willie Mae Ford Smith,Artelia Hutchins, and Jackson spread the gospel blues style by performing in churches around the U.S. For 15 years the genre developed in relative isolation with choirs and soloists performing in a circuit of churches, revivals, and National Baptist Convention (NBC) meetings where music was shared and sold among musicians, songwriters, and ministers. The NBC boasted a membership of four million, a network that provided the source material that Jackson learned in her early years and from which she drew during her recording career.[130]
Though Jackson was not the first gospel blues soloist to record, historian Robert Marovich identifies her success with "Move On Up a Little Higher" as the event that launched gospel music from a niche movement in Chicago churches to a genre that became commercially viable nationwide.[131]The "Golden Age of Gospel", occurring between 1945 and 1965, presented dozens of gospel music acts on radio, records, and in concerts in secular venues.[132]Jackson's success was recognized by the NBC when she was named its official soloist, and uniquely, she was bestowed universal respect in a field of very competitive and sometimes territorial musicians. Marovich explains that she "was the living embodiment of gospel music's ecumenism and was welcomed everywhere".[133][130][134][33]
The Cambridge Companion to Blues and Gospel Musicidentifies Jackson andSam Cooke, whose music career started when he joinedthe Soul Stirrers, as the most important figures in black gospel music in the 1950s.[135]To the majority of new fans, however, "Mahalia was the vocal, physical, spiritual symbol of gospel music", according to Heilbut.[136]Raymond Horricks writes: "People who hold different religious beliefs to her own, and even people who have no religious beliefs whatsoever, are impressed by and give their immediate attention to her singing. She has, almost singlehandedly, brought about a wide, and often non-religious interest in the gospel singing of the Negro."[137]Because she was often asked by white jazz and blues fans to define what she sang, she became gospel's most prominent defender, saying: "Blues are the songs of despair. Gospel songs are the songs of hope. When you sing gospel you have a feeling there's a cure for what's wrong. When you're through with the blues you've got nothing to rest on."[138][139]
As gospel music became accessible to mainstream audiences, its stylistic elements became pervasive in popular music as a whole. Jackson, who enjoyed music of all kinds, noticed, attributing the emotional punch ofrock and rollto Pentecostal singing.[140]Her Decca records were the first to feature the sound of aHammond organ, spawning many copycats and resulting in its use in popular music, especially those evoking a soulful sound, for decades after.[141]The firstR&Band rock and roll singers employed the same devices that Jackson and her cohorts in gospel singing used, including ecstatic melisma, shouting, moaning, clapping, and stomping. Heilbut writes: "With the exception ofChuck BerryandFats Domino, there is scarcely a pioneer rock and roll singer who didn't owe his stuff to the great gospel lead singers."[104]Specifically,Little Richard,Mavis Staplesof theStaple Singers,Donna Summer, Sam Cooke,Ray Charles,Della Reese, andAretha Franklinhave all named Jackson as an inspiration. Jackson was inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Famein the Early influence category in 1997. Mavis Staples justified her inclusion at the ceremony, saying: "When she sang, you would just feel light as a feather. God, I couldn't get enough of her."[142]Franklin, who studied Jackson since she was a child and sang "Take My Hand, Precious Lord" at her funeral,[143]was placed atRolling Stone'snumber one spot in their list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, compiled in 2010.[144]Despite her influence, Jackson was mostly displeased that gospel music was being used for secular purposes, considering R&B andsoul musicto be perversions, exploiting the music to make money.[106][145]
Jackson's success had a profound effect on Black American identity, particularly for those who did not assimilate comfortably into white society. Though she and gospel blues were denigrated by members of the black upper class into the 1950s, for middle and lower class black Americans her life was arags to richesstory in which she remained relentlessly positive and unapologetically at ease with herself and her mannerisms in the company of white people. InImitation of Life, her portrayal as a funeral singer embodied sorrow for the character Annie, a maid who dies from heartbreak. Scholar Johari Jabir writes that in this role, "Jackson conjures up the unspeakable fatigue and collective weariness of centuries of black women." Through her music, she promoted hope and celebrated resilience in the black American experience.[114]Jackson was often compared to opera singerMarian Anderson, as they both toured Europe, included spirituals in their repertoires, and sang in similar settings. Jackson considered Anderson an inspiration, and earned an invitation to sing atConstitution Hallin 1960, 21 years after theDaughters of the American Revolutionforbade Anderson from performing there in front of an integrated audience.[146]But Jackson's preference for the musical influence, casual language, and intonation of black Americans was a sharp contrast to Anderson's refined manners and concentration on European music. In interviews, Jackson repeatedly credits aspects ofblack culturethat played a significant part in the development of her style: remnants of slavery music she heard at churches,work songsfrom vendors on the streets of New Orleans, and blues and jazz bands.[147]Her first national television appearance on Ed Sullivan'sToast of the Townin 1952 showed her singing authentic gospel blues, prompting a large parade in her honor inDayton, Ohio, with 50,000 black attendees – more than the integrated audience that showed up for a Harry Truman campaign stop around the same time.[148]Known for her excited shouts, Jackson once called out "Glory!" on her CBS television show, following quickly with: "Excuse me, CBS, I didn't know where I was."[129]By retaining her dialect and singing style, she challenged a sense of shame among many middle and lower class black Americans for their disparagedspeech patterns and accents.Evelyn Cunninghamof thePittsburgh Courierattended a Jackson concert in 1954, writing that she expected to be embarrassed by Jackson, but "when she sang, she made me choke up and feel wondrously proud of my people and my heritage. She made me drop my bonds and become really emancipated."[149]
Malcolm Xnoted that Jackson was "the first Negro that Negroes made famous".[150]White radio host Studs Terkel was surprised to learn Jackson had a large black following before he found her records, saying: "For a stupid moment, I had thought thatIdiscovered Mahalia Jackson."[151]Jazz composer Duke Ellington, counting himself as a fan of Jackson's since 1952, asked her to appear on his albumBlack, Brown and Beige(1958), an homage to black American life and culture. Due to her decision to sing gospel exclusively she initially rejected the idea, but relented when Ellington asked her to improvise on the23rd Psalm.[152]She was featured on the album's vocal rendition of Ellington's composition "Come Sunday", which subsequently became a jazz standard.[153]As she became more famous, spending time in concert halls, she continued to attend and perform in black churches, often for free, to connect with congregations and other gospel singers.[154][155]Believing that black wealth and capital should be reinvested into black people, Jackson designed her line of chicken restaurants to be black-owned and operated. She organized a 1969 concert called A Salute to Black Women, the proceeds of which were given to her foundation providing college scholarships to black youth.[156]Upon her death, singerHarry Belafontecalled her "the most powerful black woman in the United States" and there was "not a single field hand, a single black worker, a single black intellectual who did not respond to her".[81]

Riley B. King(September 16, 1925 – May 14, 2015), known professionally asB.B. King, was an Americanbluesguitarist, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He introduced a sophisticated style ofsoloingbased on fluidstring bending, shimmeringvibrato, andstaccatopickingthat influenced many laterelectric guitarblues players.[9][10]AllMusicrecognized King as "the single most important electric guitarist of the last half of the 20th century".[10]
He was inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Famein 1987 and is one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning thenickname"The King of the Blues", and is referred to as one of the "Three Kings of the Blues Guitar" (along withAlbert KingandFreddie King, none of whom is related).[11][12][13]King performed tirelessly throughout his musical career, appearing on average at more than 200 concerts a year into his 70s.[14]In 1956 alone, he appeared at 342 shows.[15]
He was attracted to music and taught himself to play guitar beginning his career injuke jointsand on local radio. He later lived inMemphisand Chicago. Then, as his fame grew, he toured the world extensively.
Riley B. King was born on September 16, 1925,[16]on a cottonplantationinBerclairnamed Bear Creek inLeflore Countynear the city ofItta Bena, Mississippi,[10][17][18]the son ofsharecroppersAlbert and Nora Ella King.[18]When he was four years old, his mother left his father for another man, so he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Elnora Farr, inKilmichael, Mississippi,[18]then inLexington.[17]As a teen, he moved toIndianolawhich he referred to as his hometown, later working at acotton gin.[19]
While young, King sang in thegospelchoir at Elkhorn Baptist Church inKilmichael. He was attracted to thePentecostalChurch of God in Christbecause of its music. The local minister performed with aSearsRoebuck Silvertone guitar during services and taught King his first three chords.[20]Flake Cartledge, his employer in Kilmichael, bought him his first guitar
for 15 dollars. Cartledge withheld money from King's salary for the next two months until he repaid the debt.[21][18]
In November 1941,King Biscuit Timefirst aired, broadcasting onKFFAinHelena, Arkansas. It was a radio show featuring the Mississippi Delta blues. King listened to it while on break at the plantation. A self-taught guitarist, he then wanted to be a radio musician.[22]
In 1943, King left Kilmichael to work as a tractor driver and play guitar with the Famous St. John's Gospel Singers ofInverness, Mississippi, performing at area churches and onWGRMinGreenwood.[23][24]He served in theU.S. ArmyduringWorld War IIbut was released after being ruled as "essential to the war economy" based on his experience as a tractor driver.[25][26][27]
In 1946, he followedBukka WhitetoMemphis, Tennessee. White took him in for the next ten months.[18]King returned shortly afterward to Mississippi where he better prepared himself for the next visit. Two years later, he returned toWest Memphis, Arkansas. He performed onSonny Boy Williamson's radio program onKWEMin West Memphis where he began to develop an audience. His appearances led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten minute spot on the Memphis radio stationWDIA.[28]The radio spot became so popular that it was expanded and became theSepia Swing Club.[29]
He worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey where he was given the nickname "Beale StreetBlues Boy", later shortened to "Blues Boy" and finally to "B.B."[30][31][32]It was there that he first metT-Bone Walker. King said, "Once I'd heard him for the first time, I knew I'd have to have [an electric guitar] myself. 'Had' to have one, short of stealing!"[33]
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, King was a part of the blues scene onBeale Street. "Beale Street was where it all started for me," he said. He performed withBobby Bland,Johnny AceandEarl Forestin a group known asthe Beale Streeters.[34]
According to King and Joe Bihari, one of the founders ofModern Recordsand its subsidiaries,Ike Turnerintroduced King to theBihari brotherswhile he was a talent scout for them.[35][36]Before his RPM contract, King had debuted onBullet Recordsby issuing the single "Miss Martha King" (1949), which did not chart well. "My very first recordings [in 1949] were[sic]for a company out of Nashville called Bullet, the Bullet Record Transcription company," King recalled. "I had horns that very first session. I hadPhineas Newbornon piano; his father played drums, and his brother,Calvin, played guitar with me. I hadTuff Greenon bass,Ben Branchon tenor sax, his brother, Thomas, on trumpet, and a lady trombone player. The Newborn family were the house band at the famous Plantation Inn in West Memphis."[37]In 1949, King began recording songs under contract with Los Angeles-basedRPM Records, a subsidiary of Modern.Sam Phillips, who later foundedSun Records, produced many of King's early recordings.
King assembled his band, the B.B. King Review, under the leadership of Millard Lee. The band initially consisted of Calvin Owens and Kenneth Sands (trumpet), Lawrence Burdin (alto saxophone),George Coleman(tenor saxophone),[38]Floyd Newman(baritone saxophone), Millard Lee (piano),George Joyner(bass) and Earl Forest and Ted Curry (drums). King hiredOnzie Horne, a trained musician, to be an arranger and assist him with his compositions. By his admission, King could not play chords well and always relied onimprovisation.[39]
King supported his recordings by touring across the United States with performances in major theaters in cities such as Washington, D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, and St. Louis, as well as numerous gigs in small clubs andjuke jointsin the southern United States. During one show inTwist, Arkansas, a brawl broke out between two men and caused a fire. He left the building with the rest of the crowd but ran back in to get his guitar. He said he later learned that the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. He named the guitarLucilleas a reminder not to fight over women, or run into any more burning buildings.[40]
Following his firstBillboardRhythm and Blues chartednumber one, "3 O'Clock Blues" (February 1952),[41]King became one of the most important names inR&Bmusic in the 1950s, amassing an impressive list of hits[32]including "You Know I Love You", "Woke Up This Morning", "Please Love Me", "When My Heart Beats Like a Hammer", "Whole Lotta' Love", "You Upset Me Baby", "Every Day I Have the Blues", "Sneakin' Around", "Ten Long Years", "Bad Luck", "Sweet Little Angel", "On My Word of Honor", and "Please Accept My Love". This led to a significant increase in his weekly earnings, from about $85 to $2,500,[42][43]with appearances at major venues such as theHoward Theaterin Washington and theApolloin New York, as well as touring the "Chitlin' Circuit". 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked and three recording sessions.[44]That same year he founded his own record label, Blues Boys Kingdom, with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. There, among other projects, he was a producer for artists such as Millard Lee and Levi Seabury.[19]In 1962, King signed toABC-Paramount Records, which was later absorbed intoMCA Records(which itself was later absorbed intoGeffen Records). In November 1964, King recorded theLive at the Regalalbum at theRegal Theater.[41]King later said thatRegal Live"is considered by some the best recording I've ever had ... that particular day in Chicago everything came together."[45]
From the late 1960s, his new manager, Sid Seidenberg, pushed him into a different type of venue as blues-rock performers likeEric Clapton(once a member ofthe YardbirdsandCream) and Paul Butterfield were bringing blues music to appreciative white audiences.[46]King gained further visibility among rock audiences as an opening act onthe Rolling Stones'1969 American Tour.[47]He won aGrammy Awardin  1970 for his version of the song "The Thrill Is Gone"[48]which was a hit on both the Pop and R&Bcharts.Rolling Stonemagazine listed it in the number 183 spot in their500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[49]
King was inducted into theBlues Hall of Famein 1980, theRock and Roll Hall of Famein 1987, and the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 2014.[14][50]In 2004, he was awarded the internationalPolar Music Prizewhich is given to artists "in recognition of exceptional achievements in the creation and advancement of music."[51]
From the 1980s to his death in 2015, he maintained a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and sometimes performing 300 nights a year. In 1988, he reached a new generation of fans with the single "When Love Comes to Town", a collaborative effort with the Irish bandU2on theirRattle and Humalbum.[41]In December 1997, he performed in the Vatican's fifth annual Christmas concert and presented his trademark guitar "Lucille" toPope John Paul II.[52][53]In 1998, King appeared inThe Blues Brothers 2000, playing the part of the lead singer of the Louisiana Gator Boys along withEric Clapton,Dr. John,Koko TaylorandBo Diddley. In 2000, he and Clapton teamed up again to recordRiding With the Kingwhich won aGrammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album.[54]
Discussing where he took the Blues, from "dirt floor, smoke in the air" joints to grand concert halls, King said the Blues belonged everywhere beautiful music belonged. He successfully worked both sides of the commercial divide, with sophisticated recordings and "raw, raucous" live performances.[45]
In 2006, King went on a farewell world tour although he remained active afterward.[55]The tour was partly supported by Northern Irish guitarist,Gary Moore, with whom King had previously toured and recorded. It started in the United Kingdom and continued with performances at theMontreux Jazz Festivaland in Zürich at the Blues at Sunset. During his show in Montreux at the Stravinski Hall, he jammed withJoe Sample,Randy Crawford,David Sanborn,Gladys Knight, Leela James, Andre Beeka, Earl Thomas,Stanley Clarke,John McLaughlin,Barbara HendricksandGeorge Duke.[56]
In June 2006, King was present at a memorial of his first radio broadcast at the Three Deuces Building inGreenwood, Mississippi where the Mississippi Blues Commission erected an official marker as part of theMississippi Blues Trail. The same month, a groundbreaking was held for a new museum, dedicated to him,[57]inIndianola, Mississippi.[58]TheB.B. King Museum and Delta Interpretive Centeropened on September 13, 2008.[59]
In late October 2006, King recorded a concert album and video entitledB.B. King: Liveat his B.B. King Blues Clubs in Nashville and Memphis. The video of the four night production featured his regular band and captured his shows as he performed them nightly around the world. Released in 2008, they were his first performances in over a decade to be documented with a live album release.[60]
In 2007, King played at Eric Clapton's secondCrossroads Guitar Festival[61]and contributed the songs "Goin' Home", toGoin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino(withIvan Neville's DumpstaPhunk)[62]and "One Shoe Blues" toSandra Boynton's children's albumBlue Moo, accompanied by a pair of sock puppets in a music video for the song.[63]
In the summer of 2008, King played at theBonnaroo Music and Arts FestivalinManchester, Tennesseewhere he was given akey to the city.[64]Later that year, he was inducted into theHollywood Bowl Hall of Fame.[65]
He performed at theMawazinefestival inRabat, Moroccoon May 27, 2010.[66]In June 2010, he played at the Crossroads Guitar Festival withRobert Cray,Jimmie Vaughan, andEric Clapton.[67]He also contributed toCyndi Lauper's albumMemphis Blueswhich was released on June 22, 2010.[68]
In 2011, King played at theGlastonbury Music Festival,[69]and in theRoyal Albert Hallin London where he recorded a concert video.[70]
Rolling Stoneranked him at No. 6 on its 2011 list of the100 greatest guitarists of all time.[71]
On February 21, 2012, King was among the performers of "In Performance at theWhite House: Red, White and Blues" during which PresidentBarack Obamasang part of "Sweet Home Chicago".[72]King recorded for the debut album of rapper and producerBig K.R.I.T.who also hails from Mississippi.[73]On July 5, 2012, King performed a concert at theByblos International Festivalin Lebanon.[74]
On May 26, 2013, he appeared at theNew Orleans Jazz Festival.[75]
On October 3, 2014, after completing his live performance at the House of Blues in Chicago, a doctor diagnosed King with dehydration and exhaustion and the eight remaining shows of his ongoing tour had to be canceled. King did not reschedule the shows, and the House of Blues show would be the last before he died in 2015.[76][77]
When I sing, I play in my mind; the minute I stop singing orally, I start to sing by playingLucille.[78]
King used equipment characteristic of the different periods he played in. He played guitars made by various manufacturers early in his career. He played aFender Esquireon most of his recordings withRPM Records.[79]Later, he was best known for playing variants of theGibson ES-355.
In the September edition 1995 ofVintage Guitarmagazine, early photos show him playing aGibson ES-5through aFender tweedamp. In reference to the photo, King stated,
"Yes; the old Fender amplifiers were the best that were ever made, in my opinion. They had a good sound and they were durable; guys would throw them in the truck and they'd hold up. They had tubes, and they'd get real hot, but they just had a sound that is hard to put into words. The Fender Twin was great, but I have an old Lab Series amp that isn't being made anymore. I fell in love with it because its sound is right between the old Fender amps that we used to have and the Fender Twin. It's what I'm using tonight."[80]
He moved on from the larger Gibson hollow bodied instruments which were prone to feedback when played at high volumes to various semi-hollow models beginning first with the ES-335 and then on to a deluxe version called the ES-355 which used a stereo option.[80]In 1980,Gibson Guitar Corporationlaunched the B.B. King Lucille model, an ES-355 with stereo options, a varitone selector, and fine tuners (neither of which he actually used ) and, at King's direct request, no f-holes to further reduce feedback. In 2005, Gibson made a special run of 80 Gibson Lucilles, referred to as the "80th Birthday Lucille", the first prototype of which they gave him as a birthday gift and which he used thereafter.[81]
He used a Lab Series L5 2×12" combo amplifier and used this amplifier for a long time. Norlin Industries made them for Gibson in the 1970s and 1980s. Other popular L5 users areAllan HoldsworthandTy TaborofKing's X. The L5 has an onboard compressor, parametric equalization, and four inputs. King also used a Fender Twin Reverb.[82]
He used his signature model strings "Gibson SEG-BBS B.B. King Signature Electric Guitar Strings" with gauges: 10–13–17p–32w–45w–54w and D'Andrea 351 MD SHL CX (medium 0.71mm, tortoiseshell, celluloid) picks.[82]
In 1991,Beale StreetdeveloperJohn Elkingtonrecruited King to open the original B.B. King's Blues Club inMemphisand in 1994, they launched a second club atUniversal Citywalkin Los Angeles. A third club in New York City'sTimes Squareopened in June 2000 but closed on April 29, 2018. Management is currently in the process of finding a new location in New York City.[83]Two more clubs opened, atFoxwoods Casinoin Connecticut in January 2002,[84]and in Nashville in 2003.[85]Another club opened inOrlandoin 2007.[86]A club inWest Palm Beachopened in the fall of 2009[87]and an additional one, based in theMirage Hotel,Las Vegas, opened in the winter of 2009.[88]Another opened in theNew OrleansFrench Quarterin 2016.[89]
King made guest appearances on a number of popular television shows including:The Cosby Show,The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,The Young and the Restless,General Hospital,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Sesame Street,[90]Married... with Children,Sanford and SonandTouched by an Angel.
From the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s, he appeared in several advertisements forMcDonald's.[91][92]In the early 2000s he also appeared in a campaign forBurger King.[93]
In 2000, the children's showBetween the Lionsfeatured a singing character named "B.B. the King of Beasts" based on him.[94]
B.B. King: The Life of Riley, a feature documentary about him narrated byMorgan Freemanand directed byJon Brewer, was released on October 15, 2012.[95]
His performance at the 1969Harlem Cultural Festival[96]appears in the 2021 music documentarySummer of Soul.
King was married twice, to Martha Lee Denton, from November 1946 to 1952 and to Sue Carol Hall, from 1958 to 1966. He attributed their failure to the heavy demands of his 250 performances a year.[18][97]It is said that he fathered 15 children with several women.[18][16]After his death, three more have come forward, claiming him as their father.[98]Though neither of his marriages produced children, biographer Charles Sawyer wrote that doctors found his sperm count too low to conceive children,[99]King never disputed paternity of any of the 15 who claimed it and by all accounts was generous in bankrolling college tuitions and establishing trust funds.[98]In May 2016, the 11 surviving children initiated legal proceedings against his appointed trustee over his estimated $30 million to $40 million estate. Several of them also went public with the allegation that King's business manager, LaVerne Toney and his personal assistant, Myron Johnson had fatally poisoned him. Autopsy results showed no evidence of poisoning. A defamation suit filed by Johnson against the accusing family members (including his own sister, Karen Williams) is pending. Other children have filed lawsuits targeting his music estate which remains in dispute.[98]
King was an FAA-certified private pilot and learned to fly in 1963 at what was thenChicago Hammond AirportinLansing, Illinois.[100][101]He frequently flew to gigs but in 1995 his insurance company and manager asked him to fly only with another certified pilot. As a result, at around the age of 70, he stopped flying.[102]
King's favorite singer wasFrank Sinatra. In his autobiography, he spoke about how he was a "Sinatra nut" and how he went to bed every night listening to Sinatra's classic albumIn the Wee Small Hours. During the 1960s, Sinatra had arranged for King to play at the main clubs in Las Vegas. He credited Sinatra for opening doors to black entertainers who were not given the chance to play in white dominated venues.[103]
In September 1970, King recordedLive in Cook County Jailduring a time in which issues of racism[104]and class in the prison system were prominent in politics. King also co-founded the Foundation for the Advancement of Inmate Rehabilitation and Recreation tying in his support for prisoners and his interest in prison reform.[104]In addition to prison reform, King also wanted to use prison performances as a way to preserve music and songs in a similar way thatAlan Lomaxdid.[105]
In 2002, he signed on as an official supporter ofLittle Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization that provides free musical instruments and instruction to children in underprivileged public schools throughout the United States. He sat on the organization's honorary board of directors.[106]
Diagnosed withdiabetesin 1990,[107]King was a high-profile spokesman in the fight against the disease.[56][108]He appeared in several television commercials forOneTouch Ultra, a blood glucose monitoring device, beginning in the early 2000s.American IdolcontestantCrystal Bowersox, who was diagnosed with diabetes at age six, would co-star with King in later commercials.[109][110]
The last eight shows of his 2014 tour were canceled because of health problems caused by complications fromhigh blood pressureand diabetes.[77][111][112]On May 14, 2015, at the age of 89,[22]he died in his sleep fromvascular dementiacaused by a series of smallstrokesas a consequence of histype 2 diabetes.[113]Two of his daughters alleged that he was deliberately poisoned by two associates trying to inducediabetic shock;[114]an autopsy showed no evidence of that.[111][115]
His body was flown to Memphis on May 27, 2015. A funeral procession went downBeale Streetwith a brass band marching in front of the hearse while playing "When the Saints Go Marching In". Thousands lined the streets to pay their last respects. His body was then driven downRoute 61to his hometown of Indianola, Mississippi.[116]He waslaid in reposeat theB.B. King Museum and Delta Interpretive Centerin Indianola so people could view his open casket.[117][118]The funeral took place at the Bell Grove Missionary Baptist Church in Indianola on May 30.[119][120][121]He was buried at theB.B. King Museum.[118]

The 5th Dimensionis an American vocal group. Their music encompasses sunshine pop,[1]pop soul,[1]and psychedelic soul.[2]They were an importantcrossover musicact of the 1960s and 1970s, although both praised and derided for their particular musical approach and mass appeal.[3][4]During the original group's heyday, they were twice invited to perform at the U.S.White House, and accepting those invitations was controversial during that era of social upheaval.[5]
Formed asThe Versatilesin late 1965, the group changed its name to "The 5th Dimension" by 1966.[6]Between 1967 and 1973, they charted with 20 "Top 40" hits on theBillboardHot 100, two of which – "Up, Up and Away" (No. 7, 1967) and the 1969 No. 1 "Medley: Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures)" — won theGrammy AwardforRecord of the Year. Other big hits include "Stoned Soul Picnic" (No. 3), "Wedding Bell Blues" (No. 1), "One Less Bell to Answer" (No. 2), a cover of "Never My Love" (Pop chart, No. 12/Easy ListeningNo. 1), "(Last Night) I Didn't Get to Sleep at All" (No. 8), and "If I Could Reach You" (Pop chart No. 10/Easy ListeningNo. 1). Three of their records reached the Top Ten ofBillboard'sRhythm & Blues/Soulchart. 5 of their 19 "Top 20" hits on theEasy Listeningchart reached the No. 1 position.[7]
The five original members wereLamonte McLemore,Marilyn McCoo,Florence LaRue,Ronald Townson, andBilly Davis Jr.Their earliest recordings were on theSoul Cityrecord label, which was started by recording artistJohnny Rivers. The group later recorded forBell/Arista Records,ABC Records, andMotown Records.[8][9]
In 1963, LaMonte McLemore and Marilyn McCoo got together with three fellow vocalists from Los Angeles—Harry Elston, Lawrence Summers, and Fritz Baskett—to form a Jazz-oriented vocal group called The Hi-Fi's. Ray Charles signed The Hi-Fi's as his touring opening act in 1963. The vocal group's name was changed to The Vocals,  and they recorded a single, "Lonesome Mood"  on Tangerine Records in 1963.[10][11]When The Vocals broke up in 1964, McLemore and McCoo teamed up with two of McLemore's childhood acquaintances from St. Louis (now looking for music opportunities in Los Angeles): aspiring Opera singer Ron Townson, and Gospel and R&B singer Billy Davis Jr. And a second female singer was recruited: Florence LaRue, who — like McCoo — had won the Grand Talent award in the annual Miss Bronze beauty pageant, and had also been photographed by McLemore for the event.[12]
The members began rehearsing as The Versatiles in late 1965. McLemore had been a staff photographer at Motown West in Los Angeles for a short period, so he connected withMarc Gordon, Motown's Senior Vice President in Los Angeles, to arrange for a meeting.[10][13]Gordon gave The Versatiles permission to record some existing Motown songs as a demo tape, but it was left to McLemore to fly to Detroit and meet with Motown head,Berry Gordyand play the audition tape for him. According to McLemore, Gordy's response to the tape was non-committal:
"Man, you all sound great, but I don't hear no hit. So just go back and cut some more."[14]
Although Gordy had not immediately offered a recording contract to The Versatiles, Marc Gordon believed they had something special, and offered to manage the group. Gordon brought them to the attention of popular singerJohnny Rivers, who had just started his own label,Soul City Records. Soul City signed the group on the spot, but Rivers insisted on a new name. Townson and his wife came up with "The 5th Dimension," and as Davis recalled later, "We all heard it, we all agreed right away, 'That's got to be it!'"[15][16]In November 1966, Soul City released their first single as The 5th Dimension, "I'll Be Lovin' You Forever", with a decidedly Motown-flavored arrangement. However, the song failed to chart.
In 1967 The 5th Dimension recorded "Go Where You Wanna Go," which became a breakthrough hit for them. The song was aJohn Phillipstune and reached No. 16 on the US Hot 100 chart.[10]The group followed this with "Up, Up and Away",[10]which reached No. 7 later that same year and went on to win fiveGrammy Awards. The following year, the group scored major hit singles withLaura Nyro's songs "Stoned Soul Picnic" (U.S. No. 3) and "Sweet Blindness" (U.S. No. 13).[10]The group received a gold record for their albumStoned Soul Picnic.
That album included "California Soul", which peaked at No. 25 in February 1969.[10]Weeks later the group's success broke wide open, with "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In" from the musicalHairtopping the Hot 100 for six straight weeks in April and May[10]and another Nyro song, "Wedding Bell Blues", doing the same for the first three full weeks in November. Their cover ofNeil Sedaka's "Workin' On a Groovy Thing" went to No. 20 in between. Those four singles kept the group on the Hot 100 for all but four weeks in 1969. By some reckonings, "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In" was the biggest hit single for 1969.[17]
Later top 20 hits included 1970's "One Less Bell to Answer" (U.S. No. 2),[10]1971's "Love's Lines, Angles and Rhymes" (U.S. No. 19) and "Never My Love" (U.S. No. 12), and 1972's "(Last Night) I Didn't Get to Sleep at All" (U.S. No. 8) and "If I Could Reach You" (U.S. No. 10). The group had seven other top 40 hits, the last being 1973's "Living Together, Growing Together" (U.S. No. 32) from the filmLost Horizon.
In 1975, McCoo and Davis, who had married on July 26, 1969, left the group to do collective and individual projects.[10]The duo had success with "Your Love" and thechart topper"You Don't Have to Be a Star (To Be in My Show)",[28]which won them their seventh Grammy award as well as their own television variety show, The Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr. show. Marilyn McCoo served a lengthy 1980s stint as the host of the TV showSolid Gold.[28]
As of April 2009[update], the group was actively touring as "The 5th Dimension featuring Florence LaRue," led by LaRue, with Willie Williams, Leonard Tucker, Patrice Morris and Floyd Smith.[29]
On June 21, 2016, The 5th Dimension featuring Florence LaRue performed inThe Villages, Floridajust days after theOrlando nightclub shooting. LaRue took the opportunity to share her thoughts on the shooting: "We will not be terrorized. We know what's happening in the world, but this is a song about good health, love, peace and happiness. We still believe in those things today," she stated before the group performed "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In".[30]
In November 2017, The 5th Dimension appeared for 18 performances at the Andy Williams Performing Arts Centre inBranson, Missouri, in the Andy Williams Christmas Extravaganza hosted byJimmy Osmond.[31]
David Brown:For a brief period in the late 1960s, the 5th Dimension fully realized the post-racial crossover success that [Motown's] Gordy had imagined for his stars, while raising the legitimate question of what it means to sound Black in music.To listen to the 5th Dimension was to hear a mélange of middle-of-the road Pop, show-tunes, folk music, with flourishes of Jazz, Soul, and a tinge of Gospel. If music were to sound like America, it might sound like the 5th Dimension – at least in the 1960s.[3]
Mark Anthony Neal:But in a scenario that's nearly impossible to imagine for a modern act, the 5th Dimension also became victims of their own success. In an extendedSummer of Soul[film] segment, Davis and Marilyn McCoo, the group's most prominent female member, rewatch the footage with equal degrees pride and pain. "We were constantly being attacked because we weren't 'black enough,'" McCoo says. "Sometimes we were called the black group with the white sound, and we didn't like that. … Our voices sound the way they sound. How do you color a sound?" As Davis adds, "Everyone thought we were a white act until they saw pictures." Those poignant moments recall similar put-downs that Whitney Houston endured two decades later, after she began pulling in both black and white audiences with her first two albums.[4]
Caroline Sullivan:Playing a show at the White House for president Richard Nixon in 1970 only cemented the idea that they were part of the establishment, though LaRue – the only original member who still tours under the 5th Dimension name – has said they were no fans of Nixon. "It was an honour to perform for the president of the United States, [but he] wasn't necessarily the president of our choice." No matter; they couldn't undo what we would now call the reputational damage, despite the fact that one of the songs they played at the White House was "The Declaration", a powerful folk-pop appeal for racial unity.[5][The medley of "The Declaration / A Change Is Gonna Come / People Gotta Be Free" was recorded for thePortraitalbum. The U.S.Declaration of Independenceas written byThomas Jeffersonis sung by the group before segueing into Sam Cooke's socially-conscious  "A Change Is Gonna Come." The musical treatment of "The Declaration" was first created for the play "Bread, Beans and Things." The recorded version by The 5th Dimension was refused play on Armed Forces radio during the Vietnam era "as they felt it depicted overthrowing the government".][32]
The 5th Dimension recorded songs by a wide variety of artists, many of whom were well known in the music industry of the era:Harry Nilsson,John Phillips,Paul Anka,Elton JohnandBernie Taupin,Neil Sedaka,Paul Williams (composer)andRoger Nichols, as well asLennonandMcCartney, andGeorge HarrisonofThe Beatles. They recorded a small number ofBurt BacharachandHal David-penned songs, most notably "One Less Bell to Answer" and "Living Together, Growing Together" (the CD rarity track, "As Long as There's an Apple Tree" was never released on album). LaMonte McLemore of The 5th Dimension contributed lyrics and melody on two recordings, "A Love Like Ours" and "The Singer".
The vocal group also recorded multiple songs by lesser known artists such as Motown'sWillie Hutch(Hutchison), an American singer, songwriter and producer who supplied them with some of the more funky, soulful songs in their repertoire. Jeffrey Comanor, an American singer-songwriter and actor, provided the group with at least seven of their more memorable album tracks and single B sides. They also recorded a couple of songs by the celebrated British composerTony Macaulay, one of which, "(Last Night) I Didn't Get to Sleep at All," was a major hit.
Some of the songwriters who worked with The 5th Dimension went on to establish successful performance careers of their own, notablyAshford & Simpson, who wrote the song "California Soul". The group is also notable for having more success with the songs ofLaura Nyrothan Nyro did herself,[6]particularly with "Stoned Soul Picnic", "Sweet Blindness", "Wedding Bell Blues", "Blowin' Away" and "Save the Country". The same was true forJimmy Webb, an American singer-songwriter and arranger who won far more accolades supplying songs to artists likeJohnny Rivers,Glen Campbell,Judy Collins,Art Garfunkel,Nina Simone,Thelma Houston, and evenFrank Sinatraand the actorRichard Harris, than he did for his own solo releases.[33]He would become the group's most prolific contributor. Webb wrote the first significant hit for both The 5th Dimension and himself: 1967's "Up, Up and Away". The group's 1967LP,The Magic Garden, features an 11 track song-cycle composed by Webb.[34][35]In all, the original lineup of The 5th Dimension recorded 24 different Jimmy Webb compositions by the end of 1975, most with his instrumental arrangements.
All but two of The 5th Dimension's original albums were produced byBones Howe, who had been a sound engineer for the likes ofFrank Sinatra,Bobby Darin,Mel Torme,Johnny RiversandPhil Spector, before producing and engineering hits for a number of young, contemporary acts, includingThe Association,The TurtlesandThe Mamas & the Papas. Howe employed members of the "Wrecking Crew" on all of The 5th Dimension recordings under his direction. (TheWrecking Crewprovided backing or replacement instrumentation for many bands recording in Los Angeles whose own musicianship skills were deemed not of a professional level by their record producer - a common practice of the era). In the case of The 5th Dimension, there were no backing musicians for the vocal group so theWrecking Crewbecame their defacto accompanists and instrumental arrangers. The contributions of the rhythm section in particular (consisting ofJoe Osbornon bass,Hal Blaineon drums, andLarry Bunkeron percussion) on these recordings are notable: Osborn and Blaine opting to be the rhythm section on most every 5th Dimension album and single recorded up through 1975. And their Wrecking Crew cohort, keyboardist/guitaristLarry Knechtel, was a constant presence as well. Being able to rely upon the same producer and group of musicians helped to give The 5th Dimension recordings a distinct and cohesive sound from album to album. Most other purely vocal groups of the time were stuck working with whoever got assigned to individual recording sessions - and didn't have much say in it.
Vocal arrangements on The 5th Dimension albums were handled byBob Alcivar, an American music producer, arranger, composer, conductor and keyboard player.
The group was inducted into theVocal Group Hall of Famein 2002.[8]
The 5th Dimension was inducted into theGrammy Hall of Famein 2003 for the 1967 single, "Up, Up and Away."[36]
The original lineup of The 5th Dimension performed for the U.S. president, staff and invitees at theWhite Housein 1970 and 1972.[5]
The Florence LaRue-led group later performed again at the White House in September of 1982.[37]
The group was invited by the U.S. State Department to represent the country as part of theUS Cultural Exchange Programin 1973. This involved a Goodwill Tour of Eastern Europe, giving concerts and talks in Ankara and Istanbul, Turkey, Bucharest and Ploesti, Romania, Warsaw and Katowice, Poland, and Ostrava, Bratislava and Prague in Czechoslovakia.[38]
They have a star on theHollywood Walk of Fame, inducted August 9, 1991, and theSt. Louis Walk of Fame, inducted on March 18, 2010.[39]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin. Since 1980, it has been struck in most years by theRoyal Mintfor sale to collectors and investors.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
