Apex, titledApex Predatorin the UK,[2]is a 2021 Americanscience fictionaction filmdirected byEdward John Drakeand written by John Drake andCorey William Large. It starsNeal McDonoughandBruce Willisand was released on November 12, 2021.
The film opens with Samuel, a self-proclaimed Apex Warrior and pharmaceutical trillionaire, shooting and killing a man. Samuel complains to a computer interface that he is becoming bored with the 'game' and asks the computer to find him a real challenge.
Thomas Malone has spent years of his life in prison, serving a life without parole sentence for multiple crimes he had committed in the past. He longs to be reunited with his family, with whom he has no contact. Thomas is approached by the game-master and offered the opportunity for his freedom. To win, Thomas must survive on a private island while being hunted by five wealthy participants, known as Hunters. Thomas accepts the offer, knowing it is his only chance to be reunited with his family and to gain his freedom.
As the hunt progresses, the hunters start to doubt each other and their own abilities, and begin to turn against one another. Samuel outwits all the other hunters in the game and claims their heads as trophies. He becomes frustrated that Thomas has escaped him so he hires additional hunters called 'Mongrels' to take part in the hunt and help him kill Thomas. Thomas eventually beats the Mongrels and faces-off with Samuel. Samuel taunts Thomas about his experience in prison, informs him that his head will look good in his trophy case, and tells Thomas to beg for his life. Thomas refuses. The confrontation ends in a fast-draw with Thomas firing a larger gun and ultimately killing Samuel. Thomas leaves the game and the island with his freedom.

The company is headquartered inChatsworth, California.
Founded in 1981 as aNASDAQ-listed public company known as Image Entertainment, Image began as a distributor ofLaserDiscs, whose sound and picture quality surpassed that ofVHSandBeta, the dominant tape formats of the time.

The company was trading under the symbol "DISK".
In August 1994, Image entered theCD-ROMmarket, releasing movies on the CD-ROM format.[5]
As the 1990s came to a close and Laserdiscs gave way to DVDs, Image re-focused on the fledgling format that quickly came to dominate the home video marketplace. While studios were busy managing the transition from VHS to DVD, Image began to acquire DVD rights to long-form music concert programs, television programming, foreign films and a broad array of special interest programming fromGRB Entertainment,20th Television/Foxstar Productions,Orion Pictures,Playboy Home EntertainmentandUniversal Pictures, all of which were being ignored by the major studios and music labels.[6]
In 2005, Image signed a distribution deal withBandai Visualto distribute selectanimetitles under the Honneamise label.[7]The deal ended in March 2007, when Bandai Visual switched over toGeneon USA.[8]

By the 10th anniversary of the DVD, Image has once again established itself as a dominant distributor of independently produced programs. In 2008, Image began to expand its release schedule to include feature films.

This also gave them access to theNew World Pictureslibrary which Lakeshore acquired in 1996, with many of the titles not issued on Blu-ray at the time.[10]Incidentally, Image originally released a number of New World titles on laserdisc from the late 80's to early 90's. 
On April 2, 2012, it was announced that RLJ Acquisition, Inc. had entered into an agreement to acquire Image Entertainment as well as Acorn Media and plan to merge the two companies.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
