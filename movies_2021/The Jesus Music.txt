Steve Pulaski ofInflux Magazineand his personal website gave the film an "A−" letter-grade, calling it "theSummer of Soulfor Christian music," in reference to theAcademy Award-winningdocumentary about the 1969Harlem Cultural Festivalreleased earlier in the year, and added that it "is such a formidable documentary because it consistently reminds us that music is the most universally powerful tool we have as humans. Thoughts you can convey through song often hit harder than they do in casual conversation. Whether you're a fan of contemporary Christian music, a devout believer, or simply someone hungry for knowledge, this is a documentary well-worth your time."[6][7]

After stopping their studies at a film school, the Erwin brothers producedThe Cross and the Towers, a documentary about the steel cross found in the debris of theWorld Trade Centertowers afterSeptember 11 attacks.[6]
Jon Erwin served assecond unit directorforAlexandStephen Kendrick's 2011 filmCourageous.[7]When asked by Alex in reference to his career, "[w]hat is your purpose?", Jon and Andrew conceived the idea for their firstfeature film,October Baby, a Christianpro-lifedramawhich was released in 2011.[8][9]The brothers went on to produce and direct several otherfaith-based films, including comedyMoms' Night Out(2014), andsports dramaWoodlawn(2015).
Their 2018music biopicI Can Only Imagine, became asurprise box-office hitwith $17.1 million from 1,629 theaters during its debut weekend, and went on to become the most successfulindependent filmof the year of 2018, as well as the third-highest grossing music biopic at the time of its release. Distributed byLionsgate, made more in box office receipts than all of their previous films combined and is their most successful film to date, with $86 million in worldwide box office against a production budget of $7 million.[10][11]
The success ofI Can Only Imagineled to the founding ofKingdom Story Company, a subsidiary of Lionsgate founded by the Erwin brothers and frequent filmmaking collaboratorKevin Downes, specializing inChristian films.[12]Some will be directed by the Erwins, while other movies will use newcomers and other veteran directors.[13]Jon Erwin compared it to a "ChristianPixar" or "ChristianMarvel".

In February 2020, Andrew Erwin related the Erwins' goal in filmmaking:
Our focus is still firmly rooted within the church, but it's focused out[.] ... And so our goal is to reach out beyond the church walls to engage a generation that's walking away from the church – as an introduction to Christianity.

Amy Lee Grant(born November 25, 1960) is an American singer-songwriter and musician. She began her music career incontemporary Christian music(CCM) before crossing over topop musicin the mid-1980s. Grant has been referred to as "The Queen of Christian Pop".[1][2]
Grant made her debut as a teenager, gaining fame in Christian music during the 1980s with hits such as "Father's Eyes", "El Shaddai", and "Angels". In the mid-1980s, she began broadening her audience and soon became one of the first CCM artists tocross overinto mainstream pop on the heels of her successful albumsUnguardedandLead Me On. In 1986, she scored her firstBillboardHot 100no. 1 song in a duet withPeter Cetera, "The Next Time I Fall". In 1991, she released the albumHeart in Motion, which became her best-selling album, topping theBillboardChristian album chart for 32 weeks. It sold five million copies in the U.S. and produced her second no. 1 pop single "Baby Baby", as well as another three top 10 hits on theBillboardHot 100: "That's What Love Is For", "Every Heartbeat" and "Good for Me".
As of 2009,[update]Grant had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide,[3]won sixGrammy Awards, 22Gospel Music AssociationDove Awards, and had the first Christian album to goplatinum.[4]She was honored with a star on theHollywood Walk of Famein 2006[5]for her contributions to the entertainment industry, and in 2022 she was announced as a recipient of theKennedy Center Honors.[6]Grant is the author of several books, including a memoir,Mosaic: Pieces of My Life So Far, and a book based on the popular Christmas song "Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song)" that she co-wrote.
Born inAugusta, Georgia, Grant is the youngest of four sisters. Her family settled inNashvillein 1967.[7]She is a great-granddaughter of Nashville philanthropistA. M. Burton(founder of Life and Casualty Insurance Company,eponymof Nashville'sLife & Casualty Tower,WLACRadio, andWLAC-TV) and Lillie Burton.[8][9][10][11][12]She has acknowledged the influence of the Burtons on her development as a musician, starting with their common membership in Nashville's AshwoodChurch of Christ.[13]According to the Singing Carrots website, based on her recorded songs, Grant has amezzo-sopranovoice type, also able to perform in thesopranoandcontraltoranges.[14]
In 1976, Grant wrote her first song ("Mountain Top"), performed in public for the first time atHarpeth Hall School, the all-girls school she attended in Nashville. She recorded ademo tapefor her parents with church youth-leaderBrown Bannister. While Bannister wasdubbinga copy of the tape,Chris Christian, the owner of the recording studio, heard the demo and calledWord Records. He played it over the phone, and she was offered a recording contract five weeks before her 16th birthday.
In 1977, she recorded her first album,Amy Grant, produced by Bannister, who also produced her next 11 albums. It was released in early 1978, one month before her high-school graduation. Toward the end of 1978 she performed her first ticketed concert after beginning her first year atFurman University.
In May 1979, while at the album-release party for her second album,My Father's Eyes, Grant metGary Chapman, who had written the title track. Grant and Chapman toured together in mid-1979. In late 1980, she transferred toVanderbilt Universitywhere she was a member of the sororityKappa Alpha Theta.[7]Grant made a few more albums before dropping out of college to pursue a career in music—Never Alone, followed by a pair of live albums in 1981 (In ConcertandIn Concert Volume Two), both backed by an augmented edition of theDeGarmo & Keyband. It was during these early shows that Grant also established one of her concert trademarks: performing barefoot. Grant continues to take off her shoes midway through performances, as she has said, "it is just more comfortable."[15][16]
In 1982 she released her breakthrough albumAge to Age. The album contains the signature track, "El Shaddai" (written byMichael Card) and the Grant-Chapman penned song, "In a Little While". "El Shaddai" was later awarded one of the "Songs of the Century" by theRIAAin 2001. Grant received her firstGrammy Awardfor Best Contemporary Gospel Performance, as well as twoGMA Dove Awardsfor Gospel Artist of the Year and Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year.Age to Agebecame the first Christian album by a solo artist to be certified gold (1983) and the first Christian album to be certified platinum (1985).[4]
In the mid-1980s, Grant began touring and recording with young up-and-coming songwriterMichael W. Smith. Grant and Smith continue to have a strong friendship and creative relationship, often writing songs for or contributing vocals to each other's albums, and as of 2019, often touring together annually during November and December putting on Christmas concerts. During the 1980s, Grant was also a backup singer forBill Gaither.[17]
Grant followed this album with the first of her Christmas albums, which was later the basis for her holiday shows. In 1984, she released another pop-oriented Christian hit,Straight Ahead, earning Grant her first appearance at theGrammy Awardsshow in 1985. The head ofNBCtook notice of Grant's performance and called her manager to book her for her own Christmas special.[7]
Shortly after Grant established herself as the "Queen of Christian Pop" she changed directions to widen her fan base. Her goal was to become the first Christian singer-songwriter who was also successful as a contemporary pop singer.[18]Unguarded(1985) surprised some fans for its very mainstream sound. "Find a Way", fromUnguarded, became one of the few non-Christmas Christian songs to hit theBillboardTop 40list, also reaching No. 7 on theAdult Contemporarychart. She also scored No. 18 onBillboardAC in 1986 with "Stay for Awhile".[19]Grant scored her firstBillboardNo. 1 song in 1986 with "The Next Time I Fall", a duet with formerChicagosinger/bassistPeter Cetera. That year, she also recorded a duet with singerRandy Stonehillfor hisLove Beyond Reasonalbum, titled "I Could Never Say Goodbye", and recordedThe Animals' ChristmaswithArt Garfunkel.
Lead Me On(1988) contained many songs which were about Christianity and love relationships, but some interpreted it as not being enough of a "Christian" record. Years laterLead Me Onwould be chosen as the greatest Contemporary Christian album of all time byCCM Magazine. The mainstream song "Saved by Love" was a minor hit, receiving airplay on radio stations featuring the newly emerging Adult Contemporary format. The album's title song received some pop radio airplay andcrossed overto No. 96 on theBillboardHot 100, and "1974 (We Were Young)" and "Saved By Love" also charted as Adult Contemporary songs. In 1989, she appeared in aTargetad campaign, performing songs from the album.[20]
WhenHeart in Motionwas released in 1991, many fans were surprised that the album was of contemporary pop music. Grant's desire to widen her audience was frowned upon by the confines of the popular definitions of ministry at the time.[21]The track "Baby Baby" written for Grant's newborn daughter Millie, of whom Grant wrote, her "six-week-old face was my inspiration", became a pop hit (hitting No. 1 on theBillboardHot 100), and Grant was established as a name in the mainstream music world. "Baby Baby" received Grammy nominations for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Record and Song of the Year (although it failed to win in any of those categories).
Four other hits from the album made the Pop top 20: "Every Heartbeat" (No. 2), "That's What Love Is For" (No. 7), "Good for Me" (No. 8), and "I Will Remember You" (No. 20). On the Adult Contemporary chart, all five songs were top 10 hits, with two of the five ("Baby Baby" and "That's What Love Is For") reaching No. 1. Many Christian fans remained loyal, putting the album atopBillboardContemporary Christian Chart for 32 weeks.Heart in Motionis Grant's best-selling album, having sold over five million copies according to the RIAA.[22]Grant followed the album with her second Christmas album,Home For Christmasin 1992, which included the song "Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song)", written byChris Eatonand Grant, and would later be covered by many artists, includingDonna Summer,Jessica Simpson(who acknowledged Grant as one of her favorite artists),Vince Gill,Sara Groves,Point of Grace,Gladys Knight, and Broadway starBarbara Cook.
House of Lovein 1994 continued in the same vein, containing pop songs mingled with spiritual lyrics. The album was a multi-platinum success and produced the pop hit "Lucky One" (No. 18 pop and No. 2 AC; No. 1 onRadio & Records) as well as the title track (a duet with country music star and future husbandVince Gill) (No. 37 pop) and a cover of Joni Mitchell's frequently covered "Big Yellow Taxi" (No. 67 pop) (in which she changed the line "And they charged the peoplea dollar and a halfjust to see'em" to "And then they charged the people25 bucksjust to see'em").
After she covered the10ccsong "The Things We Do for Love" for theMr. Wrongsoundtrack,Behind the Eyeswas released in September 1997. The album struck a much darker note, leaning more towards downtempo, acoustic soft-rock songs, with more mature (yet still optimistic) lyrics. She called it her "razor blades andProzac" album.[23]Although "Takes a Little Time" was a moderate hit single, the album failed to sell like the previous two albums, which had both gone multi-platinum.Behind The Eyeswas eventually certified Gold by theRIAA. The video for "Takes a Little Time" was a new direction for Grant; with a blue light filter, acoustic guitar, the streets and characters of New York City, and a plot, Grant was re-cast as an adult light rocker. She followed up "Behind The Eyes" withA Christmas To Remember, her third Christmas album, in 1999. The album was certified gold in 2000.
Following the9/11 attacksGrant's "I Will Remember You" saw a resurgence in popularity as many radio DJs mixed a special tribute version of the song. In the same year Grant won $125,000 for charity on the "Rock Star Edition" ofWho Wants to Be a Millionaire?[24]
Grant returned to Christian pop with the 2002 release of an album ofhymnstitledLegacy... Hymns and Faith. The album featured a Vince Gill-influenced mix ofbluegrassand pop and marked Grant's 25th anniversary in the music industry.[25]Grant followed this up withSimple Thingsin 2003. The album did not have the success of her previous pop or gospel efforts. Soon afterSimple Things, Grant andInterscope/A&M parted ways. The same year, Grant was inducted into theGospel Music Hall of Fameby theGospel Music Association, an industry trade organization of which she is a longstanding member, in her first year of eligibility. Grant released a sequel in 2005 titledRock of Ages...Hymns and Faith.[26]
Grant joined the reality television phenomenon by hostingThree Wishes, a show in which she and a team of helpers make wishes come true for small-town residents.[27]The show debuted on NBC in the fall of 2005; however it was canceled at the end of its first season due to high production costs. AfterThree Wisheswas canceled, Grant won her 6th Grammy Award forRock of Ages... Hymns & Faith. In a February 2006 webchat, Grant said she believes her "best music is still ahead".
In April 2006, a live CD/DVD titledTime Again... Amy Grant Livewas recorded inFort Worth, Texas, atBass Performance Hall. (Grant's first paid public performance was at the Will Rogers Auditorium in Fort Worth.) The concert was released on September 26, 2006. In addition to receiving a star on theHollywood Walk of Fame, media appearances included write-ups inCCM Magazine, and a performance onThe View.
In a February 2007 web chat on her web site, Grant discussed a book she was working on titledMosaic: Pieces of My Life So Far, saying, "It's not an autobiography, but more a collection of memories, song lyrics, poetry and a few pictures." The book was released on October 16, 2007. In November, it debuted at No. 35 on theNew York TimesBest Seller list.[28]In the same web chat, Grant noted that she is "anxious to get back in the studio after the book is finished, and reinvent myself as an almost-50 performing woman".
2007 was Grant's 30th year in music. She left Word/Warner, and contracted with EMI CMG who re-released her regular studio albums as remastered versions on August 14, 2007. Marking the start of Grant's new contract is a career-spanninggreatest hitsalbum, with all the songs digitally remastered. The album was released as both a single-disc CD edition, and a two-disc CD/DVD Special Edition, the DVD featuring music videos and interviews.[29]Grant appeared with Gill onThe Oprah Winfrey Showfor a holiday special in December 2007.[30]
In February 2008, Grant joined the writing team fromCompassionartas a guest vocalist at the Abbey Road studios, London, to record a song called "Highly Favoured", which was included on the albumCompassionArt. On June 24, 2008, Grant re-released her 1988 album,Lead Me On, in honor of its 20th anniversary. The two-disc release includes the original album and a second disc with new acoustic recordings, live performances from 1989, and interviews with Amy. Grant recreated theLead Me Ontour in the fall of 2008. On June 27, 2008, atCreation Festival Northeastshe performed "Lead Me On" and a few other songs backed byHawk Nelson.

When asked about the new album during an interview with CBN.com, Grant says, "... my hope is just for those songs to provide companionship, remind myself and whoever else is listening what's important. I feel like songs have the ability to connect us to ourselves and to each other, and to our faith, to the love of Jesus, in a way that conversation doesn't do. Songs kind of slip in and move you before you realize it."[32]In September 2012, Grant took part in a campaign called "30 Songs / 30 Days" to supportHalf the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide, a multi-platform media project inspired by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn's book.[33]

Due to club play of the remixes of "Baby Baby" and "Every Heartbeat", they charted at No. 3 and 13, respectively on the U.S.Dance Chart.[40]This marked her first appearance on that chart in 23 years.

Smith and Jordan Smith.[48][49]Grant has been a guest narrator forDisney's Candlelight ProcessionalatWalt Disney Worldin 2012, 2013, and 2015.[50][51]
On June 19, 1982, Grant married fellow Christian musicianGary Chapman. Their marriage produced three children.[52]In March 1999 she filed for divorce from Chapman. On March 10, 2000, Grant married country singer-songwriterVince Gill, who had been previously married to country singer Janis Oliver ofSweethearts of the Rodeo.[53]Grant and Gill have one daughter together, Corrina Grant Gill, born March 12, 2001.[54]In the November 1999CCM Magazine, Grant explained why she left Chapman and married Gill:
I didn't get a divorce because 'I had a great marriage and then along came Vince Gill.' Gary and I had a rocky road from day one. I think what was so hard—and this is (what) one of our counselors said—sometimes an innocent party can come into a situation, and they're like a big spotlight. What they do is reveal, by comparison, the painful dynamics that are already in existence.[55]
In June 2020, Grant had an open-heart surgery to repairpartial anomalous pulmonary venous return(PAPVR), a congenital heart condition.[56]
Along with praise for her contributions to the contemporary Christian genre, Grant has also generated controversy within the Christian community, from "complaints that she was too worldly and too sexy" to a "barrage of condemnation" following her divorce and remarriage.[57]
In an interview early in her career, Grant stated, "I have a healthy sense of right and wrong, but sometimes, for example, using foul, exclamation-point words among friends can be good for a laugh."[58]The article which was based on that interview was constructed in such a manner so as to make it appear as though Grant condonedpremarital sex. Later Grant reflected on how the article misrepresented her views, stating: "We probably talked for two hours about sexual purity, but when the interview finally came out he worded it in such a way that it sounded like I condoned premarital sex. So I picked up that article and thought, 'You've made me say something I've never said, and you've totally disregarded two hours of Bible put in one flippant comment that I made about a moan.'"[59]

Michael Whitaker Smith(born October 7, 1957) is an American musician who has charted in bothcontemporary Christianand mainstream charts.[2]His biggest success in mainstream music was in 1991 when "Place in This World" hit No. 6 on theBillboardHot 100. Over the course of his career, he has sold more than 18 million albums.[3]
Smith is a three-timeGrammy Awardwinner, anAmerican Music Awardrecipient,[4]and has earned 45Dove Awards.[5]In 1999,ASCAPawarded him with the "Golden Note" Award for lifetime achievement in songwriting,[6]and in 2014 they honored him as the "cornerstone of Christian music" for his significant influence on the genre.[7]He also has recorded 31 No. 1 Hit songs, fourteen gold albums, and five platinum albums.[3]He has also starred in two films and published 14 books includingThis Is Your Time, which he worked with Christian authorGary Thomasto write.[8]
Michael Whitaker Smith was born to Paul and Barbara Smith inKenova, West Virginia. His father was an oil refinery worker at the Ashland Oil Refinery, in nearbyCatlettsburg, Kentucky. His mother was a caterer.[9]He inherited his love of baseball from his father, who had played in theminor leagues. As a child, he developed a love of music through his church. He learned piano at an early age and sang in his church choir. At the age of 10, he had "an intense spiritual experience" that led to his becoming a devoutChristian. "I wore this big cross around my neck," he would recall, "It was very real to me."[10]He became involved in Bible study and found a group of older friends who shared his faith.[10]
After his older Christian friends moved away to college, Smith began to struggle with feelings of loneliness and alienation. After graduating from high school, he gravitated toward alcohol and drugs.[9]He attendedMarshall Universitywhile developing his songwriting skills but dropped out after one semester. He also played with various local bands aroundHuntington, West Virginia. During that time, his friendShane Keister, who worked as a session musician in Nashville, encouraged him to move to Nashville, the Country Music capital, and pursue a career in music.[10]
In 1978, Smith moved to Nashville, taking a job as a landscaper to support himself. He played with several local bands in the Nashville club scene. He also developed a problem with substance abuse.
I really started losing touch when I moved to Nashville, around April of '78. I was smokin' marijuana, drinking, doing some other drugs; just being crazy, you know. My mom and dad knew what I was doing. But they never hassled me; they just prayed for me. And I felt convicted by God. Every time I'd wake up I knew: This isn't me. But I couldn't change myself.[10]
After a breakdown in November 1979, Smith decided to recommit to Christianity. The next day he auditioned for a new contemporary Christian music (CCM) group, Higher Ground, as a keyboardist and got the job. His lead vocals were heard on much of CCM radio with the single, "I Am". It was on his first tour with Higher Ground, playing mostly in churches, that Smith was finally able to put the drugs and alcohol behind him.[10]
In 1981, while he was playing keyboards for Higher Ground,[11]Smith was signed as a writer to Meadowgreen Music, where he wrote numerousgospelhits penned for artists such asSandi Patty,Kathy Troccoli,Bill GaitherandAmy Grant, to the effect that some of these popular worship songs can now be found in churchhymnals. The following year, Smith began touring as a keyboardist for Grant on herAge to Agetour.
He became Grant's opening act and recorded his firstGrammy-nominated solo albumThe Michael W. Smith Project(which he also produced himself) in 1983 on theReunion Recordslabel. This album contained the first recording of his hit "Friends", which he co-wrote with his wife Deborah. By the time Smith's second albumMichael W. Smith 2was released in 1984, he was headlining his own tours. In 1986, Smith releasedThe Big Picture.
After the release of his 1988 effort,i 2 (EYE), Smith once again collaborated with Grant for her "Lead Me On" world tour. The following year, Smith recorded his firstChristmasalbum, simply titledChristmas(1989).
In 1990, Smith releasedGo West Young Man, his first mainstream effort, which included the mainstreamcrossoverhit single "Place in This World". The song peaked at No. 6 on theBillboardHot 100. In 1992, he releasedChange Your World, which included the No. 1 adult contemporary hit "I Will Be Here for You". In 1993 Smith released his first box set,The Wonder Yearsand his first greatest hits album,The First Decade (1983–1993). The latter also includes two new songs, "Do You Dream of Me?" and "Kentucky Rose".
In 1994, Smith appeared as a guest pianist on the albumSwing, Swang, SwungbyChristian rockbandGuardian.[12]
In 1995, Smith released his eighth albumI'll Lead You Home, which combines the pop style of his secular albums with a touch of religious feel.Live the Life(1998) andThis Is Your Time(1999) follow the same style. In 1998, Smith also released his second Christmas album,Christmastime.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
