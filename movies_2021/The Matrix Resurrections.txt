The Matrix Resurrectionsis a 2021 Americanscience fictionaction filmco-produced, co-written, and directed byLana Wachowski, and the first in theMatrixfranchise to be directed solely by Lana. It is the sequel toThe Matrix Revolutions(2003) and the fourth installment inThe Matrixfilm franchise. The film starsKeanu Reeves,Carrie-Anne Moss,Yahya Abdul-Mateen II,Jessica Henwick,Jonathan Groff,Neil Patrick Harris,Priyanka Chopra Jonas, andJada Pinkett Smith. The film is set sixty years afterRevolutionsand followsNeo, who lives a seemingly ordinary life as a video game developer having trouble with distinguishing fantasy from reality. A group of rebels, with the help of a programmed version ofMorpheus, free Neo from a new version of the Matrix and fight a new enemy that holdsTrinitycaptive.
Following the release ofRevolutions, the Wachowskis denied the possibility of anotherMatrixfilm. Warner Bros. constantly expressed interest in reviving the franchise, hiringZak Pennto write a new screenplay after the Wachowskis refused every offer to create more sequels. In late 2019, a fourthMatrixfilm was finally announced, with Lana Wachowski returning as director withoutLilly, and with Reeves and Moss reprising their roles. Filming started in February 2020 but washaltedthe next month by theCOVID-19 pandemic. Wachowski considered abandoning the film, but was encouraged by the cast to finish it. Filming resumed in August and concluded three months later.
The Matrix Resurrectionspremiered at theCastro TheaterinSan Franciscoon December 16, 2021, and was released theatrically and via theHBO Maxstreaming service byWarner Bros. Pictureson December 22, 2021. The film received generally positive reviews from critics but was abox-office disappointment, grossing only $159 million worldwide against a production budget of $190 million. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the75th British Academy Film Awards. A sequel is currently in development.[5]
A young woman named Bugs learns that the Matrix is running old code in a loop, enacting the moment when Trinity first found Neo within the Matrix.[a]Bugs discovers a program embodyingMorpheusand helps free him from the simulation.
Thomas Anderson is the creator of a video game series calledThe Matrix,based on his faint memories asNeo. At a coffee shop, he regularly encounters Tiffany, a married mother with no recollection of her past, on whom Anderson based the game characterTrinity. Anderson has created a simulation called a Modal to develop game characters. He struggles to separate perceived reality from dreams, a known concern among his co-workers and partner. Thomas'spsychoanalystprescribes himblue pillsthat he takes each day to suppress the occurrences, but he stops taking them. Meanwhile, as Bugs and Morpheus work to extract Neo from the Matrix, Anderson's business partner regains his memories asAgent Smith, Neo's former nemesis.
Neo awakens in a pod and notices Trinity confined in another nearby, before being extracted to Bugs's hovercraftMnemosyne. Neo is brought to the human city Io, where he reunites with an elderlyNiobe. She explains that sixty years have passed in the real world since the Machine War ended, and that Neo's allies, including the original Morpheus, have died over time. The peace achieved by Neo's sacrifice lasted for many years, but the large number of humans leaving the Matrix created a serious power shortage, causing the machines to fight over limited resources. Soon afterward, Zion was targeted in an attempt to get humans to use as the power supply once more. However, this attempt caused many machines, who still remembered Neo's sacrifice and the promise of peace, to turn on the others in order to protect the humans. This allowed most of Zion's citizens to escape. Io was then founded by both machines and humans who have been working together ever since against the remaining machines who want to return things to the way they were before the war.
Niobe refuses to risk Io's safety to help Neo free Trinity and confines him to his quarters. Bugs and her crewmates free Neo and enter the Matrix to contact Trinity. They are attacked by Smith and other exiled programs, including the Merovingian, but Neo and theMnemosynecrew defeat them as Neo's abilities return. The group leaves and locates Trinity, but before Neo can talk to her, his therapist appears and immobilizes him by manipulating time. He reveals that he isThe Analyst, a program designed to study the human psyche.
The Analyst explains that after Neo's and Trinity's deaths, he wanted to study Neo's body and his anomalous powers as The One and convinced his superiors to resurrect both of them. He discovered that due to The One's inherent connection to all humanity in the Matrix, manipulating Neo could make the Matrix produce more energy. Moreover, he found that the code anomaly in Neo was shared in his bond with Trinity, and that by suppressing their memories and keeping them close but always apart, the Matrix generated much more energy. Solving the energy crisis put The Analyst in a position to seize power from The Architect, after which he rebuilt the Matrix to control humans withemotional manipulation, claiming that humans generallybelieve what theywantto believe. Neo's liberation destabilized the system and triggered afail-safeto reboot the Matrix, but The Analyst stalled the reboot by convincing his superiors that threatening to kill Trinity would coerce Neo to return to his pod.
Neo and Bugs return to Io and talk to Sati, an exiled program that Neo previously met.[b]Seeking to avenge her parents' deaths at the hands of the Analyst, Sati helps devise a plan to free Trinity. Back in the Matrix, Neo makes a deal with The Analyst: he will return to his pod if he fails to convince Trinity to leave the Matrix. Tiffany reaffirms her identity as Trinity while talking with Neo. Realizing that he has lost, The Analyst attempts to kill her, but Agent Smith appears and attacks The Analyst, seeking revenge for his own imprisonment.
Neo, Trinity, and the others escape in their vehicles, chased through the streets by hordes of bot programs and attack helicopters. As the last ones to be extracted from The Matrix, Neo and Trinity become cornered atop a skyscraper. Holding hands, they leap off and Trinity begins to fly, taking them to safety. With Trinity's newfound control over the Matrix, both return to confront The Analyst. They thank him for giving them a second chance by resurrecting them while they also express their contempt. Neo and Trinity fly off into the sky together, making plans to remake The Matrix.
Additionally,Andrew Lewis CaldwellandEllen Hollmanappear as Jude and Echo, respectively.[28][29]Julian Greyand Gaige Chat also appear as Tiffany's sons Brandon and Donnie, respectively.[30]San Francisco mayorLondon Breedappears as Calliope, a member of Resistance.[31]Daniel Bernhardtwas announced to be reprising his role asAgent JohnsonfromThe Matrix Reloaded,[32][10]but his scenes were cut from the final film.Tom Hardyfilmed an uncredited backgroundcameo appearance, due toThe Matrix Resurrectionsfilming inSan Franciscosimultaneously withVenom: Let There Be Carnage, in which Hardy starred asEddie Brock / Venom.[33]
I couldn't have my mom and dad... yet suddenly I hadNeoandTrinity, arguably the two most important characters in my life. It was immediately comforting to have these two characters alive again, and it's super-simple. You can look at it and say: "Okay, these two people die, and okay, bring these two people back to life, and oh, doesn't that feel good?" Yeah, it did! It's simple, and this is what art does and this is what stories do. They comfort us and they're important.
While making theMatrixfilms,the Wachowskistold their close collaborators that they, at the time, had no intention of making another film in the series afterThe Matrix Revolutions(2003).[35]Instead, they gave their blessing to the notion ofgamers"inherit[ing] the storyline", andThe Matrix Onlinevideo game was billed as the official continuation.[36]Rumors of a new installment began to circulate online in 2011 when it was reported that the Wachowskis had been planning two additional films in the series and had discussions withKeanu Reevesabout reprising his role.[37]Another rumor in 2014 claimed that the sisters had submitted a story treatment for a newMatrixtrilogy toWarner Bros.[38]These were later confirmed to be false.[39]
In February 2015, in interviews promotingJupiter Ascending(2015), Lilly Wachowski called a return toThe Matrix(1999) a "particularly repelling idea in these times" when studios preferred to green-light sequels,reboots, and adaptations over original material,[40]while Lana Wachowski, addressing rumors about a potential reboot, said they had not heard anything but believed the studio might be looking to replace them.[41]At various times, Reeves andHugo Weavingeach confirmed their interest and willingness to reprise their roles in potential future installments of theMatrixfilms, with the stipulation that the Wachowskis were involved in the creative and production process.[42][43]
According to producer James McTeigue, there was "always talk" of a fourthMatrixfilm within Warner Bros. even without the Wachowskis on board, though prior to 2019 they had not found the right concept.[44]In March 2017,The Hollywood Reporterwrote that Warner Bros. was in the early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise, withZak Pennin talks to write a treatment, and interest in gettingMichael B. Jordanattached to star. The Wachowskis were not involved at that stage, although the studio had hoped for their blessing. The notion of a reboot or remake was denounced by Penn, and ideas for stories set in the already established universe were explored, including, reportedly, a prequel film about a youngMorpheusor a sequel film from a descendant of his.[45]In March 2018, Penn said he was working on a revival of the franchise and teased the possibility of an expanded universe.[46]Penn clarified in October 2019 that he had been working on one of twoMatrixprojects at Warner Bros., and that his work was separate from the planned film.[47]Penn's film did not go ahead in favor of Wachowski's film;Jada Pinkett Smithlater reflected that handing the franchise's legacy to other filmmakers would have been a "horrendous mistake".[11]
As explained by Lana Wachowski during theBerlin International Literature Festival2021, Warner Bros. constantly approached the Wachowskis every year to make anotherMatrixsequel, but the Wachowskis always declined the offers out of a lack of interest and because of their feelings that the trilogy's story had concluded. However, in 2019, Ron and Lynne Wachowski, the Wachowskis' parents, died alongside a close friend of Lana's, with her father passing away first, her friend second and her mother third. After not being able to process that kind of grief, Lana suddenly conceived the story ofThe Matrix Resurrectionsone sleepless night. In her words, Wachowski felt that while she could not have her parents back, she then could haveNeoandTrinityback, feeling very comforted to see them alive again.[34]With Lana Wachowski stepping forward for a sequel, Warner Bros. readily accepted her concept, eager to have the franchise's creator aboard for the sequel, according to McTeigue.[44]
The film was officially announced by Warner Bros. on August 20, 2019. Lana Wachowski returned as sole director, with Reeves andCarrie-Anne Mossconfirmed to reprise their roles. The script was written by Wachowski,David Mitchell, andAleksandar Hemon, who had previously written the series finale ofSense8together.[6][48][49]The Wachowskis also previously directed the2012 film adaptationof Mitchell's novelCloud Atlas. Lilly Wachowski was not involved with the film due to work on theShowtimeseriesWork in Progress, but gave her blessing to those involved to come up with a story even "better than the original".[50]She said she needed time away from the industry to "reconnect with myself as an artist and I did that by going back to school and painting and stuff", and that she had been affected by the death of her parents.[51]John Tollwas hired as cinematographer that month. Toll was cinematographer on the Wachowskis' previous filmsCloud AtlasandJupiter Ascending, as well as every episode ofSense8.[52]
Reeves and Moss were confirmed to be reprising their roles as Neo and Trinity upon the film's announcement in August 2019.[6]In October 2019,Yahya Abdul-Mateen IIwas cast in the film, with some sources speculating he would be playing a young Morpheus, whileNeil Patrick Harriswas added in an undisclosed role.[53][54]Following the first trailer's release, Abdul-Mateen II confirmed that he was indeed playing the role of Morpheus.[9]Laurence Fishburne, who portrayed Morpheus in the original trilogy, announced in August 2020 that he was not asked to reprise his role as Morpheus.[55]Pinkett Smith entered negotiations to reprise her role asNiobe, withJessica Henwickentering negotiations to join in an undisclosed role,[56][57]later revealed as Bugs.[14]Henwick was being considered byThe Walt Disney Companyto audition for a role inShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings(2021) at the same time she was offered to audition for the part of Bugs; in what she described a "red-pill/blue-pill moment" for her, Henwick choseResurrectionsoverShang-Chi.[11]Jada Pinkett-Smith and Jessica Henwick were confirmed in December, along with the additions ofJonathan GroffandToby Onwumere;[58][59]Pinkett-Smith was convinced to return after learning from Wachowski how much the film meant for her. They went through a "couple different versions" for Niobe until they settled to depict the character in an elderly form.[60]
In January 2020,Eréndira Ibarrawas cast, withPriyanka Chopraentering final negotiations.[61][62]That same month,Lambert Wilson, who played the Merovingian in the sequels, revealed he was in negotiations to return.[63]Hugo Weaving, who starred in the franchise asAgent Smith, was originally approached to reprise his role, but he had scheduling conflicts with his involvement inTony Kushner's theatrical adaptation ofThe Visit, leading Wachowski to conclude that the dates would not work after staying in touch with Weaving for a while.[64][65]Weaving was later confirmed to be appearing in the film, but through archive footage from the original trilogy,[66]while Groff was confirmed to have been cast as Smith in December 2021, replacing Weaving.[15]Chopra and Wilson's castings were confirmed in February 2020, along with the additions ofAndrew Caldwell,Brian J. SmithandEllen Hollman.[25][67][68][69]After some speculation, Chopra was revealed to be playing Sati in the film; the character was previously portrayed by Tanveer K. Atwal inRevolutions.[19]
Joe Pantoliano, who appeared in the first film as Cypher, expressed interest in April 2020 in reprising his role despite his character's death in the first installment and messaged Lana Wachowski about the possibility of bringing him back, but received no response from her.[70]In September 2020, it was announcedDaniel Bernhardtwas reprising his role as Agent Johnson fromThe Matrix Reloaded(2003).[32]Christina Ricciwas announced as part of the cast in June 2021; she had previously worked with the Wachowskis onSpeed Racer(2008).[71]Telma Hopkinswas also announced to be part of the cast in September 2021.[22]In December 2021, less than a week before the film's premiere, Henwick confirmed to have filmed a scene with a backgroundcameo appearanceofTom Hardy, asVenom: Let There Be Carnage(2021) was being filmed simultaneously withResurrections, though it is currently unclear if Hardy's appearance was kept in the finished film.[33]After the film'sTorontopremiere, it was confirmed thatChad Stahelski, who served as stunt coordinator in the previous films, appeared in the film as "Handsome Chad".[24]
Unlike the previous films, which were shot predominantly in Australia,[72]The Matrix Resurrectionswas filmed in the United States and Europe.
Under the code name "Project Ice Cream", the film began production in San Francisco on February 4, 2020.[67][73][74]Filming also took place in Chicago.[74]Filming in San Francisco caused irritation amongst residents and city workers after damage was inflicted to buildings and street lights.[75]As in the case of other productions likeShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten RingsandVenom: Let There Be Carnage, the producers had to pay $420,000 to theSan Francisco Police Departmentso they could film in the city.[76]As opposed to other productions, nosecond unitwas needed during the action sequences as Wachowski directed all the scenes herself.[77]Scott Rogers, astunt performerwho worked with Reeves inJohn Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum(2019) andJohn Wick: Chapter 4(2023), was hired to be the film's stunt coordinator.[11]
In March 2020, the production relocated toStudio BabelsberginPotsdam, Germany.[78]On March 16, 2020, production on the film was suspended due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[79][80]After filming washalted, Wachowski contemplated the possibility of never finishing the film and letting it "go down as an incomplete legendary film not meant to be seen by anyone". However, the cast insisted Wachowski return and finish the film until she agreed.[81]On August 16, 2020, Reeves confirmed filming had resumed in Berlin.[82]Principal photography wrapped on November 11, 2020.[83]
Wachowski's long-time camera operator, Daniele Massaccesi, took over asdirector of photographyin the latter part of filming after original DoPJohn Tollleft due to a health issue in his family.[84][85]
The dialogue editing, sound mixing, sound design and sound editing with director Lana Wachowski took place in spring 2021 at the Babelsberg-based post-production companyRotor Film. Visual effects that allow space and time to appear offset on the screen were created with camera systems specially developed forMatrix Resurrectionsduring outdoor shooting and in the volumetric studio called Volucap in Babelsberg as well as in the world's first volumetric underwater studio on the Babelsberg film studio premises. Volucap, a cooperation between Studio Babelsberg,Fraunhofer SocietyandUFA, worked on site for two years onMatrix Resurrections.[86]
After finishing work onMatrix Resurrections, the co-producing Studio Babelsberg fitted its largest film studio (Stage 20) with rainbow colors and named it "Rainbow Stage" in honor of theWachowskis. The Wachowskis, known for their commitment to people of diverse sexual orientations and identities, had previously directed several times in Babelsberg including, e.g.,V for VendettaandCloud Atlas.[87][83]
In September 2021, Warner Bros. confirmed thatJohnny KlimekandTom Tykwerwould be scoring the film, having previously collaborated with Wachowski onSense8andCloud Atlas,[88]replacingDon Davis, who composed the score for the first three films. The 1967 song "White Rabbit" byJefferson Airplaneis prominently featured in the trailer and film.[89][90]Wachowski said the choice of "White Rabbit" for the trailer not only was in reference to elements ofLewis Carroll's 1865 novelAlice's Adventures in WonderlandthatThe Matrixhad previously used and which "White Rabbit" is based on, but also a nod to Jefferson Airplane themselves which was formed as ahouse bandforThe Matrixclub in San Francisco.[91]The second trailer featured an electronic/orchestral cover of theRage Against the Machinesong "Wake Up" by Sebastian Böhm.[92]The original song featured prominently at the end of the firstMatrixfilm,[93]andResurrectionsfeatures in its ending a cover byBrass Against.[94]
The film'sscorewas released on December 17, 2021. A track from the album titled "Neo and Trinity Theme (Johnny Klimek & Tom Tykwer Exomorph Remix)" was released as a single on December 10.[95]
On August 24, 2021, the title was revealed asThe Matrix Resurrections.[96]A trailer was screened as part of Warner Bros.' panel atCinemaConthat day, featuring a meeting between Neo and Trinity.[96]Ahead of the film's first official trailer being released on September 9, the movie's official website was updated on September 7, presenting random clips of the trailer to the user and narration based on their time of day.[97][98]A second trailer was released on December 6, 2021.[99]By its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada, the film had made 600.6 million impressions across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, in part due to the exponential growth of HBO Max in 2021. According to RelishMix, "these stats run 2X over the norm for the genre as far as awareness and reach."[100]
A tie-in video gametech demotitledThe Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience, based onUnreal Engine 5, was released byEpic GamesforPlayStation 5andXbox Series X/SduringThe Game Awards 2021.[101]
The Matrix Resurrectionsheld its world premiere in the United States at theCastro Theaterin San Francisco on December 18, 2021.[102]The film was initially set for release on May 21, 2021, which would have premiered alongsideJohn Wick: Chapter 4, also starring Keanu Reeves.[103]However, the film was postponed to April 1, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[104]The film was then moved forward to December 22, 2021.[105]It is the final film from Warner Bros. Pictures to have a simultaneous 30-day release on theHBO Maxstreaming service, which was used in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[106]

In February 2022, co-financiersVillage Roadshowsued Warner Bros. for breach of contract, claiming that the decision to streamThe Matrix Resurrectionson HBO Max created "abysmal theatrical box office sales figures" and damaged the value of theMatrixfranchise. Warner Bros. responded that the lawsuit was "a frivolous attempt by Village Roadshow to avoid their contractual commitment".[125]
The review aggregator websiteRotten Tomatoesreported an approval rating of 63% based on 356 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "If it lacks the original's bracingly original craft,The Matrix Resurrectionsrevisits the world of the franchise with wit, a timely perspective, and heart."[126]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[127]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B−" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest of the series, whilePostTrakreported 60% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 46% saying they would definitely recommend it.[100]
Los Angeles Timesreported divided reactions to the film.[128]Film critic Katie Walsh praised the film, concluding "Wachowski brings this unapologetic earnestness and sense of pleasure toThe Matrix Resurrections, which is also a welcome reminder that big action films can be well lit, stunningly designed and, yes, colorful too."[129]The Independentgave the film 4 out of 5 and wrote, "The Matrix Resurrectionsends with a literal call to the powers of sentimentality, empowerment and freedom – it ponders whether humanity finds any value in them which, in turn, seems to really ask whether audiences still have any interest in blockbusters of this purity and ambition. For my own stake, at least, I hope they do."[130]Gizmodopraised the film, saying "Resurrectionsis an excellentMatrixsequel that knows what you think you want in aMatrixsequel, and gives it to you in ways you aren't expecting. Sometimes those things don't work, but mostly they do, and as a result I'm confident to say:The Matrixis back."[131]Matt Singer ofScreenCrushwrote, "The thing that carriesThe Matrix Resurrectionsthrough some of those rough patches instead is Wachowski's obvious affection for the characters, and the actors' reciprocal love for this world and its endless intellectual curiosities."[132]
The Guardiangave the film 2 out of 5 and wrote: "Really,Resurrectionsdoesn't do much to remove the anticlimax that hung like a cloud over the cinema auditorium at the end of the third film in 2003. This movie is set up to initiate a possible new series, but there is no real creative life in it. Where the original film was explosively innovatory, this is just another piece of IP, an algorithm of unoriginality."[133]The Vergealso gave the film a negative review praising the performances and visuals but criticized the writing, characterization and recasting of characters and felt that "Resurrectioncenters Neo and Trinity's love story but in a disjointed and frustrating way."[134]The Timescalled it "another truly horrible sequel" in a one-star review, criticizing what it called its creative shallowness, similarity to previousMatrixfilms, level of self-referentiality, and the quality of its action sequences.[135]Gulf Newsgave the film a mixed review, concluding that "The Matrix Resurrectionsmay be a bumpy ride but it's still a trip."[136]IGN's Amelia Emberwing gave the film 4 out of 10, praising the performances but criticizing the execution and visuals while also writing "The Matrix Resurrectionsis the kind of film that will go down in cult history because it is so laughably bad. Truthfully, I can't even say it's unenjoyable because I spent so much of its overly long runtime giggling over how jaw-droppingly misguided the majority of it is", and further expressed, "The Matrix Resurrectionsis a bunch of really good ideas stacked together to make a bad – and sometimes ugly – film."[137]
Following the film's release, producer James McTeigue toldColliderthat there were no plans for furtherMatrixfilms, though he believed that the film's open ending meant that this could change in the future: "I think the film also works where it's really open to audience interpretation, like what happened in those 60 years before they fished Neo out again, or Thomas Anderson to Neo. When Neo and Trinity are there at the end, and they're talking with The Analyst, what do they actually mean that they're going to change? So I think that it's out there, but it's not in our wheelhouse at the moment."[146]
In April 2024, it was announced that Warner Bros. was developing a new installment in the franchise withDrew Goddardattached to write and direct. Lana Wachowski will serve as executive producer.[147]

Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.

The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros.

In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]

Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros.

In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros.

As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]

Max, also known asHBO Max,[b]is an Americansubscription video on-demandover-the-topstreamingservice. It is a proprietary unit ofWarner Bros. Discovery Global Streaming & Games, which is itself a division ofWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD).[2]The platform offers content from thelibrariesofWarner Bros.,Discovery,HBO,CNN,Cartoon Network,Adult Swim,Animal Planet,TBS,TNT,Eurosport, and their related brands. Max first launched (as HBO Max) in the United States on May 27, 2020.
The service also carries first-run original programming under the "Max Originals" banner, programming from the HBOpay televisionservice, and content acquired via either third-party library deals (such as those with film studios for pay television rights) or co-production agreements (including, among others, those withBBC StudiosandSesame Workshop).
When the service was first launched as HBO Max, it succeeded bothHBO Now, a previous HBO SVOD service; andHBO Go, theTV Everywherestreaming platform for HBO pay television subscribers. In the United States, HBO Now subscribers and HBO pay television subscribers were migrated to HBO Max at no additional charge, subject to availability and device support. HBO Max also supplanted the streaming component ofDC Entertainment'sDC Universeservice, with its original series being migrated to HBO Max as Max Originals. The HBO Max service began to expand into international markets in 2021.
According toAT&T,[c]HBO and HBO Max had a combined total of 69.4 million paying subscribers globally on June 30, 2021, including 43.5 million HBO Max subscribers in the U.S., 3.5 million HBO-only U.S. subscribers (primarily commercial customers like hotels), and 20.5 million subscribers to either HBO Max or HBO by itself in other countries.[3]By the end of 2021, HBO and HBO Max had a combined total of 73.8 million paying global subscribers.[4][5]At the end of Q1 2022, HBO and HBO Max had 76.8 million global subscribers.[6]
Since the April 2022 merger ofWarnerMediawithDiscovery, Inc.to form Warner Bros. Discovery, Max is one of the combined company's two flagship streaming services, the other beingDiscovery+(which primarily focuses onfactualandrealityprogramming from the Discovery brands). WBD initially announced plans for HBO Max and Discovery+ to merge in 2023, but the company ultimately chose to retain Discovery+. As part of the decision, WBD migrated some Discovery+ shows to Max whilst also leaving them on Discovery+. WBD went on to replace HBO Max with a newly rebranded service, shortening the service's name to "Max", which launched in the United States on May 23, 2023, in Latin America on February 27, 2024, and in Europe on May 21, 2024, introducing a redesigned user interface, and adding more Discovery content. The rebrand was also applied to Netherlands, Poland, France, and several other regions in 2024. In Belgium and the Netherlands the name "HBO Max" was retained with a new Max logo.
On October 10, 2018, WarnerMedia announced that it would launch anover-the-topstreaming servicein late 2019, featuring content from its entertainment brands.[7]The original plan for the service called for three tiers with a late 2019 launch.[8]Randall L. Stephenson, chairman and CEO of WarnerMedia's parent,AT&Tindicated in mid-May 2019 that it would use the HBO brand and would tie into cable operators as HBO cable subscribers would have access to the streaming service. A beta was expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a full launch in the first quarter of 2020 at the time.[9]
Otter Mediawas transferred in May 2019 to WarnerMedia Entertainment fromWarner Bros.to take over the streaming service as Brad Bentley, executive vice president and general manager of direct-to-consumer development, exited the post after six months. Andy Forssell transferred from being the chief operating officer of Otter to replace Bentley as executive vice president and general manager while still reporting to Otter CEO Tony Goncalves, who would lead development.[10]
On July 9, 2019, WarnerMedia announced that the service would be known as HBO Max and that it would launch in spring 2020, whileReese Witherspoon'sHello SunshineandGreg Berlantiwere signed to production deals for the service. (The "Max" moniker is shared with HBO's sister linear pay television serviceCinemax, which has alternately identified by its suffix name since the mid-1980s and used it prominently in its branding from 2008 to 2011.)[11]On October 29, 2019, it was announced that HBO Max would officially launch in May 2020.[12]
On January 8, 2020, AT&T announced thatAudience, a channel exclusive to subscribers of AT&T-owned television providers such asDirecTVwith some original programming, would be sunset on May 22, eventually transitioning to abarker channelfor HBO Max.[13]Warner Bros.and HBO Max announced theWarner Maxfilm label on February 5, 2020, which would produce eight to ten mid-budget movies per year for the streaming service starting in 2020.[14]On April 20, 2020, WarnerMedia announced HBO Max's launch date as May 27.[15]Later that year on October 23, it was announced that WarnerMedia decided to consolidate the Warner Max label into the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after its chairman,Toby Emmerich, and his development and production team led by Courtenay Valenti of Warner Bros. Pictures, Richard Brener of New Line and Walter Hamada (who oversees DC-based films), was put to manage the company's entire film output, both theatrical and streaming releases.[16][17][18]
In July 2022, as a part of a cost-cutting and strategic move following the merger ofDiscovery, Inc.with WarnerMedia to formWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD), it was reported that HBO Max had ceased new original series development inCentral Europe,Nordic Europe, the Netherlands, and Turkey, as well as removed selected international series from the platform worldwide. It was reported that France and Spain had been largely excluded from these cuts, due to French regulations requiring streaming services to produce domestic content, and Spanish-language content appealing to a wide range of markets served by HBO Max.[19][20][21]With the cancellation ofGordita Chronicleslater that month, it was reported that the service was also abandoning development of live-action children's and family programming.[22]
On August 3, 2022, it was reported that multiple Max Original films and HBO series had been quietly removed from the service without prior notice as part of cuts to direct-to-streaming films. The company thenwrote offfilms and series that had underperformed on the service.[23][24]It was also thought that avoiding payment forresidualsplayed a part.[25]This followed news that had broken the previous day that then-upcoming Max Original filmsBatgirlandScoob! Holiday Haunthad been both abruptly cancelled, despite being nearly complete.[26][27]During an earnings call the next day, WBD CEODavid Zaslavstated that the company would cut children's programming and emphasize theatrical films over direct-to-streaming releases.[28][29]
Later that month, more programs were pulled from the streaming service, including animated and unscripted series such asThe Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo,Final Space,Summer Camp Island,Infinity Train,Close Enough, and nearly 200 episodes ofSesame Street, among others,[30][31]which was met with heavy backlash from fans, critics, actors, and creators alike.[32][33][34]On August 24, 2022, the HBO Max original filmsHouse Party(which was pulled from its slate just 17 days before its release) andEvil Dead Risewere both shifted to theatrical releases.[35]WBD later reached licensing deals with thefree ad-supported streaming television(FAST) servicesThe Roku ChannelandTubi(owned byFox Corporation) in 2023; the deal covers over 2,000 hours of library programming, some of which being shows that had been pulled from HBO Max.[36][37]
During its third-quarter earnings report in November 2022, WBD stated that the merged service was now targeting a "Spring 2023" launch in the U.S., ahead of the original schedule. Perrette also stated of a potential price increase for HBO Max's ad-free tier in 2023, explaining that it was "an opportunity, particularly in this environment".[38]A price hike for the ad-free tier in the U.S. was later announced on January 12, 2023, which saw the price raised by $1 to $15.99 a month (the yearly plan would be unaffected by this move), effective immediately for new subscribers, while current subscribers would see the price hike starting on February 11, 2023.[39]
On March 14, 2022, after Discovery shareholders approved its merger with WarnerMedia, Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels stated that the company planned to pursue an eventual merger of HBO Max with its own streaming serviceDiscovery+. Wiedenfels stated that this process would most likely begin with a bundle of the two services as a short-term option, with a long-term goal to eventually merge the services into one platform.[40]
During an earnings call in August 2022, WBD head of Global Streaming and Interactive JB Perrette revealed that Discovery+ and HBO Max would merge "next Summer", with the unified service launching first in the United States, and rolled out to other markets beginning in late-2023.[29]When announcing the merged service, Zaslav did not immediately indicate whether it would continue to carry the HBO brand. He stated that HBO was one of the "great crown jewels of the company" and would "always be the beacon and the ultimate brand that stands for the best of television quality".[41]In early-December 2022, it was reported by CNBC via inside sources that multiple names were being considered—including simply "Max".[42][43]
In February 2023, Zaslav revealed during an earnings call that WBD would officially announce the service on April 12.[44]He also announced that WBD would continue operating Discovery+ in conjunction with the service rather than shut it down, stating that it was profitable, and that its subscribers were "very happy with the product offering".[44]One day before the scheduled announcement,The New York Timesconfirmed that the service would be called "Max", and that it would retain HBO Max's existing pricing and be available in multiple price tiers for six months (on December 5 its legacy ad-free tier will be removed with former users in this tier downgrading to the ad-free tier after this date).[45][46]WBD acquired the max.comdomain nameearlier that year from Max International, anutritional supplementcompany.[47]
WBD officially unveiled Max on April 12: the new service would first launch in the United States on May 23, and in other regions throughout 2023 and 2024. While the new service maintains similar price points to HBO Max, support for4K resolutionvideo andDolby Atmosbecame exclusive to the new "Ultimate" tier, and the ad-free plan was also reduced from four concurrent streams to two.[48]In addition to all Warner Bros. Pictures releases from 2023 onward, WBD plans to have more library films and television series available on Max in 4K.[47][49][48]
Perrette explained that the HBO branding had been dropped from the service's name so that it could be associated with itsoriginal programmingas a flagship brand on Max, rather than having to be associated with the entirety of its library—which included children's and family programming at odds with HBO having traditionally been associated withpremiumand adult-oriented programming.[50][51]The Max logo was designed by the British agency DixonBaxi, and incorporates elements of both the HBO and Warner Bros. logos, including a center-dotted "a" resembling the center-dotted "O" from the HBO logo, and the "m" and "x" letters containing curves based on Warner Bros.' long-time shield logo. The service also changed its corporate color from purple to blue, in homage to Warner Bros.' historical use of blue-colored logos.[52][53]
The rebrand was promoted with the tagline "The one to watch".[54][55]Pato Spagnoletto, chief marketing officer of Warner Bros. Discovery Streaming, identified the campaign as the largest marketing spend in company history.[53][56]WBD's stock fell by nearly six percent after Max's announcement.[57]Within the first 3 months of Max's rebrand, WBD lost 1.8 million subscribers across their streaming platforms, but attributed it to an overlap of subscribers of Max and Discovery+, as well as expected churn.[58]In November 2023, it was reported that WBD lost 2.5 million subscribers over a six-month period, with their shares falling 19% as a result.[59]
In May 2024, WBD announced a partnership with Disney to offer a bundle of Max with its competitorsDisney+andHuluin the United States, It was launched on July 25, 2024, at a price of $16.99 per-month for ad-supported, and $29.99 per-month for ad-free.[60][61]
Existing HBO Max subscribers were grandfathered under their current plan features for least six months, following that period all legacy ad free customers were moved to the ad free tier (existing ad supported were moved to the ad lite tier).[64][46]
HBO Max was formed under WarnerMedia's Entertainment division, then headed byRobert Greenblatt.Kevin Reilly, president of WarnerMedia Entertainment Networks, which includes most of the company's ad-supported entertainment channels such asTBS,TNT, andTruTV, was also given the role of as chief content officer of HBO Max with responsibility for HBO Max-exclusive original programming and library content. Andy Forssell was named the service's executive vice president and general manager while still reporting toOtter MediaCEO Tony Goncalves, who leads development.[11]Casey Bloys, programming president of HBO, retained oversight of the core HBO service but was not initially involved with Max-exclusive programming.
On August 7, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a significant restructuring under new presidentJason Kilar, which he described as "leaning into this great moment of change" towards direct-to-consumer services. As a result, Greenblatt and Reilly both left the company. WarnerMedia Entertainment was dissolved, with programming operations combined with Warner Bros. in a new Studios and Networks group under that studio's CEO Ann Sarnoff. Bloys was given complete programming oversight of HBO and HBO Max, as well as Reilly's other previous responsibilities, reporting to Sarnoff. Forssell became the head of a new HBO Max operating business unit, reporting directly to Kilar.[65]On April 23, 2021,Adult Swimand HBO Max's adult animation development teams merged under the leadership of Suzanna Makkos.[66]
On August 15, 2022, HBO was reorganized by Warner Bros. Discovery, resulting in layoffs within HBO Max's non-scripted originals, live-action family originals, international originals, and casting units (HBO itself never had an in-house casting department). Makkos also began reporting to HBO's head of comedy Amy Gravitt.[67][68]
Max features first-run and library content from HBO and other Warner Bros. film and television studios and brands.[69][70][71]The service also includes films available through HBO's existing pay television rights that are sourced fromWarner Bros. Picturesonly.[70][72][73][74]
As with HBO's other streaming platforms,HBO GoandHBO Now(but as opposed to its add-on services onPrime Video Channels,YouTube Primetime Channelsand, until its removal from that platform in 2021,Apple TV Channels), Max originally did not include feeds of HBO's linear cable channels,[75]nor does it include any content fromCinemax.[76]Though Cinemax shares its film content with the linear HBO channel, and therefore the majority of films in the combined library will be on both services in different windows, these films will not necessarily be available on both Max and Cinemax at the same time.[77]
On December 4, 2024, Max added a “Channels” tab offering live feeds of HBO and its linear multiplex channels (with the exception of HBO Family and HBO Latino). Initially available on a limited basis to U.S. subscribers of Max’s Ad-Free and Ultimate Ad-Free tiers using adult profiles, the feature will allow users to restart, rewind and fast-forward, and navigate between streams of the linear channel feeds directly from within the player.[78][79]
First and third-party content providers for Max. Asterisk (*) denotes third parties while cross (†) denotes former providers.
Original content produced will be under the bannerMax Originals, including series, films, and specials.Original episodic content is released weekly, eschewing the "binge" format made popular byNetflix.Kevin Reillystated this was to ensure that originals would remain in the spotlight for extended periods, by letting said shows "breathe" as opposed to "fading quickly after a binge and burn". He also noted that the weekly schedule helped to drive the success of past HBO shows likeSuccessionandChernobylwhich they co-produced withSky UK, and became hits precisely due to their staying power.[87]
A slate of 31 original series were planned for its first year, with plans to expand to 50 for its next year, but production timelines may have been interrupted by theCOVID-19 pandemic.[70]Max also has podcasts about the films and TV series on the service.[90]It also produces original podcasts exclusively for the service, withBatman: The Audio Adventuresbeing the first.[91]
NewWarner Bros.-produced television series that have premiered onThe CWsince the2019–20 seasonbeginning withBatwoman,Nancy DrewandKaty Keene(which was cancelled in July 2020) will have their past seasons placed on Max about a month after the season finale airs on television (streaming rights to existing series remains with Netflix under an existing deal).[11]Although theAll Americanspin-off,All American: Homecoming, which premiered on the CW in 2022, was placed onNetflixwith its parent show. On July 9, 2019, HBO Max acquired the U.S. streaming rights toFriendsin a $425 million deal,[11][70]and on September 17, 2019, acquired the U.S. streaming rights toThe Big Bang Theory, as part of a deal that also extends TBS's off-network rights to the series through 2028.[92]
Outside of Warner Bros. Discovery, the service also offers titles fromThe Criterion Collection,[93]and has a long-term partnership withBBC Studios(which HBO had previously partnered with to createHis Dark Materials). Over 700 episodes of BBC content were available on the service at launch, including the first 11 seasons of the 2005Doctor Whorevival, as well as future seasons twelve through fourteen, and a variety of other shows includingThe Honourable Woman,Luther,Top Gear, and the original British version ofThe Office. Additionally, future shows by BBC Studios will be co-produced with Max.[94]
HBO also extended their existing partnership withSesame Workshop, while moving said content to the front of the Max brand. Select episodes from all fifty seasons ofSesame Street(dating back to 1969) are available to stream on the service for the first time ever.[95]Additionally, future seasons ofSesame Streetwill stream exclusively on Max until 2025, alongsideEsme & Roy, and several new spin-offs starting withThe Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo,Sesame Street: Mecha Builders, andThe Monster at the End of This Story.[96]On March 8, 2022, WarnerMedia and Sesame Workshop announced they will plan new shows for Cartoon Network for the new original series run and a second run acquisition rights HBO Max, includingCharlotte's Web, andBea's Blockas well as the animation specialSesame Street: The Nutcracker.

In August 2021,Funimation, a subsidiary ofSony, purchased Crunchyroll from AT&T for $1.175 billion, with the intent to create a combined service that caters to anime entertainment.[121]On January 1, 2022, HBO Max removed the Crunchyroll hub, instead redirecting subscribers to a "global animation" page that combines selected anime with other international animated films. Since then, the service has slowly started to remove anime from Crunchyroll's line up.[122]

In late 2020, due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, WarnerMedia moved two Warner Bros. films originally intended as major theatrical releases to either exclusive or simultaneous releases on HBO Max.The Witcheswas released exclusively on HBO Max in the U.S. on October 22,[133]andWonder Woman 1984debuted simultaneously in North American theaters and on HBO Max on December 25, although the latter was initially only available on the service for a month.[134]Week-long free trials were discontinued in December 2020.[135]
On December 3, 2020, it was announced that the studio's entire 2021 film lineup would see a simultaneous theatrical release and a one-month limited release on the streaming service, starting withThe Little Thingson January 29.[136]Subsequent films released under the same-day theatrical/streaming window to date wereJudas and the Black Messiah(February 12),[137][138]Tom and Jerry(February 26),Godzilla vs. Kong(March 31),Mortal Kombat(April 23),Those Who Wish Me Dead(May 14),The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It(June 4),In the Heights(June 10),Space Jam: A New Legacy(July 16),The Suicide Squad(August 5),Reminiscence(August 20),Malignant(September 10),Cry Macho(September 17),The Many Saints of Newark(October 1),Dune(October 22),King Richard(November 19), andThe Matrix Resurrections(December 22). Standard release windows applied to each film after their initial limited-run streaming release on the service; HBO Max would then reassume streaming rights to the aforementioned Warner Bros. films upon their respective pay television premieres on the linear HBO service in mid-to-late 2021 or 2022, depending on the scheduled start of their individual HBO exhibition agreements.[139][140]
This decision, called "Project Popcorn" within Warner Bros.,[141]was met with backlash from filmmakers, production companies, theDirectors Guild of America, theCreative Artists Agency, and movie theater owners as Warner Bros. had not informed anyone about their plan ahead of the announcement.[142][143][144][145][146]Viewership of the films varied, withMortal Kombatreaching 3.8 million,The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do Ittotaling 1.6 million, andIn the Heightstotaling 693,000 (according toSamba TV, as WarnerMedia does not report viewership numbers for HBO Max).[147]
Warner Bros. spent over $200million alone compensating talent for the shift to streaming;Deadlinereported in January 2022 that such a business move "will never occur again given its high cost".[141]
In March 2021, it was announced that Warner Bros. would discontinue same-day releases in 2022, as part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas) and will instead use a 45-day exclusive release window for theaters.[148]The Matrix Resurrectionswas the final film released in 2021 as part of Project Popcorn. The 45-day release window for HBO Max was only used for two films (The BatmanandFantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore) before it was reported in August 2022 that as part of a restructuring of Warner Bros' film distribution strategy following the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc, the length of the window would now be decided for each film on a case-by-case basis.[149]
On August 13, 2023, CNN announced a new streaming news hub on Max known asCNN Maxto launch on September 27, which features a mix of original news programs and simulcasts of primetime programs from CNN's U.S. andinternationallinear networks.[150][151]CNN Internationalwill be also available through Max in European countries such as France and Poland.[152]
CNN had previously attempted a standalone subscription service in 2022,CNN+, but was closed almost immediately after the completion of the WarnerMedia/Discovery merger due to it conflicting with the company's goal of having one streaming service to encompass all WBD properties.[153][154]
Beginning on March 30, 2025, Max announced that it will be removing this feature on the Basic with ads plan.[155]
On March 1, 2022, Turner Sports announced an eight-year deal to hold rights toUnited States men'sandwomen'snational soccer team home matches, such as FIFA World Cup qualifying and international friendlies. This excludesFIFAandCONCACAFevents, whose rights are held by Fox, and away matches. It was stated that at least half the matches per-season would be exclusive to HBO Max.[156]The first match was streamed on January 17, 2023.[157]
On October 5, 2023, Max announced plans to launch a new sports-focused tier in the United States, to be known initially as theBleacher ReportSports add-on. The tier would feature live sporting events and studio shows fromTNT Sports, includingMajor League Baseball(MLB), theNational Basketball Association(NBA), theNational Hockey League(NHL), and theNCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, as well as exclusive USA Soccer matches and programs, and select on-demand content.[158][159]On December 14, 2023, amid the closure of theGCN+service, WBD announced that its programming rights would be consolidated into the sports add-on in February 2024, including theGiro d'Italiaand variousUCItours and events.[160]
The service was to be available as a free preview until February 29, 2024, after which it was to become an $9.99 add-on on top of an existing Max subscription. However, amid changes to TNT Sports' portfolio (including its impending loss of rights to the NBA in 2025, and other acquisitions such as college sports and international events such as theFrench Open), the launch of the sports add-on as a paid service was delayed indefinitely.[158][159]On February 26, 2025, it was announced that the add-on had been scrapped as part of a change in strategy, and that live sports content would be available at no additional charge as part of the "Standard" and "Premium" tiers of Max (as B/R sports on Max). JB Perrette stated that WBD had been "actively involved in exploring ways to evolve the sports distribution ecosystem in the U.S.", and that offering sports content as part of the existing tiers was the best option for subscribers.[161][162]
Similar to the Bleacher Report Sports add-on in the United States, a sports-focused tier will be added to Max in Europe during its launch over the summer of 2024 in conjunction with its pan-European sports brandEurosport. This tier will offer the linear channelsEurosport 1andEurosport 2, and coverage for various sports events including the2024 Summer Olympics, Giro d'Italia,Vuelta a España, andTour de France.[152]
On July 9, 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery announced thatTNT Sportswill arrive at Max in Chile the week of July 15 with an innovative proposal where sports fans will be able to subscribe independently or by adding it to the platform's available plans. It will include live events and original content.
The most relevant Chilean soccer competitions are added, such as theChilean Primera División,Primera B,Copa Chileand original programming, among others.[1]
From February 2025,TNT Sportscontent will be available to users with a subscription toPack Fútbolwith their enabled cable operator and to TNT Sports subscribers independently.
From October 24, 2024, in Spain, Max has added a newMax DAZNpackage that will cost €44.99 per month, in addition to the Sports package that is optional for the Standard and Premium plans, it includes fourDAZNchannels in addition toEurosportwith the best sport that fans could wish for.
LaLiga, theUFC, or theFormula 1andMotoGPworld championships will be available to subscribers of theMax DAZNPackage, in addition to having all the movies, series and documentaries on the platform with the same advantages as the Premium Plan[163]
At launch, HBO Max did not support4K,HDR,Dolby Vision, orDolby Atmos, but support for these technologies were planned as "part of the HBO Max product roadmap".[164][165]Support for 4K, HDR, and Atmos was added starting with the release ofWonder Woman 1984,[166][non-primary source needed]with WarnerMedia promising to add more content in these formats throughout 2021 and beyond.[167]
The service providedclosed captioningsupport at launch, but initially lacked support foraudio description(AD) for those with visual impairments.[168]In October 2020, theAmerican Council of the Blindannounced it had reached a settlement with WarnerMedia whereby at least 1,500 hours of HBO Max content will be available with AD by the end of March 2021, increasing to at least 6,000 hours by March 2023, along with otheraccessibilityenhancements to the website and apps by September 2021.[169]HBO Max later began rolling out AD on select titles on March 26, 2021.[170]
The majority of active subscribers to the HBO pay TV service (which previously included HBO Go), and most customers that were subscribed to HBO Now at time of launch, can access HBO Max for no extra charge, with all three services generally sharing the same price point of $14.99 per month. However, this transition is contingent on the customer's current provider or biller having signed a new distribution agreement for HBO Max with WarnerMedia.[75][171]
On May 27, 2020, as part of an agreement with Time Warner that renewed its carriage contract for theTurner Broadcasting Systemnetworks and gave its over-the-top television serviceSling TVdistribution rights to the linear HBO channel.Dish Networksecured an option to become a distribution partner for HBO Max following the exclusivity period with Apple.[172][173]HBO content is also available as a premium add-on forDirecTV StreamandHulufor the same $14.99 price as HBO Max.[174]
In announcing HBO Max, WarnerMedia immediately confirmed that HBO subscribers on AT&T-owned platforms (includingAT&T TV,DirecTV,U-verse, andAT&T Mobility) would receive HBO Max on-launch at no additional charge.[175][176]AT&T customers who are subscribed to their highest-tiered internet, TV and wireless plans would also receive HBO Max for free, while those on lower-tiered plans will get a free trial ranging from one month to one year.[177]Existing HBO Now subscribers billed directly by HBO were also migrated to HBO Max on-launch at no additional charge. On April 27, 2020, an agreement was announced for HBO Now subscribers via Apple (both in-app subscriptions andApple TV Channels) to be migrated to HBO Max. Content from HBO Max would be listed in theApple TV appalong with there being a dedicated HBO Max hub in the app.[178][179]OnApple TVdevices, HBO Max is available to the regular fourth generation Apple TV and fifth and sixth generationApple TV 4K; earlier versions which do not support third-party app download are not supported.
WarnerMedia subsequently negotiated with other pay TV providers for similar arrangements.[171]On February 20, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a distribution deal withYouTube TVthat would allow members to add HBO and Cinemax, while also being able to include HBO Max as an add-on.[180]On April 15, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a similar deal withCharterSpectrum(which acquired Warner's formercable divisionafter it was spun off in 2009, in May 2016) to give access to HBO Max for HBO subscribers via theirTV Everywherecredentials.[181]A similar agreement was announced withHuluon May 1 for most existing subscribers via Hulu + Live TV, as well as being available as an add-on to all other plans on the service.[182]On May 20, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia had made distribution deals withAltice USA,Cox Communications,Xbox,Samsung,PlayStation,Verizon Communicationsand the National Cable Television Cooperative (NCTC).[183]An agreement withComcast(Xfinity) was announced a few hours after the platform's launch.[184]Max is also available onXfinityFlex andCoxContour Stream Player.[185][186]
The most prominent platforms without agreements to carry HBO Max at the launch wereAmazon(maker of theFire TVandFire HDdevices) andRoku, which together are estimated to control 70% of the U.S. streaming player market.[184]With both platforms, non-Max HBO content remained available as usual through the companies' respective channels platforms and/or through HBO Now (which was rebranded to just "HBO" on July 31, 2020) while deals for HBO Max were being worked out. On May 13, 2020,John Stankey, CEO of AT&T, revealed toVarietythat Amazon was very unlikely to become a launch partner for HBO Max; the parties have remained at an impasse following the launch, reportedly due to a disagreement about whether Amazon can host the additional Max programming directly on itsAmazon Prime VideoChannels platform as it does for HBO currently.[187][184]On November 16, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia and Amazon had reached an agreement to make HBO Max available on Fire TV and Fire Tablet devices beginning the following day, while also allowing subscribers of HBO via Prime Video Channels access to the HBO Max app at no extra cost (although the additional Max programming will still not be hosted on the Prime Video Channels platform).[188]The dispute with Roku was reported to hinge on carriage commissions and advertising sales on the future ad-supported tier.[184]On December 16, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia and Roku had reached an agreement to make HBO Max available on Roku devices beginning the following day, while also allowing subscribers of HBO via Roku Channels access to the HBO Max app at no extra cost (although the additional Max programming would still not be hosted on the Roku Channels platform); conversely, Roku remote controls from the past five years which included an HBO Now app shortcut button now route viewers directly to the HBO Max app instead.[189]Dish Networkwas also erroneously mentioned as a holdout in some media reports; HBO has not been available at all from Dish since late 2018 due to a separate dispute.[190]On July 29, 2021, WarnerMedia and Dish announced that they had reached an agreement to resolve the dispute and restore HBO to Dish's satellite service, along with offering access to HBO Max to HBO subscribers via Dish at no extra cost.[191]
There were plans for HBO Max to introduce an ad-supported tier by 2021,[192]with AT&T later announcing during their Investor Day event on March 12, 2021, that the tier would launch in June of the same year.[193]HBO original programming will continue to be ad-free for subscribers of the tier, but the tier will not allow access to Same-Day Premieres.[194]WarnerMedia later announced during their 2021 upfront presentation on May 19 that the ad-supported tier would launch during the first week of June at a price point of $9.99 a month.[195]The tier would end up launching on June 3, while also adding a yearly option for both tiers (priced at $99.99 a year for the ad-supported tier and $149.99 a year for the ad-free tier).[196]
Localized versions of HBO Max launched on June 29, 2021, in Latin America and the Caribbean,[197]on October 26, 2021, in Andorra, Spain and the Nordics (excluding Iceland), and on March 8, 2022, in Central and Eastern Europe and Portugal, in part by converting existing streaming services operated by HBO in some of those markets to the HBO Max platform.[198][199]In the interim, some HBO Max original programs have been made available on WarnerMedia's existing international platforms, also includingHBO Asia.[200][201]The European launches of HBO Max featured a notable promotion, offering the service with a 50% discount "for life" for new subscribers as long as they maintain their subscription.[202]
In other countries, HBO and/or Max original programs are licensed tothird-party networks and streaming servicesunder long-term deals. In these cases, Max has left it up to individual rightsholders to decide whether to offer its programming on an over-the-top basis. The extent and lengths of the deals vary by country; not all networks that carry HBO programs also carry Max programs, and in some cases individual programs are carried by different services.[203][204][205]
WarnerMedia said in late 2019 that it planned to continue HBO's existing international licensing partnerships for the time being.[206]However, as part of the WarnerMedia further restructuring announced in August 2020, WarnerMedia presidentJason Kilarsaid HBO Max would be expanding its scope globally.[65]Operations chief Andy Forssell indicated later that year that the company ultimately plans to have HBO Max active in 190 countries, but that a timeline for most of the remaining countries had not been decided.[199]
Following the merger of WarnerMedia with Discovery, Inc. in April 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery has decided to halt international expansion of HBO Max in favor of waiting to replace the existing service, as well as HBO Go in Asia-Pacific region, with Max, and instead continuing to license its content to other international distributors such asSky EuropeandFoxtelin markets where HBO Max isn't available, in an attempt to reach financial stability for the company.[207]This also included postponing the launch of Max in France and Belgium until the summer 2024, despite there already being plans to launch the service as HBO Max in 2023.[208]Plans for expansion of Max are expected to restart sometime in 2026, beginning with the regions where Sky Europe operates,[209]although the service has continued to expand before then, but in the form of an additional VOD hub for existing pay TV operators in countries like New Zealand, Japan and Greece.[210][211][212]
HBO Max was launched on June 29, 2021, in the 39 territories of Latin America and the Caribbean, where HBO already operated directly its streaming service HBO Go, and premium television channels.[213][214]HBO Max in Latin America and the Caribbean was rebranded as Max on February 27, 2024.[215]
Max does not operate in Canada;[216]rights to most Max Original programming produced by Warner Bros. or its subsidiaries are held byBell Media, which distributes them via its OTT serviceCrave, and its English- and French-language pay television servicesCraveandSuper Écran(which themselves include access to the OTT version of Crave viaTV Everywherecredentials). The agreement was first announced in 2019, also renewing Crave's existing rights to first-run HBO programming (Bell operates anHBO channelas a multiplex of Crave) and pay-one rights to Warner Bros. Pictures releases. It does not include the rights to series produced for the service by third-party studios.[203][217][218]The agreement was most recently renewed in 2024 for an unspecified length.[219]
The Bell agreement has excluded some of Max's youth, family, and animation programming, which have often been picked up byCorus Entertainmentfor its specialty channels, such asCartoon Network,Treehouse, andAdult Swim[220](in conjunction with the company's long-standing output agreement withCartoon Network).[221][222][223][224][225]
Under a long-term agreement until 2024 between HBO andSky Group(Comcast), Sky operatesSky Atlanticwhich broadcasts the majority of HBO's programming. Sky Atlantic is available in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy. In February 2011,Sky Atlanticlaunched on the Sky platforms in theUnited KingdomandIreland, which maintains a distribution deal with HBO to offer the majority of its programming on the channel. Under the five-year agreement between HBO and Sky, newer HBO programs will air on Sky Atlantic before airing on other television channels within the United Kingdom and Ireland. Before 2011,TG4in Ireland had a long-term agreement to broadcast HBO programming free-to-air, this ceased following the creation of Sky Atlantic. In many other countries, Max has licensed exclusive rights to its programming to television networks owned by third parties, includingSky Atlanticin theUnited Kingdom.
In March 2021, WarnerMedia confirmed that HBO Max would not launch in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy before 2025 due to an existing deal for HBO programming withSky Groupwhich was renewed in 2019 but does not automatically include Max Originals produced by third-party companies or Warner Bros. Television themselves.[226][227][228]
On December 9, 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery and Sky announced a brand new non-exclusive bundling partnership in the UK and Ireland, where Max is expected to launch in early 2026. Following its launch, Sky customers will gain access to the ad-supported version of Max at no additional cost.[229]
On August 15, 2012, HBO announced plans to launchHBO Nordic, a multiplatform video distribution service servingNorway,Denmark,SwedenandFinlandthat was created through a joint venture with Parsifal International.[230][231]Thevideo on demandservice launched in December 2012.[232]HBO programming also airs inIcelandonStöð 2.[233]In Spain, HBO programs were previously broadcast on pay television serviceCanal+, since 2011.[234]In 2016, during the discontinuation of the Canal+ branding in Spain, HBO launched a standalone streaming service called HBO España, which was the Spanish equivalent of HBO Now and HBO Nordic.
HBO Europehad announced on multiple occasions that they were not aware that they were going to replace their current service with HBO Max, nor would their rates be increased.[235]However, in December 2020, the head of HBO Max, Andy Forssell, revealed that all HBO services in Europe, including HBO España and HBO Nordic, would be replaced by HBO Max. On October 26, 2021, HBO Max was launched in the Nordics (excluding Iceland) and Spain and Andorra.[236][237]
Starting in 2024, HBO Max's programming began to be integrated as part of more expensive packages in the Spanish TV service Movistar Plus+ with all programming from the service becoming available on Movistar Plus+ by April 2024.[238][239]The rebranding to Max went into effect on May 21, 2024.[240][241]On September 17, 2024, a linear TV channel dedicated to broadcasting HBO and Max content was launched, exclusively on Movistar Plus+, as Max Avances.[242]
In the 2010s,HBO Europelaunched streaming serviceHBO Goin 13Central and Eastern Europeancountries. HBO programs in Portugal were previously broadcast on the premium television channel TVSéries from the services ofTVCine, since 2015. In 2019, less than a year before the discontinuation of TVSeries, HBO Europe launched a standalone streaming service called HBO Portugal. Similarly to the Nordics and Spain, HBO Max was launched in Portugal[243]and Central and Eastern Europe on March 8, 2022,[244]replacing HBO Portugal and HBO Go.
The rebranding to Max went into effect on May 21, 2024,[241]except in Poland where it took place on June 11.[245]The Max rebranding in Poland also gave the option to live stream all ofTVN Warner Bros.

Meanwhile, Polish users not subscribed to extra add-on will be able to only live stream the threeHBOchannels in Poland and the free to air networkTVN.
On November 13, 2008,OrangelaunchedOrange Cinéma Séries(renamed OCS in 2012), a five-channel package, dedicated to movie and series. The same year, OCS signed a long-term agreement with HBO. On October 10, 2013, they launched the channel OCS City (initially nicknamed Génération HBO) to broadcast only HBO productions. The HBO catalog was also available to stream on their streaming service. From 2019 to 2023, OCS had the complete exclusivity on the HBO catalog in France. Before that, other channels likeCanal+,Canal+ SériesorNT1could aired reruns of selected HBO series after their original run on OCS.[246]However, OCS didn't have the rights on the Max catalogue. The deal ended in December 2022, with HBO productions leaving OCS from January 2023 onwards.[247]
In October 2021, formerCanal+executive Vera Peltekian was appointed as VP and commissioning editor of original HBO Max programming forFrance. HBO Max's launch in France was set for 2023, but this ended up getting delayed after Warner Bros. Discovery decided to halt the global rollout of HBO Max to replace the existing service with Max first.[208]Meanwhile,Canal+, theTF1 Group, andWarner TVbroadcast a selection of the Warner Bros.-produced scripted live-action Max Original series, certain films and reunion specials. Programs not owned by Warner Bros. (likeLionsgate'sLove Life) have been licensed separately to other French broadcasters.
In October 2022,Amazon Prime Videosigned a deal withWarner Bros. Discoveryto distribute the HBO Max programs owned by Warner Bros. in France.[248]In January 2023, it was announced that the deal was extended to all HBO productions, following the expiration of the deal with OCS for HBO productions, but also to Warner Bros. Discovery's linear TV channels, following the end of the deal withCanal+for their carriage. All this content where available on the service through Le Pass Warner ("The Warner Pass"), asubscription-based channel, launched on March 16, 2023.

HBO Netherlands was not limited to subscribers of Ziggo, instead, many Dutch cable operators offered HBO Netherlands. However, on September 28, 2016, HBO Netherlands announced that it would cease operations on December 31, 2016. That same day, it was announced that Ziggo had bought exclusive rights to HBO programming.[251]On November 1, 2016, it was announced that Ziggo will offer HBO programming exclusively as part of their newMovies & Seriesservice starting from January 2017.[252]In September 2021, it was reported that Ziggo's rights to HBO programming is set to expire at the end of the year.[253]Ziggo confirmed that its HBO programming rights are set to expire on January 1, 2022, as a result of WarnerMedia launching HBO Max in The Netherlands in 2022. However, some recently aired seasons will remain on theMovies & Seriesservice.[254]
On February 1, 2022, the launch date was officially announced for March 8, 2022.[255]
In Belgium, HBO and Max programing was broadcast through the pay TV operatorsBeTVand Streamz (Telenet).[256][257]
The Max rebranding in the Netherlands took place on June 11, 2024, alongside a soft launch in Belgium, before its full launch on July 1,[152][245]but the "HBO Max" name retained due to trademark conflicts withOmroep MAX, a member of theDutch public broadcasting system, as well as VRT MAX, a streaming platform by theVRT.[258][259]
Turkey and Greece
Plans to introduce HBO Max in certain Eastern European countries where HBO Go was absent, such as Turkey and Greece were announced in October 2021,[260]but these plans were later halted, withVodafoneTV in Greece and various TV operators in Turkey, includingDigiturk, instead getting the rights for various HBO and Max programming.[261][262]
On December 6, 2023,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD) fully acquired the turkish streaming serviceBluTV,[263][264]and on December 5, 2024, it was announced that BluTV would be relaunched as Max sometime in the spring of 2025, as part of WBD's global streaming consolidation strategy.[265]
In Greece, the offer present in Vodafone TV was relaunched as Max on February 20, 2025. Now all Max content is available across all TV packages in Vodafone Greece.[212]
Fox Showcase, an Australian premium television service, began airing HBO original programming in 2012, through a licensed distribution arrangement with subscription television providerFoxtel. Before this, limited HBO content was broadcast through the now-defunctMovie Network, which was founded by HBO (throughTime Warner),Village Roadshow,Metro-Goldwyn-MayerandDisney–ABC International Television. HBO Originals are also available on-demand via Foxtel servicesFoxtel NowandBinge.Sky MoviesinNew Zealandoriginally operated as a joint venture between HBO andSky Network Television. The channel was renamed HBO in 1993; Time Warner later sold its share in the service to Sky in 1998, and it was renamed back to Sky Movies. HBO programming is currently shown by Sky channelHBO, and its subscription streaming serviceNeon, in New Zealand. Deals with some other partners includingFoxtelin Australia andSkyin New Zealand which includes a significant portion of HBO Max's original programming were agreed or renewed between 2019 and 2021.[204][266][210]
Foxtel and Warner Bros Discovery renewed their partnership in February 2023, making HBO and Warner Bros. content available across Foxtel's pay-TV channels as well as its Foxtel Now and Binge streaming services.[207]However, in a press release, Warner Bros. Discovery president and managing director for Western Pacific, James Gibbons, said the renewed deal with Foxtel "also provides optionality for future collaboration, including for our future streaming service", perhaps hinting at plans to launch Max in Australia in the future.[267]
In mid October 2024, Warner Bros Discovery and Sky New Zealand signed a new partnership agreement that would allow Sky to remain the exclusive distributor of bothHBOand Max content in New Zealand from 30 October 2024. Under the partnership, Sky New Zealand would host Max as a hub on its Sky Box, Sky Pod andSky Goplatforms and its Neon streaming service. The SoHo channel would also be revamped as a linear HBO channel featuringHBO Originalcontent.[210][268]
On February 25, 2025,Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)announced that Max would be launched as a standalone service in Australia on March 31, 2025.[269]CEO and President of Global Streaming and Games, JB Perrette, stated that "Australia represents one of our biggest new markets and a significant opportunity to delight even more fans with the incredible stories told by our iconic brands". It will launch with a range of subscription plans, including 'Basic with Ads', although details on pricing and content were not stated.FoxtelandBingewill lose access to mostHBOand Max Originals, but Foxtel subscribers will be provided a 'Basic with Ads' plan at no extra cost if they have a compatible Foxtel IQ box.[270][271]
In June 2021, WarnerMedia appointed a managing director for the launch of HBO Max in eight territories across Southeast Asia and the exploration of the possibilities to launch HBO Max in theIndianmarket.[272]
Warner Bros. Discovery India decided to premiere their HBO Max original programming, including their original films, onAmazon Prime Video,[273]and onDisney+ Hotstar(until 2023) due to a previously established deal in 2016.[274]It later moved toViacom18'sJioCinemaon May 1, 2023.[275][276]On February 14th, 2025, JioCinema merged with Disney+ Hotstar to form JioHotstar which integrates HBO contents that were previously on JioCinema.[277]
Originally, HBO Max was planned to launch in Southeast Asia, but was halted.[49]Instead, it launched as Max in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, Hong Kong, and Taiwan on 19 November 2024, replacing theHBO GoAsia services.[278]
In Japan,U-Nextreached a deal to carry HBO and HBO Max original programs in Japan beginning on April 1, 2021. This replaced a previous deal between HBO andAmazon Prime VideoJapan.[279]This deal between Warner Bros. Discovery and U-Next was renewed in March 2023, making the streaming service the home of HBO content in the country in a "multi-year" deal between the two. On September 18, 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery signed an exclusive partnership agreement with U-Next. The deal will allow Max to launch within the U-Next system featuring a library of more than 2,500 works and 16,000 episodes from 8 brands including HBO, Max Originals,Harry Potter, DC, Warner Bros., Cartoon Network, Discovery Channel, and Animal Planet. It officially launched on September 25, 2024 at 2:00 p.m.[211][280]
OSNcurrently carries HBO content across 22 countries in the Middle East and North Africa region on its linear channels as well as itsOSN+streaming service. An exclusive, multi-year licensing deal was renewed in March 2023, meaning a Max launch is unlikely in this region in the near future.
HBO Max received mixed reception from media observers on launch. The range of available content was generally well received, but many commented on the likelihood of confusion with HBO's other since-deprecated streaming platforms, HBO Go and HBO Now, and the service's higher subscription price compared to other newly launched streaming platforms likeDisney+.[75][309][310]Television critics also expressed frustration that thelibrary of original series(not including its former late night adult content) for sister network Cinemax was not originally available on HBO Max, though much of its output had arrived on the service by the end of 2021.[311]
AT&T announced in July 2020 that HBO Max had nominally achieved 26.6 million subscribers after its first month of operation, including 23.6 million wholesale customers, primarily legacy HBO pay TV subscribers that were covered by new agreements that added access to HBO Max at no extra charge.[312]However, only 4.1 million customers had activated their HBO Max accounts by the same date.[312]The latter figure was seen by many observers as a disappointment, particularly in light of Disney+ having reached 10 million subscribers within a day of launch;The New York Times's media criticBen Smithwrote that WarnerMedia had "badly botched" the launch.[313]
However, AT&T executives contended that it had been a "flawless launch" citing increased customer engagement compared to HBO Now and overall growth in total subscriptions to either HBO or HBO Max (36.3 million, vs. 34.6 million HBO or HBO Now subscribers at the end of 2019), while acknowledging that there was more to do to persuade existing HBO subscribers to start using the HBO Max apps.[314]Executives had previously noted that HBO Max was starting from a different place than other streaming services as it was building on the existing HBO subscriber base, and had to work within the constraints of many of HBO's pre-existing deals (such as those with Amazon and Roku).[315]
In October 2020, AT&T revealed that the number of activated HBO Max subscribers had reached 8.6 million by the end of September, while the number of nominal (eligible) subscribers reached 28.7 million. The total number of HBO / HBO Max subscriptions in the U.S. also increased to 28 million.[316]With an agreement being reached the following month with Amazon (which is reported to have had 5 million HBO subscribers through Prime Video Channels), the number of HBO Max-eligible subscribers is understood to have increased to over 33 million.[188]In September 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery was sued by a shareholder, alleging that WarnerMedia had overstated the number of HBO Max subscribers by including unactivated subscriptions bundled with AT&T services.[317][318]
Upon its launch, it was noted that Max had grouped directors and writers for its films and television series under a singular "creators" credit.[319]TheDirectors Guild of AmericaandWriters Guild of America Westcondemned the move amidst the2023 Hollywood labor disputes. Max announced that they would fix the credits, agreeing with the outcry from the guilds regarding proper credit for its creators, noting the altered credits were a result of "an oversight in the technical transition" from HBO Max to Max.[320]Deadline Hollywoodreported the consolidation was a result of WBD's IT departments creating the "catch all" for the credits to be in place for launch, and that executives, who could have intervened, had been unaware of the single credit until the discourse arose online after its launch. Additionally, it was reported that it would take "weeks" to fix, given the service would need to make the adjustment on each platform.[321]The credits would later be fixed, beginning in late June.[322]

Lilly:
Lana Wachowski(bornLarry Wachowski, June 21, 1965)[1]andLilly Wachowski(bornAndy Wachowski, December 29, 1967)[2]are American film and television directors, writers and producers.[3]The sisters are bothtrans women.[4][5][6]
Together known asthe Wachowskis[a][7](/wəˈtʃaʊski/), the sisters have worked as a writing and directing team through most of their careers. They made their directing debut in 1996 withBoundand achieved fame with their second film,The Matrix(1999), a major box-office success for which they won theSaturn Award for Best Director. They wrote and directed its two sequels,The Matrix ReloadedandThe Matrix Revolutions(both in 2003), and were involved in the writing and production of other works in theMatrixfranchise.
Following the commercial success of theMatrixseries, the Wachowskis wrote and produced the 2005 filmV for Vendetta, an adaptation ofthe graphic novelbyAlan MooreandDavid Lloyd, and in 2008 released the filmSpeed Racer, a live-action adaptation ofthe Japanese anime series. Their next film,Cloud Atlas, based onthe novelbyDavid Mitchelland co-written and co-directed byTom Tykwer, was released in 2012. Their filmJupiter Ascendingand theNetflixseriesSense8, the latter of which they co-created withJ. Michael Straczynski, debuted in 2015; the second season ofSense8ended the series in 2018 and was Lana's first major project without Lilly.[8][9]
Since theseries finaleofSense8, the Wachowskis have been working separately on different projects: Lilly directed, wrote, and executive-produced several episodes ofShowtime'sWork in Progress(2019) with creators Abby McEnany and Tim Mason, while Lana filmedThe Matrix Resurrections, written with Mitchell andAleksandar Hemon, which was released in December 2021.
Lana was born inChicagoin 1965; Lilly was born two and a half years later, in 1967. Their mother, Lynne (néeLuckinbill), was a nurse and painter. Their father, Ron Wachowski, was a businessman ofPolishdescent. Their uncle is an actor andPrimetime Emmy Award-winning producer,Laurence Luckinbill.[2][10]Ron and Lynne died five weeks apart in the late 2010s.[11]Lana and Lilly have two other sisters, Julie and Laura.[12][13]Julie was assistant coordinator for the filmBound;[14]she is a novelist and screenwriter.[15]
The Wachowskis attended the Kellogg Elementary School in Chicago'sBeverlyarea, and graduated fromWhitney Young High School, known for its performing arts and science curriculum, in 1983 and 1985.[16]Former classmates recall them playingDungeons & Dragonsand working in the school's theater and TV program.[16]
Lana went toBard College, in New York state; Lilly attendedEmerson College, inBoston. Each dropped out before graduating, and they ran a house-painting and construction business in Chicago.
Beginning in 1993, they wrote several issues ofEctokidforMarvel Comics'Razorlineimprint (created by horror novelistClive Barker), which were credited to Lana.[17][16]They also wrote for the seriesClive Barker's HellraiserandClive Barker's Nightbreedfor Marvel'sEpic Comicsimprint.
In the mid-1990s, they went into film writing, including the script forAssassinsin 1994, which was directed byRichard Donnerand released in 1995.Warner Bros.bought the script and included two more pictures in the contract.[18]Donner had their script "totally rewritten" byBrian Helgeland[19]and the Wachowskis tried unsuccessfully to remove their names from the film.[12]They say the experience gave them the perspective that they should become directors or "[they will] never survive as writers in this town".[20]
Their next project was the 1996neo-noirthrillerBound, for which they wrote the script and made their debut as directors. The film was well received for its style and craft,[21]and was noted as one of the first mainstream films to feature a same-sex relationship without it being central to the plot.[22]Taking advantage of the positive buzz, the Wachowskis asked to direct their next picture,The Matrix.[18]
They completedThe Matrix, ascience fictionaction film, in 1999. The movie starsKeanu ReevesasNeo, a hacker recruited by a rebellion to aid them in the fight against machines who have taken over the world and placed humanity inside asimulated realitycalled "the Matrix".Laurence Fishburne,Carrie-Anne Moss,Hugo WeavingandJoe Pantolianoalso star. The movie was a critical and commercial hit for Warner Bros. It won four Academy Awards, including for"Best Visual Effects"for popularizing thebullet timevisual effect.The Matrixcame to be amajor influence for action moviesand has appeared in several "greatest science fiction films" lists.[23][24][25]In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in theNational Film Registryby theLibrary of Congressfor being "culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant".[26]
After its success, the Wachowskis directed two sequelsback-to-back,The Matrix ReloadedandThe Matrix Revolutions, both released in 2003.The Matrix Reloadedreceived positive critical reception, although not on the level of the original.[27]It became a major box office hit, retaining the spot of the highest-grossingR-rated filmfor over a decade (until 2016'sDeadpool).[28]The Matrix Revolutionsreceived a mixed critical reception and performed only moderately in the box office. Although profitable, it was slightly less so compared to the original film.[29][30]
During production of the first film, the Wachowskis and Spencer Lamm, who ran the film's official website, developed comics based on the setting of the film, which were published free of charge on the website. These and a few short stories were released in three series from 1999 to 2003, with several of them (along with new material) collected in two print volumes in 2003 and 2004. The Wachowskis themselves contributed "Bits and Pieces", a prequel to the movie that explains the origins of the Matrix, featuring illustrations byGeof Darrow, the movie's conceptual designer. Other writers and artists that contributed to the series includeNeil Gaiman,Dave Gibbons,Paul Chadwick,Ted McKeever,Poppy Z. Brite, andSteve Skroce.
After Lilly Wachowski came out as transgender, she encouraged looking back on her and Lana's works "through the lens of our transness", saying that the themes of identity, self-image and transformation are apparent inThe Matrix.[31]
The Wachowskis' next feature film wasV for Vendetta, an adaptation ofAlan MooreandDavid Lloyd's graphic novelof the same name, starringNatalie PortmanandHugo Weaving. They wrote and produced the film withMatrixproducerJoel Silver, who had previously purchased the film rights to the graphic novel. The Wachowskis offered the film toJames McTeigue, the first assistant director ofThe Matrixtrilogy, as his directorial debut. Moore did not participate in the production, as he was disappointed by previous Hollywood adaptations of his work, and disagreed with differences between his graphic novel and the screenplay. Following a statement to the press by Silver that Moore was supposedly excited to learn more about the movie, Moore demanded that Silver retract it, and had his own name removed from the credits when he did not.[32]The film's controversial storyline and themes have been both criticized and praised by sociopolitical groups. It was released in 2005 and was well received critically; it was a box office success but did not rank on the scale ofThe Matrixfilms.[33]The film popularized the image of theGuy Fawkes mask, as the version designed byDavid Lloydfor the graphic novel and used in the movie was adopted as a symbol by the onlinehacktivistgroupAnonymoustwo years later.[34]
In 2006, Silver had the Wachowskis and McTeigue hired to revampThe Invasionfor Warner Bros. The studio was disappointed in the original cut of the film by directorOliver Hirschbiegeland hired the Wachowskis to rewrite a portion of the script and add new action scenes, which McTeigue directed. The film, the fourth adaptation of the novelThe Body Snatchers, was released in 2007 and was not a critical or box office success. The Wachowskis and McTeigue are not credited on the film.[35]
The Wachowskis returned to directing withSpeed Racer(2008) which starredEmile Hirsch. The film, which was again produced by Silver, was an adaptation of a1960s Japanese manga seriesoriginally calledMach GoGoGo, which had previously been adapted as ananime television seriesin 1967. The Wachowskis were attracted to the project because the series was the first anime they had watched, and they wanted to make a family-friendly film for their nieces and nephews to enjoy.[36][37]In an effort to simulate the look of anime in live action, the Wachowskis had cinematographerDavid Tattersallshoot the moviedigitallyon adigital backlotwith the intention of adding extensive visual effects in post-production. The movie was considered a critical andcommercial failure.[38]While its special effects were noted as outstanding, the storyline is considered lacking.[39]It was nominated in the category of "Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel" for the29th Golden Raspberry Awards. Its box office gross was $93 million compared to a production budget of $120 million. Since then, critics periodically have put the film on lists of underrated orcult films.[40][41][42][43][44]
The Wachowskis' next film project wasNinja Assassin, amartial arts filmstarringRain, which was released in 2009. It was inspired by Rain's fighting scene inSpeed Racer.[45]It was produced by the Wachowskis in their last involvement with Silver, and directed by McTeigue. The screenplay was written by Matthew Sand andJ. Michael Straczynski, whom the Wachowskis called six weeks before filming to ask him for a total rewrite completed within a week, because they were dissatisfied with the earlier drafts and were running out of time.[46]Ninja Assassinreceived negative reviews and performed lukewarmly in the theaters but respectably on home video.[47][48][49][50]
Their next directorial outing wasCloud Atlas, which was adapted fromDavid Mitchell's2004 novelof the same name and starred anensemble castwhich includedTom HanksandHalle Berry.Cloud Atlaswas written and directed in collaboration with German filmmakerTom Tykwer, to whom the Wachowskis had introduced the novel several years earlier. The filmmakers failed to secure funding from a studio (save for $20 million by Warner Bros.) and the film was produced independently after much trouble.[51][52]With a budget of over $100 million it was noted as the most expensive independent movie to that date and the first attempt at a German blockbuster.[53]The movie opened at the37th annual Toronto International Film Festivalin September 2012 to acclaim and received a loud and lengthy standing ovation.[54][55][56]In its general release a month later, it received polarized reviews and eventually appeared in both "Best Film" and "Worst Film" lists. Overall reviews were mixed to positive.[57]The film received many nominations and awards, particularly for its technical aspects, including 10 nominations for theGerman Film Award, out of which it won five. It also received fiveSaturn Awardnominations, out of which it won two. David Mitchell liked the script ofCloud Atlas, spent some time on the set (including filming a cameo), and had a positive impression about the result.[58][59]According to the Wachowskis the movie was the hardest of their films to make, the one they are the most proud of, and the one they have been told has touched people's lives the most. They believeCloud Atlaswill be the film for which they will be remembered.[20][60][61]
The Wachowskis subsequently produced and directedJupiter Ascending, an originalspace operascreenplay they wrote. The film was released in 2015.[62]It starsChanning TatumandMila Kunis, and features the Wachowskis' regular collaboratorsJohn Gaetaon visual effects andKym Barretton costumes. According toDeadline, the financial and critical failure ofJupiter Ascendingcaused their business relationship with Warner Bros, that began withThe Matrixfranchise, to be terminated.[63]
Their next project was theNetflixscience fiction drama seriesSense8, created and written with J. Michael Straczynski.Sense8features an internationalensemble castand was shot in multiple cities around the world. The Wachowskis directed most of the episodes of the first season, with the rest being handled by McTeigue, Tykwer, and their go-to visual effects supervisor on their movies, Dan Glass, in his directorial debut.[64]The first season premiered in 2015 to generally positive reviews, particularly for the scale of the production and the presentation of diverse andLGBTcharacters and themes, winning theGLAAD Media AwardforOutstanding Drama Series.[65][66]It also received aPrimetime Emmy Awardnomination forOutstanding Original Main Title Theme Music.[67]After the first season, Lilly took a break from it, for what turned out to be the remainder of the series. AChristmas specialwas released on December 23, 2016, with the remainder of the show's second season released in May 2017.[68]Subsequently, the third season was canceled, andSense8concluded with a two-hour finale which aired in June 2018.
In June 2016, theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciencesinvited the Wachowskis to join its ranks.[69]
In May 2019, it was reported that Lilly would co-write, and co-showrunthe eight-episode first season of thedrama-comedyseriesWork in Progress, created by Abby McEnany and Tim Mason forShowtime.[70]The series premiered in December 2019.[71]In January 2020, the series was renewed for a 10-episode second season, with which Lilly would continue to be involved.[72]
In August 2019, it was announced that Lana would be returning to write, direct and produceThe Matrix Resurrections, the fourth installment of theMatrixseries, with Reeves and Moss also reprising their roles; it marks the first film made by only one of the Wachowskis. Lana wrote the script with David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemon.[73]The film was released in December 2021.[74]
In February 2024,Colliderannounced that Lily would directTrash Mountain, a film about a younggayman returning from Chicago to ruralMissourito deal with the aftermath of his hoarder father's death. The film, Lilly's first directorial effort sinceJupiter Ascending, will starCaleb Hearon, be written by Hearon and Ruby Caster and will be produced byColin Trevorrow, Eddie Vaisman and Julia Lebedev.[75]
In April 2024, it was announced that Warner Bros. was developing a newMatrixinstallment withDrew Goddardattached to write and direct, for which Lana will serve as an executive producer.[76]
J. Michael Straczynski, who has worked with the Wachowskis onNinja AssassinandSense8, has said that the sisters told him they were reading his column on scriptwriting for theWriter's Digestmagazine, for inspiration and pointers.[77]Straczynski contributed to the magazine from 1981 to 1991.[78]
In 1998, in the context of explaining how they got their start in filmmaking, the Wachowskis mentionedRoger Corman's bookHow I Made A Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime, and indicated, with laughter, that they liked his movies, and began by wanting to "make a low-budget horror movie".[79]In the same interview they stated that they felt flattered, after their first film, by comparisons others had made between them and theCoen brothers, who had "made five, maybe six great movies..." at that time.[79]
Speaking to Bernard Weintraub ofThe New York Timesin April 1999, the Wachowskis mentioned explicitly that they prepared for their firstMatrixproduction by studying the works ofJohn Woo"and other Hong Kong filmmakers", as well as reading and rereading Homer'sOdyssey, and studying the works ofJohn Huston,Stanley Kubrick,Fritz Lang,George Lucas,Ridley Scott, andBilly Wilder.[80]
Mark Miller, writing inWiredin 2003, also listedHomer,Hermann Hesse,Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and philosopherCornel West.[16]In an interview withGadflyin 1998 (after their first movie), the Wachowskis reiterated their influence by or enjoyment of Huston (e.g.Treasure of the Sierra Madre) and Wilder (e.g.,Sunset BoulevardandLost Weekend), and added to these the impacts ofAlfred Hitchcock(e.g.Strangers on a TrainandPsycho),Roman Polanski(e.g.Repulsion), andFrancis Ford Coppola(theGodfathermovies, andThe Conversation).[79]
Ken Wilberhas been cited as an influence.[81]
The Wachowskis admit to a love for telling multi-part stories. "Because we grew up on comic books and theTolkientrilogy, one of the things we're interested in is bringing serial fiction to cinema," Lana has said. Lilly says: "We think movies are fairly boring and predictable. We want to screw with audiences' expectations."[82]In terms of themes expressed in their body of work, Lana has cited "the inexplicable nature of the universe [being] in constant dialogue with our own consciousness and our consciousness actually affect[ing] the inexplicable nature of the universe",[83]"interconnectivity and about truth beneath the surface",[84]"the paradox of choice and choicelessness",[85]"transcendence ... transcending archetypal boxes, stereotypes", "race ... an important component" and "gender ... it's one of our most significant cultural subjects".[86]
The Wachowskis cited the art of comic book artistGeof Darrowas an influence on the look ofThe Matrix. Also, they said thatGhost in the Shell,Ninja Scroll, andAkirawere anime that inspired them, saying "in anime, one thing that they do that we tried to bring to our film was a juxtaposition of time and space in action beats".
The Wachowskis citedStanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odysseyas a major influence forCloud Atlas.[87]They first saw the film when they were ten and seven, respectively.[12]
Lana has most been influenced by2001: A Space Odyssey,Blade Runner,Ma vie en rose, andMy Neighbor Totoro.[88]Both Wachowskis are fans of theGhost in the Shell,Akira,Wicked City,Ninja ScrollandFist of the North Staranimefilms.[89]
None of thehome videoreleases of their films feature anydeleted scenes. Lana says that despite often having to cut scenes from their movies, they do not want to include deleted scenes in such releases, as this would suggest that their films suffer from incompleteness. They love their finished products and believe them complete.[90][91]For the same reason, they have not released their films for home video withdirector'sorextended cuts. They also avoid recordingaudio commentarytracks, having participated only on the track recorded for theLaserDiscofBound. The sisters say they learned that offering an interpretation of their films means that viewers will be less likely to express their own interpretation.[92][93]
The Wachowskis frequently hire the same basicfilm crewto make their movies. Lana says they do it in part to ensure a positive environment. "It's like family. Everyone is very respectful of each other," says Lana.[94]They used the same practice while selecting thetelevision crewfor theirNetflixshow,Sense8.
Some of their most notable frequent collaborators are:
(Season 2)
DuringThe Matrix Reloaded,The Matrix Revolutions,The AnimatrixandEnter the Matrixproduction, the Wachowskis created EON Entertainment (not to be confused withEon Productions), their production company to coordinate and direct all involved partners.[140]It is also where the films were edited together, after the variousFXvendors sent their finished work.[141]EON's internal VFX team, ESC, did a number of visual effect shots for the twoMatrixsequels and coordinated the other vendors.[141]ESC was shut down in summer 2004.[142]Anarchos Productions (credited inCloud Atlasas Anarchos Pictures)[143]is their production company[144][145]that has been billed for all their films starting withV for Vendettaup to the first season ofSense8.[146]In the second season and following Lilly's break from the show, Anarchos is replaced by Venus Castina Productions,[147]a production company created by Lana Wachowski and her wife Karin Winslow.[148]Venus Castinais an epithet of the Roman goddess Venus, who in this form, was supposedly associated with "the yearnings of feminine souls locked up in male bodies". In theSense8series finale, the real bookVenus Castina: Famous Female Impersonators Celestial and Humanmakes an appearance as the unlikely object that brought a lesbian couple together;[149]according to Lana and the actresses that portray the couple, the duo have been based on Lana and Karin.[150][151][152]
Kinowerksis their pre- and post-production and effects studio, based in theRavenswoodneighborhood of Chicago.[153]It has been acclaimed for itsgreen-friendlydesign, including solar panels, a planted roof, countertops and floors made of recycled materials, plug-in car stations, a water reuse and filtration system, skylights, and a pneumatic elevator.[154][155]Roger Ebertwas invited to watch a restored print ofThe Godfatherin theKinowerksfacilities and met the Wachowskis,[156]but he was oblivious to the fact the studio belonged to them. According to theChicago Tribune's Christopher Pirelli, the facility is very low-key: "an industrial building that appears neither old nor especially new" and "It could be an upscale dentist's office" while the "inside is rather unexpected" and has numerous mementos of past film projects.[157]On October 22, 2018, the Wachowskis announced their plans to close and listKinowerksfor $5 million.[155]
In 2003, they createdBurlyman Entertainmentand released comic books based onThe Matrix[158][159]as well as two original bi-monthly series:
The Wachowskis' first script was a thriller calledCarnivore.[20]It has been described as "aCorman-style, low-budget horror movie that dealt withcannibalismor, more specifically, rich people being eaten by cannibals".[80]The writing was well received and the script achieved notice for the duo;[12][80]however, interest in making the movie was low, for executives told them: "This is a bad idea. I can't make this. I'm rich."[80]Years later, on April 6, 1999, a week afterThe Matrixopened in American theaters,VarietyreportedTrimarkwas looking to buy the script and were in talks withGeorge A. Romeroto direct it with production scheduled to begin in August.[162]In April 2001, news of the Wachowskis producing it forLionsgateand looking for a director surfaced again,[163]and in August 2003 a second time, with their go-to cinematographerBill Poperumored to be making his directorial debut with it.[164]The film ultimately went unproduced.[12]
Another two of their earliest scripts which were never produced werePlastic Man, based on the DC Comicssuperhero of the same nameandVertical Runbased on the book of the same name byJoseph R. Garber.[16][165][166]
After completingThe Matrix, the Wachowskis were looking to make an animated adaptation ofFrank Miller'sHard Boiledgraphic novel.[167]The comic was drawn by Geof Darrow, the conceptional designer ofThe Matrixand later its sequels. The project didn't move forward because Miller didn't want it to be an animated film.[168]
In November 2000,Varietyreported the Wachowskis would produce, co-create and direct second unit on a newConan the Barbarianmovie for Warner Bros. which was to be written and directed byJohn Miliusand which could seeArnold Schwarzeneggermake an appearance. The Wachowskis were planning to juggle their pre-production involvement on the movie and work onThe Matrixsequels at the same time.[169]In January 2004 it was reported that development onKing Conan: Crown of Ironhad stalled for years because of the Wachowskis' involvement inThe Matrixsequels and now that the movies were complete they decided to abandon the project of their own volition because of the frequent clashes they had experienced with Milius concerning the tone and direction of the movie.[170]Lana once suggestedConan the Barbarianas her favorite movie based on comics, to which Lilly also responded enthusiastically.[167]
In 2008,[171]the Wachowskis were producing forMadhousean animated film based on theircomic book company'sShaolin Cowboy,[172][173]titledShaolin Cowboy in The Tomb of Doom.[168]The feature is co-directed by the comic book's creator Geof Darrow andSeiji Mizushima, a Japanese director.[171]When the American financiers backed out, the film was left half-finished and in need of $3 million. Darrow does not believe that the required amount of money to finish it will be found.[174]
In December 2009,Arianna Huffingtontweeted pictures of herself on the set of "a Wachowskis movie on Iraq from the perspective of the future".[175]CHUD.comreported what the Wachowskis were doing was camera tests and shooting of test footage on theRed digital camerafor a future movie, but not shooting the movie itself.[176]In March 2010,Jesse Venturasaid he had also shot for the project right before Huffington. Both of them were dressed as people from roughly 100 years in the future and they were asked to improvise without a script about theIraq War.[177]In May 2010,Deadlinereported the movie was going to be a hard-R story that would begin in the future but move back to the then-current war in Iraq and center on the homosexual relationship between an American soldier and an Iraqi. The Wachowskis completed the script and were searching for funding to direct it.[178]In July 2010, the movie was reported to have begun casting under the codenameCN9(orCN-9),[179]and in August 2010 the full name was revealed asCobalt Neural 9.[180]In September 2010,Vultureposted additional details about the script and revealed the movie would be told infound footage-stylefrom the perspective ofdigital archaeologistsfrom the future. An estimated $20 million budget was reported although they were told a studio would "never, ever" finance it but perhaps the Wachowskis could do it themselves.[181]In December 2010,The Hollywood Reporterwrote thatSalman RushdieandCornel Westhad also shot talking head sequences along with the previously reported involvement of Huffington and Ventura but the Wachowskis were looking into other movies because of troubles financing it.[182]In September 2012,Aleksandar Hemonwrote about the making ofCloud Atlasand recalled he too was one of the people the Wachowskis had invited to interview in December 2009, to help inspire the script ofCobalt Neural 9.[12]The last update on the film was in October 2012, when the Wachowskis were asked about it and they responded they were still keen to make it, because they had invested both financially ($5 million) and emotionally into it, even if that ends up being in a different form than film.[183]
In December 2010,The Hollywood Reporterwrote that the Wachowskis were planning to direct for Warner Bros. a script of theirs calledHood, which was a modern adaptation of theRobin Hoodlegend. The Wachowskis were said to be reaching out to actors, includingWill Smith.[182]
Lilly married Alisa Blasingame in 1991.[184]In 2016, Lilly mentioned having a boyfriend.[185]In 2019, she said Mickey Ray Mahoney was now her partner and that they had moved in together.[186][187]Mahoney is an adjunct professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and atrans man.[185]
Lana married Thea Bloom in 1993. Following the release ofThe Matrix, Lana began attending the Los AngelesBDSMclub The Dungeon, where she met Karin Winslow, who worked there as adominatrixunder the name Ilsa Strix. Bloom divorced Lana in 2002 after discovering the relationship.[188]Lana and Karin made their first public appearance together at the premiere ofThe Matrix Reloadedin 2003, and married in 2009.[12][189]Winslow is a board member of the Chicago House and Social Service Agency.[190][191]
Raised by a "hardcoreatheist" father and an "ex-CatholicturnedShamanist" mother,[83]the duo once described their religious beliefs asnon-denominational.[90]Lana is avegetarian.[192]During theDemocratic Party presidential primaries of 2016,The Advocateposted a video message of Lana talking about why she would be supportingBernie Sanders.[193]
Rumors that Lana Wachowski wastransitioningspread in the early 2000s, though neither sister spoke directly on the subject at the time.[194]In 2003,Gothamistreported the possible transition.[195]In a 2007 interview,Joel Silver, the producer of numerous Wachowski films, said that the rumors concerning the transition were "all untrue", saying that "they just don't do interviews, so people make things up." Crew members working onSpeed Racersaid similar things.[196]
Lana publicly revealed her transition afterSpeed Racer's release in 2008[197]and by at least December 2010, after which trade magazines and newspapers began to refer to her as "Lana Wachowski",[182][198]and to the duo as "Andy and Lana Wachowski".[199]On some documents her name is shown as Laurenca Wachowski.[200]In July 2012, Lana made her first public appearance after transitioning, in a video discussing the creative process behindCloud Atlas.[201]Lana is the first major Hollywood director to come out as transgender.[4]
In a September 2012 interview withAleksandar HemonofThe New Yorker, Lana described an incident in third grade at her Catholic school where she was hesitant to join the boys' line and unconsciously accepted herself as belonging to the girls' line.[202]
In October 2012, Lana Wachowski received theHuman Rights Campaign's Visibility Award.[203]In her acceptance speech, she revealed that once during her youth, she had considered suicide because of her feelings of confusion about hergender identity. Her acceptance speech was one of the longest public appearances by either of the reclusive sisters. Lana said that, although she and Lilly had not publicly commented on her transitioning during the previous decade, it was not because she was ashamed of it, nor had she kept it a secret from her family and friends. Rather, she stated, the two are generally shy about the news media and prefer to maintain their privacy. Comparing media exposure to losing one's virginity as an irreversible event that only happens once, the Wachowskis had tried to stay out of the public eye. They feared losing their privacy and the ability to go to public places without being noticed and harassed as celebrities.
Explaining her decision to appear at the HRC event, Lana said:
There are some things we do for ourselves, but there are some things we do for others. I am here because when I was young, I wanted very badly to be a writer, I wanted to be a filmmaker, but I couldn't find anyone like me in the world and it felt like my dreams were foreclosed simply because my gender was less typical than others. If I can be that person for someone else, then the sacrifice of my private civic life may have value.[204]
In February 2014, Lana received the Freedom Award fromEquality Illinoisat their annual gala in Chicago.[205][206][207]
In March 2016, Lilly Wachowski also came out as a transgender woman, issuing a statement to theWindy City Timesafter a visit from a reporter from theDaily Mailnewspaper who had attempted to get an interview with her about it.[5][6][208][209][210]In that article, she said, "I am one of the lucky ones. Having the support of my family and the means to afford doctors and therapists has given me the chance to actually survive this process. Transgender people without support, means and privilege do not have this luxury. And many do not survive."[211]
Her first public appearance since beginning transitioning was a few weeks later, at the27th GLAAD Media Awards, where she accepted an award for her Netflix seriesSense8for Outstanding Drama Series.[212]She said, "I didn't feel obligated to be here, but I wanted to do something. And it's serendipitous that the awards were a couple of weeks later and our show was up for an award."[213]
The Wachowskis are self-proclaimedgamers. As teens, they spent their weekends in the attic playingDungeons & Dragons.[12]They liken the process of their gaming sessions to their process of filmmaking. Along with some of their friends, they wrote a 350-pagerole-playing gameof their own calledHigh Adventure.
On the video game front, they had been exchanging letters withHideo Kojimaand met him during aFamitsuinterview in late 1999.[214]Metal Gear Solidwas the first video game they played after finishing work onThe Matrix. Candidates for an adaptation of the firstMatrixmovie to video game form included Kojima,BungieandShiny Entertainment, whoseMessiahPC gameimpressed them.[215][216]Shiny'sDavid Perry, who ultimately had his company develop and collaborate with them on theEnter the MatrixandThe Matrix: Path of Neovideo games, was impressed with their familiarity with the medium; this proved helpful during development.[217]The Wachowskis owned both aPlayStation 2andXboxvideo game consoleand played several games such asSplinter CellandHalo 2.[218]They reportedly destroyed their Xbox during aHalodeathmatch.[215]ActorCollin Chourecounts an instance of visiting their office and finding them playing video games on the floor.[219]Lilly is a fan of theDeath Jr.PlayStation Portablegame.[220]
Asked about their feelings about turning the tightly controlledMatrixsaga to the unpredictable form of anMMORPGwithThe Matrix Online, the duo appeared enthusiastic about the nature and possibilities of video games:
The "vagaries of an MMO where unpredictable player behavior is the rule," is the reason for doing it. Our films were never intended for a passive audience. There are enough of those kinds of films being made. We wanted our audience to have to work, to have to think, to have to actually participate to enjoy them. This may be because while we enjoy movies, we also spend a lot of time (as in crack-den amounts of time) gaming.
Gaming engages your mind actively whereas most genre films (the films we tend to watch) are designed to provoke as little thinking as possible. Consider why the films in which everyone knows exactly what is going to happen are the films that make the most money.
Yet the fact thatThe Matrixfilms are three of the most successful adult films in history (despite of what much of the media would have us believe), suggests that there are other people like us. Those are the people, the people who thought about it, who worked at it, who we ultimately made the trilogy for and it now makes perfect sense to us that they should inherit the storyline. For us, the idea of watching our baby evolve inside the virtual bubble-world of this new radically developing medium, which has in our opinion the potential of combining the best attributes of films and games, of synthesizing reality TV with soap opera, RPGs and [Mortal Kombat], is fantastically exciting.
The Art of the Matrixbook credits them for including their screenplay and additional art. The Wachowskis also wrote an introduction to the 2005 publishedVol. 2: Tag[242]trade paperbackofEx Machinacomic book, being big fans of it.[243]Additionally Lana Wachowski wrote the introduction to the 2012 publishedNo Straight Lines: Four Decades of Queer Comicscollection ofLGBTQcomic book stories.[244]
Additionally classifying themselves as "lifelong rabid Bulls fans" they created a revamped introductory animation forChicago Bullsto open the2006–2007 regular season.[245]

I would probably have become a writer wherever I lived, but would I have become the same writer if I'd spent the last six years in London, orCape Town, orMoose Jaw, on an oil rig or in the circus? This is my answer to myself.

Herbreakthrough rolecame when she playedTrinityin the science-fiction thrillerThe Matrix(1999). Her role demanded extreme acrobatic actions, and she underwent a three-hour physical test during casting. The film grossed over US$460 million worldwide and was highly acclaimed by critics, some of whom have considered it one of the greatest science-fiction films ever made.[4][5]Moss asserted that prior to being cast inThe Matrix, she had "no career". It launched Moss into international recognition and transformed her career; in aNew York Daily Newsinterview, she stated, "The Matrixgave me so many opportunities. Everything I've done since then has been because of that experience. It gave me so much."[6]Moss was nominated for aSaturn Award for Best Actress, and for theMTV Movie Award for Breakthrough Female Performance.
Moss had four film releases in 2000—Chocolat,Red Planet,The Crew, andMemento. In the romantic comedyChocolat, she took on the role of Caroline Clairmont, a cold, devoutly pious woman living in a French village. As part of an overall positive response towards the film,The New York Timesremarked that Moss, "as an upright widowed mother swathed in mournful baby blue, radiates glimmers of hurt; she shows it's not easy to keep up such a front."[7]The film made US$152 million at the international box office.[8]The science-fiction thrillerRed Planethad her play the commander and leader of a rescue mission toMars.A.V. Clubfelt that Moss was "largely reduced to worrying while modelling a series of tight-fitting space fashions".[9]Despite a US$80 million budget, the film only grossed US$33 million worldwide.[10]She appeared as detective Olivia Neal in the crimeblack comedyThe Crew, directed byMichael Dinner.
InChristopher Nolan'sneo-noirpsychological thrillerMemento, she portrayed a manipulative bartender who meets a man suffering fromanterograde amnesia.

Nolan decided to cast Moss as Natalie, saying, "She added an enormous amount to the role of Natalie that wasn't on the page".[11]The film became asleeper hit, being acclaimed by critics and earning US$39.7 million over a US$9 million budget.[12][13]She won theIndependent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Femalefor her performance.

It's pretty spectacular".[18]She provided voiceovers for video game and animated spin-offs of the films.
In 2005, Moss starred in the little-seen thrillerSuspect ZeroasFBIagent Fran Kulok, and was part of anensemble castin the independent dramedyThe Chumscrubber, which premiered at theSundance Film Festival. Moss next appeared in the zombie comedyFido(2006), playing a housewife in a 1950s-esquealternate universewhere radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies. She noted the "very rich" and "very visual" script for the film, and became drawn to the project for its "underlying messages about control and domination".[6][19]Fidowas an opening night film at theToronto International Film Festival,[20]and received largely favourable reviews, with theLos Angeles Timescalling it a "crafty mixture ofGeorge A. RomeroandDouglas Sirk."[21]Moss played the neighbour of anautisticwoman in the small-scale romantic dramaSnow Cake(2006). It was released in selected theatres, to positive reviews from critics.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
