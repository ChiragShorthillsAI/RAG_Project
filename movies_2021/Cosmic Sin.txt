In the year 2031, humanity establishes its firstspace colonyonMars. By 2042, "the Alliance"world governmenthas been formed and quantum propulsion technology allows humanity to travel beyond theSolar System. The Mars colony fails in 2281 and the Alliance controls three colonies: Earth, Zafdie, and Ellora. In 2519, Zafdie attempts to secede from the Alliance. During the ensuing war,GeneralJames Ford drops a quantum bomb ("Q-bomb") on the rebel colony, killing 70 million people. Ford is dishonorably discharged from the Alliance military and gains thesobriquetof "the Blood General." His wife, Doctor Lea Goss, leaves him.
In 2524, miners of the Vander Mining Corp stationed on planet 4217LYA (Heracles System) encounter unseen aliens and Captain Juda Sayle reports an "FC incident" to Alliance Command. On Earth, General Eron Ryle is notified of the incident and orders that Goss and Ford be brought to him.
At a local bar, Dash meets with Ford to discuss a potential job. A fight between them and civilians is interrupted byCommanderMarcus Bleck, who passes on Ryle's request for Ford's counsel. Ford eventually agrees upon the promise of him being reinstated and his pension restored. At McMillian Airfieldmilitary base, Ford and Dash meet with Goss and Ryle. Survivors of the FC incident are brought in for quarantine and questioning but turn hostile and kill base personnel. The survivors appear to be infected, ignore attempts at communication, appear unfamiliar with human technology (exceptfirearms), and "infect" several base personnel, who also become hostile. The infected attempt to board a transport ship but are eliminated by Ryle, Ford, Dash, and several other soldiers.
While the Alliance Senate debates, Ryle authorizes Operation Cosmic Sin – with a strike team consisting of himself, Ford, Dash, Goss, Bleck,SpecialistBraxton (Ryle's nephew), and technicianCorporalArdene – to launch a counterstrike against the aliens. Ardene reports that atachyonpulse was released by one of the infected miners during the base attack, which will allow the aliens to know Earth's location in hours. The team is outfitted with small arms,Icarus suitsdesigned for combat and space environments, and a Q-bomb. The team plans to travel to the Ellora colony viaquantum jump, where Alliance forces have shot down an alien ship. They intend to recover it and analyze the cosmic radiation to locate the alien's home planet, then destroy it with the Q-bomb.
The team arrives in the middle of a battle between Alliance and alien spacefleets, and is forced to conduct anorbital dropthrough the space debris. Ryle, Goss, Ford, and Dash go missing during the drop, and the remainder of the team comes under enemy fire almost immediately after landing, with Bleck being critically wounded. Elloran survivors rescue the team and, after verifying the team is free of infection, the survivors reveal the aliens have invaded the planet and the area is swarming with alien troops and infected humans. The survivors offer to treat Bleck at their outpost's medbay, and Ardene goes with them. Meanwhile, Braxton, accompanied bysniperSol Cantos, proceeds to the downed alien ship. While analyzing the ship's radiation, Braxton's Icarus suit reports Ford as alive. He and Sol Cantos recover Ford, who experiences visions of the aliens and Goss whileconcussed, and they reach the Alliance outpost. Ardene views video recordings that reveal the aliens are ahive mindthatparasitically procreatesby infecting victims, who then fall under their control.
Braxton gives the coordinates of the alien's home planet to Ardene, who reports the tachyon interference generated by the aliens means they cannot travel to the coordinates without first getting into orbit. Meanwhile, Ford consoles thenmercy killsthe mortally wounded Bleck. Dash is revealed to have survived and made his way to the outpost.
Ardene discovers the aliens have built a stabilized quantum space gate near Ellora that will allow the alien armada, currently in the Sigea galaxy[a], to invade theMilky Wayin force. The survivors plan to collapse the gateway with the Q-bomb by firing it via the outpost's orbital cannon. While prepping the orbital cannon, Ardene receives a signal from Ryle, who has survived in orbit, albeit with his Icarus suit damaged and unfit forreentry. He volunteers to position himself on the gateway and trigger his suit's self-destruct to close the gate after the Q-bomb passes through.
The aliens converge on the outpost and speak through an infected Goss, mocking Ford, preaching the superiority of "the Sigea"[b], and offering the chance for humankind's assimilation or death. After Dash replies with a simple "no," the Sigea begin their attack while Goss boards a Sigea ship. Ford latches onto the ship and later confronts Goss as she prepares to cross via the completed space gate. With the orbital gun charged, Ardene loads the Q-bomb into a missile and fires it at the gate. Goss intercepts the Q-bomb missile in astasis field, blows Ford into space, and crosses to join the assembled Sigea fleet, inadvertently releasing the bomb from the stasis field in the process.
Ryle positions himself on the space gate and, unable to trigger his suit's self-destruct, provides a target reference for the orbital gun. Ardene, with Braxton's reluctant blessing, fires the gun on Ryle's position, killing him and destroying the gate. The Q-bomb detonates, resulting in ablack holethat destroys the Sigea's fleet and homestar system. Braxton, stricken with grief, kills the Sigea's field commander on Ellora.
Back on Earth, seven days after first contact, Braxton, Ardene, Sol Cantos, Dash, and Ford morosely celebrate in a bar as the Alliance Senate proudly declares that the remaining Sigea have unconditionally surrendered. Ford takes ashot, sadly reminisces about Goss, and then abruptly leaves the bar.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 6% of 34 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 2.8/10. The website's consensus reads: "Let he who is withoutCosmic Sincast the first stone—and possibly use it to rouse Bruce Willis from the slumber he seems to be in throughout this dreadful sci-fi blunder."[15]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 9 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating "overwhelming dislike".[16]
Christy LemireofRogerEbert.comgave the film a zero-star negative review and wrote, "To suggest that Bruce Willis is phoning in his performance inCosmic Sinwould be an insult to telephone communication, which can be an effective means of conveying important information and genuine emotion." Lemire called the film "baffling and boring" and commented: "Worst of all,Cosmic Sinisn’t even a bad B-movie in an interesting way."[17]
Noel Murray of theLos Angeles Timeswrote that while the film did have some "genuinely impressive special effects sequences" and an ambitious screenplay, it was "pretty tedious" and clichéd. The reviewer commented that while Willis only had minimal screen time in most of his recent pictures, the "good news" inCosmic Sinwas that roughly half of the action directly involved him; however, "The bad news is that he’s somehow more lackluster than usual—something that would seem to be impossible given his recent run." Murray also noted that the film "perks up" when Frank Grillo appears on screen, but that Grillo's screen time was too limited, making him "the Bruce Willis of this movie – offering little more than another recognizable face to put on the poster."[18]
Bruce Williswas nominated for his performance in this movie, along with all his other 2021 performances, in the category "Worst Performance by Bruce Willis in a 2021 Movie" at theGolden Raspberry Awards. The category was later rescinded after he announced his retirement from acting due toaphasia.[19][20]
