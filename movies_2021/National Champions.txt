In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014 (the "S" standing for Simonds, the company's founder; the "T" standing forTPG Growth, whose managing partner McGlashan helped launch the company; and the "X" standing for "secret project"),[2]with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[3][4]Investors in the company includedHony Capital,Tencent,PCCW, TPG Growth,RTL GroupandLiberty Global. Individual investors includeGigi Pritzker,Beau Wrigley, andDominic Ng.[5][6][7]

Instead, he opted to earn aBachelor of Fine Arts.[3]However, Olyphant left university one elective shy of a degree; he returned to finish the degree 30 years later, taking an online course during theCOVID-19 pandemic.[29]In 1990, he planned to finish his degree and apply for amaster's degree in fine artsand half-heartedly considered a career incommercial art.[22][30]While working as a swimming coach atIrvine Novaquatics,[31][32]Olyphant decided to move to New York to explore other options.[27]He initially performedstand-up comedy: "I'd dabbled [before] and then there was a six-month period where I did it with a certain commitment. Then I'd occasionally go back."[22][30][33][34]Ultimately, he decided to become an actor. In his final year of college, he had taken an acting class as an elective atUC Irvineand found it "really enjoyable".[3][35]He completed a two-year acting program at New York'sWilliam Esper Studioand began auditioning for roles.[36][37][38]
Olyphant's first paid acting job was in a 1995WBtelevision pilot based on77 Sunset Strip.Phyllis Huffmancast him in the role but he did not have an opportunity to meet the show's producer,Clint Eastwood, who quit days before filming began.[39][40]Later that year, he made his professionalOff Broadwaydebut in thePlaywrights Horizons' production ofThe Monogamist[41][42]and received theTheatre World Award for Outstanding Debut Performance.[43]He starred in the world premiere ofThe SantaLand Diaries(1996) at theAtlantic Theater Company, a one-man play based onDavid Sedaris' essay about working as aMacy'sdepartment store Christmas elf.[44]Ben Brantley ofThe New York Timesfelt the "charming" Olyphant did "a wonderful job" when imitating other characters but had "a harder time finding a convincing style for the running narrative".[45]Howard Kissell ofThe New York Daily Newsremarked that he delivered "all the drollery with a perfect deadpan and a twinkle"[46]while David Patrick Stearns ofUSA Todaydescribed him as "an excellent young actor who successfully projects the world-weariness of a young 20-something who slowly evolves into somebody who just might believe in Christmas."[47]
Olyphant made his feature film debut inThe First Wives Club(1996) as an eager young director who attempts to cast Elise Elliot (Goldie Hawn) – who thinks she will be playing the leading lady – in the role of the elderly mother.[48]Airing on the same day of that film's release, he made his television debut in the pilot of theCBSspy seriesMr. & Mrs. Smith.[49][50]In 1997, Olyphant made a guest appearance as Officer Brett Farraday in three episodes of theABCpolice dramaHigh Incident[51]and returned to New York's Playwrights Horizons to play a supporting role inPlunge.[52]He also had minor roles in the romantic comedyA Life Less Ordinary[53]and the CBS television filmEllen Foster.[54]Olyphant's most high-profile role of 1997 was as a film student later revealed as one of the killers in the successful horror filmScream 2, bringing "a degree of wild-eyed flair to the role," according toHitFix's Chris Eggertsen.[55][56]He later described the role as "a gift. I had virtually nothing on my resume at that point. I'm sure some of it was made up."[56]
Olyphant returned to television in 1998 for a guest starring role in an episode of theHBOsitcomSex and the City, playing a love interest forCarrie Bradshaw.Sarah Jessica Parkerlater said the episode, "Valley of the Twenty Something Guys", was her favorite of the series.[57]Also that year, he had supporting roles in the HBO war filmWhen Trumpets Fade[58]and the independent ensemble drama1999.[59][60]Two little-seen films were released in 1999: the dramaAdvice from a Caterpillar, in which Olyphant played the bisexual love interest ofCynthia Nixon's character,[61][62]and the offbeat ensemble comedyNo Vacancy, in which he starred withChristina Ricci.[63]Olyphant received positive notices for portraying a drug dealer in the cult comedyGo(1999).[8][37][64]Janet Maslin ofThe New York Timesnoted that the role was "played with offbeat flair"[65][66]while Todd McCarthy ofVarietydescribed it as a "deftly etched" performance.[67]He was set to star in the fantasy filmPractical Magic, but he was replaced byAidan Quinn.[68][69]
After Olyphant's performance inGo, the film's producerMickey Liddelloffered him his choice of parts in his next projectThe Broken Hearts Club(2000), a romantic comedy about a group of gay friends living in West Hollywood.[70][71][72]The Village Voice's Dennis Lim commented that his leading performance was better than the film deserved: "Olyphant is charismatic enough for his worst lines not to stick."[73]However, Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chroniclefelt he played the part "like a straight actor gaying it up".[74]Olyphant played a detective in the successful action filmGone in 60 Seconds(2000) and joked in an interview about the challenges of playing "second fiddle to a car";[48][75]his performance reminded theWashington Post's Stephen Hunter of a youngBill Paxton.[76]
Olyphant was offered a starring role for a character calledDominic Torettoin another car film calledRedline– that would later be retitledThe Fast and the Furious. According to Sony producerNeal H. Moritz, "The studio said, 'If you can get Timothy Olyphant to play that role we will greenlight the movie.'" Olyphant declined the role, which went toVin Diesel. The film went on to be a massive success withnine sequelsto date.[77]Olyphant later discussed passing on a lot of roles earlier in his career. In 2011, when asked byThe Hollywood Reporterwhat was the most absurd project he had ever been pitched, he replied, "I've passed on absurd projects and they have become enormous, enormous hits spawning numerous sequels, and I'm not in them."[78]In 2018, he reflected on passing on the role of Toretto inThe Fast and the Furious, thinking it would be "stupid" and would bomb at the box office.[79]
Olyphant also had supporting roles in the musical comedyRock Star,[40]the crime dramaAuggie Rose,[80][81]and the romantic comedyHead Over Heels(all 2001). He starred in the short filmDoppelganger(2001)[82]and appeared in an episode of theSci-Fi Channelhorror seriesNight Visions(2002).[83]
The independent dramaCoastlinesmade its debut at the 2002SXSW Festival, but failed to find a distributor until 2006.[84][85]Olyphant starred oppositeJosh Brolinas an ex-con who returns to his Florida hometown to collect a $200,000 debt. Kevin Crust of theLos Angeles Timeswrote that he "possesses the kind of thousand-yard stare that suggests something deeper going on,"[86]while Owen Gleiberman ofEntertainment Weeklyremarked that "Olyphant, in the sort of role thatPaul Newmanused to swagger through, has a star's easy command."[87]However, Todd McCarthy ofVarietyfelt his performance "sort of floats along".[88]
Olyphant's most high-profile role of 2003 was in the Vin Diesel-starring action filmA Man Apart. Desson Howe of theWashington Postremarked that Olyphant "gets a kudo or two for [having] the good sense to realize he's playing one of the movie's many one-dimensional characters, so he might as well have insane fun".[89]Similarly, Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chroniclenoted that "the most lively character in "A Man Apart" turns out [to be] a middling drug dealer played to the hilt by Timothy Olyphant."[90]He appeared in thefilm adaptationofStephen King's horror novelDreamcatcheras one of four friends attacked by parasitic aliens.[91][92][93]The film was poorly reviewed, with David Rooney ofVarietyremarking: "OnlyLeeand Olyphant come close to hitting the right note of tongue-in-cheek humor that might have made all this palatable. Unfortunately, they're the first to go."[94]Also in 2003, he appeared in the independent ensemble dramaThe Safety of Objects.[70][95][96]
Olyphant received widespread praise for his 2004 performance as a porn film producer in the comedyThe Girl Next Door.[97][98][99]He was initially reluctant to audition for the part, feeling it was too similar to some of his previous roles but, "as my manager dutifully reminded me, not many people saw those movies."[75]Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chronicledescribed the character of Kelly as "a leering, magnetic, frightening, glad-handing, easily-amused, hyper-sensitive, utterly deceitful, maddeningly likable wild man. When Olyphant is on screen, there's the feeling that things might go anywhere."[100]A.O. Scott ofThe New York Timesremarked that the part was played with "a throwaway inventiveness"[101]while Kenneth Turan of theLos Angeles Timesfelt it was played "with wonderful comic zest".[102]David Edelstein ofSlateenjoyed his "spaced-out volatility. Olyphant's Kelly is a brilliant synthesis of poses."[103]Joe Leydon ofVarietysaid he "strikes an impressively deft balance of hearty amiability and understated menace in his scene-stealing turn".[104]
In a 2015 interview, Olyphant reflected on the early stages of his film career, and not getting the leading roles that would have possibly led to major fame: "I got great opportunities right off the bat. And at the same time I either passed or failed to get things that would have made things ridiculously quick. I passed on enormous opportunities only to end up playing the supporting role in the next film. And then I'd think to myself, "What the fuck am I doing? Why did I do that?" But sometimes I feel like I got away with some things, because I've been able to work for a long time and I haven't had to deal with any kind of fame issues."[105]
Olyphant came to the attention of a wider audience when he was cast as SheriffSeth Bullockin HBO's acclaimed westernDeadwood, which aired for three seasons from 2004 to 2006.[75]While he had previously been typecast "as a talkative,Jack Nicholson–styled, funny bad boy," in the words ofVulture'sMatt Zoller Seitz,[106][107]Deadwoodgave him the opportunity to play a righteous, brooding lawman.[108][109][110][111]The show's creator,David Milch, said of the casting choice: "Bullock's uprightness is an alternative to going medieval on people. You can see that same fire and that possibility in Tim, even at his most genial ... I'm not sure which poet talked about 'thoughts too deep for words,' but he brings that idea alive ... Tim is a guy that doesn't let himself be known easily."[64][112][113]
While Bullock was initially introduced asDeadwood's protagonist, Emily VanDerWerff ofThe A.V. Clubnoted that the character ofAl Swearengencame to "dominate the show ... This is not to slight Timothy Olyphant. He's a fine actor, and his portrayal of Bullock is frequently very, very good. Bullock is still unquestionably one of the most important characters on the show but the character of a Wild West lawman, no matter how revisionist it was in its portrayal of that lawman as someone who seemed barely in control at all times, just ended up not having as much to do in a blatantly revisionist Western about how chaos gives way to civilization."[114]Matt Feeney ofSlatedescribed Bullock as "laconic, feral, hot-tempered and a little vain", and said the character was "not so much played as embodied by Olyphant".[115]Alan Sepinwall ofHitFixfound his performance "fierce and commanding"[116]while Jeremy Egner ofThe New York Timessaid that he showed "a capacity for explosive, nuanced performance barely suggested by earlier roles".[64]The cast were nominated for the 2006Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.[53]
Years later, Olyphant remarked thatDeadwood"almost has done more for me since we wrapped than while it was on. I continue to draw from it, to steal from it. I'm much better at my job now because of the things I learned while doing it. David Milch is one of the greatest writers, storytellers, directors, creative forces I've ever been around."[117]He has been somewhat critical of his own performance: "Frankly, the show is much better than my performance ...Ianwas like a little kid, playing with the props and playing with the language and he never lost the sense of fun of it all. I wasn't operating at that same level."[118][119]
Also in 2006, he made a guest appearance in an episode of theNBCcomedyMy Name Is Earl.[120]In 2007, Olyphant starred in the romantic comedyCatch and Release. He knew co-starJennifer Garnerfrom their days as struggling actors in New York, and was excited for the opportunity to play a romantic lead.[7][53][121]Lael Loewenstein ofVarietyfelt "Olyphant clearly has a bright future"[122]while Desson Thomson of theWashington Postdescribed him as "the strongest performer here" but that he was "entirely misplaced, an estimable actor caught in a thankless, frilly role".[123]Scott Tobias ofThe A.V. Clubremarked: "Olyphant's trademark volatility makes him a livelier romantic lead than the usual stuffed shirt."[124]Similarly, Stephanie Zacharek ofSalonfound him "effective here precisely because he seems a little sharp and dangerous. He's not your typical cuddly romantic lead."[125]
Olyphant's first post-Deadwoodroles were the action moviesLive Free or Die HardandHitman(both 2007). (Coastlineswas first screened during the Sundance Film Festival in 2002[126]whileCatch and Releasewas filmed in 2005.[127]) He had bought a house in the weeks beforeDeadwood's cancellation[128][129]and he later admitted his job choices during this period were for "purely financial reasons".[21]InLive Free or Die Hard, he played a villainous cybersecurity expert.[53][110][130]Both he andBruce Willishave said his role was underwritten in the script, and he enjoyed working with Willis to develop the character.[131][132][133]Peter Travers ofRolling Stonedeclared him "a master at smiling menace",[134]while Mick LaSalle ofThe San Francisco Chroniclefound him "perfectly ice cold".[135]However,Manohla DargisofThe New York Timesremarked: "Mr. Olyphant has many charms, but annihilating menace is not one of them."[136]He next starred inHitman, a video game adaptation, as the assassinAgent 47.[7][137][138]He was hired to replace Vin Diesel six weeks before filming began[139][140]and reluctantly agreed to shave his head.[132][141]The film was commercially successful, grossing over $100 million,[142]but received negative reviews. Todd McCarthy ofVarietydescribed Olyphant as "an actor capable of portraying subtle ambiguities and thought, which suggests he ought to branch out to play something other than baddies".[143]Nick Schager ofSlant Magazinewas disappointed to see the actor "reduced to glowering and posing with pistols"[144]while Manohla Dargis ofThe New York Timesfelt he was "strangely, at times ridiculously, miscast".[145]In 2008, he had a supporting role as alieutenant colonelin theIraq WardramaStop-Loss,[53][146]played a pompous newscaster in the little-seen comedyMeet Bill,[147]voiced the character Cowboy in the video gameTurok[148]and made a guest appearance on the first season of the ABC sitcomSamantha Who?withChristina Applegate.[149][150]
Olyphant had a new outlook when choosing his 2009 projects, influenced by his experience withHitman: "It motivated me to take a little more responsibility with what I was doing ... I was very fond of the director and a lot of the people that worked on the film but there was definitely a part of me that was like, "What am I doing here?'"[64][151][152]He starred as a morphine addict in the little-seen independent heist comedyHigh Life,[153][154][155]with Derek Elley ofVarietypraising his "terrific" performance.[156][157]He had a starring role in the thrillerA Perfect Getawayas a possible serial killer of fellow holidaymakers in Hawaii. Manohla Dargis ofThe New York Timesenjoyed "the regrettably underemployed" actor's performance,[158]Ty Burr of theBoston Globefound him "delightfully confident"[159]while Lisa Schwarzbaum ofEntertainment Weeklynoted he "has a heckuva good time telegraphing macho mania".[160]He was nominated for theToronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor.[161]He returned to the stage for one night to appear inStanding on Ceremony: The Gay Marriage Plays, benefiting theHuman Rights Campaign.[162][163]Also in 2009, he appeared in 11 episodes of theFXlegal thrillerDamages, as a morally ambiguous love interest forRose Byrne's character.[164][165]Byrne later said he was her favoriteDamagesguest star,[166][167]while FX presidentJohn Landgrafsent him the pilot script for another FX project,Lawman(later renamedJustified).[113][117]In 2010, he starred as the town sheriff in the horror filmThe Crazies.[151][168]Peter Bradshaw ofThe Guardianwas impressed by the "saturnine screen presence of Timothy Olyphant – that formidable actor who deserves a lead role to match his potential."[169]The Hollywood Reporter's Michael Rechtshaffen found him "convincing"[170]while Claudia Puig ofUSA Todayenjoyed the "smart, stoic and sympathetic" performance.[171]He also appeared in the independent comedyElektra Luxx(2010).[172][173]
Olyphant starred in FX's modern-day western series,Justified, as Deputy U.S. MarshalRaylan Givens, who is reassigned to his native Eastern Kentucky following a "Justified," but questionable, quick-draw shooting of a criminal in Miami. There, he encounters many outlaw figures from his childhood, including his father and Boyd Crowder, with whom he dug coal as a teenager.[174]Olyphant was initially drawn to "the ease and the charm and the sort of old-fashionedness" of the character[152]but has said he does not consider him a "good guy".[64][174][175][176]The character of Raylan Givens was created by novelistElmore Leonard, appearing in his short story "Fire in the Hole" (2001) and the novelsPronto(1993) andRiding the Rap(1995). Leonard was an executive producer ofJustifiedand befriended Olyphant;[177][178][179]his final novel,Raylan(2012), was inspired by the television show.[180]
Raylan Givens has been described by many television critics as the "defining role" of Olyphant's career.[64][181][182]Brian Lowry ofVarietysaid it was "an unabashed star turn": "There are surely worse ways to be pigeonholed than playing tough, laconic lawmen, and Timothy Olyphant is carving himself a formidable niche in those confines ... It's an enormously appealing performance."[183]Tim Goodman of theSan Francisco Chroniclepraised "an incredibly riveting performance": "Olyphant's steely gaze, Zen interior and matinee looks called to mind a younger Clint Eastwood."[184]Daniel Fienberg ofHitFixdescribed him as "a tremendously compelling actor. It's not that he thrives only on minimalism, but he gets a lot out of a little. His performance is about potential energy, or potential violence. And Olyphant does "intense and coiled" to perfection."[185]Matthew Gilbert ofThe Boston Globesaid: "It's hard to imagine any other actor in the part, as Olyphant milks Raylan's smooth, laconic cowboy style for as much wry humor as he can. He is riveting without a lot of noise — both his body language and his conversation are pared down, and yet his presence is always resonant."[186]Although Olyphant was nominated for aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Seriesin 2011,[187]he and the show were often perceived to have been "snubbed" by Emmy voters.[188][189][190][191]Matt Zoller Seitz ofVulturesuggested this was because it was "the kind of performance that almost nobody recognizes as 'acting.' It's an old-fashioned movie hero performance in which much of the emotional action is internal and articulated with great subtlety."[192]Similarly, Robert Bianco ofUSA Todaycommented that his "masterfully complete immersion in the role seems to have masked the talent expended playing it".[193]
Olyphant also served as a co-executive producer onJustified, working withGraham Yostand the writing team on some of the show's storylines and coming to the set on his days off to work with guest stars.[64][152][194][113]He has described producing as "the greatest thing about this job".[175]Yost has said of his producer credit: "Often on shows that really doesn't mean much. On this show it actually doesn't reflect the depth of his involvement, which would be an even bigger credit. Tim is the biggest reminder for everyone that we're in the Elmore Leonard world. And that it needs to be funny and dark and twisted, and it needs to speak with all of those voices at the same time."[64]Justifiedwas awarded aPeabody Awardin 2011.[195]
Olyphant made occasional guest appearances on comedy television shows duringJustified's six-season run. He played a paper salesman in two episodes of the NBC comedyThe Office(2010), afterMindy Kaling, a writer, producer and actress on the show, pushed for him to make a guest appearance.[196][197][198]In 2012, he played a character billed as White Sushi Chef in an episode of the FX sitcomThe League(2012)[199]and voiced a character in an episode of the FX animated seriesArcher.[200][201]In 2013, he appeared as a love interest on theFoxcomedyThe Mindy Project. The guest appearance came about after he told Kaling that he wanted to appear on the show[202][203]and he later said he would have been happy to play his middle-aged skateboarder character for "years".[33][204][205]
Olyphant also worked on numerous films in between seasons ofJustified. He voiced the Spirit of the West in the animated filmRango(2011).[206][207]The character was a parody ofClint Eastwood'sMan with No Name[208]and Olyphant was cast after directorGore Verbinskioverheard him speaking on television: "I just sort of doubled back and looked through the door and was like, "That's our guy" ... Timothy has such a great quality to his voice."[209][210][211]Olyphant appeared as a mentor toAlex Pettyfer's character in the science-fiction thrillerI Am Number Four(2011).[206]Justin Chang ofVarietysaid he "brings some of his usual edge"[212]but Betsy Sharkey of theLos Angeles Timesfelt he was "an untapped resource".[213]Also in 2011, he voiced a character called Sergeant First Class "Grinch" in the video game,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. In 2013, he appeared asJeff Garlin's father in the independent comedyDealin' with Idiots[214][215]and took part in a one-offLACMA Live Readof the black comedyRaising Arizona(1987); he playedNicolas Cage's character whileAmy PoehlerplayedHolly Hunter's character.[216][217]In 2014, Olyphant starred withTina Feyin the ensemble comedy-dramaThis Is Where I Leave You. Their characters were teenage sweethearts until an accident left him with a mild brain injury. The film received mixed reviews,[218]with David Edelstein ofVulturecommenting: "Over the course of his career, Olyphant has given life to head-slappingly bad material, and he does it again by simply underplaying."[219]
Olyphant had a recurring guest role as a fictionalized version of himself in the Fox comedyThe Grinder(2015–2016). His performance received positive critical notices,[220][221][222][223]withUSA Today's Robert Bianco declaring it an "Emmy-deserving performance".[224]The role won him theCritics' Choice Television Award for Best Guest Performer in a Comedy Series.[225]
In early 2016, Olyphant starred in the world premiere ofKenneth Lonergan's comedyHold On to Me Darlingat the off-BroadwayAtlantic Theater Company. His character, Strings McCrane, is a self-absorbed country singer and actor who returns home toTennesseefollowing his mother's death.[226][227]Ben Brantley of theNew York Timesfound him "entertainingly irritating" in a performance that "avoids the obvious route of histrionic posing"; "The startling, bona fide sorrow that Mr. Olyphant brings to [the final scene] truly illuminates everything that has come before."[228]Frank Rizzo ofVarietyfelt his performance was "a stunner, striking just the right notes of guilelessness, obliviousness and narcissism to make Strings one of the most appealing messes in a long time".[229]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterfelt the role "seems tailor-made for his laid-back swagger and sly humor ... Olyphant's natural charm ensures that Strings' unapologetic self-absorption remains more human than monstrous."[230]He also played Henry, ex-husband of Sandy (Jennifer Aniston), in the universally-panned ensembleromantic comedyMother's Day(2016);[231]he  appeared inOliver Stone'sSnowden(2016) as aCIA agentwho befriendswhistleblowerEdward Snowdenjust prior to Snowden's fleeing to Russia, after publicly leaking classified US government information.[232]
In February 2017, Olyphant began starring in theNetflixhorror-comedySanta Clarita Diet, and also served as an executive producer for the series, which co-starredDrew Barrymore. Netflix renewed the series for a second season in March 2017[233][234]and for a third, ultimately final season in May 2018.[235]Dark Was the Night, an independent drama in which he starred withMarisa Tomei, was filmed in 2015 and premiered at the 2018Galway Film Fleadh.[236]
In early 2016, HBO announced that David Milch was developing a two-hour film continuation ofDeadwood.[237]The follow-up to the television series began production in October 2018.[238]Deadwood: The Moviepremiered on HBO on May 31, 2019.[239]

He is also a keen tennis player,[254][255]and has participated in many pro-celebrity tournaments.[256][257][258]He is a fan of theLos Angeles Clippers[253]and theLos Angeles Dodgers, and he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at a Dodgers game in 2013.[259]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
