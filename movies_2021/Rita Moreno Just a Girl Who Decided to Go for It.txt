According to research done in 2010 byHarvardprofessor andFaces of AmericahostHenry Louis Gates Jr., Longoria's oldest identifiable Spanish immigrant ancestor is her ninth great-grandfather, Lorenzo Suárez de Longoria (b.Oviedo, 1592), who was a colonist of theViceroyalty of New Spain(modern-day Mexico) in 1603. His family was based in a small village called Llongoria,Belmonte de Miranda, Asturias, Spain.Longoriais the Castillanized form of thisAsturian-languagesurname.
In 1767, her seventh great-grandfather received almost 4,000 acres (16 km2) of land along theRio Grandein a land grant from KingCharles III of Spain. The family retained this land for more than a century. After the US-Mexican border was moved southwards in the aftermath of theMexican–American War, the land ended up on the American side of the border. Her family had to deal with the influx of United States settlers following the Mexican–American War and theAmerican Civil War.[140]
According toDNA testing, Longoria's overall genetic ancestry is 70% European, 27%Indigenous American, and 3%African.[141]A computer analysis of the DNA results of Gates's dozen guests showed that Longoria has the same genetichaplogroupas cellistYo-Yo Ma, who is of Chinese heritage.[141]As women have two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, Longoria did not inherit her father'sY-DNA, but she did inherit her mother'smitochondrial DNA(genetic information passed from mother to child). Longoria's mtDNA belongs to theHaplogroup A2, making her a direct descendant of a Native American woman, aMayanfrom the territory of Mexico long before it was Mexico. Her ancestors include many other Maya on both sides of her family.[142][143]
Longoria identifies as a "Texican"—a Mexican-American Texan.[142]

Her maternal grandfather, Leonardo García, emigrated toCubafromPola de Siero, Asturias, Spain, where he married Gloria's grandmother, Consuelo Pérez, who was originally fromLogroño, Spain. Consuelo's father Pantaleón Pérez served as the head chef to two Cuban presidents.[12][13][14]Estefan's paternal side also had musical sensibilities, as the lineage had a famous flautist and a classical pianist.[15]
Estefan's mother Gloria Fajardo, nicknamed "Big Gloria", won an international contest during her childhood and received a Hollywood offer to dubShirley Temple's films inSpanish.[16][17]However, Leonardo García did not permit his daughter to pursue the offer.[18]Gloria Fajardo earned aPh.D.in education in Cuba, but her diploma and other papers were destroyed by Cuban officials when she left for the United States.[19]
Estefan's paternal grandparents were José Manuel Fajardo González and Amelia Montano. José Manuel was a Cuban soldier and a motor escort for the wife ofCuban presidentFulgencio Batista, and Amelia Montano was a poet. As a result of theCuban Revolution, the Fajardo family fled and settled inMiami, in 1959, and ran one of the first Cuban restaurants in the city.[20][21][22]In 1961, Estefan's father José participated in the failedBay of Pigs Invasion. He was captured by his cousin, who was a member ofFidel Castro's army, and imprisoned in Cuba for nearly two years.[11]On his return, he joined the United States military and fought in theVietnam War.

Estefan told her mother who alerted the police of the allegation; charges were not pressed because of the additional trauma she felt Estefan would undergo as a result of testifying against the perpetrator. When Estefan was 16, her father's illness led him to be hospitalized at aVeterans Administrationmedical facility.[26][27]

In 1980, he founded the advocacy organizationPeople for the American Wayto counter the influence of theChristian rightin politics, and in the early 2000s, he mounted a tour with a copy of theDeclaration of Independence.
Norman Milton Lear was born on July 27, 1922, inNew Haven, Connecticut,[3][4]to Jeanette (néeSeicol) and Hyman "Herman" Lear, a traveling salesman.[4]He had a younger sister, Claire Lear Brown (1925–2015).[5]Lear grew up in a Jewish household in Connecticut and had abar mitzvahceremony.[6]Both parents were of Russian-Jewish descent.[7][8][9]
When Lear was nine years old and living with his family inChelsea, Massachusetts,[10]his father went to prison for selling fake bonds.[11]Lear thought of his father as a "rascal" and said that the character ofArchie Bunker(whom Lear depicted as white Protestant on the show) was in part inspired by his father, and the character ofEdith Bunkerwas in part inspired by his mother.[11]However, Lear has said the moment which inspired his lifetime of advocacy was another event which he experienced at the age of nine, when he first heard antisemitic Catholic radio priest FatherCharles Coughlinwhile tinkering with his crystal radio set.[12]After hearing more of Coughlin's radio sermons, Lear said he found Coughlin would promote antisemitism by targeting people whom Jews considered to be "great heroes", such as US President Franklin Roosevelt.[13]
Lear attendedSamuel J. Tilden High SchoolinBrooklyn, New York,[14]graduated from Weaver High School inHartford, Connecticut, in 1940 and attendedEmerson CollegeinBoston, but dropped out in 1942 to join theUnited States Army Air Forces.[15]

Carroll.[19]
AfterWorld War IILear had a career inpublic relations.[11]The career choice was inspired by his Uncle Jack: "My dad had a brother, Jack, who flipped me a quarter every time he saw me. He was a press agent so I wanted to be a press agent. That's the only role model I had. So all I wanted was to grow up to be a guy who could flip a quarter to a nephew."[6]Lear decided to move to California to restart his career in publicity, driving with his toddler daughter across the country.[11]
His first night in Los Angeles, Lear stumbled upon a production ofGeorge Bernard Shaw'sMajor Barbaraat the 90-seattheater-in-the-roundCircle Theater off Sunset Boulevard. One of the actors in the play wasSydney Chaplin, the son of actorsCharlie ChaplinandLita Grey. Charlie Chaplin,Alan Mowbray, and DameGladys Coopersat in front of Lear, and after the show was over, Charlie Chaplin performed.[11]
Lear had a first cousin in Los Angeles, Elaine, who was married to an aspiring comedy writer namedEd Simmons.  Simmons and Lear teamed up to sell home furnishings door-to-door for a company called The Gans Brothers and later sold family photos door-to-door. Throughout the 1950s, Lear and Simmons turned out comedy sketches for television appearances ofMartin and Lewis,Rowan and Martin, and others. They frequently wrote for Martin and Lewis when they appeared on theColgate Comedy Hour, and a 1953 article fromBillboardmagazine stated that Lear and Simmons were guaranteed a record-breaking $52,000 (equivalent to $610,000 in 2024) each to write for five additional Martin and Lewis appearances on theColgate Comedy Hourthat year.[20]In a 2015 interview withVariety, Lear said thatJerry Lewishad hired him and Simmons as writers for Martin and Lewis three weeks before the comedy duo made their first appearance on the Colgate Comedy Hour in 1950.[21]Lear also acknowledged in 1986 that he and Simmons were the main writers forThe Martin and Lewis Showfor three years.[22]
In 1954, Lear was enlisted as a writer and asked to salvage the newCBSsitcom starringCeleste Holm,Honestly, Celeste!, but the program was canceled after eight episodes. During this time he became the producer ofNBC's short-lived (26 episodes) sitcomThe Martha Raye Show, afterNat Hikenleft as the series director. Lear also wrote some of the opening monologs forThe Tennessee Ernie Ford Show[21][23]which aired from 1956 to 1961. In 1959, Lear created his first television series, a half-hour western forRevue StudioscalledThe Deputy, starringHenry Fonda.[24]
Starting out as a comedy writer, then a film director (he wrote and produced the 1967 filmDivorce American Styleand directed the 1971 filmCold Turkey, both starringDick Van Dyke), Lear tried to sell a concept for a sitcom about ablue-collarAmerican family toABC. They rejected the show after two pilots were taped: "Justice for All" in 1968[25]and "Those Were the Days" in 1969.[26]After a third pilot was taped, CBS picked up the show, known asAll in the Family. It premiered on January 12, 1971, to disappointing ratings, but it took home severalEmmy Awardsthat year, including Outstanding Comedy Series. The show did very well in summer reruns,[27]and it flourished in the 1971–72 season, becoming the top-rated show on TV for the next five years.[28]After falling from theNo.1 spot,All in the Familystill remained in the top ten, with the exception of the1976-1977 television seasonwhere it ranked No. 12,[29]and eventually becameArchie Bunker's Place. The show was based loosely on the British sitcomTill Death Us Do Part, about an irascible working-classToryand hissocialistson-in-law.[30]
Lear's second big TV sitcom,Sanford and Son, was also based on a British sitcom,Steptoe and Son,[31]about a west London junk dealer and his son. Lear changed the setting to theWattssection of Los Angeles and the characters to African Americans, and theNBCshowSanford and Sonwas an instant hit.[32]Numerous hit shows followed thereafter, includingMaude,The Jeffersons(bothspin-offsofAll in the Family),One Day at a Time, andGood Times(which is a spinoff ofMaude).[33]
Most of these Lear sitcoms share three features: they were shot onvideotapein place offilm, used a live studio audience, and dealt with current social and political issues.[34]Maudeis generally considered to be based on Lear's wife Frances, which she confirmed, withCharlie Hauckserving as main producer and writer.[35][36]
Lear's longtime producing partner wasBud Yorkin, who also producedAll in the Family,Sanford and Son,What's Happening!!,Maude, andThe Jeffersons.[37]Yorkin split with Lear in 1975. He started a production company with writers and producersSaul TurteltaubandBernie Orenstein; however, only two of their shows lasted longer than a year:What's Happening!!andCarter Country. The Lear/Yorkin company was known asTandem Productionsand was founded in 1958. Lear and talent agentJerry PerenchiofoundedT.A.T. Communications("T.A.T." stood for the Yiddish phrasetuchus affen tisch, "putting one's ass on the line".[38]) in 1974, which co-existed with Tandem Productions and was often referred to in periodicals as Tandem/T.A.T. The Lear organization was one of the most successful independent TV producers of the 1970s.[39]TAT produced the influential and award-winning 1981 filmThe WaveaboutRon Jones' social experiment.[40]
Lear also developed the cult favorite TV seriesMary Hartman, Mary Hartman(MH MH) which was turned down by the networks as "too controversial" and placed it into first run syndication with 128 stations in January 1976. A year later, he added another program into first-run syndication along withMH MH,All That Glitters. He planned in 1977 to offer three hours of prime-time Saturday programming directly having stations place his production company in the position of anoccasional network.[21][41]
In 1977, African-American screenwriterEric Montefiled a lawsuit accusingABCandCBSproducers Norman Lear,Bud Yorkin, and others of stealing his ideas forGood Times,The Jeffersons, andWhat's Happening!!Monte received a $1-million settlement and a small percentage of the residuals fromGood Timesand one percent ownership of the show. Monte, due to his lack of business knowledge and experience as well as legal representation, would not receive royalties for other shows that he created. However, Lear and other Hollywood producers, outraged over the lawsuit, blacklisted Monte and labeled him too difficult to work with.[42]
In 1980, Lear founded the organizationPeople for the American Wayfor the purpose of counteracting theChristian rightgroupMoral Majoritywhich had been founded in 1979.[43]In the fall of 1981, Lear began a 14-month run as the host of a revival of the classic game showQuiz Kidsfor the CBS Cable Network.

Communications, the Avco was dropped, and the combined entity  was renamed as Embassy Communications, Inc.[44]Embassy Pictures was led byAlan Hornand Martin Schaeffer, later co-founders ofCastle Rock EntertainmentwithRob Reiner.[45]
In March 1982, Lear produced an ABC television special titledI Love Liberty,  as a counterbalance to groups like theMoral Majority.[46]Among the many guests who appeared on the special was conservative icon and the 1964 U.S. presidential election's Republican nomineeBarry Goldwater.[46]
On June 18, 1985, Lear and Perenchio sold Embassy Communications toColumbia Pictures(then owned byThe Coca-Cola Company), which acquired Embassy's film and television division (including Embassy's in-house television productions and the television rights to the Embassy theatrical library) for $485 million of shares of The Coca-Cola Company.[47][48]The brandTandem Productionswas abandoned in 1986 with the cancellation ofDiff'rent Strokes, and Embassy ceased to exist as a single entity in late 1986, having been split into different components owned by different entities.[49]Coca-Cola sold the film division to Dino De Laurentiis and the home video arm to Nelson Holdings (led by Barry Spikings).[50][51]The TV properties continued under theColumbia Pictures Televisionbanner.[52]
Lear'sAct III Communicationswas founded in 1986 and in the following year,Thomas B. McGrathwas named president and chief operating officer of ACT III Communications Inc after previously serving as senior vice president.[53][54]On February 2, 1989, Norman Lear's Act III Communications formed a joint venture with Columbia Pictures Television calledAct III Televisionto produce television series instead of managing.[55][56]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Act III Communications purchased several business journals, includingChannelsmagazine that had been founded byLes Brown, formerNew York TimesTV correspondent.Channelsclosed in 1990, by which time Act III and Brown published and editedTelevision Business International(TBI).[57][58]

Lear has been honored for his influence on American television and culture.[72]BeforeAll in the Family, television sitcoms in the 1950s and 1960s generally portrayed white American family life as comfortable and avoided raising issues such as racial discrimination and patriarchy.[73][74]Beginning in 1971,All in the Familyopenly discussed current social and political topics and became the country's most popular show for five straight years.[75][76]Lear's subsequent shows widened television's representation of racial and gender diversity, such asGood Times, the first television show centered on an African-American nuclear family;[77][78][79]Television screenwriterPaddy Chayefskysaid that Lear "put the American people [on screen] ... he took the audience and put them on the set".[80]However, it has been acknowledged thatJames L. BrooksTV seriesRoom 222, which was not made by Lear and which debuted before Lear's shows debuted, was also among the first shows to not only feature an African American lead character in a less stereotypical role, a high school teacher, but also invoke serious contemporary issues, with theTelevision Academy Foundationstating that "A season and a half before Norman Lear made "relevant" programming a dominant genre with the introduction of programs like All in the Family and Maude, Room 222 was using the form of the half-hour comedy to discuss serious contemporary issues. During its five seasons on the air, the show included episodes that dealt with such topics as racism, sexism, homophobia, dropping out of school, shoplifting, drug use among both teachers and students, illiteracy, cops in school, guns in school, Vietnam war veterans, venereal disease, and teenage pregnancy".[81]

McNally was born November 3, 1938, inSt. Petersburg, Florida, to Hubert Arthur and Dorothy Katharine (Rapp) McNally,[14]two transplanted New Yorkers from Irish Catholic backgrounds.[15][16]His parents ran a seaside bar and grill called The Pelican Club, but after a hurricane destroyed the establishment, the family briefly relocated toPort Chester, New York, then toDallas, Texas, and finally toCorpus Christi, Texas. There Hubert McNally purchased and managed aSchlitz beerdistributorship,[17]and McNally attendedW.B. Ray High School. Despite his distance from New York City, McNally's parents enjoyed Broadway musicals. When McNally was eight years old, his parents took him to seeAnnie Get Your Gun, starringEthel Merman, and on a subsequent outing, McNally sawGertrude LawrenceinThe King and I.[18]McNally later said: "When I sawOn the Town, with Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly and Jules Munshin with the Staten Island Ferry and the Empire State Building, I said: 'That's where I want to live.' I've never regretted it."[19][a]In high school McNally was encouraged to write by a gifted English teacher, Maurine McElroy (1913–2005).[b]
He enrolled atColumbia Collegein 1956. There he especially enjoyed Andrew Chiappe's two-semester course onShakespearein which students read Shakespeare's plays in roughly the order of their composition.[22]He joined theBoar's Head Society[23]and wrote Columbia's annualVarsity Show, which featured music by fellow studentEdward L. Klebanand directed byMichael P. Kahn. He graduated in 1960 with aB.A.in English and membership inPhi Beta Kappa Society.[12][24]In 1961, McNally was hired by novelistJohn Steinbeckto tutor his two teenage sons as the Steinbeck family took a cruise around the world.[c]On the cruise McNally completed a draft of what became the opening act ofAnd Things That Go Bump in the Night. Steinbeck asked McNally to write the libretto forHere's Where I Belong, a musical version of the novelEast of Eden.[25]
After graduation, McNally moved to Mexico to focus on his writing, completing a one-act play which he submitted to theActors Studioin New York City for production. While the play was turned down by the acting school, the Studio was impressed with the script, and McNally was invited to serve as the Studio'sstage managerso that he could gain practical knowledge of theater. His earliest full-length play,This Side of the Door, deals with a sensitive boy's battle of wills with his overbearing father and was produced in anActors StudioWorkshop in 1962, featuring a youngEstelle Parsons.[12]Starting a career that covered both off-Broadway and Broadway, his plays cried out againstVietnam, satirized stale family dynamics, mocked sexual mores and became a part of the social protest movement of the 1960s and early 1970s.[26]
In 1964, his next playAnd Things That Go Bump in the Nightputhomosexualitysquarely on stage which brought him the ire of New York City's conservative theatre critics.[27]It opened at theRoyale Theatreon Broadway to generally negative reviews. The play explores the psycho-social dynamic of anxiety that leads one to preemptively and defensively accuse others of creating problems that in actuality result from one's own insecurity. McNally later said, "My first play,Things That Go Bump in the Night, was a big flop. I had to begin all over again."[11]Nevertheless, the producer,Theodore Manndropped the price of tickets to $1.00 which allowed the production to run with sold-out houses for three weeks.[28]
Next(1968), which brought him his greatest early acclaim and was directed byElaine Mayand starredJames Coco, follows a married, middle-aged, businessman who has been mistakenly drafted into the armed forces.Botticelli(1968) centers on two American soldiers standing guard in the jungle while making a game of the great names in Western Civilization.¡Cuba Si!(1968) satirizes the disdain that many Americans feel for the idea of revolution though United States was itself born out of a revolution.

InLet It Bleed(1972) a young couple showers and becomes convinced an intruder is lurking on the other side of the shower curtain. These and his other early plays, includingTour(1967),Witness(1968), andBringing It All Back Home(1970), andWhiskey(1973), form a dark satire on American moral complacency.[12]
McNally turned to comedy andfarce, beginning withNoon(1968), a sexual farce revolving around five strangers who are lured to an apartment in lower Manhattan by a personal advertisement.Bad Habits, which satirizes American reliance uponpsychotherapy, premiered at the John Drew Theatre inEast Hampton, New York, in 1971 starringLinda Lavin.

In 1978, McNally wroteBroadway, Broadway, which failed in its Philadelphia try-out starringGeraldine Page. Rewritten and retitledIt's Only a Play, it premiered in off-Broadway in 1985 atManhattan Theatre Clubdirected byJohn Tillingerand starringChristine Baranski,Joanna Gleason, andJames Coco.[12][29]
After the failure ofBroadway, Broadwayand living briefly inHollywood, he returned to New York City and formed an artistic relationship with Manhattan Theatre Club. The rapid spread ofAIDSfundamentally changed his writing.[12]McNally only became truly successful with works such as the off-Broadway production ofFrankie and Johnny in the Clair de Luneand its screen adaptation with starsAl PacinoandMichelle Pfeiffer. His firstBroadwaymusical wasThe Rinkin 1984, a project he joined after the score by composerJohn Kanderand lyricistFred Ebbhad been written. In 1990, McNally won anEmmy Awardfor Best Writing in a Miniseries or Special forAndre's Mother, a drama about a woman coping with her son's death from AIDS. A year later, inLips Together, Teeth Apart, two married couples spend the Fourth of July weekend at a summer house onFire Island. They are all afraid to use the pool given that its owner has just died of AIDS. It was written forChristine Baranski,Anthony Heald,Swoosie Kurtz(taking the place ofKathy Bates), and frequent McNally collaboratorNathan Lane, who had also starred inThe Lisbon Traviata.[30][31]
WithKiss of the Spider Woman(based on the novel byManuel Puig) in 1992, McNally returned to the musical stage, collaborating with Kander and Ebb on a script which explores the complex relationship between two men jailed together in a Latin American prison.Kiss of the Spider Womanwon the 1993Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical, the first of McNally's fourTony Awards.

McNally'sCorpus Christi(1997) became the subject of protests. In this retelling of the story of Jesus' birth, ministry, and death, he and his disciples are portrayed as homosexual. The play was initially canceled because of death threats against the board members of theManhattan Theatre Club, which produced the play.[34]The board relented after several other playwrights, includingAthol Fugard, threatened to withdraw their plays ifCorpus Christiwas not produced. A crowd of almost 2,000 protested the play as blasphemous at its opening.

Reviewing this production forThe New York Times, Jason Zinoman wrote that "without the noise of controversy, the play can finally be heard.

There are whole seasons in New York when I don't think a single classic play would have been performed if it hadn't been for the Pearl... I think it's really important. I write new plays for a living; I certainly don't think theatre should be just revivals, but there has always got to be a place forChekhov,Ibsen,Shakespeare,MoliereandAeschylus."[59]

In his early years in New York City, McNally's interest in theatre brought him to a party where, departing, he shared a cab withEdward Albee, who had recently writtenThe Zoo StoryandThe Sandbox. They functioned as a couple for over four years during which Albee wroteThe American DreamandWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?[12]He was frustrated by Albee's lack of openness about his sexuality. McNally later said: "I became invisible when press was around or at an opening night. I knew it was wrong. It's so much work to live that way."[71]After his relationship with Albee, McNally entered into a long-term relationship with the actor and directorRobert Drivas.[12]Drivas and McNally broke up as a couple in 1976; they remained close friends until Drivas died of AIDS-related complications ten years later.[29]

As a young man, McNally was a heavy drinker. He relates that while attending a party in 1980 he spilled a drink onLauren Bacall. "Then someone I hardly knew,Angela Lansbury, [said] 'I just want to say, I don't know you very well, but every time I see you, you're drunk, and it bothers me.'...She was someone I revered, and she said this with such love and concern. I went to an A.A. meeting, and within a year, I had stopped drinking."[77]
When given his Tony for Lifetime Achievement in June 2019, he began his acceptance speech saying "Lifetime achievement. Not a moment too soon." He wore a cannula and appeared short of breath.[78]McNally died atSarasota Memorial Hospitalin Sarasota, Florida, on March 24, 2020, at the age of 81, from complications ofCOVID-19during theCOVID-19 pandemic.

For McNally, the most important function of theatre was to create community and bridge rifts opened between people by differences in religion, race, gender, and particularly sexual orientation.[79]
In an address to members of theLeague of American Theatres and Producershe remarked, "I think theatre teaches us who we are, what our society is, where we are going. I don't think theatre can solve the problems of a society, nor should it be expected to ... plays don't do that. People do. [But plays can] provide a forum for the ideas and feelings that can lead a society to decide to heal and change itself."[80]
McNally donated his papers to theHarry Ransom Centerat theUniversity of Texas at Austin. The archive includes all of his major works for stage, screen, and television, as well as correspondence, posters, production photographs, programs, reviews, awards, speeches, and recordings.
