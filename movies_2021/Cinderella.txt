It is a jukebox musical, featuringpopandrockhits, in addition to several original songs.[2]
Development began in April 2019, whenSony Picturesannounced a musical-style film ofCinderella, with Cannon writing and directing. The film was produced byJames Corden, throughFulwell 73withLeo Pearlman, Jonathan Kadin andShannon McIntosh.Principal photographybegan in February 2020 atPinewood Studios, and was suspended in March 2020 due to theCOVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed in August 2020 and concluded in September.
Cinderellawas released inselect theatersand digitally onAmazon Prime Videoon September 3, 2021[3]to mixed reviews from critics. Commercially, according to Samba TV, it was watched in 1.1 million U.S. households over its four-dayLabor Dayweekend debut and in 2.2 million households by the end of its first 30 days. According to the analytics company Screen Engine,Cinderellawas the most-watched streaming film during its opening weekend, as well as the most-watched musical film of 2021.
Cinderellais an ambitious young woman who dreams of establishing her shop, Dresses by Ella. After she catches the eye of Prince Robert in passing, he disguises himself as a commoner and sets out in hopes of meeting her.
Robert finds Ella among the local market vendors, trying to sell one of her creations. After some playful banter, he buys her dress for triple the original price. Robert invites Ella to an upcoming ball, where he promises she can mingle with people from around the world who will want to buy her designs.
On the day of the ball, Ella'sstepmotherVivian forbids her to attend, as Ella has already been promised in marriage to Thomas the vegetable merchant. Vivian throws ink on Ella's dress, ensuring that onlyher own daughtersMalvolia and Narissa can attend.
Though Ella's hopes are dashed, herfairy godparentFab G comes to her aid. He uses magic to outfit her in a gown of her own design and a pair of glass shoes. Mice become footmen for a crate transformed into a carriage that takes Ella to the ball. There she meets visiting queen Tatiana, who offers to take Ella around the world as her personal dressmaker. She also meets Robert's sister Princess Gwen, who is wearing the dress Ella sold him in the market.
When Robert proposes to Ella, she demurs, explaining that marriage will put an end to her dressmaking dreams, which are finally within reach. Robert, whose own lifelong ambition has been to assume the throne, struggles with this answer. At the stroke of midnight, Ella leaves the ball after throwing her shoe at one of the royal attendants, who tries to catch her.
The next day, Vivian reveals her own bitter story, trying to make Ella understand that going off to pursue one's personal dreams is incompatible with love and marriage. Seeing the remaining glass slipper in Ella's room, she realizes she is the mystery girl the prince has been seeking, so she tries to convince her to marry Robert. When Ella refuses, Vivian gives her to Thomas.
With the help of Queen Beatrice, King Rowan accepts that Robert wishes to marry a commoner, giving him the glass slipper as he searches for Ella. She, having run away from Thomas, is reunited with Robert in a forest, where they profess their love for each other and share a kiss. The pair reach the market in time to show her designs to her benefactor, Tatiana, who accepts them and invites Ella to travel with her.
Robert introduces Ella to the king and queen, and informs them of their shared decision to travel the world. Though this nullifies his future ascension to the throne, Beatrice smiles as Rowan proudly names Gwen (who has repeatedly shown an interest and ability in affairs of state)first in line to the throne. Citizens of the kingdom gather to witness and celebrate as the royal family officially announce these developments.

On September 1, 1987,the Coca-Cola Companyannounced plans to spin offColumbia Pictures, which it had owned since 1982. Under this arrangement, Coca-Cola would sell its entertainment assets (Coca-Cola's Entertainment Business Sector) toTriStar Pictures, of which it owned 39.6%. Tri-Star would be renamed Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. (CPE), with Coca-Cola owning 49%, its shareholders owning 31%, and Tri-Star's shareholders owning 20%.[7][8]As part of a merger plan, the two television businesses, comprising Columbia/Embassy Television andTri-Star Television, merged altogether to form a new incarnation of the originalColumbia Pictures Television.[9]
The merger enabled three top Tri-Star executives, namely Arnold Messner, who ranTri-Star Telecommunications, Victor A. Kaufman, who ran the main Tri-Star Pictures studio, andScott Siegler, who ranTri-Star Televisionto stay on, while four of the Coca-Cola Entertainment Business Sector departed, namelyBarbara Corday, who ranColumbia/Embassy Televisionas president, Herman Rush and Peter Seale, who ranCoca-Cola Telecommunications, and Brian McGrath, who was the president of the Coca-Cola Entertainment Business Sector.[10]In early December 1987, former Coke EBS vice president Kenneth Lemberger exited the post to joinTri-Star Pictures, displacing Roger Faxon, who had joined Columbia Pictures as senior vice president of the studio.[11]
The merger was approved by shareholders on December 15, 1987, and it was completed two days later. Columbia and Tri-Star brands would be used as separate and autonomous production entities, and would be part of CPE whole, along with the prior assets, units and commitments of the former Coca-Cola Entertainment Business Sector, which included all feature, TV, home video, and pay cable operations as well as the Entertainment Sector's feature production deal withNelson Entertainmentand its investment inCastle Rock Entertainment, andTeleVentures; a company it continues to own, which was linked to three independent companies:Tri-Star Pictures,Stephen J. Cannell ProductionsandWitt/Thomas Productions.Merv Griffin Enterprisescontinue to function as a separate operation.[12]A new company was formed in early 1988 with the Tri-Star name to take over the studio's operations.[13]
In early January 1988, CPE announced that they would revive the Triumph branding for the new worldwide subsidiary,Triumph Releasing Corporation, which was functioned as a theatrical distributor, marketing and promotion forColumbiaandTri-Starfilms, and named Patrick N. Williamson as president of the unit and the company provided administrative services related to distribution of its films in North America, while internationally, would be responsible for the direction of each studio.[14]

(NASDAQ: GPEC; formerlyBarris Industries, Inc.) to acquire CPE for $200 million when Sony hiredPeter GuberandJon Petersto be its co-chairmen.[16]This was all led byNorio Ohga, who was the president and CEO of Sony during that time.[17]
The hiring of Guber and Peters by Sony to run Columbia was conflicted by a previous contract the producers had signed atWarner Bros.Time Warner's chairman,Steve Ross, threatened Sony with a lawsuit forbreach of contract. The lawsuit would be subsequently dropped when Sony sold half-interest inColumbia Houseand cable distribution rights to Columbia's feature films, TV movies, and miniseries to Warner Bros. That same agreement also saw Columbia sell its 35% interest in the Burbank Studios and acquiredLorimar Studios, previously theMGMlot, from Warner Bros.[18][19]

On November 8, 1989, Sony completed the acquisition by a "short-form" merger of its wholly owned subsidiary Sony Columbia Acquisition Corporation into CPE under theDelaware General Corporation Law. Sony also completed a tender offer for shares of common stock of the Guber-Peters Entertainment Company on November 6, 1989, and acquired the company 3 days later. The acquisition cost Sony $4.9 billion ($3.55 billion for shares and $1.4 billion of long-term debt) and was backed (financed) by five major Japanese banksMitsui,Tokyo,Fuji,MitsubishiandIndustrial Bank of Japan.[20][21][22]
The company was renamed as Sony Pictures Entertainment on August 7, 1991.[23][24]Also that year, Jon Peters left Columbia to start Peters Entertainment with a three-year exclusive production agreement at the studio at first, before transitioning to a non-exclusive deal at the studio.[25]Longtime CPE employeeLaurie MacDonaldalso left to start Aerial Pictures at the studio, first for a two-year deal, before going to20th Century Foxin 1993, and being swallowed up byAmblin Entertainmentlater that year, eventually setting upDreamWorks.[26]
Sony has since created numerous other film production and distribution units, such as creatingSony Pictures Classicsfor art-house fare, by forming Columbia TriStar Pictures (also known as the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group) by merging Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures in 1998, revitalizing Columbia's former television division Screen Gems.

Menzel sang "Let it Go" at the86th Academy Awardsin March 2014, where the song eventually won theAcademy Award for Best Original Song. While introducing her performance, actorJohn Travoltamispronounced her name as "Adele Dazeem"; the mispronunciation was widely ridiculed by fans and the media, and subsequently became a viralInternet meme.[121]Although initially thrown off by the incident,[122]Menzel was not upset about the mishap, and credits it with introducing her to a wider audience.[123][122]To promote her then-current role in Broadway'sIf/Then, the production printed satiricalplaybillsthat credited Menzel as Adele Dazeem, and referenced her previous credits inNert(Rent),Wicked-ly(Wicked), andFarfignugen(Frozen).[124][125]Shortly after the ceremony, Travolta publicly apologized to Menzel.[124]At the87th Academy Awardsthe following year, Menzel presented Best Original Song with Travolta and jokingly introduced him as "Glom Gazingo", who finally pronounced her name correctly upon joining her on stage.[126]
Although Menzel had already been well known within the Broadway community prior to working with Disney, she was not as recognized outside of her stage credits.[76]The success ofFrozen, "Let it Go", and the Oscars incident are credited with establishing Menzel as an international superstar,[76][127][128]helping bolster her film and music careers beyond musical theatre.[76][127][128]She considers Travolta mispronouncing her name to be "one of the best things that happened for my career".[122]
In 2015, Menzel was slated to star on theEllen DeGeneres–produced sitcomHappy Time, which would have been her first television role sinceGlee.[129]However, the project never came to fruition.[129]
Following the success ofFrozen, Menzel continued to pursue more prominent roles in film and television projects. She starred as CC Bloom, a role originated by one of her idolsBette Midler,[130]inLifetime's2017 remakeof the 1988 filmBeaches.[131][132]Themelodramafollows the decades-long friendship and rivalry between a brassy singer (Menzel) and a reserved lawyer, played byNia Long.[133][134]Due to her typical avoidance ofrevivalsand fondness for the original film, Menzel was initially hesitant to star in the project, but ultimately embraced the remake as an opportunity to introduce a classic story about female friendship to a younger generation.[135]The remake was conceived around Menzel's singing career in a similar manner to how the original incorporated Midler's,[136]whose songs she covered for the film's soundtrack.[130]Premiering to mixed reviews,[75][137]several critics found the remake inferior to the original, but praised Menzel's musical contributions.[138][139]CNN's Brian Lowry said "the lure of providing Menzel an opportunity to let loose on these familiar tunes is more than enough to qualify as a win for Lifetime, even if the movie itself ... never achieves liftoff".[140]Katie Rife ofThe A.V. Club, Linda Holmes ofNPR, and MaryAnn Sleasman ofTV Guideeach found Menzel's acting adequate but lacking the conviction and humor Midler brought to the role, resulting in a less compelling version of the same character.[136][139][141]
In 2019, she starred oppositeAdam Sandlerin the crime thrillerUncut Gems, playing his character's estranged and frustrated wife Dinah Ratner.[142]The role was considered a stark departure for Menzel, who longed to be involved in a project that differed from thefamily-friendlymaterial she had become synonymous with.[143]DirectorsJosh and Benny Safdiecast her based on her performance as a similar character inSkintight, and Menzel drew upon personal experience for the role, having grown up around confident women like Dinah in New York.[143]She described Dinah as "the voice for how the audience feels as they're going through this roller-coaster ride" and avoided devolving her into merely a stereotype.[144]The film and Menzel's performance drew critical acclaim.[145][144]Writing forThe Post and Courier, Jocelyn Noveck found Menzel "compelling in the rare role that doesn't make use of her famous singing voice",[146]while Johnny Oleksinski of theNew York Postcalled her "delightfully abrasive".[147]
In 2021, Menzel co-starred alongsideCamila Cabello,Billy Porter, andJames CordeninKay Cannon'sjukebox musicaladaptationof theCinderellafairy tale, playing Cinderella's (Cabello) unkind stepmother Vivian.[148]Despite admiring actresses who had played the villainous role prior, Menzel wanted to eschew "the archetypal kind of idea of the straight-ahead evil nemesis" in order to uncover the trauma behind the character's cruel nature.[149]In addition to performing several covers for the film,[150]Menzel wrote and recorded an original song for her character entitled "Dream Girl",[151]which was shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.[152]Cinderellareceived mixed reviews,[153]but Menzel's performance was praised:IndieWire's Kristen Lopez said she played the character "deliciously",[154]whileRichard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesdescribed Menzel as "her usual spectacular self" and "arguably the most nuanced and empathetic 'evil' stepmother in 'Cinderella' history".[155]Michael Calleri of theNiagara Gazettesaid Menzel delivers the film's best performance.[156]
In 2022, Menzel reprised her role as Nancy in theEnchantedsequelDisenchanted.[157]Now the Queen of Anadalasia as Edward's (James Marsden) wife,[158]Menzel's character sings for the first time,[159][160]in addition to serving as the film's "voice of reason".[161]A pop version of Menzel's song, "Love Power", was released as thesoundtrack's lead single in November 2022.Disenchantedreceived mixed reviews; most critics appreciated hearing Menzel sing,[161][162][163]while others found her role brief and her song unmemorable.[164][165]Marya E. Gates ofRogerEbert.comcalled Menzel's performance "one of the few that manages to transcend beyond the subpar trappings of" the film, lamenting that she is "relegated to only a handful of scenes".[166]She also starred in an episode of theHGTVshowCelebrity I.O.U.with theProperty BrothersDrewandJonathan Scott.[167]In this episode, she helped the brothers renovate a garage for her friend James.[168][169]
In 2023, Menzel played Bree Friedman in the coming-of-age comedyYou Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah, reuniting with Sandler.[170]Directed by Sammi Cohen,[171]the film co-stars Menzel and Sandler as Jewish parents raising an adolescent girl as they prepare for herbat mitzvah.[172]Menzel had previously played Sandler's wife inUncut Gems, while Sandler's real-life wife and children also co-star inYou Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah.[173]Writing for theLos Angeles Times, Gary Goldstein said Menzel fits in well among Sandler's own family,[174]while Matthew Jackson ofThe A. V. Clubsaid the duo make "a wonderful (and wonderfully grumpy) couple".[175]Abhishek Srivastava ofThe Times of Indiasaid Menzel "comes across as extremely authentic and hits all the right notes".[176]
She also starred inAmerican Murdererdirected by Matthew Gentile.[177]During the ongoing time of the COVID-19 pandemic, Menzel created and launched a brand new YouTube web series for children entitledIdina's Treehouse. The series featured Menzel from her treehouse out in her Los Angeles home that originally was built for her son Walker Nathaniel Diggs. It features a full set of songs, stories, and appearances from Menzel's family and friends.[178]In 2024, alongside Chenoweth, Menzel made a cameo appearance during the "One Short Day" sequence in thefilm adaptationofWicked.[179]
Menzel possesses amezzo-sopranovocal range that spans approximately three octaves.[114][106][183][184][150]For thePittsburgh Post-Gazette, Sharon Eberson wrote that Menzel's voice "could be categorized ascoquettishto flat-outbelterand everything in between—and with a stage presence to match—she usually is labeled a mezzo-soprano. But whypigeonholesomeone so intriguingly offbeat?"[185]Eberson observed that she "interprets songs as much as an actress as a singer," believing, "therein lies her connection to the music and her fans."[185]Describing Menzel as a loud soprano similar to Broadway actressEthel Merman,Stephen HoldenofThe New York Timeswrote "The sound she creates when she belts ... is a primal cry embedded in her being that insists that we listen and pay attention."[185]Holden observed that her voice can alternate between "babyish and demanding, or it can sound grand and imperial" depending on the song choice.[186]According to Andrew Gans ofPlaybill, Menzel has "one of the most unique voices of her generation, a pliablealtothat can be sweet and girlish in its middle register and then easily soar to pop-influenced top notes way abovehigh C."[23]FrozensongwriterKristen Anderson-Lopezdescribed Menzel's voice as "a warm hug" with "this warmth and this vulnerability down low. And then, as you bring her higher and higher, she gets stronger and stronger, and more powerful. She just reaches into your soul when she's singing these big, giant songs."[105]
Menzel is known for her signature high belting style; theKennedy Centerwebsite cites Menzel as a prime example of a "Broadway Belter" who uses the technique to her advantage.[187]Theater criticCharles Isherwoodsaid the singer "has a voice that is very much her own," describing it as "totally distinctive" with "a great belt and a great range."[188]Describing Menzel's voice as "husky ... which sometimes veers toward shrieking until she effortlessly reins herself in or, amazingly, kicks it up another notch," Melissa Ruggieri ofThe Atlanta Journal-Constitutionbelieves she possesses "a superior instrument" both live and in-studio.[189]Explaining her own technique, Menzel said she avoids moving her shoulders while singing and prefers "to take a smaller breath for a bigger, longer note because there's less air that will come pummeling out."[190]She also maintains her voice by constantly steaming and practicingvocal warm ups,[188]describing her routine as "very ritualistic" and "disciplined".[191]Despite her live vocals earning consistent acclaim,[180][192]some critics have criticized Menzel's belting for sounding "screechy".[193]Schuyler Velasco ofThe Christian Science Monitorobserved that the singer "made a career out of belting notes that would fry the vocal chords of mere mortals", but felt the emotion of her performances sometimes suffers at the hands of her vocal proficiency.[65]Velasco cited her rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" atSuper Bowl XLIXas an example of Menzel sacrificing excitement and inspiration for technique, yet delivering an adequate performance nonetheless.[65]Menzel addressed such criticisms during a 2014 concert, explaining that she wishes to sing loud, proud and "from the heart" like her idols Merman and Aretha Franklin.[193]Tim Smith ofThe Baltimore Sunwrote that Menzel's "high-wattage vocal cords and intense phrasing ... [make] a mark whenever she sings."[188]Menzel admits that she finds some of her most famous songs challenging, namely songs from theFrozenfilms, which "push her to vocal extremes" and require constant warming up and sometimes lowering the key for live performances.[105]The term "powerhouse" has often been used in the media to describe Menzel's vocal ability.[194][195][196][197][198]
Menzel's vocal style has drawn comparisons to singerBarbra Streisand, whose song "Don't Rain on My Parade" she often covers, including in tribute to her at the 2008 Kennedy Center Honors.[180][199]Menzel said she had long aspired to have a career as successful as Streisand to whose Jewish upbringing Menzel has also been compared, with fans deeming her "the next big Jewish icon in music".[180]Menzel was particularly inspired by Streisand's performance in the filmA Star is Born(1976),[200]and cites singers Franklin,Billie Holiday,Etta James,Chaka KhanandSarah Vaughanamong her vocal idols.[20][201][202]Despite emulating her inspirations, Menzel claims she maintains the importance of "finding [her] own voice."[20]Some critics have dubbed Menzel "the Streisand of her generation".[181][182][203]Similar comparisons have been drawn between Menzel and singerBette Midler.[180]
Professionally trained as a classical singer from age eight, Menzel decided to pursue different genres such asR&Bandjazzonce she began high school.[204]Upon becoming a wedding singer, Menzel was eventually exposed to a wide variety of musical genres, ranging from jazz to rock andMotown,[204]and would often experiment with new arrangements of traditional songs.[191]She credits her wedding singer background with training her to improvise new vocal arrangements, which in turn helps herad-libalternative versions of songs when she is feeling unwell or her voice is tired.[191]Her set lists tend to incorporate an eclectic combination of original material and covers of popular pop, rock, musical theatre and film songs,[205]selecting an assortment of songs she expects fans want to hear and feels inspired to attempt new interpretations of.[206]Jay Handelman of theSarasota Herald-Tribuneopined that Menzel's song choices "reinforce her own offbeat personality."[205]According to Menzel, her song selections usually indicate a milestone, choosing to convey a stories and memories about her life using music.[195]Menzel often opts to perform barefoot in concert, which has become a trademark of her live performances.[193]She also enjoys conversing with audience members in-between musical performances.[182]In addition to her vocal prowess, Menzel has been noted for her charming and witty banter;[182][127]Smith described her as "a pro at delivering stage banter and as quick on the draw with one-liners as seasoned stand-up comedians."[188]On her stage presence,The Denver Postcritic Ray Mark Rinaldi wrote that Menzel delivers "the kind of self-assurance that can only come from beating out Kristin Chenoweth for a Tony. She comes out on stage, dressed like she doesn't care, acting a little dizzy, but knowing all along she's gonna hit the right notes."[207]
Menzel has become closely associated with songs about self-empowerment,[206][208]specifically herSignature Songs"Defying Gravity" and "Let it Go".[209]Discussing Disneyauthor Amy M. Davis believes Menzel's voice "has become associated with rebellion for Broadway fans."[209]However, the artist claims such themes have made her feel fraudulent at times because she herself does not always feel empowered.[20]Subsequently, she began incorporating more emotional material into her sets, such asRadiohead's "Creep".[20][206]Although Menzel co-writes most of her own material as a singer-songwriter,[151][210][211][212]she considers herself a collaborator rather than a songwriter, explaining that she prefers working with professional songwriters or producers: "They start playing some music, and I like to sing… I can sing melodies, I come up with titles and lyrical ideas, but I'm really not good at making decisions."[191]She has frequently collaborated with songwriter and producerGlen Ballard, and tends to draw upon lyrics from her personal diary and melodies from a tape recorder.[201]Menzel claims she has never completed writing a song entirely on her own, finding the process to be too stressful: "I never had a good song that I wrote, so to ... act like I'm this great songwriter, I would be just a fraud. But, I'm good at bringing myself to it—being a good collaborator in the room."[191]She citesJoni MitchellandAnnie Lennoxamong her musical influences, describing them as "singer-songwriters who had these amazing voices but also were incredible storytellers and lyricists", while expressing admiration for musiciansBono,StingandSeal.[201]The Ithacan's Preston Arment observed that "what Menzel may lack in songwriting ability, she makes up for with stunning vocals that remind us why listeners will never stop loving her."[213]AllMusicbiographer Marcy Donelson described Menzel's studio albums as a combination ofAdult Alternative,vocal, andcontemporary popmusic.[214]Menzel's fifth studio album, which she considers to be her most personal to-date, contains a combination of ballads and upbeat tracks that explore themes about home, personal loss, empowerment,[213]relationships and starting over, much of which was inspired by her divorce from Taye Diggs.[211][197]Bailey Flynn ofThe Heightsbelieves the album demonstrates several trademarks for which Menzel has become known: "power balladsthat give her huge vocal range and mind-blowing control all the chance they need to show off."[197]
Menzel described performing her own songs live as "scarier" than singing covers or songs from established shows because "You're a little bit more transparent. There's no costume or character I'm hiding behind ... yet sometimes it's more rewarding because of that", describing the feeling of hearing fans sing songs she has written herself as "incredible".[201]
Menzel has been called one of Broadway's greatest performers.[20][215][216][217][218][219]Tim Beedle ofDC.comdeclared her "arguably the most widely recognized Broadway star in the country".[220]Several media publications havenicknamedher the "Queen of Broadway" due to her success and impact on the genre.[221][222][223][224][225][226][227][228]Often described as one of the defining singing voices of her generation,[229][230]Apple Musicreferred to her as "one of the 21st century's premier vocalists".[231]Jenny Singer ofGlamourdeclared Menzel one of history's greatest musical theatre vocalists,[232]while Valerie Complex ofDeadline Hollywoodcalled her an influential performer who has "left an indelible mark on the industry".[233]TheToronto Sun's Jim Slotek dubbed her "this generation's Broadway icon".[234]In a 2020retrospective,Cleveland.com's Troy L. Smith named Menzel the best vocalist of 2013, claiming the success of that year's "Let it Go" only cemented her legacy as "one of Broadway's greatest stars of all time".[215]The previous year,BroadwayWorldrecognized Menzel as one of the decade's 10 most influential Broadway stars.[235]Time Outranked Menzel the 19th greatest female Broadway actress of all time, observing that she established a "stratospheric reputation" largely based on the popularity of only two roles:RentandWicked.[236]Vulture's Jackson McHenry attributed the popularity and endurance of "Defying Gravity" to Menzel, believing few singers can service the song as successfully as she has.[237]In 2018,NPRnamed "Let it Go" one of the 200 greatest female-performed songs of the 21st century, at number 182.[238]
Menzel's successfulcrossoverfrom stage actor to television, film, and music star have been discussed at length,[128]withRedbookdubbing her "One of [Broadway's] biggest crossover success stories".[239]Menzel's biography onStarzdescribed her as the kind of stage-to-screen star Broadway seldom produces anymore.[184]Marty Hughley ofThe Oregonianshared a similar sentiment, writing in 2012 that although Broadway does not guarantee global superstardom as often as it used to, Menzel is "a notable exception to the rule of Broadway’s declining clout".[240]Original Broadway cast recordings ofRentandIf/Then, both albums prominently featuring Menzel as a soloist, debuted within the top-20 of theBillboard 200.[110]In a 2014 article,Billboardtheorized that Menzel's crossover success "bodes well for Broadway's would-be stars", believing "Let it Go" "kicked open the door for future composers of stage and screen".[241]When Menzel returned to Broadway in 2014 shortly after the success ofFrozen, Suzy Evans ofBillboardobserved that audience reception was more akin to that of a "rock star" than a musical theatre performer.[242]Menzel's fanbase has nicknamed themselves "Fanzels".[242]In addition to her perceived authenticity, Isherwood attributes the artist's large following to the successes ofRentandWicked: "two era-defying, hugely successful Broadway musicals".[188]Toronto Startheatre criticRichard Ouzouniancredits the same two shows with solidifying her reputation as one of the industry's "most dynamic musical theatre stars".[243]She has been described as "Broadway royalty", due to a combination of her successful stage career and playing royalty in several Disney projects.[244][245]
According to Akiva Gottlieb of theLos Angeles Times, Menzel's public persona is largely defined by her performances inFrozenandWicked, and recording Christmas albums.[143]As an actress, Menzel has earned a reputation for playing misunderstood characters both on stage and in film,[151]admitting she gravitates towards complex roles.[149][246]She cited power and vulnerability as common traits among characters she has played.[247]According to theIrish Independent, Menzel has become "a go-to actress for producers looking for a feisty female lead",[248]whileThe Globe and Mail's Courtney Shea said she "forged her career playing strong and sensational females".[247]Menzel believes Broadway has always offered compelling roles for women of all ages, whereas she considers Hollywood to be more susceptible toageismandsexism.[248]Menzel is revered as arole modelfor young women, particularly due to her role as Elsa which has contributed her a large following among predominantly femaleFrozenfans.[249]Although she takes her responsibility as a role model seriously,[249]she has stated that she does not always feel like a role model in her personal life and feels uncomfortable bearing the responsibility at times.[248][250]Menzel has a prominent gay following,[251][252]dating back to the 1990s when she starred inRent.[228][253]Rentwas also one of the first Broadway shows to show a lesbian relationship.[227]The performer attributes this to playing several repressed characters who are "hiding something within them that they’re afraid to let people see, and then finally they embrace it".[253]Michael Heaton, a critic forThe Plain Dealer, noted that some parents have expressed concerns about the "blue humor" Menzel uses in her typical concerts in an attempt to appeal to both her adult gay and young fans.[252]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
