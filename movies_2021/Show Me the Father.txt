Show Me the Fatheris a 2021 AmericanChristiandocumentary filmby directorRick Altizer, presenting five fatherhood-related stories connected with commentary byTony Evans, produced by Mark Miller and executive produced by the Kendrick brothers. It is the Kendrick brothers' seventh film and their third through their subsidiary,Kendrick Brothers Productions. It was theatrically released on September 10, 2021.[3]
The film covers the fatherhood stories of good fathers, absent fathers, and abusive fathers. It also details the adoption ofStephen Kendrick's daughter from China, and the blessings that the Kendrick brothers' father Larry pronounced for them at each of their respective weddings.
With the exception of Evans, who provides Christian, faith-based commentary on topics of fatherhood, adoption, and sonship,[4]each person featured in the film relates their personal stories of experiencing fatherhood. While the five main stories focus on men, several of their mothers and wives also provide their perspectives on the events depicted, as does Larry Kendrick, Alex and Stephen's father.[5]
Quoted inThe Christian Post, executive producer Stephen Kendrick said "We want people to learn how to relate to God as the perfect Father they've always wanted and longed for, but never had," he added. "The fatherhood of God was the design for God creating fatherhood on Earth. All the roles that dad is supposed to play on Earth come from God's roles in our lives."[5]
Show Me the Fatheris the Kendrick brothers' seventh film and the third produced by their company,Kendrick Brothers. Their initial four films were created underSherwood Pictures.[6]
Released on September 10, 2021, the film made $700,181 from 1,073 theaters in its opening weekend.[7]
The Christian Postpositively reacted to the film.[5]Writing forCrosswalk.com, Michael Foust said that "Show Me the Fatherisn't a boring documentary. Like the Kendricks Brothers' feature films, it inspires and convicts you – and leaves you reaching for the box of tissue."[8]Reviewing forWorld Radio, Collin Garbario praised the film but suggested the filmmakers could have "broadened their interviews to include more perspectives on the importance of fathers.  For example, we don't really get to hear about the legacy that a good or bad father can leave on a woman's life."[4]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film a rare average grade of "A+", the fourth consecutive top score for a Kendrick Brothers-produced film,[9]whilePostTrakreported 88% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 67% saying they would definitely recommend it.[7]

Movie critic Phil Boatwright, aBaptist Presscolumnist, said of the Kendricks: "One gets the impression this is their ministry, while at the same time understanding the No. 1 rule of cinematic storytelling -- story must come first."[25]Movie reviewer Michael Foust said in aBaptist Pressfeature on the Kendricks: "They've been the Lewis and Clark of the genre. No, they weren't the first to make faith movies, but they did it better than anyone who came before -- and Hollywood noticed. They were trailblazers who made first-class movies on shoestring budgets." Foust added, "Even more impressive, the Kendricks have continued to improve on their craft.War Roomwas better thanCourageous, which was better thanFireproof,which was better thanFacing the Giants, which was better thanFlywheel. Remember:War Roomwas the No. 1 movie at the box office in its second weekend in 2015. That's an accomplishment that many well-known Hollywood directors haven't achieved. The Kendricks also have been models of humility, giving all credit to God while working to help raise up the next generation of filmmakers."[25]
In addition to filmmaking, Kendrick has co-written five novels from his films, the last four of which became bestsellers. The first three were written with his brother, Stephen, and novelist Eric Wilson. The fourth novel,Courageous, was written with Randy Alcorn.

Jim Daly(born July 22, 1961) is the head ofFocus on the Family,[1]an internationalChristiancommunications ministry based inColorado Springs, Colorado.  He succeeded founderJames Dobsonin 2005.[1]
Daly is the main host of the Focus on the Family radio program.[2]
Daly grew up inSouthern California. He was abandoned by his alcoholic father at age five, and orphaned by his mother's death fromcancerwhen he was nine. He was then placed in a foster home, initially inMorongo Valley, California, until he moved in with his older brothers and then with his father, who eventually turned back to alcohol and died. By the time that Daly was a senior in high school, he was living on his own.[3]
Daly experienced a Christian conversion at age 15 while attending a camp run by theFellowship of Christian Athletes. He went on to study atCalifornia State University, San Bernardino, and eventually earned hisMaster of Business AdministrationfromRegis University.[4]
Daly worked in the paper industry until he was recruited to join Focus on the Family, at one-third of his six-figure private-sector pay.[4]
He has worked at Focus on the Family for 16 years in a variety of positions, including assistant to the president for Public Affairs, Vice President of the International Division, and a Group Vice President under former Secretary of Energy and Secretary of the InteriorDonald P. Hodel(then President of Focus on the Family), before ascending to the presidency.
In 2009, theDenver Postreported that Daly shared Dobson's views in the public-policy arena, but had taken a different approach from that of his predecessor.  Daly referred to himself as more of anevangelistthan aprophet.[4]He believed that the Christian community should demonstrate the values it wishes to promote, and maintain civil discourse.[4][5][6]
While Dobson's approach was often political, Daly and his colleagues have said that he is trying to make it less so.[7][8][9]
According to reports from 2009 and 2010, Daly and his colleagues, similarly to Dobson, opposedabortionandsame-sex marriage, but also wished to address issues other than these typicalevangelicalhot-button issues;[5]they "want[ed] to frame political work as an inspirational call to do good—not just to oppose what they view[ed] as sinful behavior."[7]
In a 2009 interview with theWashington Post, Daly stated,
I am pro-life, I am pro-traditional marriage. At the same time, I'm also a person who looks for the conversation. ... The question I have is, Where can we meet on common ground?
Daly also told thePost, "We will definitely be rigorous in the policy debate. We're not going to back out of that or back off expressing a biblical worldview in the public square."[10]
Daly said that he wished to make abortion much rarer as a step toward eliminating it.[11][12]
In addition to meeting with abortion rights groups at the state and local levels, Daly met with organizational leaders who were traditionally at odds with conservative Protestants, including the Colorado-based gay rights organization theGill Foundation.[13]Daly also participated in the White House's Fatherhood Initiative.[5]With theColorado Springs Independentthe two organizations co-sponsored an event supporting foster families.[14]
Daly's childhood experience possibly influenced him to start Wait No More, an organization that encourages Christians to adopt children. Wait No More possibly led to a drop in the number of children in foster care in Colorado from 900 to 365.[15]Daly wants Colorado to become the first state to "wipe out the waiting list for foster care."[12]
In 2012, it was reported that Daly reached out to the younger generation through writing for Catalyst, a ministry that develops Christian leaders, and through various speaking engagements at venues such asKings Collegein NYC, as well as "The Civil Conversations Project" fromOn BeingwithKrista Tippett, featuring conversation between Daly and Q Ideas leader Gabe Lyons.[16]
In 2017, an Associated Press story published by theDenver Postreported that under Daly, Focus on the Family "has scaled back involvement in politics ... [Daly] sees himself as part of a younger generation of religious leadership. ... 'Jesus does not go after Caesar much -- he dealt with people at their point of need,' Daly said, touting the ministry's radio show, counseling and efforts promoting foster care and adoption."[17]A similar assessment is made by religious-studies scholar Susan B. Ridgely, writing in 2017 that Daly has "reached out to second-generation evangelicals ... by softening Dobson's stance on homosexuality, matching anti-abortion rhetoric with pro-adoption and foster care discussion, and keeping open dialogue with all regardless of political party."[18]
Daly hosts a radio broadcast with John Fuller.[2]He has interviewed numerous Christian leaders and notable guests, includingDrew Brees,Pam and Bob Tebow,Dave Ramsey,Rosaria Butterfield, authorGary Chapman,Chuck Colson,Larry Crabb,Tim Keller, Kevin Leman,Max Lucado,Eric Metaxas,Jerry Jenkins,John Ortberg,Lee Strobel,Gary Thomas,Philip Yancey,Mark Burnett,Roma Downey, and former U.S. presidentGeorge W. Bush.
Daly has appeared on national television programs such asFox and Friends,Larry King Live,America Live with Megyn Kelly, andABC World News Tonight.  In 2010 he was named one of the nation's top new evangelical leaders byNewsweek.[citation needed]He relates the story of his difficult upbringing in the 2021Kendrick BrothersdocumentaryShow Me the Father.
Daly is also a regular panelist forThe Washington Post/Newsweekblog "On Faith."

Illinois recovered the fumble and drove for the game-winning touchdown.
Before the Illinois game, George had carried the ball 25 times and scored 5 touchdowns, but he had only 12 more rushing attempts and no more touchdowns for the rest of the year. In the following season, George was listed in the depth chart as the team's third-string running back, behindRaymont Harris. He carried the ball just 42 times, mostly when Ohio State had a large lead late in games, but showed his potential by averaging 5.3 yards per carry. As a junior, George became the team's starting running back and went on to rush for 1,442 yards and 12 touchdowns.
As a senior in the 1995 season, George rushed for a school-record 1,927 yards and 24 touchdowns, an average of 148.23 yards per game, while also catching 47 passes for 417 yards and another score (George only caught 16 passes in his first three seasons).

He also rushed for a school-record 314 yards and scored 3 touchdowns in OSU's victory overIllinois.
In the 3 years after his 2 fumbles as a freshman, George had over 600 rushing attempts and fumbled only 6 times. Ohio State finished the season with an 11–2 record. George was recognized as aunanimous All-American. He won theHeisman Trophyin the closest vote in the history of the award at the time, beatingNebraska'sTommie Frazierby 264 votes. George left Ohio State second in school history in career rushing yards (3,768) and third in rushing touchdowns (44). Overall, he finished with 4,284 all-purpose yards, 45 touchdowns, and a 5.5 yards per carry average.
George was a first-round draft selection (14th overall pick) of theHouston Oilers(now theTennessee Titans) in the 1996 NFL Draft, being selected afterJerome Bettiselected to be traded to therivalPittsburgh Steelersover the Oilers when theSt. Louis Ramsreplaced Bettis withLawrence Phillips.[6][7]George won theNFL Rookie of the Year awardin 1996, and was the Oilers/Titans' startingtailbackthrough 2003, never missing a start.

Though George rushed for 1,000 yards in all but one season, numerous sportswriters suggested that a heavy workload caused a decline in George's productivity. In five of his eight seasons with the Titans, George carried the ball over 330 times. In 2001, George averaged just 2.98 per carry, the fourth lowest number in league history among running backs with more than 200 rushing attempts in a season.[9]George's decline in production along with several toe and ankle injuries were contributing factors in Titans ownerBud Adams' decision to release him on July 21, 2004, in part due tosalary capconsiderations, after George would not agree to a pay cut.[10]
On July 23, 2004, George signed a one-year contract with theDallas Cowboysfor $1.5 million-plus incentives that could have earned him more than the $4.25 million he would have made under his previous contract with the Titans.[11]George only started 8 games for Dallas while rookieJulius Joneswas out for two months with a fracturedscapula. He became the backup running back when Jones returned midway through the season, finishing with 432 yards on 132 carries and 4 touchdowns. He officially retired in 2006.
His career totals include 10,441 rushing yards, 268 receptions, 2,227 receiving yards, and 78 touchdowns (68 rushing and 10 receiving).
In 2019, George had his No. 27 jersey number retired by the Tennessee Titans, along with his former teammateSteve McNair’s No. 9 jersey.[12]In 2021, he became a semifinalist (of the 26-person Modern-Era list) for thePro Football Hall of Fame, the first time he had made the stage since he was eligible.[13]
As of the 2017 NFL off-season, Eddie George still held at least 28 Titans franchise records, including:
George was named the head coach atTennessee Stateon April 13, 2021.[18]He signed a five-year deal that paid $400,000 annually.[19]
In 2024, his fourth year as Tennessee State head coach, George was namedBig South–OVCCoach of the Year.[20]
For 2025, George was hired as the head coach ofBowling Green State Universityin theMid-American Conference.[21]
On October 1, 2006, George was appointed spokesperson for Tennessee's GetFitTN program by GovernorPhil Bredesen. The initiative is aimed at preventingType 2 diabetesand promotion of healthier, more active lifestyles. On Saturday, April 28, 2007, George ran the Country Music Half Marathon (ending just outside then LP Field, now Nissan Stadium) in an unofficial time of 2:04:08. He wore race number 27 during the race, just as he wore number 27 during his college and NFL careers. George later stated that completing the race was tougher than playing in the NFL.
In 2008, George campaigned forSenatorBarack Obama'spresidential bid.[22]
After he retired from football, George went back to complete his bachelor's degree in landscape architecture from Ohio State. He later graduated from the Kellogg School of Management atNorthwestern University, earning his MBA degree from the Executive MBA program.[23]
In 2004, George married American singer, rapper, actress, and authorTamara "Taj" Johnson. She is best known for being a part of the groupSWV(Sisters with Voices) and later being a contestant on the18th seasonof the CBS reality showSurvivor.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
