In 1991, international assassin Moody Dutton discovers a child named Anna in the aftermath of a gang massacre inDa Nang,Vietnam. Thirty years later, Moody has raised Anna as his apprentice and adopted daughter, while she runs a rare book shop inLondonas a cover.[3]
Following a successful assassination inRomania, Anna returns home where an ill Moody shows her his headquarters under a barn next to the English manor where he lives.  After celebrating Moody's 70th birthday Anna gives him a guitar owned byAlbert King.  He then asks her to track down a person of interest named Lucas Hayes. Anna enlists her contact Benny to investigate Lucas, and encounters the mysterious Michael Rembrandt at her bookstore. Soon after, Anna finds Moody, his housekeeper, and Benny murdered.  She recovers files Moody hid from his killers, and survives a hit at her store, killing those sent to assassinate her.
The files indicate that Lucas's father Edward was a past target killed by Moody in Da Nang. Anna travels there and convinces old associate Billy Boy to help her confront Jossino Vohl, Edward's business partner who took over their company after Edward's death. She meets with Vohl and his lawyer, Duquet, but Duquet unexpectedly kills Vohl and takes Anna prisoner, demanding to know why she is seeking Hayes. During her captivity and torture, she is visited again by Rembrandt. It is revealed that Rembrandt and Duquet are rivals working for the same man. He tells her he was not involved in Moody's death or the shooting at her store, but she should drop her quest to find Lucas.
After the visit her captors try to hang Anna but she kills them, escapes and discovers that Lucas is severely disabled, cared for in a facility with a wealthy benefactor. Anna agrees to meet Rembrandt for dinner, where he urges her not to pursue his mysterious employer. After they part, Rembrandt survives a hit ordered by Duquet while Anna finds and kills Duquet at his apartment. She ambushes Rembrandt when he arrives but they give in to their mutual attraction and sleep together.
On the street, Anna is shot by Duquet's last henchman but is rescued by Moody, who faked his death by disguising his attempted killer as himself. They find out that Rembrandt's employer is holding a charity banquet at his heavily fortified mansion. Anna infiltrates that banquet disguised as a waiter but is stopped by Rembrandt. Moved to his secure bunker, the employer is confronted by Moody and is revealed to be Edward Hayes.
Edward hired Moody to perform the hit on him years ago, faking his death to hide him, his son, and his criminal empire. Moody tells Edward that he was only looking for Lucas to make amends for killing his father, and that Edward brought all this upon himself.  He discusses how he may be a bad man but Hayes is truly evil, then detonates a bomb killing Edward and himself.
Badly wounded, Anna escapes to Da Nang to the place where Moody found her as a child. It is revealed that young Anna's family was attacked by a gang who forced her to watch them kill her parents and sisters. At the gang hideout, she watched the gang leader clean and assemble a pistol before assembling one herself and using it to kill the gang before being rescued by Moody.
Rembrandt arrives, and he and Anna hold each other at gunpoint. A shot is heard.  Anna exits the building, alone.

Millennium Media(formerlyNu ImageandMillennium Films) is an American independent film production and financing company that was founded byAvi Lerner, Trevor Short, Danny Dimbort and Danny Lerner in 1992, and is one of Hollywood's[1]longest running independent film companies.[2]Millennium creates, produces, finances, and sells[3]films worldwide. The company producesaction films, most of which are filmed primarily inSouth AfricaandBulgaria(by 2005, it acquiredNu Boyana Film Studios),[4]among other locations.
In the mid-1980s,The Cannon Group, Inc.began expanding its operation into Africa, taking advantage of cheap locations and labor in countries such asZimbabweandSouth Africa.Avi Lerneropened Nu Metro Entertainment, a film production company based inJohannesburgto accommodate production demands in the countries.[5]During this time, Lerner executive produced many films, such asAmerican Ninja 2: The ConfrontationandRiver of Deathfor Cannon as well asHowling IV: The Original NightmareforHarry Alan Towers.
After pressure from anti-apartheid forces, Cannon closed its African operations in 1988,[6]Lerner created a new company, Nu Image, to produce original, low budget films alongside his brother Danny Lerner and otherCannonemployees Trevor Short, Danny Dimbort andBoaz Davidson.[5]
From 1992, Nu Image began producing multiple films a year, mainly in the action genre. Many of its films wentdirect-to-video, however some, such asShark Attackdebuted ontelevision. Many stars, writers and directors fromThe Cannon Group, Inc.appeared in films for Nu Image, includingDavid Bradley,Michael Dudikoff,Sam FirstenbergandBilly Drago. They also built a new generation of action talent such asBryan Genesse[7]andJoe Lara.[8]
However, their efforts to break into the mainstream withmockbusterssuch asFreefallstarringEric Roberts,Jeff FaheyandPamela Gidley, created to capitalise on the success ofSylvester Stallone'sCliffhangerfailed to make much of an impact.Freefallended up goingdirect-to-video.[9]
After the successes ofcreature featuressuch asAnacondaandDeep Blue Seareleased in the late 1990s, Nu Image produced a spate of low budget franchises to capitalise on the trend including;Tobe Hooper'sCrocodile,Shark Attack,Spiders,Killer Rats,OctopusandRaging Sharksand various sequels were produced from 1999 to 2005. While not critically successful, the films were extremely successful on television and home media.
In 1999, Nu Image formed a subsidiary label, Millennium Films, for higher-budget productions. From the mid-2000s, the main Nu Image company gradually began producing fewer films, with Millennium Films releasing more with a greater level of financing than previously.
In 2005, it purchasedNu Boyana Film Studiosin Bulgaria.[10]
In March 2007, Nu Image acquired a controlling 52% stake in independent film and home video companyFirst Look Studios. As a result, Nu Image and Millennium Films were given an additional outlet for home video and theatrical distribution.[11]
One of the first films to be produced by Millennium Films was the remakeThe Wicker ManstarringNicolas Cage.[12]The film was a critical and commercial failure.[13][14]They continued on with a focus onsequelsandremakesof notable properties such asDay of the Dead[15]andRambo.[16]After the commercial success ofRambo,[17][18]Millennium Films entered into a multi-year deal withLionsgateto produce several big-budgeted films, the first of which wasConan the Barbarian.[19]The deal would be extended over the years with successful box-office hits (The Mechanic[20]) andbox office bombs(The Legend of Hercules[21]). Another notable success wasOlympus Has FallenstarringGerard Butler.[22]
In November 2010, First Look filed for bankruptcy. Nu Image formed Millennium Entertainment, LLC to assume the assets of First Look.[23]
Millennium Entertainment was sold in August 2014. The company's library and distribution assets had been sold to a consortium consisting of its current management and Virgo Investment Group. The new owners renamed the companyAlchemyin January 2015, finally cutting ties to its former sister company Millennium Films, which remained under the control ofAvi Lerner.[24]Alchemy filed forChapter 7 Bankruptcyon June 30, 2016.[25]
In 2017, a deal was reached withThe Recon Group, a Chinese investment firm, for them to purchase a majority stake in the Millennium Films subsidiary.[26]The deal was signed and a $20 million downpayment was secured.[27]However, this deal was later announced to be off in August 2017 due to the Chinese government clamping down on overseas business investments.[28]The same year, Millennium Films was merged into Nu Image to form Millennium Media.
In 2017, Millennium faced sexual harassment allegations alleging hostile workplace and rampant sexual harassment and gender disparity.[29]
In 2018, actor Terry Crews testified in front of Congress that he had been threatened by Avi Lerner of Millennium Media not to testify in his sexual assault case.[30]

Keaton first appeared on TV in the Pittsburgh public television programsWhere the Heart IsandMister Rogers' Neighborhood(1975).

Keaton left Pittsburgh and moved to Los Angeles to begin auditioning for various TV parts. He popped up in various popular TV shows includingMaudeandThe Mary Tyler Moore Hour. He decided to use a stage name to satisfySAGrules, as there were already an actor (Michael Douglas) and daytime host (Mike Douglas) with the same or similar names. In response to questions as to whether he selected his new surname due to an attraction to actressDiane Keaton, or inhomageto silent film actorBuster Keaton, he has responded by saying "it had nothing to do with that".[23][24]Keaton has said in several interviews that he searched a phone book under "K", saw "Keaton" and decided to stop looking.[25][26]Keaton's film debut came in a small non-speaking role in theJoan RiversfilmRabbit Test(1978).[27]

According toLes Daniels's reference bookBatman: The Complete History, Keaton initially believed the film would be similar in tone to the1960s TV seriesstarringAdam Westbut he understood the darker, brooding side of Batman the film was going for after readingFrank Miller's comic book miniseries,The Dark Knight Returns, which he portrayed to much fan approval.[36]Keaton later reprised the role for the sequelBatman Returns(1992), which was another critically acclaimed success.[37]He was initially set to reprise the role again for a third Batman film, even going as far as to show up for costume fitting.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
