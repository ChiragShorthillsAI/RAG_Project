A year after last seeing her, 31-year-old drug addict Margaret "Molly" Wheeler walks to her mother Deb's house remembering times before her fall. She insists that she is ready to be sober and begs her mother to allow her to stay for a few days before going todetox. Deb, although ambivalent about the matter, stands resolute with the support of her husband Chris, fearing that aiding Molly in any way will serve as being anenabler. Molly spends the night outside her mother's house and is persistent about her recovery. The next morning a frustrated Deb agrees to take Molly to detox. Upon arrival, it is revealed that Molly has been an addict for over a decade, has lost custody of her children, and is on her 15th attempt atsobriety. Four days after commencing detox, she is offered anopioid antagonistin order to help her on the road to sobriety. However, she must stay off any drugs for an additional four days before it is safe for her to receive the first shot, and then expect an additional shot each month.
On her first day at home, Molly learns through Deb about many of her misdeeds during her time as an addict, many of which Molly clearly regrets. Deb remains suspicious of Molly's intentions, but by the end of the day, secretly begins to have hope.
On the second day, Sean, Molly's ex, allows her to see their children. Although, initially reluctant, they are happy to see her and make the most of their time together. She and Deb go grocery shopping, where they see Coach Miller, who invites Molly to speak to her class about drug addiction. Back at home, Deb reveals she was very unhappy with Molly's father, Dale, as she felt forced into marriage after becoming pregnant with Molly's older sister, Ashley, and this led to her walking out on the family. Molly has always held this abandonment against Deb and blames her addiction on these events. Deb dismisses this, admitting that Dale's implied mental and emotional abuse was the reason for her leaving, much to Molly's surprise.
Molly speaks to Coach Miller's class on her third day at home. While speaking to the class, she releases her emotions, and is blatant and transparent with the children about her situation and experiences, using the moment to vent. This causes Deb to openly express her optimism and hopes that this time, Molly will finally recover. Afterwards, Molly asks that Deb take her to see Sammy, a friend and fellow addict. There, Deb has a chance encounter with Molly's ex-boyfriend Eric, who inadvertently reveals that Molly was pregnant. Molly later confesses to Deb that she was pregnant, but gave the baby up foradoption. That evening, Molly receives a phone call from the detox center and learns that due to issues with her health insurance, she cannot get the shot until Monday, adding an additional three days to her wait and thus the fight against her urges. A suspicious Deb questions the call, they argue, and Molly leaves with Sean.
The additional days become excruciating for Deb as she attempts to contact Molly incessantly to no avail. On Monday morning, Molly arrives at the house urging Deb to get ready so they will not miss her appointment at the detox facility. However, before they leave Molly asks Deb for her urine, confirming Deb's suspicions. Molly further admits that she hasrelapsed. Despite this, she is adamant that she does wish to get sober, and Deb provides her urine. At the center, Molly receives the opioid antagonist shot, but due to her having drugs in her system, she goes into acute withdrawal, and they rush to the hospital.
Four months later, Molly is still living with Deb, visits her children regularly, is getting ready for her next shot, and is on her way to recovery. The film ends with a line about the real-life mother and daughter who inspired the film, Amanda Wendler (Molly) and Libby Alexander (Deb).

During her childhood, Close lived with her parents in a stone cottage on her maternal grandfather's estate in Greenwich. She began honing her acting abilities in her early years, "I have no doubt that the days I spent running free in the evocative Connecticut countryside with an unfettered imagination, playing whatever character our games demanded, is one of the reasons that acting has always seemed so natural to me."[4]Although Close has an affluent background, she has stated that her family chose not to participate inWASPsociety. She would also avoid mentioning her birthplace, the wealthy town Greenwich, whenever asked because she did not want people to think she was a "dilettantewho didn't have to work."[5]
When Close was seven years old, her parents joined theMoral Re-Armament(MRA), a movement in which her family remained involved for 15 years. During this period, Close's family lived in communal centers. She has described MRA as a "cult" that dictated every aspect of her life, from the clothes that had to be worn to what she was allowed to say. Close also spent time inSwitzerlandwhen studying atSt. George's School, and attendedRosemary Hall(now Choate Rosemary Hall), graduating in 1965.[6]She traveled for several years in the mid-to-late 1960s with the nonprofit encouragement singing groupUp With People. During her time in Up With People, Close organized a small singing group called the Green Glenn Singers, consisting of herself,Kathe Green, Jennie Dorn, and Vee Entwistle. The group's stated mission was "to write and sing songs which would give people a purpose and inspire them to live the way they were meant to live".[7]
When she was 22, Close broke away from MRA.[8]She once stated that her desire to become an actress allowed her to leave the group, adding, "I have long [ago] forgiven my parents for any of this. They had their reasons for doing what they did, and I understand them. It had terrible effects on their kids, but that's the way it is. We all try to survive, right? And I think what actually saved me more than anything was my desire to be an actress."[9]She attendedThe College of William & Mary, double majoring intheaterandanthropology.[10]During her senior year of college, Close became inspired to pursue a career in acting after watching an interview ofKatharine HepburnonThe Dick Cavett Show.[11]It was in the college's theater department that Close began to train as a serious actor under Howard Scammon,William and Mary's long-time professor of theater. During her years at school inWilliamsburg, she also starred in the summer-time outdoor drama,The Common Glory, written by Pulitzer Prize authorPaul Green.[12]She was elected to membership in the honor society ofPhi Beta Kappa.[13]Through the years, Close has returned to William & Mary to lecture and to visit the theater department.[14]

Close started her professional career on the stage in 1974 at age 27.[13]In her senior year of college, she called her school's theater department to be nominated for a series of auditions through the University Resident Theatre Association andTCG.[13]Eventually, she was given a callback and hired for one season to do three plays at theHelen Hayes Theatre, one of those plays beingLove for Lovedirected byHal Prince.[16]She made her television debut in 1975 with a small role in the anthology seriesGreat Performances.

Also in 1980, she received her firstTony Awardnomination for her performance in the musicalBarnum.
In 1984, Close was given a part inRobert Redford's baseball dramaThe Natural, and although it was a small supporting role, she earned a third consecutive Oscar nomination. Close, to this day, credits her nomination to cinematographerCaleb Deschanel, stating "That hat was designed so the sunlight would come through. We waited for a certain time of day, so the sun was shining through the back of the stadium. And he had a lens that muted the people around me. It was an incredibly well thought-out shot. And I honestly think that's the reason I got nominated."[21]Close also starred oppositeRobert Duvallin the dramaThe Stone Boy(1984), a film about a family coping after their youngest child accidentally kills his older brother in a hunting accident. She continued to appear in television films in the following years, beginning withThe Elephant Man, and in 1984, she starred in the critically acclaimed dramaSomething About Amelia, a television film about a family destroyed by sexual abuse. She won her first Tony Award in 1984 forThe Real Thing, directed byMike Nichols.

Close was given favorable reviews and even received her secondGolden Globe Awardnomination, but the movie was critically panned and under-performed at the box office.[23][24]In 1985, Close starred in the legal thrillerJagged Edge, oppositeJeff Bridges.

Close eventually heard about this and said she didn't want Ransohoff on set while she was making her scenes. DirectorRichard Marquandstood by her side and sent Ransohoff away. Infuriated, Ransohoff went to the studio heads trying to get Close and Marquand fired from the picture. The studio refused, stating they were pleased with their work in the film.[25]Jagged Edgereceived mixed-to-positive reviews and grossed $40-million on a $15-million budget.[26]
In 1987, Close played the disturbed book editor Alex Forrest in the psychological thrillerFatal Attraction. The film became a huge box-office success, the highest-grossing film worldwide of that year. The film propelled Close to international stardom and the character of Alex Forrest is considered one of her most iconic roles; the phrase "bunny boiler" has even been added to the dictionary, referring to a scene from the movie. During the re-shoot of the ending, Close suffered a concussion from one of the takes when her head smashed against a mirror. After being rushed to the hospital, she discovered, much to her horror, that she was actually a few weeks pregnant with her daughter. Close stated in an interview that, "Fatal Attractionwas really the first part that took me away from the Jenny Fields, Sarah Coopers—good, nurturing women roles. I did more preparation for that film than I've ever done."[22]Close received her fourth Oscar nomination for this role, her first in the leading role[27]and also won thePeople's Choice Awardfor Favorite Motion Picture Actress.[citation needed]

In 2005, Close joined the FX crime seriesThe Shield, in which she played Monica Rawling, a no-nonsense precinct captain, which became her first TV role in a series. Close stated that she made the right move because television was in a "golden era" and the quality of some programs had already risen to the standards of film.[43]John Landgraf, CEO ofFX, stated that network was the "first to bring a female movie star of Glenn Close's stature to television." He also credits her collaboration with the network with promoting roles for women on television, as well as influencing other film actors to switch to the small screen.[44][45]
In 2007, she appeared in the same film as her previous co-starMeryl Streepin the ensemble dramaEvening. This would be Close's final theatrical film role of the decade, since she began to star in her own television series,Damages(2007). Close was asked about her contributions to independent films, to which she responded "I love the casts that gather around a good piece of writing certainly not for the money but because it is good and challenging. Sometimes I've taken a role for one scene that I thought was phenomenal. Also my presence can help them get money, so it's I think a way for me to give back."[46]Shortly after her stint onThe Shield, Close was approached byFXexecutives who pitched a television series for her to star in. Also in 2007, Close began a five-season run playing the ruthless and brilliant lawyerPatty HewesonDamages.

In December 2010, Close began filmingAlbert NobbsinDublin. She had previously won anObiein 1982 for her role in the play on stage. She had been working on the project, in which she appeared alongside101 Dalmatiansco-star Mark Williams, for almost twenty years, and aside from starring in it, she co-wrote the script and produced the film.[50]Close stated it became more important for her to make the film in order to stimulate discussion ontransgenderissues, commenting, "There came a point where I asked, 'Am I willing to live the rest of my life having given up on this?' And I said, 'No I won't.' Some people will change their point of view, and those who are either too old, or too blinkered, to accept the beauty of difference will just have to 'die off'."[51]In the film, Close played the title role ofAlbert Nobbs, a woman living as a man in 19th century Ireland after beingsexually assaultedas a young girl.
While the film overall received mixed reviews, Close's performance received critical acclaim, as it was noted for being the most subtle and introverted of her career to that point and a departure from her previous roles. When asked during the film's awards campaign about the fact of not having an Oscar, Close said: "I remember being astounded that I met some people who were really kind of almost hyper-ventilating as to whether they were going to win or not, and I have never understood that. Because if you just do the simple math, the amount of people who are in our two unions, the amount of people who in our profession are out of work at any given time, the amount of movies that are made every year, and then you're one of five [nominees]. How could you possibly think of yourself as a loser?"[52]
She provided the voice of the "Giant" in the Summer 2012 production of the musicalInto the Woodsat theDelacorte TheaterinCentral Park.

Close is regarded as an extraordinarily versatile actress with an immersive acting style and a considerable range.[111][112]Vanity Fairremarked how Close is "long considered one of the great actresses of our time."[113]James Liptondescribed her as an actor who "can find an outstanding number of layers in a role or a single moment; she is a supple actor who performs subtle feats." Close was also professionally trained by acting coachHarold Guskin, who also mentoredKevin Kline,Bridget Fonda, andJames Gandolfini. Working with Guskin, Close learned several important lessons, which she said she's applied to her career as well as her life. One such lesson, she claims, was to "read the lines off the page" and remembering to breathe. Close states, "You have to maintain a certain openness, and if you don't maintain that, you lose something vital as an actor. It's how we're wired, and it's not a bad thing."[114]Close says that she went to every rehearsal in order to master her acting skills.[115][116]
"I love the chemistry that can be created onstage between the actors and the audience. It's molecular even, the energies that can go back and forth. I started in theater, and when I first went into movies, I felt that my energy was going to blow out the camera."
Onmethod acting, Close claims that while she found it an interesting technique, it was not her preferred style.[118]Although Close does extensive research and preparation for her roles, she also relies less on the technicality of a performance saying, "Good acting I think is like being a magician, in that you make people believe; because it's only when they believe that they are moved. And I want people to get emotionally involved. I think technique is important but it isn't everything. You can have a great technical actor who'll leave people cold. That's not my idea of great acting. As audience, I don't want to be aware of acting."[119]Longtime collaborator and playwrightChristopher Hamptondescribes Close as an actress who can very easily convey "a sense of strength and intelligence." Hampton worked onSunset Boulevardand the stage production ofDangerous Liaisons, later casting Close in the movie version of the latter production.[120]"Glenn is often described as having a glacial or distant quality about her, but in person she's the absolute opposite: warm and intimate," says actorIain Glen, who co-starred with her in the 2002 stage production ofA Streetcar Named Desire. "She was able to bring strength to the role, she was able to completely access that vulnerability. There was a real softness to her."[120]
However, Close is consistently praised for her roles as the villain or antagonist in her performances.[121]Her character inFatal Attractionwas ranked number 7 onAFI's 100 years...100 heroes and villains list.[122]Regarding her role in the seriesDamages,The New York Timesremarked, "There is no actor dead or alive as scary as a smiling Glenn Close."[123]Journalist Christopher Hooton also praised her, saying, "Christopher Walken, Glenn Close,Al Pacino, and many others have a surprising danger in them. They're a little scary to be around, because you feel they might jump you or blow up at you at any time. They are ticking time bombs."[124]Film historianCari Beauchamphas stated, "When you look at the top 10 actresses of the past 80 years, since sound came in, first you haveBette Davis,Katharine HepburnandMeryl Streep– but I think Glenn Close is definitely in that list. It's a combination of her guts, in the roles she chooses, and her perseverance. We're talking about 30 years of nominated performances."[125]
On January 12, 2009, Close was honored with a star on theHollywood Walk of Fameat 7000 Hollywood Boulevard, in front of theRoosevelt Hotel.[126]As of 2018[update], films featuring Close have grossed over $1.3 billion in North America.[127]She is also regarded as agay icon, after having played numerouscampyroles on screen and stage.[128][129]She was namedone of the most influential peoplein the world byTimemagazine in 2019.[130]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
