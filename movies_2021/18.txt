Lucais a 2021 American animatedcoming-of-agefantasy filmproduced byPixar Animation StudiosforWalt Disney Pictures. The film was directed byEnrico Casarosa, produced by Andrea Warren and written byJesse AndrewsandMike Jonesfrom a story by Casarosa, Andrews, and Simon Stephenson. It stars the voices ofJacob Tremblay,Jack Dylan Grazer,Emma Berman, Saverio Raimondo, Marco Barricelli,Maya Rudolph,Jim Gaffigan,Peter Sohn, Lorenzo Crisci,Marina Massironi, andSandy Martinin supporting roles. The film is set on theItalian Rivierain 1950s, and centers on Luca Paguro (Tremblay), a youngsea monsterboy with the ability to assume human form while on land, who explores the town of Portorosso with his new best friends, Alberto Scorfano (Grazer) and Giulia Marcovaldo (Berman), experiencing a life-changing summer adventure.
Lucadraws inspiration from Casarosa's childhood inGenoa, Italy. Several Pixar artists were sent to the Italian Riviera gathering research fromItalian cultureand environment to create Portorosso, the primary setting. The sea monsters, a "metaphor for feeling different", were loosely based on old Italian regional myths andfolklore.[3][4]As with the short filmLa Luna(2011), the design and animation were inspired by hand-drawn and stop motion works andHayao Miyazaki's style. Casarosa described the result as a film that "pays homage toFederico Felliniand other classic Italian filmmakers, with a dash of Miyazaki in the mix too".[5]Development onLucalasted for five years, with production being done remotely during theCOVID-19 pandemic.Dan Romercomposed the film's musical score.
Lucapremiered at theAquarium of Genoaon June 13, 2021,[6]and was released direct-to-streaming onDisney+in the United States on June 18, 2021 in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It was released in theaters in countries without the streaming service, and given a simultaneous one-week theatrical run at Hollywood'sEl Capitan Theatre, from June 18 to 24, 2021.[7]It was theatrically released in the United States on March 22, 2024.[8]
The film received generally positive reviews from critics, and was the most-viewed streaming film of 2021, with over 10.6 billion minutes watched.[9][10]It was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the79th Golden Globe Awardsand the94th Academy Awards. A short film,Ciao Alberto, was released on Disney+ on November 12, 2021.[11]
In the summer in the 1950s,[12]timid sea monster child Luca Paguro herdsgoatfishoff the coast of theItaliantown of Portorosso. One day, Luca meets Alberto Scorfano, a fellow sea monster kid living alone in an abandoned lighthouse. Alberto demonstrates how sea monsters transform into humans when they are dry. Luca begins sneaking out to meet Alberto against his parents' order to stay away from the surface, fearing that he might be hunted by humans. The boys quickly become friends, wishing to own aVespaand travel around the world.
Upon discovering Luca's actions, his parents decide to send him to live in thedeepwith his uncle Ugo. To avoid this, Luca runs away from home and hides in Portorosso with Alberto. The boys run afoul of Ercole Visconti, the local bully and five-time champion of the Portorosso Cup, atriathlonof swimming, pasta-eating, and biking. When Ercole tries to soak Luca in a fountain, Giulia Marcovaldo, a young girl, stops him. In hopes of winning the money needed for a Vespa, the boys team up with Giulia for the triathlon.
Giulia invites them to stay at her house and introduces her fisherman father, Massimo, who is prejudiced against sea monsters. Meanwhile, Luca's parents infiltrate the town to find their son. Giulia and Luca bond over their love of learning, to Alberto's ire. When Luca shows interest in attending school, Alberto intentionally reveals his own sea monster form to Giulia to prevent it. Unwilling to give himself up, Luca feigns shock at the transformation, and a betrayed Alberto flees as Ercole's gang arrives to hunt him. Shortly after, Giulia finds out that Luca is a sea monster as well, and sends him away for his safety.
Luca heads to Alberto's hiding place in an effort to reconcile with him, and learns that Alberto was abandoned by his father long ago. Though Alberto declines to participate in the triathlon, Luca promises to win the Vespa to rebuild their friendship. The triathlon begins with Luca and Giulia competing separately. Luca successfully completes the swimming race in adiving suitand the pasta-eating contest without revealing himself, but rain begins during the bike race. Alberto shows up to give Luca an umbrella, but Ercole knocks it away, exposing Alberto's sea monster form and shocking the spectators and Ercole. Luca rescues Alberto, revealing his own true form, and the two bicycle towards the finish to get to the ocean.
Giulia deliberately collides with Ercole's bike to stop him from harpooning Luca and Alberto, who unintentionally cross the finish line before turning back to help the fallen Giulia. When Ercole and the other townsfolk confront the boys, Massimo stands up for them and insists that they have won. Luca is reunited with his family and the humans accept the sea monsters (except Ercole, who is thrown into a fountain by his much-abused henchmen).
Luca and Alberto buy an old Vespa with their winnings, but Alberto sells it to get a train ticket for Luca, allowing him to go to school inGenovawith Giulia. Luca's family, Massimo, and Alberto see Luca and Giulia off at the train station, where they all promise to stay in touch. Luca meets Giulia's mother and attends school with Giulia, while Massimo adopts Alberto as his son.

On July 30, 2020,Pixarannounced a new film titledLucaas an "Italy-set coming-of-age story", withEnrico Casarosadirecting and Andrea Warren producing.[27]It is the feature-length directorial debut of Casarosa, who has previously directed the 2011 Academy Award-nominated short filmLa Luna.[28]It is the first Pixar film to be made almost exclusively at crew members' homes because of the closing of Pixar campus in Emeryville, California, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[29]However, Casarosa stated it took five years to complete the development ofLuca.[30]
Casarosa has describedLucaas a "deeply personal story", being inspired by his childhood inGenoa, Italy, with the title character based on himself and Alberto on his best friend Alberto Surace (who voices a fisherman in the Italian dub version).[31][32]Casarosa has stated: "my summers were spent on beaches ... I met my best friend when I was 11. I was really shy and I found this troublemaker of a kid who had a completely different life. I wanted to make a movie about those kinds of friendships that help you grow up."[5]
He also declared that the film's core is a celebration of friendship:
Childhood friendships often set the course of who we want to become, and it is those bonds that are at the heart of our story inLuca. So, in addition to the beauty and charm of the Italian seaside, our film will feature an unforgettable summer adventure that will fundamentally change Luca.[33]
According to Casarosa, the result is a film that "pays homage toFederico Felliniand other classicItalian filmmakers, with a dash ofMiyazakiin the mix too".[5]In addition of Fellini and Miyazaki's works, the filmsLa Terra Trema(1948),Stromboli(1950) andStand by Me(1986) were also cited as source of inspiration,[34]andAardman AnimationsandWes Anderson's stop-motion films influenced Casarosa's artistic sensibilities.[35]
During earlier drafts of the film, Casarosa stated that the chief creative officer of Pixar at the time,John Lasseter, pushed for the film to be bigger scaled which included a climax where the town of Portorosso was threatened by a giant kraken. Casarosa stated that Lasseter "had great instincts but it was a little more dogmatic". After Lasseter departed Pixar in 2018, Casarosa was allowed and encouraged to pursue the smaller intimate film he wanted to make as well as experiment with the animation by Lasseter's replacement and the film's executive producer,Pete Docter.[36]The approach of using more personable stories for the film due to Docter's oversight shifted the direction that the studio took with both storytelling and film production.[37]
To prepare for the film, Pixar sent several of the film's artists to theItalian Rivierafor a research trip, during which they took photos of the area's landscape and peoples.[38]The film is rooted in the 50s and 60s, that Casarosa has described as a "golden age that feels timeless", with the music and designs inspired from that period "to capture a little bit of this timelessness of summer."[31]
The sea monsters featured in the film were pulled from Italian myths and regionalfolklore,[18]including theTellarooctopus and local "little legends about sea dragons, creatures that either come to help or get into trouble".[39][3]Casarosa said: "I always found the old sea monsters on maps really fascinating. The mystery of the sea was so represented in the weird creatures that we used to draw. And that area has a lot of wonderful myths".[18]Production designer Daniela Strijleva stated: "We were really inspired by old sea maps. Some design details that carried through to the final film are things like the shapes of the fins of the sea monsters, how decorative their scales are, and the curves of their tails."[40]Casarosa also stated that the sea monster is a "metaphor for feeling different".[3]
Disney filed for copyright registry of the names "Portorosso" and "Isola del mare" ("Sea island").[citation needed]In the final film, Luca's surname is Paguro (Italianfor "Hermit crab"), while Portorosso is the name of the village in which the film is set.
To create the setting of the movie, Portorosso, the studio sent several of the film's artists to theItalian Rivierafor a research trip, including on theCinque Terre, during which they took photos of the area's landscape and peoples. During the research trip, Deanna Marsigliese, the film's art director, noted that they were watched by curious onlookers and chose to incorporate that into the character designs. Isola del mare is inspired by the Italian islandTino.[41]
According to production designer Daniela Strijleva, it took a year to design Luca because they wanted to get to know him: "Enrico always wanted Luca to be a bit of an introvert and someone who was curious, but it took us a bit longer to figure out that Luca is a dreamer. He has a strong imagination and a really evolved inner life. That's when the character came to life for me."[16]A clay figure of sea monster Luca was sculpted to assist with the design process for the character.[38]
Casarosa described the characters' transformation scenes as "a big effort" due to the many iterations done. He also stated that another big effort was finding a different look: "So, you're using the same tools roughly and you're not completely reinventing, but you're trying to bring some warmth, some texture, some imperfection. The computer naturally kind of wants to be a little bit realistic and perfect. So, for me, it was like, why don't we bring some painterly vibes to our pictures? How do we bring texture so that it's a little more imperfect? Andwatercolor paper. I love to draw and I love to see the hand of the artist showing through and being a little bit expressive – in the world, because we were also wanting to take people to [see] Italy in this wonderfully enhanced and stylized way, but also in performances and the characters, wanting to make them feel a little bit handmade".[31]
Animation supervisor Mike Venturini stated: "Enrico, as a director and as an artist, was inspired in his youth largely by Miyazaki's film library, starting with one of his first projects ...Future Boy Conan. That was one of Enrico's favorite things as a kid. So, initially, we watched a lot of episodes of that show. And they use a multi-limb style; it's boys being silly with a really broad physicality. He really liked that and hoped we could be influenced by that in some way. Then we kind of expanded our universe into the rest of Miyazaki's film library, which a lot of the animators on the show were already familiar with. So, on a larger feature film scale, we were looking at what were some of Miyazaki's characteristics. That's what inspired us to try things." In addition of Miyazaki's works, Casarosa stated that Aardman and Anderson's stop-motion movies also influenced his artistic sensibilities: "Some of that ends up in my drawings, that sketchy and expressive style. We wanted to bring that to the film because it felt like this is a kid's world. This is a playful world. And it felt true to the story to go in that direction. I love the immersion of 3D, but I sometimes I feel it can go towards coldness. So, I wanted to bring the warmth of imperfection. That's why some of the silly drawings made us laugh when we started boarding them and then put them on a screen."[35]
Casarosa and the team began testing new animation concepts, hoping to bring playful silliness to the characters by taking away some of the typically large amount of detail. Areas of immediate focus were using a more 2D pose style, wider mouths with rounded, rather than angled corners, and multi-limb motions that brought a sillier feel to character movement. Referring to the multi-limb motion, Casarosa said: "It's an old-fashion cartoon technique in some ways ... It came out of the drawings, the essence of someone running extremely fast. We wanted to use the multi-limb technique in areas of the film where the characters were doing extreme physicality, where it would add to the personality of the silliness of the moment. There were only so many chances to use it. I wish there were more. But it was so much fun to use it when we could."[35]
On July 30, 2020, Jones announced that he would co-write the screenplay with Andrews, and that he was proud of it.[42]
It is the first Pixar film to involve Andrews, while Jones had previously co-writtenSoul(2020) and is also credited as a Senior Story and Creative Artist at the studio.[43]
Jones stated: "To force a writing partnership is not an easy thing. Jesse and I ended up having a really great meeting of the minds about what we really wanted to say with this movie. Jesse had been on it for two years before me. He had really put in the time. This is about the greatest summer in these two boys' lives and Jesse's voice with both of those boys was just so wonderful and hilarious and special and emotional. I felt in many ways that I'm just helping Jesse 'plus' that by trying to kind of apply a little bit more of story foundation."[44]
On February 25, 2021, with the release of the teaser trailer and poster, Tremblay, Grazer, Berman, Rudolph, Barricelli, Raimondo (it) and Gaffigan were announced as part of the cast.[18]Martin and Gianniotti were announced on April 28 after the official trailer and poster were released.[24]
Tremblay voices the title character; Casarosa stated that working with him was "such a pleasure", and "I love how earnest and innocent he is naturally. And he's playful and he's not afraid to try stuff so it was so much fun to improvise with him ... he's actually one of the few actors we had time to work with before the pandemic, so there it was so much fun."[31]According to Tremblay: "[Luca] really wants to explore the world and I can really relate to that, especially now. I really want to get back out there and just learn about different cultures, just like Luca. He really wants to go to this town in Italy and learn about their culture and become part of it."[45]
Casarosa stated that Grazer, who voiced Alberto, brings "a natural confidence and vulnerability" to the character, "who's a free-spirited teen sea monster with unbridled enthusiasm for the human world." Giulia, an "outsider, misfit girl", is voiced by newcomer Berman. Rudolph and Gaffigan, playing Daniela and Lorenzo, did get the chance to improvise, with Casarosa highlighting the depth and warmth they bring to the roles: "She's a stern mother. She's a difficult and very controlling mother, but there's this other warmth to her that balances it."[45]
Luca's supporting cast includes actualItalianactors: Raimondo voices Ercole; Barricelli, who has a "booming voice", voices Massimo;[18][45]Gianniotti voices Giacomo;[24]Lorenzo Crisci voices Guido; Massironi voices Mrs. Marsigliese;[23]Gino La Monicavoices Tommaso; and Francesca Fanti voices a cop.
Raimondo was chosen by Casarosa after seeing hisNetflixstand-up comedy showSaverio Raimondo: Il satiro parlante. Raimondo compared Ercole to the character Odd Henderson from the short storyThe Thanksgiving Visitor, and voicing him he was inspired byGiuseppe Anatrelli's performance as Luciano Calboni from theFantozzifilm series.[46]
Tremblay stated that the relationship between Luca and Alberto "is gonna bring back a lot of memories when people watch this and I'm hoping that when people watch this, they'll be able to forget aboutCOVID[...] It's so cool I get to be part of someone else's childhood. I think especially now the story is really special because, for me, I haven't really been able to see my friends because of COVID, of course, and this movie is all about friendship. So, when people see it in theaters, I hope they'll be able to remember hanging out with friends during summer vacation and just having a blast."[18][45]
Casarosa stated that the movie is a celebration of friendship, and "a love letter to the summers of our youth – those formative years when you're finding yourself",[39]inspired by his childhood inGenoa. Casarosa based the title character on himself, while Alberto is based on his best friend, Alberto Surace, to whom the film is dedicated and who also voices a fisherman in the Italian dub.[31]Casarosa stated: "My best friend Alberto was a bit of a troublemaker, [while] I was very timid and had a bit of a sheltered life — we couldn't have been more different ... Alberto pushed me out of my comfort zone, and pushed me off many cliffs, metaphorically and not. I probably would not be here if I didn't learn to chase my dreams from him. It's these types of deep friendships that I wanted to talk about inLuca, and that is what's at the heart of this film."[39]
The sea monsters, based on old Italian myths and regional folklore, were defined by Casarosa as a "metaphor for feeling different",[3]explaining: "We were also a bit of 'outsiders', so it felt right to use sea monsters to express the idea that we felt a little different and not cool as kids". Casarosa stated: "I always found the old sea monsters on maps really fascinating. The mystery of the sea was so represented in the weird creatures that we used to draw. And that area has a lot of wonderful myths".[18]Producer Andrea Warren expanded: "We always liked the idea that the metaphor of being a sea monster can apply to so many different things. There is a theme of openness, showing oneself and self-acceptance, as well as community acceptance. Confronting the idea that there's more to sea monsters than they realized. You know that they've only seen it through one perspective, one lens, and so I think that that's a wonderful theme in the film, which is that those ideas weren't right and that there's more to learn." Casarosa agreed: "We hope that 'sea monster' could be a metaphor for all [manners] of feeling different — like being a teen or even pre-teen — any moment where you feel odd. It felt like a wonderful way to talk about that and having to accept ourselves first, whatever way we feel different."[39]
Some have seen Luca and Alberto hiding their true sea monster identities as an allegory for people who are members of theLGBTQ+community, feeling as though they need to hide their true selves in order to be accepted.[47]Casarosa said this was unintentional and that his original vision for the film was to explore the time in a child's life before romance,[48]while stating "but it is a kind of love, right? There's a lot of hugging and it's physical and my experience as a straight man certainly wasn't that."[49]He has welcomed the interpretation after the film's release, also stating: "While I identify with pronouns he/him and I am a straight man, the themes of diversity, acceptance and inclusion in our movie are dear to my heart".[50]
Casarosa has stated that some people have interpreted the story as being a metaphor forrefugeesand immigrants as well. While he stated that this was unintentional too, he was welcome to all interpretations: "We were aware making the movie that this was a wonderful journey of owning your own identity, and coming out with it – whichever that identity is. I thought that everyone would bring their own identity to it."[51]
Casarosa later stated that the film was intended to be a metaphor for race and while romance was briefly discussed, it was never meant to be a focal point to the story; "some people seem to get mad that I'm not saying yes or no, but I feel like, well, this is a movie about being open to any difference."[49]
On April 1, 2021,Dan Romerwas revealed to be the film's composer.[52]Romer was influenced byItalianandfolk-popmusic genre from the 1950s and 1960s, while scoring for the film, and a wide range of instruments were used while recording the score.[53]It was composed during July 2020 and recorded mid-March 2021, adhering to strict safety guidelines during theCOVID-19 pandemicrestrictions.[54]The film features songs byMina,Edoardo Bennato,Gianni Morandi,Rita PavoneandQuartetto Cetra, and excerpts from operas byGiacomo PucciniandGioachino Rossini.[55][56]The soundtrack album was released byWalt Disney Recordson June 18, 2021.[56]
In November 2020, some concept art of the film and the clay figure of sea monster Luca were shown in the second episode ofInside Pixar.[38]In December 2020, an early look to the film was screened at Disney Investor Day, and the clips and some screenshots were later leaked online.[57]On January 18, 2021, the first official image from the film was released byEmpire.[58]On January 19, a promotional still was released on the cover of Italian magazineIl Venerdì di Repubblica, featuring Luca, Alberto, and Giulia on aVespain one of the scenic backdrops from the film.[59]
A series of books based on the film was published on May 14, 2021.[60]Funkoproduced a line ofFunko Popsbased on the characters of the film.[61]A line of action figures and toy packs byMattelwas released on July 1, 2021.[62]In June 2021,Trenitaliaunveiled theirLuca-themed livery for aCaravaggio train.[63]

Lucahad its premiere on June 13, 2021, in Italy at theAquarium of Genoa, with a three-day run by the non-profit organization MediCinema to raise funds for theIstituto Giannina Gasliniand other entities in the Ligurian territory.[6]The film was originally set to be theatrically released in the United States on June 18, 2021, byWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.[33]However, on March 23, 2021, Disney announced the cancellation of the film's theatrical release, and it instead was released worldwide onDisney+in response to theCOVID-19 pandemic, on the same date.[67]The film also played a one-week theatrical engagement at Hollywood'sEl Capitan Theatrefrom June 18–24, 2021.[68]In international markets where Disney+ is not available, it was released theatrically.[67]On December 5, 2023, it was announced thatLuca, as well asSoul(2020) andTurning Red(2022), would be released in theaters in the United States throughout early 2024, withLucabeing released on March 22, 2024, accompanied by the short filmFor the Birds.[69][d]

According toNielsen ratings, following its opening weekend,Lucatopped all original movies in its first days on streaming, with 1.573 billion minutes of viewing time.[71]Nielsen reported that the movie topped the weekly streaming Top 10 list for the June 14–20 week, and ranking at No. 2 on the overall streaming rankings after the TV seriesManifeston Netflix.[71]The film continued to play well in subsequent weeks, logging 1.15 billion minutes of viewership between July 21–27 (equal to about 1.2 million total watches), the second-most for an original film behindThe Tomorrow War.[72]Lucawas the most-watched streaming film of 2021, with over 10.6 billion minutes viewed.[9]
By December 2021, the film had grossed $51.1 million worldwide,[2]with its largest markets being China ($14 million), Russia ($8.2 million), Poland ($3.6 million), Hong Kong ($3.6 million), South Korea ($3 million), the United Arab Emirates ($2.1 million), and Romania ($1.02 million) in its international release[1]and United States ($1.3 million), Mexico ($307,884), Australia ($63,292) and Spain ($34,474) in the 2024 re-release.[1][73]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 304 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Slight but suffused with infectious joy, the beguilingLucaproves Pixar can play it safe while still charming audiences of all ages."[74]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 71 out of 100 based on 52 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[75]
Alonso Duraldeof theTheWrapwrote: "Lucais sweet and affecting, capturing the bond that strangers can build over a summer, and how that friendship can endure. And like its shape-shifting protagonists, it's got plenty going on beneath the surface."[76]FromThe Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney said that "the real magic ofLucais its visuals. The character designs are appealing both in the marine world and on land, and the richness of the settings in both realms is a constant source of pleasure. The play of light on the gloriously blue water's surface is almost photorealistic at times, while a sunset spreading its orange glow over rocks on the shoreline makes you yearn to be there."[77]
Charlie Ridgely, writing forComicBook.compraised the film for its uniqueness, saying that it highly deviated from Pixar's usual narrative formula and clichés, but that this didn't make it "lesser" than the company's classics likeToy StoryandUp. He also praised the animation, the design of the Italian Riviera, the score and the story.[78]
Conversely, Phil De Semlyen, writing forTime Out, branded the film a "letdown", writing "Charming but slight,Lucadefinitely isn't Pixar firing on all cylinders. The studio's trademark daring, pin sharp sight gags, and big ideas are missing from a fishy coming-of-age yarn that's a little damp around the edges."[79]
A short film titledCiao Albertowas released onDisney+on November 12, 2021.[124]It is written and directed byMcKenna Harrisand produced by Matt DeMartini with Enrico Casarosa on board as executive producer.[125][126][127]It focuses on Alberto as he continues to grow accustomed to working with Massimo; eventually accepting him as a father figure.
The cast expressed interest in returning for a sequel, and presented different ideas of what it would be about, among which was the joking suggestion they frequently made of giving Uncle Ugo a spin-off series. Casarosa expressed interest in doing a sequel that would be similar toThe Parent Trap, which would center upon Luca and Giulia's attempt to reunite Massimo and his wife.[128]In October 2022, Casarosa stated that there were no present plans for a sequel toLuca, but that he was developing a new, original film, presumably for Pixar.[129]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL.

The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle. Its first film appearance was with the release ofStrange World.[60]The logo received widespread praise from critics and audiences and won Gold in the "Theatrical | Film: Design" medium at the 2023Clio Entertainment Awardsin November 2023. The standard version of the logo premiered theatrically withThe Beach Boys.[61]

Gaffigan's memoirDad Is Fat(2013) and his most recent bookFood: A Love Story(2014) were both published byCrown Publishers. He co-created and starred in theTV LandseriesThe Jim Gaffigan Show, based on his life. He collaborates extensively with his wife, actressJeannie Gaffigan, with whom he has five children.
Gaffigan was born on July 7, 1966,[2]inElgin, Illinois,[3]the youngest of six children born to charity worker and fundraiser Marcia Miriam (née Mitchell) and banker Michael Ambrose Gaffigan.[4][5]Of Irish descent, his family's surname was Gavahan.[5]His maternal grandfather wasIowa Supreme CourtJusticeRichard F. Mitchell.[5]Gaffigan was raised inChestertoninNorthwest Indiana, a region that he has stated influenced his comedy because of its authenticity,[6]and often jokes about growing up in a large family.[7]His mother was accomplished atneedleworkand received a national award for original design and craftsmanship from the American Needlepoint Guild in 1985.[8]She died of cancer in 1990 at age 53.[8]
Gaffigan's father was the president and CEO of the Mercantile National Bank of Indiana for 15 years until his retirement in 1991.[9]A formerseminarian, he was also actively involved in local charity work.[10]He died oflung cancerin 1999.[10]Gaffigan's father was the first in his family to attend college,[11]and encouraged his children to seek careers that promised job security.[12]However, at about the age of five, Gaffigan announced that he wanted to be an actor.[13]
As a teenager, Gaffigan watchedSaturday Night Live.[11]He attendedLa Lumiere SchoolinLa Porte, Indiana, where he played on the school'sfootballteam. He attendedPurdue Universityfor one year, where he was a member of thePhi Gamma Deltafraternity, before transferring toGeorgetown University'sMcDonough School of Business, where he graduated in 1988 with a degree in finance.[12][14]He played football atGeorgetownandPurdue.[15][16]Although he "hated" studying finance, he worked as a litigation consultant for a short time after graduating and "was horrible at it".[17]
Gaffigan moved to New York in 1990 to pursue comedy,[14]a move that was inspired by his admiration for fellowHoosierDavid Letterman.[18]He worked in advertising during the day[12]and took acting classes at night.[7][18]During this time, he was cast inBlockbuster Video's"Entertainment Squad" series of commercials.[19]His career began in earnest when a friend from his acting class dared him to take astand-upseminar that required a live set at the end.[7][13]He fell in love with stand-up,[7]and began playing comedy clubs nightly—after his evening acting classes—until the early hours of the morning.[18]He was often found sleeping at his day job; his boss had to wake him up to fire him.[18]
For the first seven years of Gaffigan's stand-up career, he tried various styles, ranging from angry comedy to impressions and voices. Live comedy was in decline following its peak in the 1980s, and was further affected by the increased popularity ofcable television.[7]After periodically auditioning forThe Late Show with David Lettermanfor six years,[20]Gaffigan did a successful stand-up routine on the show in 1999,[21][22]and his career took off.[18]
Gaffigan's style is largelyobservational. Some of his main topics are laziness, eating and parenthood. His famousHot Pocketroutine was inspired by a commercial he saw that he mistook for aSaturday Night Livesketch.[13]He often performssoliloquies. For example, in high-pitched voice, he may portray someone giving negative feedback on his own performance (After he made a diarrhea joke in his 2012 special "Mr. Universe", he used the voice to say, "Really, he's using diarrhea jokes?"[23]). He has said, "That inside voice is my connection with the audience".[13]
In an interview with theDuluth News-Tribune, he explained that he began developing the voice as a teenager, when he disarmed people by talking for them in their presence.[24]He said he also used it to fend off hecklers earlier in his career, when comedy clubs were more "combative".[24]He cursed early in his career, and added cursing to his comedy albumDoing My Timeat the request of his label, in the hopes of drawing more teens.[25]He has now largely removed profanity from his routine, as he feels his subject matter doesn't lend itself to cursing and that it reduced the effort he put into crafting his jokes.[25][26]
In 2004, Gaffigan's stand-up material was featured inComedy Central's animated seriesShorties Watchin' Shorties. In October 2005, he filmed a liveComedy Centralspecial that aired the following January,[7]and became the comedy album/DVDBeyond the Pale.

Comedy Central releasedKing Babyon DVD. In a March 2009 interview onAnytime with Bob Kushell, Gaffigan defended his naming of the tour, stating that he thought it would be funny that parents would be unsure about whether to bring their teenage children to the show.[28]Four years later, on March 14, 2013, Gaffigan was named the "King of Clean" by theWall Street Journal.[29]
On February 25, 2012, Gaffigan taped a one-hour stand-up special—Mr. Universe—at theWarner TheaterinWashington, D.C.;[30]it was nominated for a Grammy.[12]He announced that, based on the business model used byLouis C.K.'sLive at the Beacon Theater, the stand-up would be available online through his website for $5, with 20% of the total proceeds going to theBob Woodruff Foundation,[31]an organization that provides support to military veterans.[32]In 2012, he was among the top-ten grossing comics in the US, according to Pollstar.[12]
Gaffigan filmed his 2014 comedy special titledJim Gaffigan: ObsessedatBoston'sWilbur Theateron January 18, 2014.[33]Obsessedpremiered onComedy Centralon April 27 becoming the most watched stand-up comedy special of the year for the network.[34]The accompanying album, also titledObsessed, debuted at number 11 on theBillboard200and number 1 on the Billboard Comedy Album charts.[35]2015 saw him embark on a headlining tour, culminating in a winter show atMadison Square Garden.[11]

Gaffigan is widely noted as aneverymanand a clean comic;[12][42]some of his signature routines regardHot Pockets,[42][43]cake, andbacon.[23]His tendency to avoid profanity has drawn mixed responses. One critic compared him toFull House-eraBob Saget(who starred in the 1990s family show), which Gaffigan took as an insult.[25]Hampton Stevens inThe Atlanticwrote that Gaffigan "champions a vital element to standup that[Lenny] Brucehad taken away—the indispensable, but apparently forgotten idea that comedians have no obligation to be provocative, topical, socially conscious, or anything else but funny."[23]
I did my set, I walked off stage and they said the executive producer wants to meet you up in his office. I thought maybe it was going to be something good. I thought maybe Dave wants me to be a writer. But they wanted me to develop my ownshow.

Damiano.[53]Reflecting on the incident in an interview forThe Daily Beast, Gaffigan said, "There's no greater sin in the stand-up world than thievery...So you do not want to be associated with thievery," but added, "I don't have any hard feelings about it because I don't think people think I had anything to do with it."[11]
In the 2010s, Gaffigan, his wife, andPeter Tolanbegan to develop material for a show based loosely on their own life.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
