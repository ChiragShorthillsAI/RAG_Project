In 1902, nearing the end of theSecond Boer War,Britisharistocrat Orlando, Duke of Oxford, his wife Emily, and their young son Conrad visit aconcentration campinSouth Africawhile working for theBritish Red Cross. A sniper attack on the camp mortally wounds Emily but, before dying, makes Orlando promise never to let their son see war again.
Twelve years later, Orlando has formed a private spy network with his servants, butler Shola and maid Polly Wilkins, employed by the world's most powerful dignitaries. Conrad is eager to fight, but Orlando forbids him to join theBritish Armyand persuadesSecretary of State for WarLord Kitchenernot to let him do so.
At Kitchener's request, Conrad and Orlando ride with Orlando's friends,Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, and his wifeSophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, throughSarajevo. Conrad saves the Archduke from a bomb thrown byGavrilo Princip, aBosnian Serbintent on sparking a war. Princip later reencounters the Archduke's entourage by chance andfatally shoots him and his wife, startingWorld War I.
Orlando learns that the assassination was orchestrated by "The Flock": a group plotting to pit theGerman,Russian, and British empires against each other, led by the mysterious "Shepherd", whose ultimate goal isScottish independence; his operatives include Russian mysticGrigori Rasputin, trusted adviser toTsar Nicholas of Russia.
Rasputin poisons Nicholas's young sonAlexei, only to cure him after Nicholas promises to pull out of the war. Conrad is notified of Rasputin's manipulation by his cousin, PrinceFelix Yusupov. Knowing theWestern Frontwill be left vulnerable if Russia exits the war, Conrad delivers this information to Kitchener and hisaide-de-campMajor Max Morton, who sets sail for Russia. Their ship,HMSHampshire, is torpedoed by a submarine and sunk. Word of Kitchener's death reaches Orlando, spurring him to travel to Russia with Shola, Polly, and Conrad to kill Rasputin. After a grueling fight, the four kill Rasputin at a Christmas party hosted by Felix.
To keep theUnited Statesfrom entering the war,Erik Jan Hanussen, an adviser toKaiser Wilhelm II, sends theZimmermann Telegram, encouragingMexicoto invade the United States. Although British Intelligence intercepts the message, Polly deciphers it, but American PresidentWoodrow Wilsonrefuses to join the war, citing a lack of concrete proof. The Shepherd recruitsVladimir Lenintooverthrow the Tsarand remove Russia from the war, sending an assassin toexecute the Romanov family.
Conrad is commissioned into theGrenadier Guardsagainst his father's wishes.King George Varranges to have him assigned toLondon. Determined to fight in the war, Conrad swaps places with Scottish soldier Archie Reid, giving him the nickname "Lancelot" to send his father a message.
Disguised as Archie, a member of theBlack Watch, Conrad volunteers for a mission intono man's landto retrieve information from a wounded British agent. Upon his return, a fellow soldier who knows Archie accuses him of being a German spy and shoots him dead, devastating Orlando. The information he recovered verifies the authenticity of the Zimmermann Telegram.
After Wilson again refuses to enter the war despite Conrad's proof, Orlando learns that the President is being blackmailed with footage of being seduced by Shepherd's agent,Mata Hari, and resolves to recover the negatives. Upon defeating Mata Hari at the American embassy, Orlando identifies hercashmerescarf and locates its origin.
Orlando parachutes onto the mountaintop sanctuary of the Shepherd, who is revealed to be Morton. Morton had arranged Kitchener's assassination and faked his own death. Orlando fights and kills him with Shola's help. Polly recovers the film, which is delivered to Wilson. He then burns it and brings the United States into the war.
After the war, Orlando purchases theKingsman Tailor Shopas a front for his organisation. Orlando, Shola, Polly, King George V, Archie, and theUS Ambassador to the UKform the original Kingsmen, each being assigned a codename from theKing Arthurlegend to honour Conrad.
In amid-credit scene, Hanussen, having assumed command of Shepherd's organisation, introduces Lenin to the Romanovs' assassin,Adolf Hitler.

The roles Brühl takes on are often morally complex characters, men who are suffering with a deep-seated darkness that threatens to weigh down their inherent humanity.[10]He has utilizedmethod actingsince the beginning of his career.[44]A German and Spanish national, he has played at least ten different nationalities (Polish, Spanish, French, Hungarian, German, Austrian, British, American, Argentine and a fictional Sokovian) and in his films has spoken English, Spanish, German, and French comfortably, as well as Polish, Russian, and Chinese. Writing forThe Hollywood Reporterin 2018, Katie Kilkenny said: "If Hollywood executives have a global, and particularly European, male part to cast, there's a good chance Bruhl will make the shortlist.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
