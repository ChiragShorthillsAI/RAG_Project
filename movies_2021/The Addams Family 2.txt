It tells the story of the Addams family as they go on a road trip.
The film was theatrically released in the United States byUnited Artists Releasingon October 1, 2021, followed by an international release byUniversal Pictureson October 8. It also became available for online rental on the same day in the United States and Canada. The film was not as successful as its predecessor and received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the humor and story and deemed it inferior to its predecessor.
At ascience fair, Wednesday Addams is set to present her experiment, where she uses her pet squid Socrates' DNA on Uncle Fester to show how humans can be improved (with the side effect of gradually transmutating Fester). However, she is dismayed when she sees her family arrive. Nonetheless, her work gets noticed by scientist Cyrus Strange. Back at the Addams' home, Gomez worries that the children are drifting apart from him and Morticia, so he decides to take them on a family vacation. Before the family, Fester, Thing and Lurch head on a road trip across the United States, Gomez and Morticia are approached by a lawyer named Mr. Mustela, who claims that Wednesday was switched at birth and may not actually be an Addams, but they ignore him. On the road, the Addams family is pursued by Mustela and his employer's henchman Pongo.
The family is initially set on going toSalem, Massachusetts, but Fester, who is slowly mutating due to the experiment, ends up making a detour toNiagara Falls. The family later stops inSleepy Hollow, New York. Gomez and Morticia bring up Mustela and his claims about Wednesday, so Fester mentions a story when he visited Wednesday the day she was born and juggled babies in the delivery room. This only worsens Gomez and Morticia's fears that Wednesday may not be their biological child, which Wednesday overhears.
Gomez brings everyone toMiamito get in touch with Cousin Itt, in hopes he can help with their current dilemma. Itt joins them on the trip as they pass throughSan Antonioand leaves the family early at theGrand Canyon. Meanwhile, Wednesday traps Mustela in a rope trap on her own and learns he is working for Cyrus before "letting him go". Cyrus suggests to Wednesday that he is her true father and invites her to his home inSausalito, California. Wednesday runs a DNA test using Gomez's hair, which seemingly proves that she is not his daughter. Wednesday leaves the family while they sleep, but Lurch catches up with her. The rest of the Addams learn where she is heading and follow suit.
At his home, Cyrus shows Wednesday a formula he developed to makehuman–animal hybrids, similar to Wednesday's experiment. When the rest of the Addams family shows up, Wednesday is persuaded to stay with Cyrus. After Pugsley finds out that Cyrus' daughter Ophelia is a pig, Cyrus reveals he is using Wednesday, as her formula was better than his. He captures the family to test on them, but Wednesday refuses to do so. Cyrus tries to get Pongo to go after her, but it is revealed Lurch and Pongo knew each other before while in a mental asylum, and they decide to free the Addams. Cyrus comes into contact with his formula during the scuffle and turns into a hybrid chicken-cow-goat-pig monster. The now-completely insane doctor tries to kill the family, but is stopped by Fester, who has fully mutated into a squid monster. After the two fight, Cyrus falls off a cliff to his death. Fester is turned back to normal by Wednesday, using a necklace of her family's blood that Morticia gave her earlier.
Wednesday reunites with her family and they return home along with Pongo and Ophelia, the latter of whom has become fully human following contact with Wednesday's formula and falls in love with Pugsley. While Wednesday knew that Cyrus faked his DNA test results, Gomez reveals to Wednesday that he wears atoupéeafter losing his original hair in a napalm accident. He promises the family that next time, he will take them on a trip across the world.

Owen GleibermanofVarietywrote about the film "It's in the nature of most animated sequels to struggle to recapture the full charm of the original hit. But in the case of "The Addams Family 2," Tiernan and Vernon have used the sequel as an opportunity for an upgrade. The script is by an entirely new team, and in some ineffable bats-in-the-belfry way the jokes now land with a more inspired and spontaneous creepy kookiness."[23]Savannah Lee of Parent Previews criticized the film, writing "I didn't see the 2019 version ofThe Addams Familybecause it didn't look appealing and my son was too young to clamor for it. I read a quick plot synopsis to get myself caught up, but I probably didn't need to. This movie has little, if anything, to do with the previous installment, so you can just jump right in if you so choose."[24]Nell Minow  ofRogerEbert.comgave a 3 out of 4 stars and wrote, "An intrusive product placement billboard will trigger the irritation viewers may have with the odd cross-promotion in television commercials on behalf of both this movie and an insurance company. Of more concern, parents may get some tough questions due to the paternity issues raised by the film, including DNA tests. The issues of who a child 'belongs' to and what biology has to do with identity will be a concern for some families."[25]
Sandie Angulo Chen ofCommon Sense Mediagave the film 3 stars out of 5 and wrote "Silly sequel focuses on family love; peril, some racy jokes."[26]Meagan Navarro ofBloody Disgustinggave 2 bones out of 5 and wrote "The Addams Family 2might change its scenery, but it doesn't deviate from its approach. It's still a ridiculous, straightforward animated update to an enduring property. Grown-ups may disown this take on The Addams Family, but it was never meant for adults anyway. This focuses solely on tickling the funny bone of the youngest of audiences. In other words, it's not a great movie, but it likely succeeds in its goal as a manic comedy bit for children. That it steps further away from a grim aesthetic means it's a far more anemic gateway into the genre than before."[27]Molly Freeman ofScreen Rantcalled the film "[...] a shallow continuation that spends too much time on unconnected hijinks resulting in an uneven sequel with much less heart."[28]

Shawn was born on November 12, 1943, in New York City, to aJewishfamily.[3][4][5][6]His parents were journalist Cecille (née Lyon) andWilliam Shawn, the longtime editor ofThe New Yorker. He has younger twin siblings: composerAllen Shawn,[7]and Mary, who isautisticand lives in an institution.[8]His father's family had emigrated from Central Europe; his paternal grandfather, Benjamin W. Chon, was a Chicago-based cutlery merchant who married Anna Bransky.[9]
Shawn grew up onManhattan'sUpper East Side.[10]He attendedThe Putney School, a private liberal arts high school inPutney, Vermont. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in history fromHarvard College. He studiedphilosophy, politics and economics, as well as Latin, atMagdalen College, Oxford, originally intending to become a diplomat. He traveled to India as an English teacher on aFulbrightprogram.[11]
Shawn's early plays, such asMarie and Bruce(1978), portrayed emotional and sexual conflicts in anabsurdiststyle, with language both lyrical and violent. In a conversation withAndre Gregory, parts of which were used to createMy Dinner with Andre, Shawn said these plays depicted "my interior life as a raging beast." Critical response was extremely polarized: some critics hailed Shawn as a major writer, whileJohn SimoncalledMarie and Bruce"garbage" and Shawn "one of the unsightliest actors in this city."[12]His 1977 playA Thought in Three Partscaused controversy in London when the production was investigated by avice squadand attacked in Parliament after allegations of pornographic content.[13]Shawn received anObie Awardfor playwrighting in 1975, forOur Late Night.[14]

Among the best-known of these areAunt Dan and Lemon(1985) andThe Designated Mourner(1997). Shawn's political work has invited controversy, as he often presents the audience with several contradictory points of view. He has calledAunt Dan and Lemona cautionary tale againstfascism.

In the late 1990s, during the release of her albumBathhouse Betty(1998), Midler commented on her time performing there, "Despite the way things turned out [with the AIDS crisis], I'm still proud of those days. I feel like I was at the forefront of the gay liberation movement, and I hope I did my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of 'Bathhouse Betty' with pride."[21]
Midler starred in the first professional production ofthe Who'srock operaTommyin 1971, with directorRichard Pearlmanand theSeattle Opera.[22]It was during the run ofTommythat Midler first appeared onThe Tonight Show.

"Bugle Boy" became a successful cover of the classic swing tune originally introduced and popularized in 1941 by theAndrews Sisters, to whom Midler has repeatedly referred as her idols and inspiration, as far back as her first appearances onThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Midler told Carson in an interview that she always wanted to move like the sisters, and Patty Andrews remembered: "When I first heard the introduction on the radio, I thought it was our old record. When Bette opened at the Amphitheater in Los Angeles, Maxene and I went backstage to see her. Her first words were, 'What else did you record?'"[25]During another Midler concert, Maxene went on stage and presented her with an honorary bugle. Bette recorded other Andrews Sisters hits, including "In the Mood" and "Lullaby of Broadway".[25]
Herself-titled follow-up albumwas released at the end of 1973. Again, the album was co-produced by Manilow.

Midler starred in her own sitcom in 2000,Bette, which featured Midler playing a version of herself, a divine celebrity who is adored by her fans. Airing onCBS, initial ratings were high, marking the best sitcom debut for the network in more than five years, but viewers percentage soon declined, resulting in the show's cancellation in early 2001.[48]Midler openly griped about the show's demanding shooting schedule, while the show itself was also reportedly rocked by backstage turmoil, involving the replacement of co-starKevin Dunnwhose departure was attributed by the media to his behind-the scenes bickering with Midler.[48]However, Midler, critically praised, was awarded aPeople's Choice Awardfor her performance in the show and received aGolden Globe Awardnomination the following year.[49]Also in 2000, Midler made an uncreditedcameo appearanceinNancy Meyers' fantasy rom–comWhat Women Want, starringMel GibsonandHelen Hunt.[50]In the film, she portrayed a therapist who realizes that central character Nick, played by Gibson, is able to understand women'sthoughts.[50]Released to generally mixed reviews, it became the then-most successful film ever directed by a woman, taking in $183 million in the United States, and grossing upward of $370 million worldwide.[51][52]

Another critical fiasco, reviewers noted that the film "drowns itself in humor that never rises above sitcom level."[55]
After nearly three decades of erratic record sales, Midler was dropped from theWarner Music Groupin 2001. Following a reported long-standing feud with Barry Manilow, the two joined forces after many years in 2003 to recordBette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook.

The project underwent numerous production problems that occurred throughout its shooting schedule, with reports of problems on-set between director Oz and the actors being rampant in the press. Oz later blamed Midler—who was amid recording her next album and rehearsing for her tour—for being under a lot of stress by other projects and making "the mistake of bringing her stress on the set."[57]While the original book and film had tremendous cultural impact, the remake was marked by poor reviews by many critics, and a financial loss of approximately $40 million at the box office.[58][59]
Midler joined forces again with Manilow for another tribute album,Bette Midler Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook. Released in October 2005, the album sold 55,000 copies the first week of release, returned Midler to the top ten ofUSBillboard200,[60]and was nominated for a Grammy Award.[61]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
