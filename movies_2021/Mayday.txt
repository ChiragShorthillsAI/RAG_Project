Ana works at a hotel with her friends Dimitri, a DJ, and cook Max. 
Ana and her coworker June comfort Marsha, a new bride who is experiencing cold feet. 
Ana is abused by the cruel head waiter. When a storm knocks out the power, Ana hears a voice spelling out "mayday" in a modified NATO Phonetic alphabet. Following the voice, she crawls into an oven and falls into the ocean.
Emerging on an unknown shore, Ana encounters Marsha, now brimming with confidence. 
She is in shock and realises she has no memories. 
A man dressed as a World War Two aviator emerges from the sea and says that his plane crashed in the ocean and that there's a war on. 
As the girls leave the beach the pilot is shot to death. 
Marsha takes Ana to a beached submarine where she and two other girls, Gert and Bea, live. Marsha explains that this land is a utopia where the girls can live without fear of male violence and predation.
Marsha tells Ana there are camps of women all over the island fighting and winning a war against the men trying to invade.
The girls show Ana how to shoot a rifle, something she proves adept at. When the three others go swimming, Ana is too afraid to jump from a cliff and join them. She is attacked by the head waiter, now dressed as a soldier, but manages to escape.
Marsha shows Ana her telescope and shows her how to view the stars.
Ana joins the girls in their ongoing mission: sending out fake distress signals to lure men to their death in the storm which surrounds the island. When a group of men manage to make it to the island alive, Ana finds herself unable to kill them. This alienates her from the bloodthirsty Marsha.
Ana begins having a recurring dream of herself driving a car through a tunnel.
While alone in the control room a distress call comes across the radio, Ana answers it and talks to the man, he tells her he isn't far from shore but they are having electrical problems. 
Ana plans to go out and swim to their ship but he tells her he is in a submarine that can't surface because of the issue but he promises to come back for her when it is fixed. 
Marsha catches her and knows she is lying when Ana says she was not talking to anyone on the radio.
Bea is captured by men and the girls run to rescue her. 
They find her being forced to dig her own grave and Ana hesitates but in the end has no choice but to shoot the men to save her friend.
Gert speaks to Marsha and questions why Bea would be out in the forest by herself and Marsha says she told her to go out there, she knew Ana’s heart wasn't in it but now it is.
Ana goes out on patrol and finds a photographer and his squad. Ana prepares herself to shoot them but bombs suddenly start to drop, she runs away but is knocked out by a blast, she comes to and stumbles into a field with a large camp of soldiers and they engage in a dance routine; this is likely a hallucination, as she has killed them all.
Ana wakes up on the ground and goes back to the submarine.
In the control room Marsha tells Ana she is a nobody and they scuffle. 
Ana tells her she has stopped hurting herself and started hurting others.
Out on patrol, this time Ana has no problem shooting soldiers she finds scaling the cliffs.
Marsha is unhappy that she is losing control of the group, during an air raid she refuses to come inside to comfort a hysterical Bea.
On patrol Ana finds an older man peeling potatoes, the chef Max. He tells her he is lost, she says she is too, they share a drink and he says he wants to be in a place where there is no war and suggests maybe they should go home. 
Ana lays her head against his knee and falls asleep.
She dreams again about driving through a tunnel but this time she sees a light from the end of the tunnel.
Ana wakes up to find she is asleep on Marsha’s knee, they fight and Ana calls Marsha a monster.
Ana tells Gert she wants to leave the island that she doesn't think she is meant to be here, Gert agrees to help her.
Ana hears a radio broadcast by the man on the submarine, he says he's dying from the fumes and apologises for not being able to come back to save her. 
He says he has ‘never had much luck with the ladies’ and tells her she should say goodbye; Ana replies, saying she’s ‘not that kind of girl’, echoing a conversation they had at the start of the movie.
The memory of the conversation makes her realise it is Dimitri, and she suddenly remembers everything.
Gert tells her she definitely doesn't belong here, and sends her to meet with 
June, now a mechanic, who she tells about her plan to leave the island. 
June warns her that she is like a star, and if she leaves it will be like a star dying; everything around it gets pulled in, and they all disappear, everyone on the island will be snuffed out of existence. 
June also tells Ana that to get through the storm she will need precise calculations.
Ana returns to the sub and tells Gert and Bea she has changed her mind and isn't leaving, but Gert reveals they already know what will happen and they still want her to try. 
Ana asks them to come with her but they tell her they can't. 
They tell Ana she can go and protect other girls from becoming like them, victims of men.
They then show Ana that they have already spoken to all of the other camps on the island and they are all in support of Ana leaving.
Gert, Bea, June and Ana, with the help of the other camps via the radio, track the storms and formulate a plan to get Ana through the storm and back to the point she entered.
They think they have kept it all a secret from Marsha, but she has actually been listening to them via the radio. 
She confronts Ana and tells her she can't believe that after everything she has given her, after making her a hero, she wants to go back to a kitchen. Ana replies that she's made her into a psychopath and Marsha says it's the same thing. 
She tells Ana that she is going back to so much darkness and Ana tells her that in the dark she will see the stars.
Ana and Bea lie in bed, Ana tells Bea she doesn't want to leave her, and Bea says she will go first and to close her eyes, Bea then disappears.
June, Gert and Bea check all of the parameters are correct and tell Ana it's time.
They watch from the control room as Ana jumps into the sea and swims towards the storm but she gets caught in a rip tide, is pulled under and starts to drown. 
Marsha gets on the radio and encourages her repeating the same message Ana heard on the radio in her dream.
Ana is able to float to where she needs to be and finds Dimitri floating there; as she reaches him, she is transported back to the hotel.
The film ends with Ana walking into the banquet hall where Dimitri is DJing. 
She approaches the microphone and opens her mouth to sing.

Following an uncredited role inBronco Billy(1980), Lewis made her first major screen appearance in the television filmHome Fires(1987).[10]Howard Rosenberg of theLos Angeles Timespraised her performance in the latter, writing that she "lights up the screen".[10]She then starred as Kate Farrell on theABCsitcomI Married Dora, which ran between 1987 and 1988.[11]At age 14, she waslegally emancipatedfrom her parents—with their approval—enabling her to work more freely.[12]She later recalled, "I know that sounds all radical, but when you start acting when you're younger, you talk to other actor kids and their moms, and they're like, 'Yeah, if you want to get a job, they like [your] resume to say  emancipated minor versus minor, because you then can work [longer hours]'".[12]
Lewis had a minor part in the science fiction comedyMy Stepmother Is an Alien(1988)—playing Lexie, the best friend of main character Jessie—before landing her first major supporting role as Audrey Griswold inNational Lampoon's Christmas Vacation(1989),[13]which is now regarded as a "classic" inits genre.[14]Regarding her involvement with the film and the opportunity to work with co-starChevy Chase, Lewis later reflected, "even at [age] 15, I knew it was a big deal".[14]She followed this with appearances in the comediesMeet the HollowheadsandThe Runnin' Kind,[15]as well as a guest-starring role as Delores on the coming-of-age drama seriesThe Wonder Years(all 1989).[16]

Lewis played Amanda, a troubled teenager who falls into a world of prostitution and drugs.[18]In his review for theLos Angeles Times, Ray Loynd felt that the film worked due to its "compelling script [and Lewis'] authentic portrayal of the young and abused murderess whose first question to her public defender [is] whether he has any sugar-coated candies".[19]
Lewis garnered international attention when she beat out 500 other actresses to play Danielle Bowden,[20]the daughter of a family targeted by psychopathic criminalMax Cady, inMartin Scorsese's1991 remakeofCape Fear(1962).[21]Vincent CanbyofThe New York Timeslauded her performance, calling her "a new young actress of stunning possibilities",[21]whileThe Hollywood Reporter's Duane Byrge commented, "Perhaps providing the strongest real counterbalance toDe Niro's crazy Cady is Juliette Lewis, whose [performance] shows the most sinewy fiber".[22]She went on to receiveGolden GlobeandAcademy Awardnominations for the role.[23][24]Retrospectively, the sequence in which her character is seduced by Cady was named one of the most unforgettable scenes in film history byEntertainment WeeklyandComplex.[25][26]On working with Scorsese, Lewis has since said, "I liken that period of time to being anointed, or getting my creative wings ... [the experience] changed me [and] gave me a confidence ... It wasn't [about] the outside accolades. It was [Scorsese] nurturing my ingredients as a performer".[27]
In 1992, Lewis had a supporting role inWoody Allen'sHusbands and Wives, with Rita Kempley ofThe Washington Postdescribing her portrayal of Rain—a"Lolita"-esque college student— as "sumptuous".[28]She headlined the romantic dramaThat Nightthe same year, a coming-of-age story set in the 1960s.[29]Lewis appeared in several films in 1993, includingPeter Medak's neo-noir thrillerRomeo Is Bleeding, where she played the mistress of a corrupt cop.[30]She then reunited with Brad Pitt inKalifornia, co-starring as the girlfriend of a serial killer.[31]CriticRoger Ebertdeemed Lewis' portrayal of the childlike Adele one of "the most harrowing and convincing performances I've ever seen".[31]At the time of filmingKalifornia, Lewis and Pitt had been in a relationship since 1990, though they separated the year of its release.[32]Next, she appeared as a psychiatric patient in the music video forMelissa Etheridge's "Come to My Window",[33]and starred in theLasse Hallström-directedWhat's Eating Gilbert Grape(also 1993), playing Becky, a free-spirited drifter who befriends a young man and his disabled brother in a smallMidwesterntown.
Lewis received thePasinetti Awardfor Best Actress at the 1994Venice Film Festivalfor her portrayal of Mallory Knox,[34]a murderous woman who embarks on a killing spree with her psychotic lover, inOliver Stone'ssatiric, controversial crime filmNatural Born Killers.[35]Though criticized for its excessive violence and influencing of copycat crimes,[36]with Lewis later admitting that playing a woman who displays such "volatility and repulsive behavior" had had a detrimental effect on her career,[37]her performance inKillerswas roundly praised,[38]withRolling Stone'sPeter Traversdeeming it "sensational":
Mickey and Mallory are a Bonnie and Clyde for the '90s, Stone's '90s; they're damaged goods — haunted, horny and out for blood.Harrelsonand Lewis ... play the dysfunctional hell out of them ... Women don't [usually] dominate Stone films [but] Lewis towers overKillers, finding the wildcat and the bruised child in Mallory.[39]

The film received largely unfavorable reviews,[46]thoughStephen HoldenofThe New York Timesfelt that it was "beautifully acted", noting, "Carla is played by Ms. Lewis with enormous heart and sensitivity, and with body language so precise that you soon forget it is a performance".[47]Lewis later admitted to having been "scared" by the challenge of portraying somebody with a neurological disorder, saying that it was "the hardest role I have ever had to play".[48]

Her portrayal of Kelly in the latter was particularly well received,[89]withThe New York Timescommenting that it "crackle[s] with authenticity", adding:
The distance between riot grrrl and suburban mom is quite a stretch. But as middle age approaches, time has a way of landing mouthy young rebels in roles they never expected to inhabit. Take Juliette Lewis, the personification of scary defiance [in]Natural Born Killers... InKelly & Cal, [she] conveys the excruciating discomfort of a slightly crumpled former upstart struggling to adapt to a staid, middle-class existence. That means reining in the anarchic impulses of her youth and tolerating polite, buttoned-up in-laws.[90]
Lewis' next role was inJem and the Holograms(2015), an adaptation of the 1980s animated seriesJem,[91]where she played a music producer.

Natalie is nothing like myself. But because there's certain things, like 'tough' and 'wrong side of the tracks' or whatever, people think it's something I've played before, but I haven't. [It has taken] me like 30 years for people to go, 'Wow, she does unpredictable stuff, and it's high quality'".[111]During that same period, Lewis appeared as Judy onPeacock's reboot ofQueer as Folk(2022) and co-starred in the biographical Hulu miniseriesWelcome to Chippendales(also 2022).Richard Roepercalled the latter "colorful and shiny but increasingly dark and twisted" in his review for theChicago Sun-Times, adding that Lewis' portrayal of forthright costume designer Denise Coughlan was "outstanding".[112]

I think there's so much confusion because people don't understand a religion where you can be another religion but you can still practice Scientology".[118]In an interview withTimein 2015, Lewis remarked about protecting her freedom of choice and religion, and being annoyed at people's misconceptions about Scientology: "Whatever people's conceptions are of me, I think it's cute. I roll with it".[119]By 2021, she began to distance herself from Scientology, tellingThe New York TimesandThe Washington Postthat she is aspiritualistand does not identify as a Scientologist.[120][121]
Lewis married professional skateboarderSteve Berrain September 1999.[122]She filed for divorce in April 2003.[123]Lewis described the divorce as "amicable",[123]later commenting, "Steve would be the first to admit he was a workaholic. You have to be ready to have a partnership. And sometimes you're like, 'Whoa, this is too much. I only actually have enough steam to focus on my own thing'".[32]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
