The cumulative gross of his films exceeds $3.3 billion globally.[5]Shyamalan has receivedvarious accolades, including nominations for twoAcademy Awards, twoBAFTA Awardsand aGolden Globe.
Shyamalan was born inMahé, India, and raised inPenn Valley, Pennsylvania. His early films includePraying with Anger(1992) andWide Awake(1998) before his breakthrough filmThe Sixth Sense(1999), which earned himAcademy Awardnominations forBest DirectorandBest Original Screenplay. He then releasedUnbreakable(2000),Signs(2002) andThe Village(2004). After a string of poorly received films—Lady in the Water(2006),The Happening(2008),The Last Airbender(2010), andAfter Earth(2013)—he experienced a career resurgence withThe Visit(2015) andSplit(2016). These were followed by the more critically mixed receptions ofGlass(2019),Old(2021),Knock at the Cabin(2023), andTrap(2024).[6][7][8]
Shyamalan was also one of the executive producers and occasional director of the20th Televisionscience fiction seriesWayward Pines(2015–2016) and theApple TV+psychological horror seriesServant(2019–2023), for which he also served asshowrunner.[9][10]
Shyamalan was born inMahé, India, a town in theUnion TerritoryofPuducherry.[11][12]His father, Dr. Nelliyattu C. Shyamalan, is aMalayalineurologist from Mahé and aJIPMERgraduate;[citation needed]his mother, Dr. Jayalakshmi Shyamalan, aTamilfromChennai, is anOB-GYN.[13]
Shyamalan's parents immigrated to the United States when he was six weeks old.[14]Shyamalan was raisedHinduinPenn Valley, Pennsylvania.[15]He attended the privateRoman Catholic grammar schoolWaldron Mercy Academy. He felt like an outsider and remembers that teachers would say that whoever was not baptized would go to hell.[16]When he was a student there, a teacher once became upset because he "got the best grade in religion class and [he] wasn't Catholic".[16]He later attended theEpiscopal Academy, a privateEpiscopalhigh schoollocated at the time inMerion Station, Pennsylvania.[17][18]
Shyamalan earned theNew York UniversityMerit Scholarship in 1988, and was also aNational Merit Scholar.[19]Shyamalan is an alumnus ofNew York University Tisch School of the ArtsinManhattan,[20]graduating in 1992.[21]It was while studying there that he adopted "Night" as his second name.[citation needed]
Shyamalan had an early desire to be a filmmaker when he was given aSuper 8camera at a young age. Though his father wanted him to follow in the family practice of medicine, his mother encouraged him to follow his passion. By the time he was seventeen, he had made forty-five home movies.[22]On each DVD release of his films, beginning withThe Sixth Senseand with the exception ofLady in the Water, he has included a scene from one of these childhood movies, which, he feels, represents his first attempt at the same kind of film.[22]
Shyamalan made his first film, the semi-autobiographicaldramaPraying with Anger, while still a student at NYU, using money borrowed from family and friends.[23]He wrote and directed his second movie,Wide Awake. His parents were the film'sassociate producers. The drama dealt with a ten-year-old Catholic schoolboy (Joseph Cross) who, after the death of his grandfather (Robert Loggia), searches for God. The film's supporting cast includedDana DelanyandDenis Learyas the boy's parents, as well asRosie O'Donnell,Julia Stiles, andCamryn Manheim.Wide Awakewas filmed in a school Shyamalan attended as a child[24]and earned 1999Young Artist Awardnominations for Best Drama, and, for Cross, Best Performance.[25]Only in limited release, the film grossed $305,704 in theaters, against a $6 million budget.[26]
That same year Shyamalan co-wrote the screenplay forStuart LittlewithGreg Brooker. In 2013, he revealed he was theghostwriterfor the 1999 filmShe's All That, a teen comedy starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook.[27]On June 17, 2013, Jack Lechner (who served as Miramax's head of development in the late 1990s) confirmed that both Shyamalan and R. Lee Fleming, Jr. contributed to the script: Fleming wrote the initial script that Miramax bought while Shyamalan did an uncredited rewrite (doing more than "a polish") that got the film green-lit. Lechner reiterated that content from both writers was included in the final cut of the film.[28]
Shyamalan gained international recognition when he wrote and directed 1999'sThe Sixth Sense, starringBruce Willis, and which became the second-highest grossing horror movie of all time.[29]The Sixth Sensewas nominated for six Academy Awards, includingBest Picture,Best DirectorandBest Original Screenplay.[30]
In July 2000, onThe Howard Stern Show, Shyamalan said he had met with Spielberg and was in early talks to write the script for thefourthIndiana Jonesfilm. This would have given Shyamalan a chance to work with his longtime idol.[31]After the film fell through, Shyamalan later said it was too "tricky" to arrange and "not the right thing" for him to do.[32]
Shyamalan followedThe Sixth Senseby writing and directingUnbreakable(2000), again starring Willis, a stealth superhero film within a thriller, which was both critically and financially successful.
Shyamalan's name was linked with the 2001 filmHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, but it conflicted with the production ofUnbreakable. In July 2006, while doing press tours forLady in the Water, Shyamalan expressed he remained interested in directing one of the last twoHarry Potterfilms: "The themes that run through it ... the empowering of children, a positive outlook ... you name it, it falls in line with my beliefs", Shyamalan said. "I enjoy the humor in it. When I read the firstHarry Potterand was thinking about making it, I had a whole different vibe in my head of it".[33]
His next film,Signs, was released in 2002. The film starsMel Gibsonas a formerEpiscopalian priestwho regains his faith in God during an alien invasion. It was both critically and financially successful and grossed $408 million from a budget of $72 million.[34]
Shyamalan next directedThe Village(2004), about an isolated community living in the woods. Although it received mixed reviews,[35]it was financially successful as it grossed $257 million from a budget of $60 million.[36]
After the release ofThe Villagein 2004, Shyamalan had been planning a film adaptation of Yann Martel's novelLife of Piwith 20th Century Fox, but later backed out so that he could makeLady in the Water. In an interview he said about his reasons for dropping out of that project:[37]
I love that book. I mean, it's basically [the story of] a kid born in the same city as me [Mahe, India] — it almost felt predestined. But I was hesitant because the book has kind of a twist ending. And I was concerned that as soon as you put my name on it, everybody would have a different experience. Whereas if someone else did it, it would be much more satisfying, I think. Expectations, you've got to be aware of them. I'm wishing them all great luck. I hope they make a beautiful movie.
Released in 2006,Lady in the Water, a bedtime story about a water nymph and an apartment superintendent, was both critically and financially unsuccessful, only grossing $72 million worldwide from a budget of $70 million.
Next was the filmThe Happening, ascience fictionthrillerabout an inexplicable natural disaster causing mass suicides, featuring a teacher and his wife fleeing from contaminated cities into the countryside. It was critically unsuccessful but financially successful as it grossed $163 million from a budget of $48 million.[38][39]

Shyamalan would produce, but not direct, one film a year for three years.[40]The first of the three films wasDevil, a supernatural thriller directed by siblingsJohnand Drew Dowdle.

It was critically unsuccessful—with significant criticism aimed at its casting of white actors in Asian and Native American-inspired roles, yet was a financial success, grossing $319 million from a budget of $150 million.
In 2013, Shyamalan directed the filmAfter Earth, based on a script byGary Whittaand starringWill Smithand his son,Jaden. It was received poorly by critics, but was financially successful, making nearly $244 million against a budget of $130 million. Shyamalan later described his thinking in 2013 as full of doubts, introspection and questioning.[43]
Shyamalan announced in January 2014 that he would be working again withBruce Willison a film titledLabor of Love.[44]As of March 2022, and the retirement of Willis, this film had yet to be produced.
Shyamalan's reputation was poor and most Hollywood studios passed on his self-funded, low-budget horror-comedyThe Visit, featuring a brother and sister who are sent to their grandparents’ remote Pennsylvania farm for a weeklong visit. After revising the film,[43]which Shyamalan had shot in secret, Universal picked up rights toThe Visit. The movie went on to gross $98 million worldwide on a budget of $5 million[45]– the fifth-highest grossing thriller film of the year.[46][47]Universal released the movie on September 11, 2015.[47]

In February 2023, it was revealed Shyamalan's next film, titledTrap, would be released in theatres on August 2, 2024 distributed byWarner Bros. Pictures.[58]The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $82 million worldwide.

Shyamalan was also instrumental in the creation of theFoxscience fiction seriesWayward Pines(2015–2016), for which he executive produced and directed the pilot episode. The series became the most-watched show of that summer.[61]
In 2016, TNT first announced that Shyamalan would be responsible for a reboot series forTales from the Crypt. As of June 2017[update]the series had been cancelled due to a number of legal reasons.[62]
He also appeared in an episode of the seriesEntourage.[63]
Shyamalan's production company,Blinding Edge Pictures,[64]is located inBerwyn, Pennsylvania.[65]Blinding Edge has producedServant,Wayward Pines,Devil,The Happening,Lady in the Water,The Village,Signs,Unbreakable,The Last Airbender,After Earth,The Visit,Split,GlassandOld.

While working on his filmThe Happening, Shyamalan developed an interest in improving the delivery of education in American schools. He hired doctoral student James Richardson to do most of the background research and as a result publishedI Got Schooled: The Unlikely Story of How a Moonlighting Movie Maker Learned the Five Keys to Closing America's Education GapthroughSimon and Schusterin 2013.[68]John Willol ofNPRreviewed the book by stating "I Got Schooledis a breezily written, research driven call to change America's approach to education. Shyamalan is smart and sincere, and his innovative ideas are unbound by the educational establishment."[69]
Shyamalan married Bhavna Vaswani, a fellow student whom he met atNew York University.[70]The couple has three daughters, including directorIshanaand musicianSaleka.[71][72]
Shyamalan and his family live near Philadelphia at Ravenwood, a 125-acre (51 ha) estate, built around a 27,000-square-foot (2,500 m2) 1937Georgian Revivalhouse.[73]

In 2023, Shyamalan bought a 218-acre (88 ha) estate from theRockefeller familyinWillistown Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, which has five historic houses and two barns for $24 million.[75]
Rolling Stonewrote thatThe Sixth Sensegave Shyamalan the reputation of "the guy who makes the scary movies with a twist".[43]In 2008, Shyamalan said it was a common misperception that "all my movies have twist endings, or that they're all scary. All my movies are spiritual and all have an emotional perspective".[76]He nonetheless avoided plot twists for years, until again using them starting withThe Visitin 2015.Rolling Stonewrote in 2018,[43]
In his twenties, [Shyamalan] says, "I don't think you could have told me that making thrillers for your whole life wasn't a bad thing. At first it was a sense of, 'Hey, I can make anything.' But that’s hypocritical, because when I pick up anAgatha Christienovel in my library, I have a strong expectation. So, I get it ... When I became happy with the idea of making thrillers for the rest of my life, everything went right."
After the release ofThe Village,Slate's Michael Agger noted that Shyamalan was following "an uncomfortable pattern" of "making fragile, sealed-off movies that fell apart when exposed to outside logic".[77]
Shyamalan has also been nominated for, and in some cases won, numerousGolden Raspberry AwardsforLady in the Waterin 2006,The Happeningin 2008,The Last Airbenderin 2010, andAfter Earthin 2013.[78][79][80][81]In 2016 he was also nominated for theRazzie Redeemer Award.[82]
The Village,Lady in the Water,SplitandTraphave been included inCahiers du Cinémaannual top ten lists.
Shyamalan is also known for setting and shooting his films in and aroundPhiladelphia,Pennsylvania, along with nearbyReading, Pennsylvania.[83][84][85][86]Most of his early commercially successful films were co-produced and released byWalt Disney Studios'TouchstoneandHollywood Picturesimprints. Films of his resurgence, however, were usually released byUniversal Pictures.
In 2008, Shyamalan was honored with thePadma Shriaward by theGovernment of India.[91]Shyamalan was the Jury President of the72nd Berlin International Film Festivalcompetition section.[92]
In 2004, Shyamalan was involved in a mediahoaxwithSyFy Channel, which was eventually uncovered by the press. SyFy claimed in its "documentary" specialThe Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan, shot on the set ofThe Village, that as a child, Shyamalan had been dead for nearly half an hour while drowned in a frozen pond in an accident, and that upon being rescued he had experiences of communicating with spirits, fueling an obsession with the supernatural.[93]
In truth, Shyamalan developed the hoax with SyFy, going so far as having SyFy staffers signnon-disclosure agreementswith a $5 million fine attached and requiring Shyamalan's office to formally approve each step. Neither the childhood accident nor a supposed rift with the filmmakers ever occurred. The hoax included a nonexistent SyFy publicist, "David Westover", whose name appeared onpress releasesregarding the special. SyFy also fed false news stories to theAssociated Press,[94]Zap2It,[95]and theNew York Post,[96]among others.
After an AP reporter confronted SyFy Channel presidentBonnie Hammerat a press conference, Hammer admitted the hoax, saying it was part of aguerrilla marketingcampaign to generate pre-releasepublicityforThe Village. This prompted SyFy's parent company,NBC Universal, to state that the undertaking was "not consistent with our policy at NBC. We would never intend to offend the public or the press and we value our relationship with both."[97]
Robert McIlhinney, a Pennsylvanian screenwriter, sued Shyamalan in 2003, alleging similarities betweenSignsand his unpublished scriptLord of the Barrens: The Jersey Devil.[98][99]
In 2004,Margaret Peterson Haddixclaimed thatThe Villagehas numerous similarities to her young adult novelRunning Out of Time, prompting discussions with publisher Simon & Schuster about filing a lawsuit.[98][99][100]
In response to both allegations, Disney and Shyamalan's production company Blinding Edge issued statements calling the claims "meritless".[100]
Orson Scott Cardhas claimed that many elements ofThe Sixth Sensewere plagiarized from his novelLost Boys, although he has said that enough had been changed that there was no point in suing.[101]
After the release ofThe Happening,The Guardian'sKim Newmanquestioned, "Can it be a kind of racism that the Indian-born, Philadelphia-raised auteur is hammered for his apparent character (or funny name) rather more than, say, Quentin Tarantino or Spike Lee?"[102]TheBritish Film Institute(BFI) also discussed the impact of racism on Shyamalan's career, pointing to frequent mispronunciations of his last name.[103]By 2017,Vicesaid that "Shamalamadingdong" had become the "agreed-upon mockery of his name".[104]
BFI asked if critical attacks are the result of egotistical statements on Shyamalan's part. They question whether his strong statements of self-assurance coupled with the remarkable success ofThe Sixth Senseset up a fall from grace which was soon realized when a run of very successful films (The Sixth Sense,Unbreakable,SignsandThe Village) seemingly collapsed with a string of critical failures (Lady in the Water,The Happening,The Last Airbender, andAfter Earth).[103]In 2019, Tim Greiving ofThe Washington Postsaid that "his confidence was interpreted as arrogance by some, especially after he cast himself inLady in the Wateras a brilliant writer whose book is prophesied as a world-saver." Greiving continued, "Howard, who expressed pride in him for forging ahead despite his turn among critics, noted how rare it was for such a young filmmaker to write, direct and produce original material. He wondered whether that placed a bigger target on his back, as his reputation for doggedness was perpetuated within the industry and reinforced by critics."[105]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
