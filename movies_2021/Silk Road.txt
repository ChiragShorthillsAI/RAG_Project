Silk Roadis a 2021 Americancrime thrillerfilm, written for the screen and directed by Tiller Russell based on theRolling Stonearticle "Dead End on Silk Road: Internet Crime Kingpin Ross Ulbricht's Big Fall" byDavid Kushner.[2]The film starsJason Clarke,Nick Robinson,Alexandra Shipp,Jimmi Simpson,Paul Walter Hauser,Darrell Britt-Gibson, andWill Ropp. It is based on the true story ofRoss Ulbricht, who develops a website on thedarknet, an act which attracts the attention of theFBIandDEA, who send in federal agent Richard "Rick" Bowden, a fictional composite of real life DEA Special Agent Carl Force and US Secret Service Special Agent Shaun Bridges, both of whom were convicted of felonies related to theft of assets in the investigation of Ulbricht, to bring down his empire.
Silk Roadwas released in the United States on February 19, 2021 byLionsgate.[3]
The film begins with Ross Ulbricht's arrest in San Francisco in 2013. It then delves into Ross's background, portraying him as a well-educated aspiring entrepreneur living in Austin, Texas. Ross comes up with the idea for Silk Road as a way to challenge government control and regulations, believing in the idea of taking back liberty. He starts the website to allow anonymous buying and selling of illegal goods.
The movie introduces Ross Ulbricht, a charismatic and tech-savvy young man who creates the Silk Road, an underground website that facilitates the sale of illegal drugs and other contraband using cryptocurrencies. Ulbricht adopts the alias "Dread Pirate Roberts" to operate the site anonymously.
Ross meets Julia, a student who becomes his lover and partner in crime. As Silk Road gains popularity, Ross makes millions by facilitating the sale of illegal items such as drugs, weapons, and identity information. However, when a Gawker article about Silk Road brings unwanted attention, law enforcement begins investigating the darknet marketplace.
DEA agent Rick Bowden, who has been reassigned to the cybercrimes unit after rehab, is tasked with investigating Silk Road. He enlists an informant to teach him about darknet activities, leading to clashes with fellow agents and strains in his personal life.
As Silk Road thrives, Ross becomes increasingly isolated from Julia and his friend Max, who express concerns about his illegal activities. Ross, operating under the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, becomes a sensation on Silk Road and engages in various interactions with sellers and buyers on the website, all while maintaining a sense of invincibility.
DEA agents, including Rick, work tirelessly to track down the owner of Silk Road, leading to a sting operation orchestrated by Rick. The film portrays Ross's eventual arrest and the dismantling of Silk Road.
Throughout the movie, the personal struggles of both Ross and Rick are depicted, shedding light on their motivations and challenges. Ross's arrest has a profound impact on his relationships and the lives of those affected by Silk Road. The film touches on themes of hubris, greed, and the clash between individual freedom and law enforcement. It also explores the complexities of Ross's character and the blurred lines between the moralities of the law and the actions of its enforcers.
As the Silk Road gains notoriety, law enforcement agencies become determined to shut it down. Rick Bowden, a DEA agent, takes on the case and begins investigating Ulbricht. Bowden is portrayed as a dedicated law enforcement officer who is intent on bringing down Silk Road and its elusive operator.
Ross Ulbricht continues to manage Silk Road, amassing a substantial fortune through the illicit marketplace. He forms alliances and confronts threats from both law enforcement and rival criminals within the dark web.
In the end, Ross Ulbricht is arrested and faces the legal consequences of his actions, highlighting the significant impact of Silk Road on the world of online criminal enterprises and the ongoing debate about the boundaries of individual liberty and government intervention in the digital age.
The film reaches its climax when Ulbricht is finally apprehended by law enforcement, and his true identity is revealed. He is arrested and faces a lengthy trial for drug trafficking, money laundering, and other charges related to Silk Road. During the trial, Ulbricht's defense team argues that he was framed and that he is not the true Dread Pirate Roberts.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
