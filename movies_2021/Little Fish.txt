Raúl Castillo Jr. was born to Raúl H. Castillo Sr. and Adela "Adelita" Rodríguez de Castillo.[3][4]He has an older brother, Tony, and a younger sister.[2][5]His parents areMexicanemigrants fromReynosa,Tamaulipas, Mexico,[2][6][7]who later moved toMcAllen, Texas, where he and his siblings were raised.[4]His hometown of McAllen was 90 percent Mexican-American.[8]Living so close to the Mexico–United States border, Castillo's family would often visit family members who still lived in Reynosa, affording him an upbringing that he describes as "very much bicultural."[6]Castillo states that growing up in a border town made him feel American when he visited Mexico, but Mexican when he traveled around the United States.[8]He explains he was "too American for Mexico, but too Mexican for the U.S."[9]He was raised Catholic.[10]His childhood nickname was "Gordo" ("fat", in Spanish), due to his weight.[11]
Castillo first became interested in acting in the third grade, after seeing his older brother in a school production ofThe Wizard of Ozas theTin Woodman. His brother also was a musician who played guitar,[12]his dedication having been seen by Castillo as he would sit and play scales for hours, which inspired Castillo to use the same technique later for his own performances.[12]He auditioned the next year for a school play, reportedly "about a mouse and a clock", but could not stop giggling during his audition and was cast instead in a non-speaking role as a guard.[5]While in sixth grade at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic School, Castillo met and befriended futureMutemathbassguitaristRoy Mitchell-Cárdenas.[7][13]Later, in high school, they started anundergroundpunk-rock band called IPM (short for "Influential Phecal Material") together with their friends Nick Trevino and Robert Vleck.[7][13][14][15]Mitchell-Cárdenas played drums while Castillo played bass guitar.[7][14][15]Before he began acting, Castillo considered pursuing a serious career as arock musician.[16]
Castillo states that he started acting when he was 14.[15]Seeking an elective class option when enteringMcAllen High School, and a way to make friends, he turned to theater, which was popular at his high school.[16]He became deeply involved in the high school drama department, which he says looked "fun".[3][15]His background playing music since age 11 made performing on stage feel natural for him.[3][15]His first acting role was in a high school production ofPaul Zindel's playThe Secret Affairs of Mildred Wild.[17]Castillo also performed in his school’s production ofI Remember Mama.[18]It was then, at age 14, that he met and became friends with future staff writer forDevious Maids,GirlsandLooking, Tanya Saracho, who also attended McAllen High School.[7][15]Saracho influenced Castillo greatly, introducing him to playwrights and encouraging to develop his own tastes in drama.[16]Castillo cites the 1993 filmCarlito's Wayas the film that "changed everything" for him.[16]He was inspired by the performances ofJohn Leguizamo,John Ortiz,Viggo Mortensen, andLuis Guzmánin particular.[16]He even memorized some of Leguizamo's phrases and dialogue, such as "Spic-O-Rama", "Mambo Mouth", and "Freak".[12]Castillo also found inspiration from several Hispanic artists in the media, includingMiguel Piñero, and an anthology of works from theNuyorican Poets Cafe.[9]He looked up to several actors, such asAl PacinoandAnthony Quinn, as icons, and spent much of his time watching the filmThe Outsiders.[12]
After graduating high school, Castillo went on to studyplaywritingas an undergraduate atBoston University College of Fine Arts,[3][17]though he continued to act, and majored in theater.[7][17]During his studies, Castillo felt that the most important skill he developed there was learning how to produce his own work.[5]He would regularly put on plays during the school's student-run playwright's festival.[5]This university offered festival gave Castillo a platform for his original work. Most of his early plays were heavy and serious, dealing with the sociopolitical and racial tensions on the border of Mexico and the United States,[12]including a trio of one-act plays calledBorder Stories, about life on the Mexico–United States border in Reynosa.[19]He graduated from Boston University in 1999.[19][20]
Castillo viewed himself as more of a writer, despite his performing abilities. It was not until after college, while performing the lead role in a 2000 production ofSantos & Santosat the Nushank Theater Collective inAustin, Texas,[21]that he felt encouraged in identifying as an actor as well.[7]He eventually moved toNew York Cityin 2002, which he describes as the smartest decision he made for his career.[5][22]
Castillo has an extensive off-Broadway theater career.[15]Right after college, Castillo performed in Austin, Texas in a 2000 production of "Santos & Santos", loosely based onJamiel Chagraand his brothers.[21]It was during that production that Castillo solidified his confidence in being a professional actor.[21]Castillo joined theLAByrinth Theater Companyas a writer shortly after moving to New York.[15]His on-stage acting debut was with the LAByrinth Theater Company's production ofJosé Rivera's playSchool of the Americasat New York'sPublic Theaterin 2006.[15][23]There he met actress and later co-starSandra Ohwhile she was performing in the Public Theater's production ofSatellites.[15]His performance as Beto in theEnsemble Studio Theatre's 2008 production of José Rivera'sFlowerswas described as "flawlessly nuanced" by Laura Collins-Hughes ofThe New York Sun.[24]In 2009, he performed in the Off-Broadway premier ofCusi Cram'sA Lifetime BurningatPremiere Stages.[25]In 2012, he was cast inGoodman Theater's production of the Cándido Tirado's playFish Men, about theGuatemalan genocide, in the lead role of Rey Reyes.[15][26]Castillo also appeared in the 2012 BareBones production ofJesus Hopped the 'A' Trainin Pittsburgh, the inaugural performance of which was directed byPhilip Seymour Hoffmanfor the LAByrinth Theater Company.[27]He later was cast in the BareBones reading ofThe Way Westat theLark Theater.[28]Castillo worked withINTAR Theater, cast in the role of Ismael in the theater's 2014 production ofAdoration of the Old Womanto positive reviews.[29][30]He starred alongside Sandra Oh in the role of Gerardo in the 2014Victory Gardens Theaterproduction ofDeath and the Maiden,[15]which was well received by critics.[31]Death and the Maidendeals with the lives of a couple, a woman who has dealt with some of the atrocities that have occurred under a dictatorship.[32]Castillo describes his heavy role as a "character dealing with the bureaucracy of government, trying to look into the crimes that were committed, specifically the deaths that were committed during the dictatorship".[32]Death and the Maidenwas originally produced on Broadway withGlenn Close,Richard Dreyfuss, andGene Hackman, but Latino actors such as Castillo felt undervalued when ethnic characters were not cast in a play by a Chilean playwright.[32]

Castillo describes his role inLookingas important to the LGBTQ and Latino community. In an interview withBackstage, Castillo states "Especially being a straight guy, I wanted to honor this character. And even though it wasn't representing the entire community—this was one story—I knew there would be a lot of expectations. I know, having done projects around the Latino community, that there were going to be a lot of people paying attention."[12]He toldOutmagazinethat he hopes that his character on the show will both enlighten and educate straight audiences, as well as shed light on some of the experiences of the gay Latino community.[8]Castillo and his character Richie gained a large social media following, using the hashtag #TeamRichie.[41]In the show's second season, Castillo was added as a regular cast member alongside co-stars Groff, Frankie J.

When I would go to Mexico, my brother and sister and I would be thegringos. Then I went out to school in Boston and felt so un-American. Everyone always asked, "Where are you from?" I said, "Texas." And then they said, "No, where are youfromfrom?" Then I understood that this is what most of America is like, and that I grew up sheltered.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
