It is the first live-action film in the series not to featureMilla Jovovichin the lead role or her characterAlice.
Development took place in early 2017, afterResident Evil: The Final Chapterwas released, with producerJames Wanexpressing interest in the project. Later,Constantin FilmchairmanMartin Moszkowiczsaid that a reboot of the film series was in development. In the same month, Wan was called to produce the reboot with a script byGreg Russo; subsequently, Roberts was hired as both writer and director and both Wan and Russo left the project. Filming began on October 17, 2020, inGreater Sudbury,Ontario,Canada. The film underwentreshootsin May 2021.
Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon Cityhad its world premiere at theGrand RexinParison November 19, 2021, and was theatrically released on November 24, 2021, in the United States bySony Pictures Releasing. The film grossed $42 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.
In the 1980s,Claire Redfieldand her older brotherChrisare children living at the Raccoon City Orphanage. Claire befriendsLisa Trevor, a disfigured girl who has been experimented on by Dr.William Birkin, an employee for theUmbrella Corporation, who takes children for his experimental research. Claire escapes the orphanage.
In 1998, she returns to Raccoon City, hitchhiking in a semi-truck. The truck driver accidentally hits a woman on the road, who disappears. The driver'sDobermannlicks the blood left behind, and over time becomes erratic. At a diner, rookie police officerLeon S. Kennedynotices that the diner's owner has blood coming out of her eyes. Claire warns Chris about Umbrella's experiments, revealing journalistBen Bertoluccias her source. After Chris leaves, a child breaks into the house, running from his mother; both are erratic and bloody. Claire escapes.
At the police station, the STARS Alpha team meets with ChiefBrian Irons, who explains that the Bravo team went missing while investigating a death at the remote Spencer Mansion. The Alpha team, composed of Chris,Jill Valentine,Richard Aiken,Brad Vickers, andAlbert Wesker, is sent to the mansion by helicopter to investigate. Unknown to his teammates, Wesker is an operative for an unidentified party, tasked with stealing Birkin's virus. Inside, the team encounters zombies eating the bodies of the Bravo team. Brad gets bitten and crashes the helicopter. Richard is eaten; Chris and Jill flee into the secret passage Wesker unlocked.
The truck driver, bitten by his dog, transforms into a zombie and crashes his truck in front of the police station. Chief Irons tries to drive out of the city but is fired on by Umbrella guards attempting to contain the outbreak. He returns to the station, where Claire and Leon encounter Bertolucci locked in a cell. Bertolucci is bitten by a zombie inmate and the station becomes overrun. Leon, Claire, and Irons escape to the Orphanage, looking for a secret Umbrella tunnel leading to the mansion.
ALickerkills Irons and attacks Leon, but he is saved by Lisa. She recognizes Claire and gives them the keys to the secret passage. The pair discovers the secret lab where Umbrella was experimenting on children. Wesker encounters Dr. Birkin and his family inside and has a shootout with them; he kills Birkin's wife in self-defense. Jill shoots Wesker. Before apparently dying, Wesker tells her to escape via the underground train before the Umbrella Corporation destroys the city. Birkin injects himself with the "G-Virus" and mutates.
Chris, Sherry Birkin, Jill, Claire and Leon board the train but are derailed when Raccoon City is destroyed, allowing a monster version of Dr. Birkin to reach them. Leon destroys the monster with a rocket launcher. As the Corporation states that there were zero civilian survivors in the aftermath of the destruction, the five survivors walk out of the train tunnel, leaving Raccoon City behind.
In themid-credits scene, Wesker awakens in a body bag, unable to see anything. A mysterious figure hands him sunglasses and introduces herself asAda Wong.
Pre-production took place in early 2017 whileResident Evil: The Final Chapterwas still in theatres, withConstantin FilmchairmanMartin Moszkowiczsaying that a reboot of the series was in development, and producerJames Wanexpressing interest in the project.[11][12]Greg Russowas attached as writer in 2017. Russo, who was also attached to write the script forMortal Kombat(2021) at the time, worked with Wan in creating aResident Evilstory he considered to be "brutal and horrifying", and drew inspiration from the 2017 video gameResident Evil 7: Biohazard, though he would later clarify he only drew on the tones of the game—"scary, isolated, alone"—rather than the story itself.[13]Russo wantedMoonlight Sonata, a composition featured inseveralResident Evilgames, to feature in the opening credits.[14]Constantin was unimpressed with this script, feeling the game was too recent and its potential failure could harm film sales. Seeking alternate story ideas, Constantin proposed the incorporation at one point of a time travel subplot. Ultimately, Wan and Russo decided to leave the project citing creative differences and their departures were confirmed in December 2018.[15][16][17]
What I loved about the games was that they were just scary, and that's a lot of what I wanted, that atmosphere. It's raining constantly, it's dark, it's scary,Raccoon Cityis a rotten character. I wanted to put [it] and mix it with the fun side, especially with the narrative style of the first game. We had a lot of fun, we even used the fixed angles that the first game has when the characters are at Spencer Mansion.
In December 2018, it was announced thatJohannes Robertswas attached to write and direct the film.[19]In August 2019, Roberts toldScreen Rantthat the reboot would be "super, super scary" and more faithful to the games than the previous films.[20]In a statement toDeadline Hollywood, Roberts said the film would be based onResident Evil(1996) andResident Evil 2(1998).[21]
Roberts said he wanted to give the film a darker tone. Inspired byJohn Carpenter's films, includingHalloween,Assault on Precinct 13, andThe Fog, the filmmaker explained that the story was divided between two main locations: Spencer Mansion from the first game and the Raccoon Police Department, which first appeared inResident Evil 2. Roberts chose the tone for theremake of the second gameas a model for the film.[18]Although directorPaul W. S. AndersonandMilla Jovovichreleased six commercially successful films based on the games between 2002 and 2017, Roberts emphasized that his version was different from the series that preceded it:
It's a totally separate story that is based on the roots of the game and the world of terror. I fell in love with Milla Jovovich, that first film is a lot of fun... but it was a real pleasure to get the reins of a new franchise. I had never seen the horror and atmosphere of the games [in the movies], what I felt when I was playing those games or watching from behind the shoulders of people playing games. I never felt it on the screen, and this is something I wanted to tell you about.[18]
In early drafts, the screenplay was ambitious, incorporating a variety of mutants from the first two games into the narrative even if only passively. The story was from the start intended as an ensemble piece comparable toResident Evil: Apocalypse, following several major characters in the film as their paths converge. Over the course of 2019 and 2020, the film script was repeatedly altered, keeping the main story but removing a number of CG-heavy elements, condensing the supporting cast and tweaking the protagonists' arcs. Earlier drafts also included more original characters, monsters and locations from the games, before Roberts had to make changes to his script after the budget was cut from $40 million to $25 million.[22]Some of the cuts and changes were made so late that most of the concept artwork done by Daniel Carrasco for the monsters to be featured was finished, including Hunters, Chimeras, Crimson Heads, Pale Heads, giant spiders, Neptune (giant shark), Tyrant (aka Mr. X), and others.[23][24][25]
Originally, Claire and Chris had no connection with Birkin or Ben Bertolucci, this was added later to help streamline the story after other script changes. The characters were also closer to their original video game versions; Jill was not written as a reckless wildcard and Claire was not a conspiracy theorist who already knew of Umbrella's intentions. Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers and other characters from the games were originally in the scripts, and some had death scenes written for them. Some of the action scenes were cut down or changed, mostly due to budget cuts, such as a scene where Lisa Trevor sacrifices herself attacking Birkin while everyone else escapes on the train.[22][26]
In early 2020, casting was underway but was delayed by theCOVID-19 pandemic.[27]On October 6,Deadline Hollywoodreported that Scodelario andHannah John-Kamenhad been cast asClaire RedfieldandJill Valentine, alongsideRobbie Amell,Tom Hopper,Avan Jogia, andNeal McDonoughasChris Redfield,Albert Wesker,Leon S. Kennedy, andWilliam Birkin, respectively.[21]That November,Donal Loguewas cast as ChiefBrian Irons,[9]alongside Chad Rook asRichard Aiken,[10]andLily GaoasAda Wong.[28]
In Japan, Capcom later confirmed the characters will be dubbed by voice actors different from the Anderson films. For example, Chris and Claire are voiced bySubaru KimuraandFairouz Aiinstead ofHiroki TōchiandHiroe Oka.[29][additional citation(s) needed]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 30% of 90 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon Cityis an affectionately faithful adaptation that further proves its source material is ill-suited to the big screen."[63]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 44 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[64]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it a 61% positive score, with 48% saying they would definitely recommend it.[51]
In a positive review, Johnny Oleksinski from theNew York Postgave 3 out of 4 stars and said the film is "empty-headed good fun that's blessedly under two hours and has just enough character development to make you kind of care when someone gets bitten".[65]Ferdosa Abdi fromScreen Rantcalled it a "fun and faithful adaptation of the games", but felt it was "lacking in character substance".[66]Sean Keane fromCNETpraised the film: "Despite the lack of scares, minor tweaks to the games' lore and overall silliness, director Johannes Roberts' love forResident Evilis clear in every moment ofWelcome to Raccoon City. With a barrage of Easter eggs and fascinating takes on classic characters, the film's a gleeful trip back to the Spencer Mansion and Raccoon Police Department aimed squarely at fans."[67]
Taylor Lyles ofIGNgave the film a 6/10 score, explaining, "Director Mr. Roberts does deserve some credit for sticking much more closely to the source material than thePaul W. S. Andersonfilms, but a short runtime, a rushed third act, and lack of elements to make it truly scary to watch in the dark hold it back immensely. Nevertheless, it should serve as decent fun for fans."[68]In a mixed review, Mark Hanson fromSLANTwrote "Roberts clearly establishes the hauntingly depressed industrial environment of Raccoon City while methodically spacing out his zombie attacks, which, while not especially innovative, at times put a pit in your stomach like theResident Evilgames do."[69]
Charles Bramesco fromThe A.V. Clubgave the film a C+ and called it "totally bereft of the visual distinction or creative personality that often made its predecessors intriguing diamonds in the rough".[70]Nick Schager fromVarietycriticized the "bevy of unexplained details, dropped subplots, paper-thin characterizations and fright-free mayhem".[2]Kimberly Myers from theLos Angeles Timesalso gave a negative review, noting the film "may reward longtime fans of the video games by returning to the series' origins, but others will find themselves wanting to leave town, much like the movie's characters".[71]
Director Johannes Roberts stated that if a sequel were to be developed, he would like to adapt the story fromResident Evil – Code: Veronica—referenced in the film with an appearance of the Ashford Twins[72][73]—and thenResident Evil 4. He also expressed interest in adaptingResident Evil 7: BiohazardandResident Evil Villagein the future.[74]
Robbie Amell stated he hoped to return as Chris in a sequel that included his boulder-punching scene fromResident Evil 5.[75]By June 2022, Tom Hopper confirmed Sony and Constantin Film were pleased with the film's success on video-on-demand and said he hoped to play Albert Wesker again.[76]
By October 2022, the film was one of several projects confirmed by executive producer Martin Moszkowicz to be in development alongside another television series which would have replacedNetflix's seriescancelled two months prior, though the exact details were not given, and Moszkowicz was skeptical of films being released for theatres if not projected to be successful.[77]
In April 2023, Raccoon HG Film Productions, which financedWelcome to Raccoon City, received a grant ofCA$2million from theNorthern Ontario Heritage FundCorporation for the production of a film titledResident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.Greater Sudburywas picked as the principal film location.[78]According to Jeff Sneider, the studio was looking atZach Creggerto direct the new film.[79][80][81]

Screen Gemsis an American film production company owned bySony Pictures Entertainment, a subsidiary of Japanese multinational conglomerate,Sony Group Corporation.[1]TheScreen Gemsbrand has served several different purposes for its parent companies over the decades since its incorporation, initially as a cartoon studio, then a television studio, and later on as a film studio. The label currently serves as a film production that specializes in genre films, mainly horror.[2]
Screen Gems is a member of theMotion Picture Association(MPA).[3]
When producerPat Sullivancame toHarry Warnerto sign a contract with him on his andOtto Messmer's seriesFelix the Cat, he declined and instead told his soon-to-be former secretaryMargaret J. Winklerthat she should form her own company and take control of the distribution of the series. Winkler formed M.J. Winkler Productions and soon also took control ofMaxandDave Fleischer's seriesOut of the Inkwell. By 1923 she and Sullivan were arguing, and that same year the Fleischer Brothers formed their own distribution company named Red Seal. Winkler saw an unreleased short calledAlice's Wonderland, a cartoon produced and directed byWalt Disney, and became impressed with the short. The two agreed to make a series about the cartoon. In 1924,Charles Mintzmarried Winkler, and the latter's career began to decline. Mintz quickly assumed Winkler's role in the company, later rebranding it Winkler Pictures.
In 1925 Winkler's renewal contract for the Felix shorts was written, yet Winkler declined to renew due to her dispute with Sullivan. The following year theAlice Comediesstopped being distributed by Winkler. After Mintz become involved with the progress it was clear that Disney was unhappy with the production costs on cartoons, and he asked Disney andUb Iwerksto develop a new character. The result wasOswald the Lucky Rabbit, the first animated character forUniversal Pictures.[4]In February 1928, when the character proved more successful than expected, Disney sought to meet with Mintz over the budget, wanting to spend more on the cartoons. Mintz refused, and hired away all ofWalt Disney Studios's animators except Iwerks, Les Clark, and Johnny Cannon, who all refused to leave Disney. He moved the production of the Oswald cartoons to Winkler Pictures, along with Margaret Winkler's brother, George. After losing the Oswald contract toWalter Lantz, Mintz focused onKrazy Kat(a character from a comic strip by cartoonistGeorge Herriman), which was the output of a Winkler-distributed property.
M.J. Winkler Productions became known as Winkler Pictures after Mintz took over in 1926 and partnered withColumbia Picturesfor distribution in 1929. In 1931, when the studio moved from New York to California, it was renamed The Charles Mintz Studio.[5]
The Charles Mintz studio became known as Screen Gems in 1933. The name was originally used in 1933, whenColumbia Picturesacquired a stake in Charles Mintz's animation studio.[6]The name was derived from an early Columbia Pictures slogan, "Gems of the Screen"; itself a takeoff on the song "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean".[7]Mintz was nominated for twoAcademy Awardsfor Best Short Subject. His first nomination was in 1935 forHoliday Land, and he was nominated again in 1937 forThe Little Match Girl. For about a decade,Charles MintzproducedKrazy Kat,Scrappy, and theColor Rhapsodyanimated short series Columbia Pictures. Also, between 1937 to 1940, several Color Rhapsody films were subcontracted toUb Iwerkswith the use of his ownanimation studio.
The studio's color cartoons were well received, while some other cartoons were not, mainly the laterKrazy KatandScrappyshorts. Animator Isidore Klein was particularly frustrated with theKrazy Katcartoons as it bear little resemblance to Herriman's comic strip by the mid 1930s (despite attempting to make a more faithful cartoon with the 1936 shortLil' Ainjil, which Klein was disappointed by the final product).[8]Furthermore, Columbia gave Mintz strict financial obligations where they advance a certain amount of money, resulting Mintz repeatedly running intocost overruns.[9]In 1939, after becoming indebted to Columbia and suffering from declining health, Mintz relinquished ownership of his studio and the Screen Gems name to Columbia to settle longstanding financial problems.[10]He would later pass away on December 30, 1939, from a heart attack.Krazy Katwas discontinued the following year, while the Scrappy cartoons ended a year afterwards.
By 1940, Columbia would oversee management of the studio following ownership. The studio's production manager, Jimmy Bronis, became the studio head but was shortly replaced by Mintz's brother-in-law, George Winkler. The following year, Columbia decided to hireFrank Tashlin, previously a writer forWalt Disney Productionsand director forLeon Schlesinger Productions, as the studio head instead.[11]Tashlin had a profound effect to the studio as he planned to revitalize it to greater heights. There, he would hire many displaced animators from the 1941Disney animators' strike, as well as making the decision of firing the bulk of their initial in-house staff (includingArthur Davis,Manny Gould,Lou Lilly, Ben Harrison and Winkler). He would also direct the shortThe Fox and the Grapes. Based on theAesop fable of the same name, the short would inadvertently spawn Columbia's most successful characters withThe Fox and the Crow, a comic duo of a refined Fox and a street-wise Crow. Tashlin was later replaced by Ben Schwalb as producer in April 1942, but continued to work there as a creative supervisor.[12]
Tashlin proved to be very influential to his staff, as he allowed and encouraged them to pursue the wildest of ideas under his supervision. However, his stay at Screen Gems would be short-lived, as he would later leave the studio in June following an argument with Columbia higher-ups.[12][13]When interviewed by Michael Barrier, he said that the management "can't stay happy long when things are going well, so we ended up in another fracas and I left."[11]He was replaced byDave Fleischer(who produced the 1942 WWII shortSong of Victoryunder Tashlin's supervision), previously the co-founder and head supervisor ofFleischer Studios.John Hubleydescribed Fleischer as being very detached from his employees, calling him "one of the world's intellectual lightweights". He was also known for editing completed cartoons in a way that broke continuity.[14]He was later fired and succeeded by a revolving door of producers, including musician Paul Worth,Three StoogesproducerHugh McCollumand ex-Schlesinger assistants Ray Katz and Henry Binder. The studio would also create several more recurring characters around this time, includingTito and His Burrito,Flippy,Flop the Cat, Igor Puzzlewitz,Willoughby Wren,and an adaptation ofAl Capp'scomic seriesLi'l Abner, with varying levels of success.
Tashlin's departure had an immediate effect to the studio in a direction standpoint, with animation historians noting that the quality of there cartoons had declined soon after. Film historianLeonard Maltinclaimed that after Tashlin left, the studio "tried to maintain some spirit on-screen, with varying results. Screen Gems cartoons of the 1940s feature some of the least endearing cartoon characters ever created, and suffer from misguided story direction," which was seen in shorts such asMass Mouse Meeting(1943) andGiddy-Yapping(1944).[15]Hubley, who went on to directProfessor Tall and Mr. Small,He Can't Make It StickandThe Rocky Road to Ruin(all 1943) with Paul Sommer, said to have disliked his work at the studio, and that Columbia "hated" the cartoons they were making.[14]Capp was also reportedly displeased with the quality of theLi'l Abnercartoons, which was discontinued after five cartoons,[16]and the shorts produced by Katz and Binder were criticized for being "pale carbons of the Warner Brothers shorts,"[17]to the point of creating clone characters ofSylvester the Cat, andDaffy Duck, respectively.[18]
In addition to Tashlin's departure, many of the ex-Disney animators that he hired also left for other studios; the inability to hire and maintain more experienced directors and storymen, as well as Columbia's mismanagement were also argued as other key factors to the studios diminished quality. Some staff members during this period included Bob Wickersham, Alec Geiss, Sid Marcus (one of the few pre-Tashlin artists who stayed in the studio), Howard Swift andAlex Lovy.Bob Clampettwas also brought in as a gag writer before setting up his own brief animation studio forRepublic Pictures, whileLooney TunewritersMichael MalteseandTedd Piercewere said to have moonlighted for a few cartoons.[19][20]
Screen Gems was, in an attempt to keep costs low, the last American animation studio to stop producing black and white cartoons. The final black-and-white Screen Gems shorts appeared in 1946, over three years after the second-longest holdouts (Famous Studiosand Leon Schlesinger Productions). During that same year, Columbia, still dissatisfied of the studios output, decided to shut its doors for good, but continured to release a back catalog of shorts up until 1949.[21]The studio name was later repurposed for a television division, while the former Seward Street facility, which Screen Gems occupied since 1940, was taken over byWalter Lantz Productionsin 1947.[22]
The Screen Gems cartoons were regarded as ones of varying quality, comparable to those produced byFamous StudiosandTerrytoons. In spite of the studio's internal affairs, the Screen Gems' cartoons were still moderately successful, with three more cartoons achievingAcademy Awards nominations. The cartoons produced and supervised by Tashlin were also praised for his attempts at revitalizing the studio. However, Screen Gems never achieved a level of success comparable toWalt Disney Productions,Warner Bros. Cartoons,Walter Lantz Productionsand theMGM Cartoon Studio. The studio's purpose was assumed by an outside producer,United Productions of America(UPA), whose cartoons, includingGerald McBoing-Boingand theMr. Magooseries, were major critical and commercial successes. Following UPA, a deal withHanna-Barberawas made in 1957, which lasted until 1967.
In 1999,Columbia TriStar International TelevisionproducedTotally Tooned In- a syndicated TV package showcasing Columbia's classic cartoon library. With the aid of animation historianJerry Beck, Columbia restored and remastered the majority of the color Screen Gems cartoons (as well as all the UPA cartoons) from their original 35mm elements. The show aired in several international markets before making its American television debut onAntenna TVon January 8, 2011. They would later be aired onToon In With Meon theMeTVNetwork in November 2021.[23]Despite these restoration efforts,Sony Pictures Home Entertainmenthas no current plans to release these shorts on DVD or Blu-ray. Since CPE Holdings, Inc. became dormant on May 9, 2024,Sony Pictures Releasingnow owns the theatrical distribution on behalf ofColumbia Pictures, whileSony Pictures Televisionowns the television distribution on behalf of CPT Holdings, Inc. to the majority of the color Screen Gems cartoons (as well as all the UPA cartoons) library.
All series were distributed by Columbia unless otherwise noted.[24]
Ralph Cohn, the son of Columbia co-founderJack Cohnand nephew of Columbia headHarry Cohn, founded Pioneer Telefilms, a television commercial production company, in 1947. Ralph later wrote a 50-page memo arguing that Columbia should be the first major film studio to move into television. Although Harry wasn't convinced by the suggestion, Columbia invested $50,000 acquiring Pioneer and reorganized it as Screen Gems.[26]The studio started its new business in New York on April 15, 1949.[27]
By 1951, Screen Gems became a full-fledged television studio by producing and syndicating several popular shows(seebelow). Within a few months, Ralph Cohn had sold a half-hour dramatic anthology concept to theFord Motor Companywhich becameFord Theatre, which was one of the first times a major Hollywood movie studio had produced content for television. They also produced seven episodes of the first season ofCavalcade of America.[28][29]
The name "Screen Gems," at the time, was used to hide the fact that the film studio was entering television production and distribution. Many film studios saw television as a threat to their business, thus it was expected that they would shun the medium. However, Columbia was one of a few studios who branched out to television under a pseudonym to conceal the true ownership of the television arm. That is until 1955, when Columbia decided to usethe woman from its logounder the Screen Gems banner, officially billing itself as a part of "the Hollywood studios of Columbia Pictures", as spoken in announcements at the end of some Screen Gems series.
By 1952, the studio had produced a series of about 100 film-record coordinated releases for television under the brand "TV Disk Jockey Toons" in which the films "synchronize perfectly with the records".[30]
In 1954, the studio started producingFather Knows Beston CBS andThe Adventures of Rin Tin Tinon ABC, which became their biggest successes at the time.[26]
On July 1, 1956, studio veteranIrving Briskinstepped down as stage manager of Columbia Pictures and formed his own production company Briskin Productions, Inc. to release series through Screen Gems and supervise all of its productions.[31]On December 10, 1956, Screen Gems expanded into television syndication by acquiring Hygo Television Films (a.k.a. Serials Inc.) and its affiliated company United Television Films, Inc. Hygo Television Films was founded in 1951 by Jerome Hyams, who also acquired United Television Films in 1955 that was founded by Archie Mayers.[32]
During that year, the studio began syndicating Columbia Pictures' theatrical film library to television, including the series of two-reel short subjects starringThe Three Stoogesin 1957. Earlier on August 2, 1957, they also acquired syndication rights to "Shock Theater", a package ofUniversal Pictureshorror films (later shifted toMCA TV), which was enormously successful in reviving that genre.[33]
From 1958 to 1974, under President John H. Mitchell and Vice President of ProductionHarry Ackerman, Screen Gems delivered TV shows and sitcoms:Dennis the Menace,The Donna Reed Show,Hazel,Here Come the Brides,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,Gidget,Bewitched,I Dream of Jeannie,The Flying Nun,The Monkees,The Girl with Something ExtraandThe Partridge Family.
It was also the first distributor forHanna-Barbera Productions, an animation studio founded byWilliam HannaandJoseph Barberaafter leavingMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and was also the distributor of theSoupy Salesshow. The company also entered a co-production deal withCanada'sCTV Television Networkand produced several shows, many of which were filmed or taped inTorontofor distribution to Canadian stations (Showdown,The Pierre Berton Show).[citation needed]The company even expanded as far asAustralia, opening Screen Gems Australia to produce shows for that country's networks, includingThe Graham Kennedy Showfor theNine Network.[34]
In the late 1950s, Screen Gems also entered into ownership and operation of television stations. Stations owned by Screen Gems over the years included KCPX (Salt Lake City; nowKTVX, owned byNexstar Media Group),WVUE-DT(New Orleans; now owned byGray Television),WAPA-TV(San Juan; now owned by the Hemisphere Media Group),WNJU(Linden, NJ; nowTelemundo/NBCUniversalO&O), and several radio stations as well, including 50,000-watt clear channelWWVA(Wheeling, WV; now owned byiHeartMedia). As a result, in funding its acquisitions, 18% of Screen Gems' shares was spun off from Columbia and it became a publicly-traded company on the NYSE until 1968. Screen Gems also provided technical assistance and partial control of a private television station inVenezuela,Canal 11 Televisión, which existed from 1966 to 1968.[35][36]

Constantin FilmverleihGmbHwas founded in West Germany on 1 April 1950 byPreben PhilipsenandWaldfried Barthel[de], who would later become the head of publicity for the company. It was originally the country's national distributor of films produced byColumbia PicturesandUnited Artists. Throughout the 1950s, Constantin distributed both popular and art-house films from several nations as well as medium-budgeted domestic films.
Constantin's popularity grew through the late 1950s to the 1960s by not only distributing popular films but creating its own in-house talent roster of contract players (Joachim Fuchsberger,Heinz Drache), directors and producers (Wolf C. Hartwig), as well as co-financinginternational co-productionfilms shot in Italy, such as theClint Eastwood spaghetti westerns, the films ofHarry Alan Towersand others using their own stable of stars.

KG and from diversified holdings for the first time in 2002. In 2003, the board of Constantin Film AG embarked on a new strategic path for the company: the traditional business areas of production and distribution were expanded to include the three areas of license trading, home entertainment exploitation and increased TV service production (especially TV entertainment). Constantin Film AG also acquired 61 percent of the shares in KirchMedia Entertainment GmbH (now renamed Constantin Entertainment GmbH), one of the market leaders in German show and entertainment production.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
