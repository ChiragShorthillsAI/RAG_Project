Fear Street Part Three: 1666premiered at theLos Angeles State Historic Parkon July 14, 2021 and was released by Netflix on July 16, 2021. It received generally positive reviews from critics.
After reuniting the severed hand of Sarah Fier with the rest of her corpse, Deena has a vision showing the events of 1666 from the perspective of Sarah Fier. She lives with her father George and brother Henry in Union, the original settlement before it was divided into Sunnyvale and Shadyside.
One night, Sarah and her friends Hannah Miller and Lizzie meet a reclusive widow to gather potent berries for a party, where Sarah stumbles on abookofblack magic. The group joins Isaac and Abigail at the party where Sarah and Hannah are harassed by Caleb. The two run off and start kissing, unknowingly seen by Mad Thomas. The next day, Pastor Cyrus Miller begins to act strange, as the town's food and water supply are poisoned. Sarah confides in Solomon Goode and wonders if she is responsible for the town's bad luck. The town then discovers that Pastor Miller has murdered twelve children in the chapel, including Abigail's sister Constance, and Sarah’s brother Henry. Sarah is attacked by Pastor Miller before he is killed by Solomon. That night, a town meeting is held at which the townspeople decide thatwitchcraftis the cause of the events, and Caleb claims that Sarah and Hannah are the witches responsible. Hannah is captured while Sarah escapes and the town declares that Hannah will be executed at dawn.
Sarah sneaks into the chapel where Hannah is confined and the two profess their love. Sarah decides to retrieve the widow's book and use it to make a deal with the devil and save Hannah, but she discovers that the book is gone and the widow murdered. She flees to Solomon's house and hides after he is ambushed by men hunting her. While hiding, she finds tunnels under his house, discovering a ritual as well as the widow's book. Solomon reveals he took the book tomake a deal with the devil, offering Pastor Miller to be possessed in exchange for power and wealth. He offers to share it with her, but she rejects his offer and a fight ensues with Sarah's hand being cut off in the struggle. She escapes to the chapel only to be captured by Solomon and the townspeople. At her and Hannah's execution, Sarah convinces the town to spare Hannah's life by proclaiming she is the witch and swears vengeance to Solomon before she ishanged. Later, Lizzie, Isaac, Hannah, and Abigail grieve Sarah and properly bury her body.
In 1994, Deena realizes that the Goode family is responsible for the Shadyside curse, as the firstborn of each generation repeats the ritual begun by their ancestor Solomon. Because of this, Sunnyvale has always prospered while Shadyside has become worse. Deena and Josh are found by Sheriff Nick Goode, but the two escape in Nick's car and arrive at Ziggy's house. The trio deduces they must kill Nick to end the Shadyside curse. After they recruit the help of Martin, the mall janitor, the group concocts a plan to lure Nick to the mall and set traps to have the Shadyside murderers kill him.
The group manages to trap the killers and Ziggy pours a bucket of Deena's blood over Nick, causing the killers to attack him. As Nick escapes into the tunnels, Deena and a possessed Sam follow him while the others fight off the killers. Sam attacks Deena, but she breaks Sam out of her possession temporarily before incapacitating her. Nick nearly kills Deena but she exposes him to the pile of beating organs in the tunnel, which gives him the visions of all of the killers' victims, causing him to go into a state of shock as he panics whilst the visions surround him. As he turns to flee, Deena kills him by stabbing him in the eye with a broken screwdriver, causing the curse to cease and making the killers vanish.
Some time later, the Goode family are exposed for their actions while life improves for the residents of Shadyside. Josh meets his online friend in person; Ziggy reunites with Mrs. Lane; Simon, Heather and Kate are commemorated by the school, and Deena and Sam have a picnic date at Sarah Fier's grave, naming her the first Shadysider.
In amid-credits scene, an unknown person takes the widow's satanic book from the tunnels.

The first film of the trilogy was scheduled to be released theatrically in June 2020,[10]but was pulled from the schedule because of theCOVID-19 pandemic.[11]In April 2020, Chernin Entertainment ended their distribution deal with 20th Century Studios and made a multi-year first-look deal withNetflix.[12]By August 2020, Netflix had acquired the distribution rights to theFear Street Trilogywith a mid-2021 release date strategy for all three movies.[13][11]
Fear Street Part Three: 1666premiered at theLos Angeles State Historic Parkon July 14, 2021.[14]The first two films were released on July 2 and July 9, respectively, with the third film following on July 16, 2021.[1]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 99 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's critics consensus states, "Fear Street Part Three: 1666sends the slasher series back in time for a trilogy-concluding installment that caps things off on a screaming high note."[15]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 15 critic reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[16]
Natalia Winkelman, in her review of theFear Streettrilogy forThe New York Times, wrote, "Here, there is less to propel the action, and lacking in pop artifacts, lingo or fashion trends, Janiak struggles to recreate the fizzy and fun tone she achieved in the earlier movies," but added: "byPart Three, you feel safe following these survivors wherever they go."[17]Clarisse Loughrey ofThe Independentgave the film a score of 3 out of five stars, writing that "even thoughPart Threeis the weakest of the trilogy, director Leigh Janiak still manages to end on a high," and described it as "a thrilling finale that Janiak doses once more in old-school gore and deliciously garish neon."[18]Donald Clarke, in his review of theFear Streettrilogy forThe Irish Times, wrote that the film "owes more toThe Cruciblethan it does to any American shocker", and stated: "Though the decision to have the puritan settlers speak in largely terrible Irish accents defies all reason, the closing section ties up some ends in a satisfactory whirl of implausibly well-scrubbed colonial paranoia."[19]
Nick Allen ofRogerEbert.comgave the film a score of 3 stars out of 4, describing it as a "triumphant finale" and writing, "Executed with the confidence of a victory lap, the last hour of1666is a series highlight, especially as it captures the brand of out-and-out fun that has made Janiak a newly minted crowd-pleaser in horror."[20]Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiangave the film a score of 4 stars out of 5, describing it as "The CruciblemeetsThe WitchmeetsItmeetsIt Followsmeets the trilogy's ultimate overarching influenceScooby-Doo," and called it "a rousing finale to a winning new franchise." He concluded, "Janiak has found a way to add new life to old material, gifting us with the rare horror franchise that makes us want more rather than less, the prospect of an expanded universe seeming less like a curse and more of a blessing."[21]
Lovia Gyarkye ofThe Hollywood Reporterdescribed the film as "bloated" and stated that it "perfunctorily ties up the narrative loose ends with little finesse or energy — a shame because the earlier two entries, chock-full of pop culture references and subversive thematic underpinnings, had immense potential." She concluded, "by the end ofFear Street Part 3, when the mystery had been solved and justice ostensibly served, I was more relieved than anything else."[22]Barry Hertz ofThe Globe and Mailwrote, "InPart Three, [Leigh Janiak] falls prey to the same problem asPart Two: her well-funded take on the work of folk-horror icons likeKen Russell,Piers HaggardandMario Bava(with a big tip of the hat to contemporaries likeRobert Eggers) is too safe, too slick, too far from gonzo."[23]Inkoo Kang, in her review of theFear Streettrilogy forThe Washington Post, wrote: "the trilogy's final scenes, which bring the action back to 1994, feel more like an iteration ofHome Alone, with mindless stabbers taking the place ofJoe PesciandDaniel Stern. Those two might not have had any brains, either, but at least they had some personality."[24]
