TroubledLAPDofficer Joe Baylor works the night shift at a911 call centerwhile awaiting a court hearing for an incident that occurred on duty eight months prior. He answers a call from Emily Lighton, a woman that reveals she has been abducted. While traveling in a white van, Emily is forced to hang up before she can provide more details. Joe relays the information to theCalifornia Highway Patrol, who cannot locate the van without a license plate number.
Joe calls Emily's home phone and speaks with her six-year-old daughter Abby, who tells him that her mom left the house with her dad, Henry Fisher. After getting Henry's cell phone number from Abby, he is able to retrieve the van's plate number.
Joe also learns that Henry has a record of assault, so he calls Sergeant Miller to send a patrol unit to Emily's home to do a welfare check on Abby and her baby brother, Oliver. He also requests he send another to investigate Henry's apartment. Miller refuses to send anyone to Henry's without a warrant. Reminding Joe of his legal issues, Miller suggests he stop investigating. Afterwards, Joe calls Henry and demands to know where he is taking Emily. Henry hangs up after Joe starts asking questions in an accusatory tone. Joe then calls his former partner, Rick, who is off-duty. Joe asks him to go to Henry's house. Rick complies, but also expresses concern about Joe's upcoming hearing at which he is set to provide testimony.
Joe receives a panicked call from Abby when two officers arrive at her home; he instructs her to let them in. The officers notice blood on Abby and, upon searching the property, find Oliver in the bedroom either gravely injured or dead. Joe calls Henry and accuses him of killing his son. Henry hangs up again. On the line again with Emily, Joe tells her to try to crash the van. Emily makes an attempt, to no avail.
Meanwhile, Rick breaks into Henry's apartment and finds documents showing that Emily had recently been a patient in a psychiatric treatment facility inSan Bernardino. Back on the phone with Emily, she admits she thinks she will die and does not want to be locked up again. Emily goes on to say that she believed Oliver had "snakes in his stomach" and that she "took them out." Joe realizes that Emily was the one who hurt baby Oliver, and Henry is trying to have her readmitted to the psychiatric hospital. Outside of the van, Emily hits Henry with a brick and runs away.
On the phone with Joe, Henry explains that she had been off her medication for a number of weeks, as they could not afford them. Henry feels guilty about having left Emily, believing this triggered the psychotic episode during which she hurt Oliver. Henry does not trust the police and thecriminal justice systemdue to his own legal troubles and because of the many failed attempts by various government agencies to "help" his mentally ill wife. Emily does not know what she has done and Henry fears what she will do after she finds out.
Eventually, Emily calls Joe back from a freeway overpass, while preparing to commitsuicide. Joe directs the CHP to her location while attempting to talk her down; he tries to distract her by revealing that he killed a 19-year-old while on duty because he was angry with him for hurting someone. Joe tells Emily that Abby needs her and that he promised Abby she would come home. As officers arrive, Emily hangs up. After repeated attempts to call her back, Joe calls the CHP dispatcher who conveys that Emily is alive. He then learns that baby Oliver is alive and in the hospital, recovering from his injuries.
An overcome Joe calls Rick and asks him to tell the truth at the hearing, even if it means he will spend years in prison. Joe then announces to the media that he will plead guilty to a charge ofmanslaughter.

Antoine Fuqua(/ˈæntwɒnˈfjuːkwə/; born May 30, 1965)[1][2]is an American film director known for his work in the action and thriller genres. He was originally known as a director of music videos, and made his film debut in 1998 withThe Replacement Killers. His critical breakthrough was the 2001 crime thrillerTraining Day, winning theBlack Reel Award for Outstanding Director.
His subsequent films includeTears of the Sun(2003),King Arthur(2004),Shooter(2007),Olympus Has Fallen(2013),Southpaw(2015),The Magnificent Seven(2016) andThe Equalizertrilogy(2014–2023), earning with the first one theNAACP Image Award for Outstanding Directing in a Motion Picture.
He also directed the critically acclaimed documentariesAmerican Dream/American Knightmare(2018),What's My Name: Muhammad Ali(2019), and the 2022Huludocumentary seriesLegacy: The True Story of the LA Lakers, for which he won theSports Emmy Awards for Outstanding Documentary Series.[3]
Fuqua was born inPittsburghtoAfrican-Americanparents Carlos and Mary Fuqua. He graduated fromTaylor Allderdice High Schoolin 1983.[4]Before turning to filmmaking and music videos, Fuqua studied electrical engineering, with the hope of going on to fly jets in the military.[5]
Fuqua pays tribute to screenwriterShinobu Hashimoto, a frequent collaborator ofAkira Kurosawa's, saying his writing "affected a boy from Pittsburgh living in the ghetto."
[Shinobu Hashimoto's writing] was so beautiful and poetic and powerful and heartbreaking. It was all about justice, it was all about sacrifice, and it made me want to be one of those guys. I came from a rough area, and I had my own version of watching poor people getting pushed down – whoever the person was who had the power, they would come in and take from other people.[6]
Fuqua explained how his experience of violence shaped his adolescence, and played a role in his eventual choice of career.
My first big break was when I got shot when I was fifteen. It changed my life and it made me not hang out in the streets as much, and go to the movies more. Those sort of things are wake up calls to have a better appreciation for life, and a better appreciation for the people around you. From that moment in my life I put all my energy into what I believed in, and at that time it was playing basketball and sports. That led me to a scholarship ... after that a professor said that I should take an art class ... I fell in love with an artist by the name ofCaravaggio.[7]
Fuqua began his career directing music videos for popular artists such asToni Braxton,Stevie Wonder, andPrince. He directedMichelle Pfeifferin the videoGangsta's ParadisebyCooliowhich was used to promoteJerry Bruckheimer'ssuccessful filmDangerous Minds.
The movie became a big hit and Jerry Bruckheimer was kind enough to give me a lot of credit for it because they used my music video ... the irony was people thought I was the new French film director. No one had any idea I was this guy from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. So I used to walk in the room and people would literally ask me to get coffee. And I would say, "No, no, I'm the director", and I loved watching their faces. That was fun.[7]
From 1998 onwards, Fuqua began working primarily as a feature film director. In a tribute article forTimemagazine, Fuqua expressed his early respect for Kurosawa as a filmmaker and how Kurosawa influenced his own perspective on filmmaking stating: "[screen writer Hashimoto's] ... working withAkira KurosawaandHideo Oguni, was so beautiful and poetic and powerful and heartbreaking. It was all about justice, it was all about sacrifice, and it made me want to be one of those guys".[6]
His first feature films were theJohn Woo-produced action filmThe Replacement Killers(1998), starringChow Yun Fatand the action comedyBait(2000) starringJamie Foxx. He then directed the crime thrillerTraining Day(2001), for which starDenzel Washingtonwon anAcademy Award for Best Actor. His next films were the action war dramaTears of the Sun(2003), the Arthurian legend filmKing Arthur(2004), the conspiracy action thrillerShooter(2007), the crime filmBrooklyn's Finest(2009), and the action thrillersOlympus Has Fallen(2013) andThe Equalizer(2014), the latter of which again pairs Fuqua with Denzel Washington. In 2011, he directed CIA proceduralFoxpilotExit StrategystarringEthan Hawke.[8][9]
He co-created the comic-book miniseriesAfter DarkwithWesley Snipes, which was written byPeter Milliganand illustrated by Jeff Nentrup.[10]He was slated to directTupac Shakur's official biopic[11]but the project was postponed to allow Fuqua to direct rapperEminem's second feature film,Southpaw(2015).[12]Eminem later leftSouthpawto focus on his music,[13]and was replaced withJake Gyllenhaal.[14]
Fuqua's 2016 film,The Magnificent Seven,was a remake of the classic 1960 Westernof the same namewhich itself was an American remake of Kurosawa's 1954 film,Seven Samurai. Denzel Washington plays the lead role of Sam Chisolm.[15]
In early 2018, Fuqua worked as one of the executive producers on theFoxmedical drama seriesThe Resident. In the summer of 2018, his thriller sequelThe Equalizer 2(2018) was released with Denzel Washington returning in the main role.

Smith and Fuqua released a joint statement: "We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access".[16]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
