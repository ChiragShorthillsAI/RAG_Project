On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, 53% of 38 reviews were positive, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "AlthoughFinding Youmanages to fit every contrivance possible into its story, its charming fluff and sharp humor may be enough to win the hearts of romance fans."[9]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 41 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[10]Audiences surveyed byPostTrakgave the film a 71% positive score, with 46% saying they would definitely recommend it.[8]
Giving the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, Michael O'Sullivan positively reviewed the film for theWashington Post, writing that although it contained "no real surprises...Finding Youkinda, sorta [works]."[11]Plugged In (publication)reviewer Paul Asay opined that while the story is "fairly predictable", it illustrated well "that sex and romance aren't synonymous; that kindness matters; and that even in moments of disappointment, God may be operating behind the scenes."[12]Tara McNamara ofCommon Sense Mediacommented on the film's religious themes, writing that "the movie's faith-based elements has a mic-drop moment, but it happens without a single line of dialogue and isn't jarring or forced." McNamara gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, praising the well-assembled cast and the setting in the Irish countryside, noting that the film was more acoming-of-agestory than a romance.[13]
In a mixed review for theLos Angeles Times, Michael Ordoña praised many of the cast members but criticized the film's determination "to bePG-clean" and Finley's character, saying she lacked personality.[14]Giving the film a grade of "C", Adam Graham of theDetroit Newsopined that the film was heavily clichéd and lacked anything of substance "except for the exquisite greenery of Ireland."[15]Kate Erbland ofIndie Wiregave it a "C−" grade, deriding it for its predictability, but noting that it contained "brief moments of magic". Erbland says "flashes of sweetness and smartness are stuck in between increasingly odd twists and tropes, eager to play up the "Notting Hill" of it all without actually doing the work to make it stick."[16]}}

…There is a quality about Vanessa that makes me feel as if she resides in a netherworld of mystery that eludes the rest of us mortals. Her voice seems to come from some deep place that knows all suffering and all secrets. Watching her work is like seeing through layers of glass, each layer painted in mythic watercolour images, layer after layer, until it becomes dark, but even then you know you haven't come to the bottom of it ... The only other time I had experienced this with an actor was with Marlon Brando ... Like Vanessa, he always seemed to be in another reality, working off some secret, magnetic, inner rhythm.[9]
When Redgrave was nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actressin 1977 for her role inJulia, members of theJewish Defense League(JDL), led by RabbiMeir Kahane, burned effigies of Redgrave and picketed the Academy Awards ceremony to protest against what they saw as her support for thePalestine Liberation Organization.[10][11][12]

In his biography of Redgrave, Dan Callahan wrote, "The scandal of her awards speech and the negative press it occasioned had a destructive effect on her acting opportunities that would last for years to come".[16]

In light of Redgrave's support for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO),[48]Fénelon herself and the Jewish groups theSimon Wiesenthal Center, theAnti-Defamation League, and theAmerican Jewish Congressobjected to Redgrave's casting. RabbiMarvin Hierof the Simon Wiesenthal Center wrote in a telegram that, "Your selection shows utter callous disregard of the tens of thousands of survivors for whom Miss Redgrave's portrayal would desecrate the memory of the martyred millions. Your decision could only be compared to selecting J. Edgar Hoover to portray Martin Luther King Jr." ProducerDavid L. Wolperin a telephone interview compared it to letting the head of theKu Klux Klanplay a sympathetic white man inRoots, a miniseries about the slave trade.[49]Arthur Miller said "She's a Marxist; this is a political matter.

At a press conference, Redgrave said she feared for Zakayev's safety if he were extradited to Russia on terrorism charges. He would "die of a heart attack" or some other mysterious explanation offered by Russia, she said.[53]On 13 November 2003, a London court rejected the Russian government's request for Zakayev's extradition. Instead, the court accepted a plea by lawyers for Zakayev that he would not get a fair trial, and could even face torture, in Russia. "It would be unjust and oppressive to return Mr Zakayev to Russia," Judge Timothy Workman ruled.[54]Due to her support of Zakayev and Chechen independence, she was awarded the Order of Friendship by theChechen government in exilein 2024.[55]

Redgrave has been an outspoken critic of the "war on terrorism".[57][58]During a June 2005 interview onLarry King Live, Redgrave was challenged on this criticism and on her political views. In response she questioned whether there can be true democracy if the political leadership of the United States and Britain does not "uphold the values for which my father's generation fought the Nazis, [and] millions of people gave their lives against theSoviet Union's regime. [Such sacrifice was made] because of democracy and what democracy meant: no torture, no camps, no detention forever or without trial.... [Such] techniques are not just alleged [against the governments of the U.S. and Britain], they have actually been written about by theFBI. I don't think it's being 'far left'...to uphold the rule of law."[59]
In March 2006, Redgrave remarked in an interview with US broadcast journalistAmy Goodman: "I don't know of a single government that actually abides by international human rights law, not one, including my own. In fact, [they] violate these laws in the most despicable and obscene way, I would say." Goodman's interview with Redgrave took place in the actress's West London home on the evening of 7 March, and covered a range of subjects, particularly the cancellation by theNew York Theatre Workshopof theAlan RickmanproductionMy Name is Rachel Corrie. Such a development, said Redgrave, was an "act of catastrophic cowardice" as "the essence of life and the essence of theatre is to communicate about lives, either lives that have ended or lives that are still alive, [and about] beliefs, and what is in those beliefs."[60]

Redgrave has declined to be specific about her financial involvement but said she was "very happy" to be of "some small assistance for Jamil and his wife", adding, "It is a profound honour and I am glad to be alive to be able to do this. Guantanamo Bay is a concentration camp."[62]

In March 2014, Redgrave took part in a protest outsidePentonville Prisonin North London after new prison regulations were introduced which forbade sending books to prisoners.[65]She and fellow actorSamuel West, playwrightDavid HareandPoet LaureateCarol Ann Duffytook turns reading poetry and making speeches. Redgrave stated that the ban was "vicious and deplorable...Literature is something that stirs us beyond our immediate problems, it can help us to learn better our own problems, our own faults or to have a goal to live for, an aspiration."[66]The ban was overturned by theMinistry of Justicethe following December.[67]
In 2017, Redgrave made her directorial debut with the movieSea Sorrow, a documentary about theEuropean migrant crisisand the plight of migrants encamped outsideCalais, France, trying to reach Britain.[19]She has heavily criticised the exclusionary policy of the British government towards refugees, stating that the British Government "... has violated these principles (of theDeclaration of Human Rights), and it continues to do so, which I find deeply shameful. The UN signed the Declaration of Human Rights, and now we have to employ lawyers to take the government to court to force them to obey the law. Just thinking about that makes my mind go berserk."[19]
