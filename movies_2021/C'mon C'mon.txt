Johnny is a single, middle-aged radio journalist who is currently working on a project that entails traveling the country with his producing partners to interview children and teenagers about their lives and thoughts about the future. While inDetroit, he calls his sister Viv, with whom he has not spoken since their mother's death from dementia a year earlier. They have a nice conversation, and Viv asks Johnny if he can come toLos Angelesand watch her nine-year-old son Jesse, as she has to travel toOaklandto help Paul, her estranged husband and Jesse's father who struggles withbipolar disorder, get settled there. Johnny agrees, and he and Jesse quickly forge a bond as they get to know each other and Johnny shows Jesse how to operate his audio equipment.
Viv discovers Paul is doing worse than she had thought and feels she should stay in Oakland until she can convince him to seek medical attention, so Johnny, who needs to return to work, convinces Viv to let him take Jesse with him to his home inNew York City. He finds caring for Jesse while trying to work increasingly difficult, and one night, after Jesse disappears at a store, Johnny snaps at his nephew. While trying to apologize, he lets slip that Viv is try to help Paul, rather than just for a visit, but, eventually, Viv and Johnny are able to smooth things over with Jesse. From time to time, Jesse asks Johnny questions about his relationship with Viv and his personal life, and it is revealed that Johnny and Viv fought over how to care for their mother as her health deteriorated, that Johnny told Viv to leave Paul the first time Paul had issues with his mental health, and that Johnny was once in a long-term relationship with a woman, Louisa, whom he still loves.
Paul checks himself into a treatment center, but asks Viv if she will stay nearby until he is better, so Johnny, feeling confident, agrees to keep watching Jesse. When his producing partners begin to pressure him about an opportunity to interview some children inNew Orleansand he loses Jesse on the street, however, he realizes he is in over his head and buys Jesse a plane ticket back to L.A. On the way to the airport, Jesse says he needs to use the bathroom, but then locks himself inside, saying he does not want to go home yet.
Johnny takes Jesse with him to New Orleans. He apologizes for wanting to send Jesse away, and the pair get back on good terms as Johnny works and they explore the city. When Viv calls with the news that Paul is doing much better and the doctors are sending him home, so she is coming to get Jesse, Jesse becomes upset and runs off. At first, he will only say that he is "fine", but Johnny helps him vent his frustrations by yelling and kicking the air. Jesse asks Johnny if he will be like his father when he grows up, and Johnny says he does not think so, as Viv has taught him how to deal with his emotions in a healthier way.
Viv flies to New Orleans and takes Jesse home. Back in New York, while listening to the recordings from New Orleans, Johnny hears a message from Jesse, in which he says that Johnny is probably his best friend. Johnny later sends Jesse a voice recording recounting their time together and reiterates a promise to remind Jesse about anything he forgets as he grows up.

During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, A24 was approved to continue filming and promotional activities since they do not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP).[57]
In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

The film is both a romantic comedy and a film about a son reflecting on his memories of his father. Amy Taubin ofFilm Commentpraised Mills, calling it a breakthrough, writing, "Mike Mills treats love and loss with a disarming tenderness and a refusal of sentimentality that make Beginners, his second feature, something of an anomaly among male identity flicks."[11]Plummer went on to win theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actorfor his performance.[12][13]

Instantaneous joy. The most enjoyable thing. For some kids, it's the first time they crack a ball or score a goal. For me, it was this. I was eight years old, and I remember the first scene on the TV set so vividly. And I knew that I loved it – the physical sensation; how powerful it was. That's the feeling I've been chasing ever since.[17]

The film premiered at the1995 Cannes Film Festivaland became a financial and critical success, withNew York TimescriticJanet Maslinpraising Phoenix's performance, writing "So pity poor Jimmy. Rivetingly played by Mr Phoenix with a raw, anguished expressiveness that makes him an actor to watch for, Jimmy is both tempted and terrified by Suzanne's slick amorality. In that, he speaks for us all."[30][31]
In 1997, Phoenix played a small-town troublemaker inOliver Stone'sU Turn, and a poor man in love with a rich woman inInventing the Abbotts.

Winslet and Phoenix generate real fire, notably when Abbe dreams of ravishing Madeleine on the altar."[43]For his combined roles of that year, Phoenix was awarded theBroadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actorand theNational Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor.[44]
The following year, Phoenix starred in the satirical filmBuffalo Soldiersas aU.S. Armysoldier. The world premiere was held at the 2001Toronto International Film Festivalin early September.

The closing credits make it clear it's Joaquin Phoenix doing the singing, and I was gob-smacked".[69]For his portrayal of Johnny Cash, he won theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedyand theGrammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Mediafor the film's soundtrack.[70]Phoenix also received a second Academy Award nomination, his first in theBest Actorcategory as well as a second BAFTA nomination.[71]Earlier that year, he narratedEarthlings(2005), a documentary about the investigation of animal abuse infactory farms, and pet mills, and for scientific research.

There is no artifice. He's not an actor disappearing into a role but a man disappearing into himself [...] Phoenix homes in on the truth of this person. It's the paradox of the greatest acting".[76]
Later that year, he played a father obsessed with finding out who killed his son in ahit-and-run accidentin his second feature with Terry George, the crime drama filmReservation Road. The film received mixed reviews from critics;[77]Peter Travers praised Phoenix's acting stating "Even the best actors—and I'd rank Joaquin Phoenix andMark Ruffaloamong their generation's finest—can't save a movie that aims for tragedy but stalls at soap opera."[78]Phoenix also executive produced the television show4Real, a half-hour program which began airing in 2007. The series showcased celebrity guests on global adventures "in order to connect with young leaders who are creating social and economic change".[79]

By claiming to retire from acting, he and Affleck planned to make a film that "explored celebrity, and explored the relationship between the media and the consumers and the celebrities themselves" through their film.[86][87]
In 2011, it was announced that Phoenix would star inPaul Thomas Anderson's drama filmThe Master, which traces the relationship between Freddie Quell (Phoenix), aWorld War IInavy veteran struggling to adjust to a post-war society and Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a leader of a religious movement known as "The Cause".

His next feature film of that year was theSpike Jonze-directed romantic science-fiction dramaHer. He played Theodore Twombly, a man who develops a relationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), an intelligent computer operating system personified through a female voice.

The thrillerYou Were Never Really Here, written and directed byLynne Ramsayand based on the novella of the same name byJonathan Ames, ranks among the most acclaimed films of Phoenix's career.[108]The film is about Joe (played by Phoenix), a traumatized formerFBI agentandGulf Warveteran who tracks down missing girls for a living.

It's a career best for him—lovely, empathetic, humane[...]He possesses a warmth that glows from beginning to end.

Phoenix will next reunite with Lynne Ramsay inPolaris, co-starring Rooney Mara, and with Ari Aster in the contemporary Western filmEddington.[143][144]He was originally set to star alongsideDanny Ramirezin a film byTodd Haynes, a sexually explicit "love story between two men" set in 1930s Los Angeles.[145]Phoenix had co-written it with Haynes, advising him to "go further" with the explicit material, which Haynes said would have likely made it anNC-17rated film.[146]The project was cancelled when Phoenix abruptly exited five days before filming began.[147][148]
"When I was 15 or 16 my brother River [Phoenix] came home from work and he had a VHS copy of a movie calledRaging Bulland he sat me down and made me watch it. And the next day he woke me up, and he made me watch it again. And he said, "You're going to start acting again, this is what you're going to do." He didn't ask me, he just told me. And I am indebted to him for that because acting has given me such an incredible life".
At the beginning of his career, Phoenix was often referred to as "the second most famous Phoenix", his name associated most closely with the death of his brotherRiver Phoenix.[8]The media would often compare the two, withThe New York Timesdescribing Joaquin as "sweetly unsettling and endlessly vulnerable" compared to his brother's "pure all-American blond boyishness".[150]After his brother died, Phoenix gained a reputation for his distrust of the media, with many speculating that it is derived from how River's death was covered by the press. He was often asked about the day River died, and still is to this date. Phoenix has described these interviews as "insincere" and has felt that they impeded on the mourning process.[8][151]
Caroline Frost ofThe Huffington Posthas said that Phoenix is "engaging, engaged, mischievous, honest" in person andAnderson Cooperof60 Minutesthought that he was "wry, shy and couldn't be any more friendlier" adding that Phoenix "just doesn't like to talk about himself".[152]Although known for his intensity and darkness on-screen, directorJames Graywho worked with Phoenix in four feature films, says that Phoenix is very different off-screen saying "He's actually very tender and sweet and sensitive. It's almost as if he channels his intensity into the characters. Like the work is an outlet for his darker side."[110][153]
Phoenix has been described as one of the finest actors of his generation.[150][154][155][156]As he achieved stardom afterGladiator(2000), he was conveniently ruled out ofteen-idolroles because of his hard gaze and scarred lip.[154]Justin Chang, analyzing his career inLos Angeles Timesin 2020, remarked that filmmakers immediately seemed to recognize that Phoenix was more than a heartthrob, and that there was "something more tortured, more vulnerable and infinitely more interesting at play beneath the surface". He noted that through his work, Phoenix is challenging and redefining cinematic manhood and that this quality sets him apart from most of his contemporaries.[155]Film criticandfilm historianLeonard Maltinhas called Phoenix "a true chameleon", writing 
"[Phoenix] commands the screen and breaks your heart; he makes us feel it all vicariously."[157]
Phoenix is particularly known for his ability to heavily commit to each role he plays and his intense preparations, deeply immersing himself in the characters, often blurring the lines between fiction and reality.[158][8]That immersion was particularly evident during the filming of themockumentaryI'm Still Here(2010), when Phoenix announced to the world that he was retiring from acting to become a rapper. Throughout the filming period, Phoenix remained in character for public appearances, giving many the impression that he was genuinely pursuing a new career. Media outlets worldwide believed that Phoenix was having amental breakdownafter his infamous appearance onThe Late Show with David Letterman.[159]Confusion from the media turned to concern as the seemingly drug-addled Phoenix continued his attempts to convince crowds he was serious about a rap career. Many worried his erratic behavior was a sign he was stuck in a downward spiral, and headed down the same self-destructive path that took the life of his older brother. Although widely suspected to be a mockumentary, the fact that the events of the film had been deliberately staged was not disclosed until after the film had been released.[85]To this day, some people believe he went through a personal meltdown during the filming period.[8][160]Phoenix has credited the making ofI'm Still Herefor allowing him to make bolder choices in acting.[150]
Phoenix contends there's no real methodology to the roles he chooses, but has said that he is drawn to complex characters.[161]He speculates that his affinity for dark roles derives from something more ineffable, possiblyprenatalsaying that "I think there is a combination of nature and nurture[...]—and some of it is my upbringing." Even so, Phoenix remains reluctant to draw a line between his unusual childhood, his private tragedy and his talent for "inhabiting the morose, damaged, violent, and otherwise anxiety-riddled characters".[8]James Gray has described Phoenix as "one of the most incorruptible people I've ever known, and the least superficial", and has spoken of his acting, saying that he admires Phoenix's "limitless ability to surprise you in the best ways and inspire you to move in a direction that you haven't thought of originally, better than what you have in mind".[132][110]
Garth Davis, who directed Phoenix inMary Magdalene(2018), has remarked that he does not applymethod acting, but said that working with Phoenix is like "working with this beautiful wild animal, where you have to give him the space to be free, so his performance can roam freely: raw, uncontrived and truly natural. If he smells the design of the scene, you lose his free spirit; if the script is weak, he will expose its flaws. He is fiercely intelligent and almost completely instinctual. And he has this immense sensitivity that can be both his curse and his gift, but for me, that is what it means to be human".[110]In an interview withThe Guardianin 2015, Phoenix said that he prefersindependent filmovermajor studio film, citing that "the quality of acting suffers".[162]
In 2019, Phoenix stated that in choosing films, he solely relies on the director, "I don't really care about genre or budget size, anything like that. It's just whether there is a filmmaker that has a unique vision, has a voice, and the ability to make the film."[163]For Phoenix, a great performance is in the director's hands — it's ultimately the director's world he's entering. He maintains that the director creates the character's arc and that the best directors adjust to what is happening with the actor in the moment.[150]
Phoenix has citedRobert De Niroas one of his favorite actors and strongest acting influences. Phoenix recalled watchingRaging Bullfor the first time in an interview, "I think it just… awakened something in me. And I could suddenly see it through his eyes. There's a part inRaging Bullwhere De Niro meets a girl in between a chain-link fence. And he, you know, shakes her pinky and it's like this just beautiful little detail, it's this wonderful moment. And I think that in some ways is what I'm always looking for."[164]
Phoenix has directed music videos forRingside,[165]She Wants Revenge,[166]People in Planes,[167]Arckid,[168]Albert Hammond Jr.,[169]andSilversun Pickups.[170]He was said to have produced the opening track forPusha T'sMy Name Is My Namealbum alongsideKanye West. The track is called "King Push". Phoenix then denied in a statement toXXLhaving produced the record, saying, "While it was widely reported that Pusha T used my beat and that I produced his song, I can't take any credit. A friend's son played me his music, and all I did was make an introduction to Kanye [West]'s camp."[171]
Phoenix is identified as one of the most active celebrities in theanimal rights movement.[172]A vegan since age three, he does not wear any clothes made out of animal skin; he requests that all of his leather costumes in films are made from synthetic materials.[173]Phoenix has said that animal rights are one of the most important pillars in his life, and maintains that "climate change is imminent if we do not adopt a plant-based lifestyle".[174]He has helped raise awareness of the correlation between animal rights, climate change and health issues.[175]
Phoenix has received praise and accolades from animal rights groups, withPETAnaming him "Person of the Year" in 2019. PETA's president,Ingrid Newkirksaid in a statement: "Joaquin Phoenix never misses an opportunity to turn the spotlight away from himself and onto animals' plight and to set a great example of walking the vegan walk".[176]He has been an active supporter of numerous animal rights organizations, including PETA.[177]
"We go into the natural world, and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. Then we take her milk that's intended for her calf, and we put it in our coffee and our cereal. And I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something, to give something up, but human beings, at our best, are so inventive and creative and ingenious. And I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles, we can create, develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment."
Throughout the years, Phoenix has headlined numerous campaigns for different organizations to help promote veganism and end animal slaughter.[179]In 2019, Phoenix and his partnerRooney Maraled the National Animal Rights Day demonstration to help spread awareness for animal rights.[180]On January 10, 2020, Phoenix was arrested with actressJane Fondaat a climate change protest outside theUnited States Capitolin Washington, D.C. At the protest, Phoenix spoke about the link betweenanimal agriculture and climate change.[181]
Phoenix has also been vocal in drawing attention to the suffering of fish, which he sees as a neglected cause in the sphere of animal rights. Fish, says Phoenix, are the "last thing besides insects that people don’t really consider".[182]Phoenix's views were shaped by a childhood incident in which he saw fish brutally flung against the side of the boat.[183][184]In 2013, he simulated drowning in a 41-secondPETAspot, designed to dramatise how fish suffer in the final moments of their lives. The video was shot by photographer Michael Muller.[185]
During the 2019–20awards season, amid protesting for animal rights, Phoenix had been driving a behind-the-scenes movement that transformed five events to meat-free menus, beginning with theGolden Globe Awards. He acknowledged theHollywood Foreign Press Associationduring his acceptance speech, for its "very bold move making tonight plant-based. It really sends a powerful message." Soon after,Critics' ChoiceandSAGfollowed suit. Phoenix contacted the presidents of the award ceremonies, accompanied by signatures from the likes of fellow nomineesLeonardo DiCaprioandPhoebe Waller-Bridge. Phoenix's pitch was that meat agriculture is a leading cause of climate change and that the televised spectacles should use their platforms to address pressing societal issues. TheAcademy Awardslater announced that all food served at theDolby Theatrebefore the Oscars was going to be vegan. Lisa Lange, Senior Vice President of Communications at PETA, spoke of Phoenix's power saying "He knows what can be done. He knows he's in a good position to push. He enlists friends. And it works. He can have influence in Hollywood and it influences the rest of the world."[186]
A day after winning theAcademy Award for Best Actor, and subsequently delivering a headlining acceptance speech in which he spoke to the plight of mother cows and their babies used in animal agriculture, Phoenix helped to rescue a cow and her newborn calf from a Los Angeles slaughterhouse. They were taken toFarm Sanctuary, an animal sanctuary and advocacy organization, where they will live out the rest of their lives.[187]The same month, he starred inGuardians of Life, the first of twelve short films by the environmental organizationMobilize Earththat highlighted the most pressing issues facing humanity and the natural world. Funds raised by the project went toAmazon WatchandExtinction Rebellion.[188]Dávid Szőke and Sándor Kiss inFilm Internationalwere highly critical of this move, arguing that "what is rather mind-boggling is that the discourse centers less on the issue of the calf and its mother or the exploitation of our natural world, and more on Phoenix in the leading role as the savior of our planet, raising questions about the narrative’s alignment with his environmental activism."[189]
Two animal species have been named after him. In 2011, atrilobitespecies was namedGladiatoria phoenixfor his iconic role in the 2000 filmGladiator, and in 2020, a spider species endemic to Iran was namedLoureedia phoenixi(also known as the Joker spider) due to its color pattern matching the DC Comics characterJoker, for his role in the 2019 filmJoker.[190][191][192]
In 2020, Phoenix collaborated withJusticeLAto create a public service announcement #SuingToSaveLives about the health of people in L.A. County jails amid theCOVID-19 pandemic.[193][194]
In October 2023, Phoenix signed an open letter by artists to PresidentJoe Bidencalling for a ceasefire during theIsraeli bombardment of Gaza.[195]The letter reads: "We believe all life is sacred, no matter faith or ethnicity and we condemn the killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians."[196]
After reestablishing himself as an actor in the mid-1990s, Phoenix moved back toLos Angeles.[150]He is known for his disdain ofcelebrity culture, rarely granting interviews, and being reticent about discussing his private life.[110][151]In 2018, he described himself as asecular Jewwho did not affiliate with any organized religion; one of his "core values" is the idea of forgiveness.[197]He has also claimed that his mother believes in Jesus, though his parents were not religious. While portraying Jesus in the 2018 movieMary Magdalene, he expressed that the role changed his perspective on the nature of forgiveness.[198]
In early April 2005, Phoenix checked himself into rehab to be treated for alcoholism.[199]Twelve years later, he revealed that he did not need anintervention: "I really just thought of myself as ahedonist. I was an actor in L.A. I wanted to have a good time. But I wasn't engaging with the world or myself in the way I wanted to". On January 26, 2006, while driving down a winding canyon road in Hollywood, Phoenix veered off the road and flipped his car.[200]The crash was reportedly caused by brake failure. Shaken and confused, he heard someone tapping on his window and telling him to "just relax". Unable to see the man, Phoenix replied, "I'm fine. I am relaxed." The man replied, "No, you're not." The man then stopped Phoenix from lighting a cigarette while gasoline was leaking into the car cabin. Phoenix realized that the man was German filmmakerWerner Herzog. While Herzog helped Phoenix out of the wreckage by breaking the back window of the car, bystanders called an ambulance. Phoenix later approached Herzog to express his gratitude.[201][202]
In 2012, Phoenix labeled theAcademy Awards"bullshit". He later gave an interview apologizing for his comments, and acknowledged that the awards provided an important platform for many deserving filmmakers.[203]He elaborated on the topic while onJimmy Kimmel Live!in 2015, explaining that he was uncomfortable receiving accolades for his work, considering the filmmaking process a collaborative one.[204]
A longtime vegan, Phoenix findsanimal agriculture"absurd and barbaric". He explained his reasoning behind hisveganism: "To me, it just seems obvious—I don't want to cause pain to another living empathetic creature. I don't want to take its babies away from it, I don't want to force it to be indoors and fattened up just to be slaughtered. Certainly, also, the effect that it has on our environment is devastating. So, for me, it's my life and has always been my life, and it's really one of the most important things to me."[205]
Phoenix is on the board of directors forThe Lunchbox Fund, a non-profit organization which provides daily meals to students of township schools inSoweto, South Africa, founded by Page-Green.[206]
From 1995 to 1998, Phoenix dated hisInventing the Abbottsco-starLiv Tyler. The two remain close friends, with Tyler considering Phoenix and his sisters as her family.[207]He was romantically involved with South African modelTopaz Page-Greenfrom 2001 to 2005.[208]From 2013 to 2015 he was in a relationship with artistAllie Teilz.[209]
In 2012, Phoenix metHerco-starRooney Mara. The two remained friends and began a romantic relationship four years later, during the making ofMary Magdalene.[8][210]They were engaged to be married in 2019, but the ceremony never took place.[211]In August 2020, the couple had a son.[212]In June 2024, they welcomed their second child.[213]They reside in theHollywood Hills. Phoenix has described his family life as simple. He enjoys meditating, watching documentaries, reading scripts, and taking karate classes. He has ablack beltin karate.[150][214]In September 2024, Joaquin Phoenix formalized his marriage with Rooney during Talk Easy podcast.[215]

Gabrielle Mary Antonia Hoffmann[1][2](born January 8, 1982)[3]is an American actress. She made her film debut inField of Dreams(1989) and found success as achild actressinUncle Buck(1989),This Is My Life(1992),Sleepless in Seattle(1993), and then later as a teenager withNow and Then(1995),Everyone Says I Love You(1996),Volcano(1997),All I Wanna Do(1998), and200 Cigarettes(1999).
After a hiatus from the industry, Hoffmann returned in 2007, appearing in various independent projects that garnered critical acclaim. This has been described as a career "resurgence",[4]due to her roles inCrystal Fairy & the Magical Cactus(2013),Obvious Child(2014),Wild(2015), andC'mon C'mon(2021). On television, she played April in theFXseriesLouie(2012), Caroline Sackler in theHBOseriesGirls(2014–2017), and Ali Pfefferman in theAmazon PrimeseriesTransparent(2014–2019), earning threePrimetime Emmy Awardnominations for the latter two.[5]
Hoffmann was born inNew York City[6]to actor parents. Her mother,Viva, is a retired actress, writer and formerWarhol superstar.[7]Her father,Anthony Herrera,[8]was asoap operaactor best known for his role asJames StenbeckinAs the World Turns.[9]Herrera was raised inWiggins,Mississippiby his maternal grandparents; his own father, Gaby's paternal grandfather, was ofFrenchandSpanishdescent.[2]Herrera died in 2011 from cancer.[9]Viva and Herrera were estranged shortly after Hoffmann's birth; she was raised by her mother at theChelsea Hotelin New York. Her father did not have a significant presence in her life.[10][11]Hoffmann's birth is documented in Pat Hackett'sThe Andy Warhol Diaries. An entry dated January 10, 1982, two days after Hoffmann was born, says a friend telephoned Warhol and told him they were going to the Chelsea Hotel to see Viva and her new baby.[citation needed]
Hoffmann attended elementary school in Manhattan at P.S. 3 on Hudson Street in theWest Village, then another school inHell's Kitchen. After she moved to Los Angeles in 1994, she attended theBuckley School, before finally graduating fromCalabasas High Schoolin 1999.[12]
Until July 1993, Hoffmann lived in Manhattan's Chelsea Hotel, which Hoffmann later said she enjoyed. According to Hoffmann, she and her best friend Talya Shomron roller-skated in the hallways, spied on the drug dealer across the hall, and persuaded thebellmanto go to the neighborhooddelicatessenat night to fetch them ice cream.
Hoffmann recalled, "I grew up in downtown New York in the '80s. I have a friend who grew up with me, and she puts it well. She says, 'If you grew up where we grew up, if you weren't an artist, adrag queen,queer, or a drug addict, then you were the freak.' I grew up in a world where I guess what is considered unusual or abnormal for the rest of America was very much considered the norm."[13]She also reported in an interview that there had been gunfire and a rape at the hotel shortly before they moved out.[11]
Hoffmann and her mother left the Chelsea Hotel after a long-standing dispute with the management that ended in eviction.[11]Regardless, Hoffmann's connection to the hotel had a significant effect on her future. The idea for the 1994 sitcomSomeone Like Meoriginated afterGail Berman(former president ofViacom'sParamount Pictures) read aNew York Timesarticle[1]about the hotel which referred to a children's book that Viva and friend Jane Lancellotti wrote,Gaby at the Chelsea(a take onKay Thompson's 1950s classicEloisebooks). Berman became theshow's producer.
After leaving the Chelsea when Hoffmann was 12,[12]she and her mother moved to the west coast to a two-bedroom rented house inWoodland Hills,Los Angeles,California, which was badly damaged in the January 17,1994 Northridge earthquake. While regrouping their living situation, Hoffmann and her mother temporarily lived at The Oceana Suites Hotel inSanta Monica, California.[citation needed]
After she graduated fromCalabasas High Schoolin 1999, Hoffmann followed her half-sister Alex's example and entered New York'sBard Collegeto pursue a degree in literature and writing. Around 2001, she temporarily left her acting career to complete her studies and graduated in 2004; her senior thesis was adocumentary film.[citation needed]
After college, she spent much of her 20s drifting. She interned with a chef in Italy, then trained to be adoulaafter helping deliver Alex's children. For a time, Hoffmann and a boyfriend lived in an old trailer in theCatskill Mountains.[1]

In 1989, she starred in her first movie,Field of Dreams,withKevin Costner, playing his character's daughter, Karin.[15]1989'sUncle Buckfollowed, working besideJohn Candyand child starMacaulay Culkin.[16]AfterUncle Buck, Hoffmann grew tired of the rigors of screen performance and temporarily retired. Upon hearing of co-star Culkin's income from his following feature films,[11]she reentered the profession.[17]She starred inThis Is My Life(1992),Sleepless in Seattle(1993) withTom Hanks, andThe Man Without a FacewithMel Gibson.[18]According to Hoffmann, the reception fromThis is My Lifegave her confidence and solidified her desire to return to acting full-time.[18]
In 1994, Hoffmann starred in her own sitcomSomeone Like Me(onNBC) about a young girl, Gaby, and her dysfunctional family. Although generally well received, the series lasted only six episodes.[19]AfterSomeone Like Me, Hoffmann led alongsideShelley Longin the 1995 TV filmFreaky Friday, a remake of the1976 film of the same namestarringJodie FosterandBarbara Harris.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
