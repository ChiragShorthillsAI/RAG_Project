Cherryis a 2021 Americancrime drama filmdirected byAnthony and Joe Russofrom a screenplay by Angela Russo-Otstot andJessica Goldberg, based on the 2018 novelof the same namebyNico Walker. It starsTom Hollandas the titular character, alongsideCiara Bravo,Jack Reynor, andJeff Wahlberg. The film follows the life of Cherry, from a college student to aPTSD-afflicted veteran who robs banks to pay for his and his wife's drug addiction.[2]
Cherrywas released inselect theaterson February 26, 2021, and received a streaming release on March 12, byApple TV+. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Holland's and Bravo's performances, but criticized its writing and direction.
College student Cherry falls in love at first sight with his classmate Emily. Their relationship blossoms but Emily decides to leave him and study inMontreal. Cherry is devastated and enlists in the Army as a medic to escape his heartbreak. Just before he is about to leave for basic training, Emily realizes her mistake and confesses she is in love with Cherry too and that they are meant for one another. Cherry and Emily marry before his deployment.
During his two year service in the Army, Cherry suffers fromPTSDafter having several horrific experiences, including seeing his friend, Jimenez, burnt and killed from an IED. To cope with his panic attacks and severe anxiety when he comes home, he abuses OxyContin, prescribed from a doctor helping to decrease his PTSD symptoms. His growing addiction begins to frustrate  Emily and as a result, she begins taking Cherry's medication to deal with her own frustration of not knowing how to support him without drugs and the two soon become addicted to OxyContin, and eventually heroin.
After they break into a safe that he was looking after for his drug dealer, Pills and Coke, he and Emily use most of the drugs secured inside for themselves. Sometime later, Pills and Coke visits and sees the empty safe. Cherry learns that his drug dealer's boss, Black, is the owner of the safe and will kill all three of them for this. To get the money for the drugs they used, Cherry robs a bank and pays back the money. As a result of their daily heroin use, Cherry continues to rob banks frequently after he and Emily go through severe withdrawals. Emily overdoses and almost dies in a hospital. Cherry is blamed and forced by Emily's mother to leave her alone.
Emily leaves her drug rehabilitation facility and reunites with Cherry. He tries to send her back and persuade her that he is no good for her. Emily does not care and tells Cherry she wants to be with him; she will get high on drugs again no matter what. Needing more money to support their addiction, he enlists Pills and Coke and his friend, James Lightfoot, to help him rob multiple tellers at once. During a robbery, the drug dealer runs away, forcing Cherry to rob the bank alone. As he drives away with Lightfoot in a getaway car, Cherry stresses that Pills and Coke will likely rat him out if he gets caught and convinces Lightfoot to turn the car around and search for him. After putting Pills and Coke in the car, he sees that he has been shot and is severely bleeding. They debate whether to take him to the hospital, but decide it is too risky, and he dies from his gunshot wound. They dump the body on the side of the road and part ways.
Black later confronts Cherry outside his home to settle the drug debt. Cherry kisses and says goodbye to Emily before performing one last robbery. During the robbery, Cherry persuades the bank teller to set off the alarm before he leaves with the money. Cherry gives Black all of the money. Cherry then walks out to the open road and gets the attention of the police by firing his gun in the air, proceeding to sit by the side of the road and get high one last time, before police arrive and arrest him.
Cherry detoxes and recovers in prison, spending 14 years serving his sentence before being released on parole. As Cherry makes his way out of the prison, he sees Emily waiting for him.
Anthony and Joe Russo's production companyAGBOpurchased the production rights to the novel in August 2018, beating out offers fromWarner Bros. Entertainmentwhich would've hadJames Francodirecting, andSony Pictures Entertainment,[6][7]with the Russos set to direct the film.[8]In March 2019,Tom Holland, who previously collaborated with the Russos onMarvel Studios'Captain America: Civil War(2016),Avengers: Infinity War(2018), andAvengers: Endgame(2019) entered talks to star in the film.[9][10]Ciara Bravo,Jack Reynor, Jeff Wahlberg,Kyle Harvey,Forrest GoodluckandMichael Gandolfiniwere added to the cast in October.[11]Pooch Hallwould be cast in an undisclosed role in December.[12]
Filming was initially reported to begin on July 15, 2019.[13]The filmmakers had plans to shoot the film in Ohio, the setting of the novel and homestate of the Russo brothers, but due to theGreater Cleveland Film Commission's proposed changes in tax incentives were forced to move the planned shooting to California. However, the proposed figures were lowered from $100 million to $40 million, and production returned to the state.[1]Because of this, filming did not begin until October 8, 2019 and concluded in February 2020. Filming occurred mostly inCleveland, Ohio. The lead actor,Tom Holland, was spotted in Cleveland'sGordon Squareneighborhood in November 2019. On Detroit Avenue, some scenes were filmed inside the Subway, after which Holland was seen hurrying outside for some exterior shots. In the morning, the crew had shot several scenes inside the Pioneer Savings Bank, where they probably filmed one of the robberies. Some important shots were also taken atCase Western Reserve University, the top-ranked private research university in Cleveland.
Although Cleveland is an important shooting location, the filming was not limited to it. InLorain, filming was done at Broadway Avenue and on East 20th Street (just east of Broadway). InMarion, prison scenes were filmed at the North Central Correctional Complex in Marion County, a high-security prison for men. The crew also filmed a few scenes in Bedford, atSt. Peter Chanel High School, before it was demolished. The Russo brothers even tweeted about it being the high school where their father obtained his education. InParma, Ohio, scenes were filmed along Ridge Rd. in the old First Merit Bank location and across the street at Mack's Beverage.[14][15]According to the Russo brothers, editing forCherrytook place as it was filmed to allow them to see what they were missing, and if they needed to "rewrite or reshoot" parts of the film.[16]
The musical score forCherrywas composed byHenry Jackmanwho had also previously collaborated withthe Russo brotherson the four films in theMarvel Cinematic Universe. The soundtrack forCherrywas recorded atAIR StudiosinLondon, Englandand was released on February 26, 2021 byLakeshore RecordsandApple Music.[17]
All music is composed byHenry Jackman
Apple Original FilmsandApple TV+acquired distribution rights to the film in September 2020 for around $40 million.[18]The film was theatrically released on February 26, 2021, and was released on Apple TV+ on March 12, 2021.[3]
Review aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoesreports that 37% of 213 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.20/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "It's certainly stylish and it offers Tom Holland a welcome opportunity to branch out, butCherry's woes stem from a story that's too formulaic to bowl anyone over."[19]According toMetacritic, which assigned the film a weighted average score of 44 out of 100 based on 45 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[20]
Writing forIndieWire, David Ehrlich gave the film a grade of D and said, "...directors Anthony and Joe Russo paid [author Nico Walker] $1 million dollars for the film rights and turned it into their first post-Avengers: Endgameproduction. Suffering through the Russo brothers' scuzzy, interminable, and misjudged adaptation of Walker's life story, there's no question who got the better end of that deal." He further states that Holland was miscast and "radiates so much friendly neighborhood sincerity that he can only wear his character's indifference like it's just another mask."[21]
Owen GleibermanofVarietysaid: "There's hardly a moment inCherrythat's believable, but the film's true crime is that there's hardly a moment in it that's enjoyable either. The only emotion the movie conveys is being full of itself,"[22]and later named it the worst film of 2021.[23]The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called the film "way overripe" and wrote: "Walker's story no doubt is grounded in a very real milieu that reflects the grim existence of countless Americans returning from active duty to a country blighted by economic downturn, shrinking opportunity and substance abuse. But the only realityCherryreflects with numbing insistence is that of co-directors getting high on their own high style."[24]
Matt Gallagher ofThe Interceptwrote that both the film and the book it was based upon have been criticized for erasing the actual victims of the crime, such as the bank teller whom Walker allegedly threatened to kill.[25]

Apple TV+is an Americansubscriptionover-the-topstreaming serviceowned byApple. The service launched on November 1, 2019, and it offers a selection of original production film and television series calledApple Originals.[9]The service was announced during theApple Special Event of March 2019,[10][11]where entertainers from Apple TV+ projects appeared onstage, includingJennifer Aniston,Oprah Winfrey, andSteven Spielberg.[12][13]The service can be accessed through Apple's website and through theApple TV app, which has gradually become available on manyApple devicesand some major competingdigital media players,[14]including somesmart TVmodels and video-game consoles.
Apple plans to expand the services' availability,[15][16][17][18]and there are workarounds for subscribers whose device is not presently supported.[14]Access is included as part of theApple Onesubscription.[19]Most of the content is available inDolby Visionprofile 5 andDolby Atmos. Upon its debut, Apple TV+ was available in about 100 countries, fewer than the reported target of 150.[20][21]Several countries were excluded from service despite other Apple products being available.[22][23][24]Commentators noted that the fairly wide initial reach of the service offered Apple an advantage over other recently launched services such asDisney+, and that because Apple distributes its own content through the service instead of distributing licensed third-party content (as, for example,Huludoes) it will not be limited by licensing issues during its expansion.[25][26][27]
By early 2020, Apple TV+ had poor growth and low subscriber numbers relative to competing services.[28][29][30][31]In the middle of that year, Apple began to license older television programs and films, attempting to stay competitive with other services, attract and retain a viewership for its original content, and convert into subscribers users who were trialing the service.[29][28]Since then, the service has become the home to critically acclaimed content: between September 2021 and March 2022, Apple TV+ netted aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy SerieswithTed Lassoand theAcademy Award for Best PicturewithCODA, the first Best Picture win for a film distributed by a streaming service.[32]Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston have all signed a multi year look deal with Apple TV+ to develop more television projects under their production companies after their critically acclaimed shows. Apple TV+ (along with the simultaneously announceda-la-cartepremium-videosubscription aggregation serviceApple TV app) is part of a concerted effort by Apple to expand its service revenues.[16][33][34]The service's programming arm isApple Studios.
Apple had long been rumored to have an interest in beginning astreaming televisionservice, and in 2015 entered into negotiations with varioustelevision studiosand programmers to aggregate their content for a live-television streaming bundle.[35][36]Negotiations fell apart over differing views on how to value the content, lack of transparency on details, and the personality of Apple's chief negotiator,Eddy Cue.[35]
In October 2016, Apple CEOTim Cooksaid that television is "of intense interest to me and other people here", and added that Apple has "started focusing on some original content", which he called "a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it's an area we're focused on."[37]
In June 2017, Apple began to take the first major steps to form its new television unit by hiring the co-presidents ofSony Pictures Television, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to oversee all aspects of worldwide video programming.[36][2]In August, Matt Cherniss was hired as Head of Domestic Creative Development, reporting directly to Van Amburg and Erlicht.[3]For the rest of 2017, Apple continued to fill out its executive team for Apple TV+, with Kim Rozenfeld joining as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted,Jay Huntjoining as Creative Director for Europe,Morgan Wandelljoining as Head of International Creative Development, Tara Sorensen joining as Head of Kids Programming, and Max Aronson, Ali Woodruff, Carina Walker, and Michelle Lee joining as development and creative executives.[38][39][4][6][40]
Throughout 2019, Apple continued to build out its unscripted content team, with Molly Thompson hired as Head of Documentaries in April.[5]In November, Rozenfeld stepped down as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted to focus on producing content again with a first-look content production deal with Apple under his Half Full Productions. Cherniss took over Rozenfeld's duties overseeing current scripted programming.[41]
In May 2018, it was reported that Apple was expected to start a sister project to its original content service, and begin selling subscriptions to certain video services directly via itsApple TV appapplication oniOSandtvOS, rather than asking Apple device owners to subscribe to those services through applications individually downloaded from Apple's app store.[42]
In October 2018, it was reported that Apple would distribute its future original content through a still-in-development digital video service within its TV application that is pre-installed in all iOS and tvOS devices. The service was expected to feature both original content, free to owners of Apple devices, as well as subscription "channels" from legacy media companies such asHBOandStarz, which would allow customers to sign up for online-only services.[43]Later that month, it was reported that Apple intended to roll out the service in the U.S. during the first half of 2019 and that it would expand its availability to around 100 countries in the months after its launch.[44]
On March 25, 2019, Apple held a press event to announce Apple TV+. At the event, Apple showed a teaser of its upcoming original content and formally announced some of it, with actors and producers attached to the content appearing on stage. The announced content includedHelpsters, the first series fromSesame Workshop, the producer ofSesame Street, and Oprah Winfrey's first projects for Apple TV+, including a documentary under the working titleToxic Labor[45]about workplace sexual harassment, a documentary series about mental health, and a revival ofOprah's Book Clubas a standalone television series.[46][47]
On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would launch on November 1 at $4.99 per month (with a 1-week free trial) for an account that can be shared with up to six family members. Apple also announced that it would be give away a year of Apple TV+ to anyone who bought a newApple TV,Mac,iPad,iPhone, oriPod Touchbeginning that day.[48]Student subscribers to the monthlyApple Musicservice at a discounted rate also have Apple TV+ bundled in at no additional cost for the time being.[49]
From the start of Apple TV+ on November 1, 2019, Apple offered a free one-year subscription to anyone buying certain of its hardware products (an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod Touch, or Mac).[50]Apple initially extended the free year that was due to end on November 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021,[51]but then announced in mid-January 2021 that it would extend it a second time to July 31, 2021.[52]
In mid-June 2021, Apple added a note to its website advising customers that new users subscribing after June 30, 2021, would receive only three months of free subscription instead of a year.[53]
On October 24, 2022, Apple announced it was to increase pricing of Apple TV+ (along withApple MusicandApple One) subscriptions in many regions. The monthly plan increased $2 to $6.99, and the annual plan increased $20 to $69.[54]
During the announcement of Apple TV+, Apple announced a number of prominent writers, directors, and stars who would be featured in the service. The signing of high-profile talent was intended to attract viewers to the service.[55]
As of March 2019[update], five of the upcoming series had completed production, with six more well into filming.[56]On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would have eight original series (seven scripted and one unscripted) and one original documentary available at launch, with plans to launch new original content every month thereafter. Most series were expected to launch with three episodes, with a new episode released weekly thereafter, although Apple said that not all series would follow that model and that some series might instead launch all at once.[57]
Early critical reaction to the bulk of the service's programming was mixed to poor, but commentators predicted that Apple would have time to grow into its new role as a content provider and to produce well-regarded content, especially as the free year of the service provided with many Apple product purchases enticed users to continue watching, and for some to eventually pay for a subscription, as new series are released.[58][59][15]
On March 13, 2020, Apple suspended all active filming on Apple TV+ shows due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, and all production on series was postponed for an indeterminate period.[60]
Apple's decision in mid-2020 to license large swaths of existing older content for the Apple TV+ service was viewed, in part, as buying time for its original content production during the pandemic by keeping users engaged and in a habit of visiting the service regularly, so that a viewer base would be in place by the time new Apple original content was released.[29][28]
In addition, Apple TV+ endeavored to gain new high-profile content, taking advantage of the pandemic's disruption of theatrical film releases. Among these acquisitions were the 2020 feature filmGreyhoundstarringTom Hanks, which was purchased fromSony Picturesfor $70 million.[61]In July 2020, the service won a heated bidding war forEmancipation, a slavery-based action-thriller starringWill Smithand directed byAntoine Fuqua.[62]Apple paid a record $105 million for the rights.[62]Apple also reportedly considered a $350 to $400 million offer for the rights to stream theJames BondfilmNo Time to Die, which was far short of the $650 to $800 million studioMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(owned byAmazon, which is one of theBig Techcompanies alongside Apple) was willing to accept.[63]
In October 2017, following reports ofsexual abuse allegationsagainst producerHarvey Weinstein, Apple announced that it was severing ties withThe Weinstein Company(TWC) and cancelling a plannedbiopicseries aboutElvis Presley.[64]
In April 2018, Apple signedKerry Ehrinto a multi-year deal to produce original content.[65]Ehrin and Apple renewed the deal in May 2020.[66]
In June 2018, Apple signed theWriters Guild of America's minimum basic agreement andOprah Winfreyto a multi-year content partnership.[67][68]The same month, Apple announced that it had given a multi-series order toSesame Workshopto produce variouslive-actionand animated series as well as a single puppet-based series.[69]
In September 2018, it was reported that Apple had decided to shelveVital Signs, a six-episode biopic television series centering on the life of hip-hop producer and performerDr. Dreand starringIan McShane,Sam Rockwell, andMichael K. Williams, due to concerns about the show's content being too graphic, with moments cited including characters usingcocaine, instances ofgun violence, and an explicitorgyscene. Reports further indicated that Apple CEO Tim Cook was taking a hands-on approach to the company's Worldwide Video Unit, with programming decisions reportedly being aligned to Cook's personal taste, with a preference for family-friendly shows. Various programs in different stages of production apparently had their content altered, including the toning down ofThe Morning Showand the removal of crucifixes from a scene in theM. Night Shyamalandrama series. Additionally, Apple reportedly passed on a television series from comedianWhitney Cummingsabout the #MeToo movement because it was "too sensitive a topic".[70][71][72]Cummings's series was ultimately put into development byAmazon Prime Videoin October 2018.[73]
In November 2018, Apple entered into a multi-year agreement with entertainment companyA24to produce a slate of original films in partnership with its Worldwide Video Unit.[74]The same month, Apple signed a deal with DHX Media (nowWildBrain) and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide to develop and produce original programs, including new series, specials, and shorts based on thePeanutscharacters. One of the first productions created through the deal was an original short-form,STEM-relatedseriesfeaturing astronautSnoopy.[75]Also that month, Apple signedJustin Linand his production company, Perfect Storm Entertainment, to a multi-year overall deal to produce original television content.[76]

Apple TV+ released its first movie in theaters,Killers of the Flower Moon.

Apple is seemingly pleased with its box-office returns, which reached $221 million and nearly made back its budget. It is apparent that Apple is attempting to compete with movie production companies.[119][120][121]
In March 2022, Apple announced that it would airFriday Night Baseball, a weekly doubleheader ofMajor League Baseball(MLB) games with live pre- and postgame shows on Apple TV+ in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom starting in the2022 Major League Baseball season.[122]

Apple TV+ subscribers can watch select games at no additional charge, and receive a discount on the MLS Season Pass.[126][127]
In mid-2020, Apple began discussions with film and television studios to license their previously released content as part of an effort to build a back catalog of non-original films and television shows for the streaming service.[30][29]The shift was designed to help the service better compete against the large content libraries competitors likeNetflixhave.[30]This represented a pivot for Apple, which had initially attempted to build the service entirely on original content, avoiding licensing fees to help keep monthly subscription fees low, and relying on its Apple TV Channels content partners to supply other content users wanted.[30][29]
Analysts believed that the addition of older, highly re-watchable content like popular sitcoms and well-liked films would help retain the slowly growing subscriber base while Apple continues to develop original content.[28]The shift was also an acknowledgement of poor growth, especially relative to competing services.[28]The back catalog development was also seen as a move to attempt to persuade free trial users to transition into paid users as the first wave of one-year trials was scheduled to expire in November 2020.[29]
On May 26, 2020, Apple announced its first acquisition of catalogue content would be theFraggle Rockseries.[128]In addition to being the exclusive home of the 1983–1987Jim Henson Companyseries, Apple would develop a new, full-length, rebootedFraggle Rockseries after the success of theFraggle Rock: Rock On!short-form series on Apple TV+.[129]On October 19, 2020, Apple announced the exclusive transmission rights of the various animated productions of thePeanutsfranchise, withdrawing them from broadcast television after 55 years; as part of that agreement, Apple TV+ must make the majorPeanutsspecials available for free in short windows.[130]After an outcry from fans of the specials, Apple sublicensedA Charlie Brown ThanksgivingandA Charlie Brown ChristmastoPBSfor commercial-free airing.[131]In 2021,It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brownalso came to the PBS rotation. The PBS sublicensing arrangement ended before October 2022.[132]
In March 2024, Apple made 51 catalog films available under a "Great Movies special collection" banner.[133]
Apple has announced a number of partnerships, bundles, and initiatives to increase subscriber growth in the service.[when?]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
