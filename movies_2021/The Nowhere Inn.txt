The Nowhere Innis a 2020 Americanmockumentarypsychological thriller-comedy filmdirected by Bill Benz from a screenplay byAnnie Clarkin her film debut andCarrie Brownstein. It stars Clark, Brownstein andDakota Johnson.

While traveling by limo, a loneSt. Vincent(Annie Clark) suddenly discovers that the driver has run off.
In interview footage, Clark recalls the time she tried making amusic documentaryto cover her life both on- and off-stage. She hires her best friend,Carrie Brownstein, to direct the film in the hopes of getting a more intimate perspective. However, Brownstein quickly finds herself frustrated by the aimless,slice-of-lifenature of the footage, Clark's bandmates' lack of knowledge about her, and the disparity between St. Vincent's aloof, emo persona with Clark's introverted, down-to-earth actual personality.
To create a narrative, Brownstein asks Clark to write a song over time. Clark accepts on the condition that Brownstein contribute a guitar solo. With this avenue into influencing the film, Brownstein suggests Clark act more like St. Vincent in the offstage footage. Although she is initially hesitant, a series of frustrating events, along with thinking that Brownstein does not find her interesting despite their friendship, convinces Clark to commit to the bit before, during, and after a concert. This produces better footage but makes Brownstein concerned.
One night, St. Vincent calls Brownstein to her room, where she forces Brownstein to film St. Vincent with her girlfriend,Dakota Johnson, on the bed wearing lingerie with heriPhone. Brownstein becomes extremely uncomfortable when St. Vincent and Johnson begin having sex right in front of her. Clark also continues playing St. Vincent whenever the cameras are not filming, and refuses to let Brownstein take a day off to visit her father, who is battling cancer. To try and wring back her normal personality, Brownstein invites a fan named Kim to meet her backstage. However, when Kim relays the story of howStrange Mercyhelped her cope with the death of her boyfriend, Clark spontaneously begins crying and is comforted by a baffled Kim.
St. Vincent begins pushing Brownstein away, including cutting her off from working on the song. Hurt, Brownstein quits. As she gets on the bus to leave, though, she is confronted by her uncle, who tells her to finish the movie on her father's behalf. Brownstein obliges, but discovers that her rejection of Clark has caused her to fully embrace her St. Vincent side. After lashing out at her and the concert's board, St. Vincent freezes on stage, causing the crowd to attack her. Brownstein returns to the bus to discover that St. Vincent is throwing a party where everyone, including the band members, is wearing a wig in Clark's hairstyle. Horrified, she flees, escaping paparazzi in the process.
Brownstein interviews St. Vincent and Johnson simultaneously, the latter wearing one of the wigs. Johnson is distraught when St. Vincent requests that they stage a public breakup to get further into character, and actually breaks up with her. Angered, she decides to stage the entire documentary, hiring actors to play her family as a stereotypically Texan blended family. Finally reaching a breaking point, Brownstein takes St. Vincent to the jail where her dad is kept.[a]This only ends up hurting Clark, who angrily says that she makes music to get away from her real world problems, not reflect on them.
Brownstein and St. Vincent record the music video for the song, "The Nowhere Inn", where Clark imagines hersinging behinda ghoulish version of herself on stage. Afterwards, Brownstein turns around to discover everyone encountered in the film, including her father, is a paid actor. St. Vincent takes her away in the limo from the beginning, which begins driving increasingly fast. As they confront each other over the situation, Brownstein has the limo stop and flees into the desert. After the limo driver is also gone, the camera pulls back to reveal the limo was also part of a set. Clark then immediately walks over to where she was recording the main interview, and claims it was Brownstein, not her, who lost sight of the goal.
In April 2019, it was announcedAnnie ClarkandCarrie Brownsteinhad joined the cast of the film, with Bill Benz directing from a screenplay by Clark and Brownstein. The project is not a documentary but a scripted film that was to have been shot like a documentary.[6]

Raised inDallas, St. Vincent began her music career as a member ofchoralrock bandthe Polyphonic Spree. She was also a member ofSufjan Stevens' touring band before forming her own band in 2006. Her debut solo studio album,Marry Me, was released in 2007; it was followed byActor(2009) andStrange Mercy(2011).

She also directed a segment in the horror anthology filmXX(2017), and co-wrote and starred in the psychological thriller filmThe Nowhere Inn(2020).
Clark was born inTulsa, Oklahoma, on September 28, 1982, to Sharon Christine and Richard "Rick" Clark.[4][5][6][7][8]Her mother is a social worker and administrator for a nonprofit organization, and her stepfather works in corporate tax administration. Her parents divorced when she was 3, and when she was 7, she moved with her mother and two older sisters toDallas, Texas. She has said that a23andMeDNA test revealed her ancestry to be 80% Irish and 20%Ashkenazi Jewish, via one of her grandmothers.[9][10]Clark was raisedCatholic[11]andUnitarian Universalist.[12]
Clark has four brothers and four sisters from her parents' blended families.[13][14]
As a child, Clark was fond ofRitchie Valensand the movieLa Bamba. When she was five, her mother gave her a red plastic guitar from aTargetstore for Christmas. She began playing her first real guitar at age 12, taking classes with Tony Hyatt, a local guitar shop employee,[15]and worked some of her teenage years as a roadie for her aunt and uncle, the guitar-vocal jazz duoTuck & Patti.[16][17]In 2001, she graduated fromLake Highlands High School, where she participated in theater and the school's jazz band, and was a classmate of actorMark Salling.[18][19]
She attended theBerklee College of MusicinBoston, Massachusetts, studying with professor Lauren Passarelli. She left after three years, feeling that art institutions such as Berklee were sometimes focused more on the aesthetics of art than the product.[20]In retrospect, she said, "I think that with music school and art school, or school in any form, there has to be some system of grading and measurement. The things they can teach you are quantifiable. While all that is good and has its place, at some point you have to learn all you can and then forget everything that you learned in order to actually start making music."[21]
In 2003, Clark released anEPwith fellow Berklee students entitledRatsliveonnoevilstar.[22]She also worked with Heavy Rotation Records, where "she revealed a much more private and intimate rendering of 'Count' forDorm Sessions Vol. 1"[23]and studied with professor of guitar Lauren Passarelli. Shortly after leaving Berklee, she returned home to Texas, where she joinedthe Polyphonic Spreejust before they embarked on a European tour.[16]In 2004, she joinedGlenn Branca's 100-guitar orchestra for the Queens performance,[24]and she was also briefly in anoise rockband called the Skull Fuckers.[25][26][27]Clark left the Polyphonic Spree and joinedSufjan Stevens' touring band in 2006. During this period, she recorded and released an EP titledParis Is Burning(2006).
In 2006, she began recording a studio album under the stage name St. Vincent. In an interview onThe Colbert Report, she said that she "took [her] moniker from a line in aNick Cavesong" that referred to the hospital whereDylan Thomasdied: "And Dylan Thomas died drunk in /St. Vincent's hospital" (from Cave's song "There She Goes, My Beautiful World", from the 2004 albumAbattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus). The name is also a reference to her great-grandmother, whose middle name was St. Vincent.[28]Clark released her debut album,Marry Me, on July 10, 2007, onBeggars Banquet Records. Named after a line from the television sitcomArrested Development,[29]it features appearances from drummer Brian Teasley (Man or Astro-man?, the Polyphonic Spree),Mike Garson(David Bowie's longtime pianist), and horn player Louis Schwadron (the Polyphonic Spree).
The album was well received by critics, who compared Clark to the likes ofKate Bushand David Bowie[30]and lauded the album for its arrangements, themes and style. In their review,The A.V. Clubsaid: "There's a point where too much happiness turns into madness, and St. Vincent's multi-instrumentalist Annie Clark knows this place well".[31]Pitchforksaid, "At every turnMarry Metakes the more challenging route of twisting already twisted structures and unusual instrumentation to make them sound perfectly natural and, most importantly, easy to listen to as she overdubs her thrillinglysui generisvision into vibrant life."[30]The songs onMarry Mewere written largely when Clark was 18 and 19, and, she says, "represented a more idealized version of what life was or what love was or anything in the eyes of someone who hadn't really experienced anything."[21]The album yielded one single, "Paris Is Burning", and a music video was produced for "Jesus Saves, I Spend".
In 2008, Clark was nominated for threePLUG Independent Music Awards: New Artist of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, and Music Video of the Year. On March 6, 2008, she won the PLUG Female Artist of the Year award.[32]After returning to New York from a lengthy tour, Clark began working on her second album. Her inspiration reportedly came from several films, includingDisneymovies: "Well, the truth is that I had come back from a pretty long — you know, about a year-and-a-half of touring, and so my brain was sort of all circuit boards that were a little bit fried", Clark said. "So I started watching films as sort of a way to get back into being human. And then it started to just really inform the entire record."[33]Clark, who did not have a studio at the time, began writing the album in her apartment on her computer usingGarageBandandMIDI, because she had gotten noise complaints from neighbors.[34]The songs were inspired largely by scenes from various children's films. Clark said she imagined soundtracks for certain scenes in films when writing the music and lyrics,[34]including scenes inSnow White(1937) andThe Wizard of Oz(1939).
Her second album,Actor, was released by 4AD Records on May 5, 2009.[35]It was also well received and gained more commercial attention than its predecessor.[21]Spingave the album eight out of ten stars, noting its "[juxtaposition of] the cruel and the kind, and here, the baroque arrangements are even more complex and her voice even prettier, with both only underlining the dark currents running through her songs".[36]Entertainment Weeklysaid the album "plays up the contrasts, [with Clark] letting her church-choir voice linger on lyrics that hint darkly at themes of violence, sex, and general chaos", and branded it "a uniquely potent cocktail of sounds and moods".[37]Actorcharted well for an independent release, peaking at No. 9 onBillboard'sIndependent Albumschart, No. 5 on the Tastemaker Albums chart,[38]and No. 90 on theBillboard200. Although it spawned no singles (except in the UK, where "Actor Out of Work" was issued as a 7" vinyl single), music videos for "Marrow" and "Actor Out of Work" were released, and aired on several music channels. A promotional music video for "Laughing with a Mouth of Blood", featuringPortlandia'sFred ArmisenandCarrie Brownstein(then of ThunderAnt), was also filmed.
Two soundtracks forThe Twilight Sagahave featured Clark's songs. "Rosyln", in collaboration withindie folkbandBon Iver, appeared on the 2009 soundtrack ofNew Moon; and "The Antidote" was written for and appeared on 2012'sBreaking Dawn – Part 2. In November 2010, Clark appeared with American rappersKid CudiandCageonLate Night with Jimmy Fallon. They performed "Maniac" from Cudi'sMan on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager, which prominently samples "The Strangers", the opening song onActor.[39]
Clark spent much of her time inSeattlewriting her third album,Strange Mercy, in October 2010. In an interview withJulie KlausnerforSpinmagazine, she recalled: "[Death Cab for Cutie drummer]Jason McGerrhad an office that was closing. He offered me the space for a month, for all of October. I was alone. I stayed at the Ace Hotel downtown, in one of the rooms with a shared bathroom. I would just get up in the morning and caffeinate, and run, and go to the studio for 12 hours, come back, eat dinner alone with a book, have a glass of wine, and go to bed. And do it all over again."[40]On January 12, 2011, Clark announced viaTwitterthat she was working onStrange Mercy, a follow-up toActor.[41][non-primary source needed]In early March 2011, producerJohn Congleton, who also worked with Clark onActor, said that he and Clark were nearly a third of the way through recording it.[42]

Clark mentioned that singers such asDavid BowieandKate Bushhad inspired her,[118]as hadJimi HendrixandSiouxsie and the Banshees.[119]She said in a 2015 lecture she listens to a Bowie track every day, and that"It's No Game (Part One)"was her favorite.[120]Talking Heads,Patti SmithandPink Floydare also influences,[121]as well as guitaristsRobert FrippandAdrian Belew(both fromKing Crimson),[122]Marc RibotandTool.[123]Clark cited the authorLorrie Mooreas an inspiration forSt Vincent.[124]
Clark has played a 1967HarmonyBobkat, 1960'sSilvertone1488, 1979HagströmSuper Swede, andFenderDeluxe NashvilleTelecaster.[125]In recent years, she has primarily played her signature Ernie Ball Music Man St. Vincent guitar.
In March 2016,Ernie Ballannounced that Clark had designed a signatureMusic Manguitar.[126]Unique to the guitar was the design, whichWelshsingerCate Le Bonclaimed inThe Guardianas being made for women's bodies and providing pleasing aesthetic form in support of the guitar's function.[127]However, Clark has since stated that the guitar being specifically for women was not a consideration during the design process.[128][129]
It was originally released in 2016 as the St. Vincent HHH with threemini-humbuckersin a signature Vincent Blue finish, a paint color which Clark herself had personally hand-mixed and selected, as well as in Black.[130][131]
In 2017, four additional colors were added to the guitar line, Polaris White, Heritage Red, Tobacco Burst, and Stealth Black. 2017 was also the last year to feature a solidrosewoodneck and fingerboard, due to heavy rosewood trade restrictions underCITES, later models would primarily use a roasted maple neck with ebony fingerboard.[132][133]A St. Vincent HH signature model was released in 2018 featuring twohumbuckersin place of the three mini-humbuckers on the original.[134]
In 2021, a new St. Vincent Goldie signature model was released, featuring threegold foilmini-humbucker pickups, a reverse matching finish headstock, redesigned pickguard shape in 3-ply parchment, a roasted maple neck, and stainless steel frets.[135][136]
Notable users of the guitar includeJack White, who used the three pickup version during every performance of hisBoarding House Reachtour in 2018,Todd Tamanend Clark,Tom Morello,J Mascis, Les Priest ofLANY, Eva Hendricks ofCharly Bliss, Emily Roberts ofThe Last Dinner Party, andDan BoecknerofWolf Parade.[137][138][139][140][141][142]
Clark divides her time between Los Angeles, Dallas, and New York City.[143]A 2014Village Voiceprofile describes her as a private person.David Byrne, with whom she collaborated and toured, said of her: "Despite having toured with her for almost a year, I don't think I know her much better, at least not on a personal level... Mystery is not a bad thing for a beautiful, talented young woman (or man) to embrace. And she does it without seeming to be standoffish or distant."[144]
When asked during a 2014 interview withRolling Stonewhether she identified as gay or straight, Clark responded: "I don't think about those words. I believe ingender fluidityandsexual fluidity. I don't really identify as anything. I think you can fall in love with anybody. I don't have anything to hide but I'd rather the emphasis be on music."[145]Later that year, in an interview with the UK'sSunday Times, she elaborated: "I'm not one for gender or sexual absolutism in the main; I fully support and engage inthe spectrum."[146]She identifies asqueer.[147]Clark was in a relationship with the actress and fashion modelCara Delevingnefrom late 2014 until mid-2016.[148]Clark briefly dated the actressKristen Stewartin late 2016.[149]While accepting aGrammy Awardin 2025, she revealed she has a wife named Leah as well as a daughter.[150]
In May 2010, Clark's father was convicted of one count of conspiracy, seven counts of wire fraud, five counts of securities fraud, and one count of money laundering.[151]The albumDaddy's Homewas in part inspired by her father's eventual release.[152]

Carrie Rachel Brownstein[5](born September 27, 1974) is an American musician, actress, writer, director, and comedian. She first came to prominence as a member of the bandExcuse 17before forming the rock trioSleater-Kinney.
During a long hiatus from Sleater-Kinney, she formed the groupWild Flag. During this period, Brownstein wrote and appeared in a series of comedy sketches alongsideFred Armisenthat were developed into the satirical comedy TV seriesPortlandia(2011–2018). The series went on to winEmmyandPeabody Awards.
Sleater-Kinney eventually reunited; as of 2023, Brownstein was touring with the band as well as in support of her new memoir.[6]
Brownstein was born inSeattle, Washington, and was raised inRedmond, Washington.[7]Her mother was a housewife and a teacher, and her father was a corporate lawyer. They divorced when Carrie was 14, and she was raised by her father.[8]Brownstein has a younger sister, Stacey. Her family isJewish.[9]
She attendedLake Washington High Schoolbefore transferring toThe Overlake Schoolfor her senior year.[10][11]
Brownstein began playing guitar at 15 and received lessons fromJeremy Enigk.[12]She later said: "He lived in the neighborhood next to mine, so I would just walk my guitar over to his house. He showed me a couple ofopen chordsand I just took it from there. I'd gone through so many phases as a kid with my interests that my parents put their foot down with guitar. So [the instrument] ended up being the [first] thing that I had to save up my own money for – and maybe that was the whole reason that I actually stuck with it."[12]
After high school, Brownstein attendedWestern Washington Universitybefore transferring toThe Evergreen State College. In 1997, Brownstein graduated from Evergreen with an emphasis onsociolinguistics[13]and stayed inOlympia, Washington, for three years before moving toPortland, Oregon.[14]

In September 2010, Brownstein revealed her latest project was the bandWild Flag, with Janet Weiss, Mary Timony, and Rebecca Cole, formerly ofThe Minders; according to Brownstein, about a year earlier, "I started to need music again, and so I called on my friends and we joined as a band.Chemistrycannot be manufactured or forced, so Wild Flag was not a sure thing, it was a 'maybe, a 'possibility.' But after a handful of practice sessions, spread out over a period of months, I think we all realized that we could be greater than the sum of our parts."[25]They released aself-titled albumin September 2011.[26]
Music has always been my constant, my salvation. It's cliché to write that, but it's true. From dancing around toMichael JacksonandMadonnaas a kid to having my mind blown by the first sounds ofpunkandindie rock, to getting to play my own songs and have people listen, music is what got me through. Over the years, music put a weapon in my hand and words in my mouth, it backed me up and shielded me, it shook me and scared me and showed me the way; music opened me up to living and being and feeling.
In 2011, Wild Flag toured for a second time[28]and played atCMJ Music Marathon.[29]By 2014, the band was no longer active.[30][31]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
