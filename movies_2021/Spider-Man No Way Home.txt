A third MCU Spider-Man film was planned during the production ofHomecomingin 2017. Negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal—in which they produce the Spider-Man films together—ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project in August 2019, but a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the companies a month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return, and filming took place from October 2020 to March 2021 in New York City and Atlanta.No Way Homeserves as acrossoverbetween the MCU and the previousSpider-Manfilmsdirected bySam RaimiandMarc Webb. Several actors reprise their roles from those films, including previous Spider-Man actors Maguire and Garfield. The pair's involvement was the subject of wide speculation and numerous leaks despite Sony, Marvel, and the cast's efforts to conceal their involvement until the film's release.

AfterQuentin BeckframesPeter Parkerfor his murder and reveals that Peter isSpider-Man,[a]theDepartment of Damage Controlarrests Peter; his girlfriend,Michelle "MJ" Jones-Watson; his best friend,Ned Leeds; and his aunt,May Parker. LawyerMatt Murdockgets Peter's charges dropped, but the group grapples with negative publicity. After Peter's, MJ's, and Ned'sMITapplications are rejected, Peter goes to theNew York Sanctumto ask Dr.Stephen Strangefor help. Strange starts casting a spell that would make everyone forget Peter is Spider-Man, but it is corrupted when Peter repeatedly requests alterations to let his loved ones retain their memories. Strange contains the corrupted spell.
At Strange's suggestion, Peter tries to convince an MIT administrator to reconsider MJ's and Ned's applications. He is attacked byOtto Octavius, who ripsnanotechnologyfrom Peter'sIron Spidersuit. This bonds with Octavius's mechanical tentacles and allows Peter to control them. AsNorman Osbornarrives and attacks, Strange teleports Peter back to the Sanctum and locks Octavius in a cell next toCurt Connors. Strange explains that the corrupted spell summoned people from other universes within themultiversewho know Spider-Man's identity. He orders Peter, MJ, and Ned to find and capture the others; they locate and retrieveMax DillonandFlint Markoat a military research facility.
Osborn reclaims control of himself from his splitGreen Goblinpersonality and destroys the Goblin mask. He gets help from May until Peter retrieves him. While discussing their battles with Spider-Man, Osborn, Octavius, and Dillon realize they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths.[b]Strange prepares to reverse the contained spell and send the villains back to their respective universes, but Peter argues that they should first help each villain to possibly change their fates upon their return. When Strange refuses, Peter steals the spell, traps Strange in theMirror Dimension, and takes the villains toHappy Hogan's apartment. He usesStark Industriestechnology to cure Octavius. Before Peter can cure anyone else, the Goblin persona retakes control of Osborn. The Goblin convinces the other villains to betray Peter and fatally wounds May as Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape; before she dies, May tells Peter that "with great power, there must also come great responsibility".
Ned discovers that he can create portals using Strange'ssling ring, which he and MJ use to try to locate Peter. They instead find "Peter-Two" and "Peter-Three",alternate versions of Peterwho were also summoned from the villains' universes by Strange's spell. The group finds this universe's Peter ("Peter-One"), who is mourning May and ready to send the villains home to die. The alternate Peters share stories of losing loved ones and encourage Peter-One to fight in May's honor. The three Peters develop cures for the villains and lure them to theStatue of Liberty. Peter-One and Peter-Two cure Connors and Marko while Octavius helps cure Dillon. Ned accidentally frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension. The Goblin unleashes the contained spell, breaking the barriers between universes and pulling in countless others who know Peter's identity. Strange attempts to hold them off while an enraged Peter-One tries to kill the Goblin. Peter-Two stops him and Peter-Three helps Peter-One inject the Goblin with his cure, restoring Osborn's sanity.
Peter-One realizes that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase himself from everyone's memory and requests Strange do so while promising MJ and Ned that he will find them and remind them who he is. Strange reluctantly casts the spell, and everyone returns to their respective universes—includingEddie Brock,[c]who unknowingly leaves behind a piece of theVenomsymbiote. Two weeks later, Peter visits MJ to reintroduce himself to her and Ned, but decides against it. While mourning at May's grave, he has a conversation with Hogan and is inspired to carry on, making a new Spider-Man suit and resuming his vigilantism.

Jonah Jameson, the host ofThe Daily Bugle;[47][48]andGary WeeksasDepartment of Damage Control(DODC) agent Foster.[49]Jake Gyllenhaalappears asQuentin Beck / Mysteriovia archival footage fromFar From Home.[50]Also appearing in the film arePaula Newsomeas an MIT administrator,[45]Arian Moayedas DODC agentCleary,[50]Mary Rivera as Ned's grandmother,[45]andCristo Fernándezas a bartender serving Brock.[42]Tom Holland's brother Harry Holland was set to make a cameo as a thief, but his scenes were cut from the original theatrical release.[51]Lexi Rabe, who portrayed Stark's daughterMorganin the filmAvengers: Endgame(2019), also had an appearance that was not included in the theatrical release.[52]
During production on the filmSpider-Man: Homecoming(2017), two sequels were being planned byMarvel StudiosandSony Pictures.[53]In June 2017, starTom Hollandexplained that each film would take place during a different year of high school forPeter Parker / Spider-Man, with the third being set during the character's senior year.[54]Marvel Studios PresidentKevin Feigenoted in July 2019 that the third film would feature "a Peter Parker story that has never been done before on film" due to the ending of the second film,Spider-Man: Far From Home(2019), which publicly reveals that Parker is Spider-Man.[55]
Development on third and fourth MCUSpider-Manfilms had begun by August 2019, with Sony hoping Holland and directorJon Wattswould return for both;[56]Holland was contracted to return for one more film, while Watts had completed his two-film deal and would need to sign on for any more films.[57][58]By then, Marvel Studios and its parent companyThe Walt Disney Studioshad spent several months discussing expanding their deal with Sony. The existing deal had Marvel and Feige produce the Spider-Man films for Sony and receive 5% of their revenue. Sony wanted to expand the deal to include more films while keeping the same terms of the original agreement. Disney expressed concern with Feige's workload producing theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU) franchise already and asked for a 25–50% stake in any future films Feige produced for Sony.[56][59][58]Unable to come to an agreement, Sony announced that it would be moving forward on the next Spider-Man film without Feige or Marvel's involvement. Their statement acknowledged that this could change in the future, thanked Feige for his work on the first two films, and said they appreciated "the path [Feige] has helped put us on, which we will continue."[59]Chris McKennaandErik Sommerswere writing the screenplay for the third film by the time of Sony's announcement, after also doing so forFar From Home, but Watts was receiving offers to direct large films for other studios instead of returning to the franchise, including potentially working on a different property for Marvel Studios and Feige.[58]
In September 2019, Sony Pictures Entertainment chairmanTony Vinciquerrasaid that "for the moment the door is closed" on Spider-Man returning to the MCU and confirmed that the character would be integrated with Sony's own shared universe—Sony's Spider-Man Universe(SSU)—moving forward. Responding to backlash from fans following the announcement, Vinciquerra added that "the Marvel people are terrific people, we have great respect for them, but on the other hand we have some pretty terrific people of our own. [Feige] didn't do all the work ... we're pretty capable of doing what we have to do here."[60]However, after this fan reaction continued at Disney's biennial conventionD23, and at the urging of Holland who personally spoke toDisneyCEOBob IgerandSony Pictures Motion Picture GroupchairmanTom Rothman,[61]the companies returned to negotiations.[62]Sony and Disney announced a new agreement at the end of September which would allow Marvel Studios and Feige to produce another MCU Spider-Man film for Sony withAmy Pascal, scheduled for July 16, 2021.[5]Disney was reportedly co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of its profits, while retaining the character's merchandising rights.[5][62]Feige said he was "thrilled" that the character would remain in the MCU and said "all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working" on the franchise. The agreement also allowed Holland's Spider-Man to appear in a future Marvel Studios film as well as crossing over to Sony's own shared universe,[5]with the latter interaction described as "a 'call and answer' between the two franchises as they acknowledge details between the two in what would loosely be described as a shared detailed universe". Sony described their previous films with Marvel Studios as a "great collaboration", and said "our mutual desire to continue was equal to that of the many fans."[62]At the time of the new agreement, Watts was in final negotiations to direct the film.[63]
Discussing the new deal in early October, Iger attributed it to the efforts of Holland as well as the fan response to the end of the original deal. He felt that both Sony and Disney had initially forgotten that "there are other people who actually matter" while they were negotiating.[64]Rothman said the deal was a "win-win-win. A win for Sony, a win for Disney, a win for the fans." He felt the initial reports on the negotiations did not necessarily line up with the actual discussions that were taking place, and said the final deal would have eventuated without the reports and fan discourse.[65]By the middle of the month,Zendayawas confirmed to be reprising her role asMichelle "MJ" Jones-Watsonfrom the previous films in the sequel.[9][10]
McKenna and Sommers began working on the script in earnest by December 2019.[31][16]They considered featuringKraven the Hunteras the film's main antagonist,[31]an idea that Watts had expressed interest in andpitchedto Holland,[66][67]but was abandoned because Sony wanted to first feature the character ina solo filmbefore any other projects.[68]The plot subsequently gravitated towards a story idea similar to the filmIt's a Wonderful Life(1946) in which Parker makes a wish regarding his now public identity. That idea introduced Dr.Stephen Strangeto the story, and the duo began exploring the idea of themultiverseand potentially revisiting characters from pastSpider-Manfilms. Initially they thought this would just be a tease for fans, but they ultimately decided to fully integrate the past characters into the plot. Sommers said, "Once it was collectively decided that we were going to take this swing, we had to commit and we had to do what was right for the story." They optimistically wrote for all the characters they wanted in the film before those actors were confirmed to be returning.[31]Initial drafts of the film included every major character from pastSpider-Manfilms returning, but this was narrowed down because the pair felt they had "bit[ten] off more than [they] could chew". The duo worked hard to prevent the film from just being "a bunch of fan service" by using the returning characters to help tell Peter Parker's story instead of just creating "curtain calls for everybody".[16]Norman Osborn / Green GoblinfromSam Raimi'sSpider-Mantrilogywas not the main villain of the film in the first version of the script, despite still appearing as an antagonist; after the film lost "other characters", McKenna and Sommers concluded that the Green Goblin "had to be" the main villain and rewrote the script to give him a second chance to replicate his actions in the filmSpider-Man(2002), but in a darker way related to Holland's version of Spider-Man.[69]America Chavezhad been considered to appear in the film at one point to serve in the sorcerer's apprentice-type role that eventually became part ofNed Leeds's role in the film; she would go on to appear in the MCU filmDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness(2022).[70]
By the end of 2019, filming was expected to begin in mid-2020.[71]By March 2020, McKenna and Sommers were still working on the first draft of the script.[16]In April, Sony rescheduled the film's release to November 5, 2021, due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[72]Although the film was originally meant to be set after the events ofMultiverse of Madness, release date changes meant the film would be released first which meant aspects of the plot had to be rewritten,[73]including Strange no longer having firsthand knowledge of the multiverse. McKenna felt this made it "even more frightening, to start fooling around with these things, because it's the fear of the unknown".[16]In June,Marisa Tomeiconfirmed that she would return asMay Parkeralong with Watts as director. She was hopeful that May's work as a community organizer would be featured in the film.[30]Also in June,Charlie Cox, who portrayedMatt Murdock / DaredevilinMarvel Television'sNetflix series, was contacted by Feige about reprising his role in upcoming Marvel Studios projects starting with appearances inNo Way Homeand theDisney+seriesShe-Hulk: Attorney at Law(2022).[74][75]While working on the script, McKenna and Sommers discussed the possibility of giving Murdock a larger role in the film than they had originally planned, though the duo ultimately decided against it to avoid shifting the film's focus away from Parker.[76]The next month, Holland said production was planned to take place from late 2020 to February 2021,[77]and Sony shifted the film's release date to December 17, 2021.[78]Tony Revoloriwas also confirmed to be reprising his role asFlash Thompson.[29]In early October,Jacob BatalonandBenedict Cumberbatchwere set to reprise their MCU roles of Ned Leeds and Strange, whileJamie Foxxwas set to return asMax Dillon / ElectrofromMarc Webb's filmThe Amazing Spider-Man 2(2014), with filming beginning later in the month.[17][12]Immediately prior to the beginning of filming, several other key actors in the film had yet to sign on. According to Holland, the film needed "all or none" of the actors to be produced.[73]
Second unitfilming occurred from October 14 to 16, 2020, in New York City,[79][80][81]under theworking titleSerenity Now,[82][80]to capture visual effects plates andestablishing shots.[79]Filming occurred in theAstoria,Sunnyside, andLong Island Cityneighborhoods in Queens.[83][81]On October 23, filming occurred inGreenwich Villagein Manhattan.[84]
The production moved to Atlanta by October 25, with Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya joining forprincipal photography,[85][86]after Holland finished shooting the Sony filmUncharted(2022) two days earlier.[87][79][88]Mauro Fioreserved as cinematographer on the film,[89]replacingSeamus McGarvey,[90]who had to leave the production after contractingCOVID-19. McGarvey also had a conflict with the filmCyrano(2021) following the third MCUSpider-Manfilm's pandemic-caused production delay,[91]as principal photography was originally planned to start in July 2020.[92][93][77]Shooting in Atlanta occurred atTrilith Studios, with strict safety measures in place on the soundstages to prevent exposure to COVID-19.[94]To reduce interactions between cast and crew members on set during the pandemic, the production reportedly relied on "innovative new technology" that scanned actors into a visual effects system that can apply make-up and costumes to actors during post-production.[95]A light system was also in-place to signal when the cast could take off their masks for filming and when masks would be required for the cast and crew members to wear while set work was being done.[96]Cumberbatch began shooting his scenes in Atlanta by late November, before beginning work onMultiverse of Madnesswhich began filming that month in London.[97][98]Filming ran for seven-to-eight weeks using the working titlesSerenity NowandThe November Project, before a break during the 2020Christmas season.[99][88][100]
By December 2020,Alfred Molinawas set to reprise his role asOtto Octavius / Doctor Octopusfrom Raimi's filmSpider-Man 2(2004),[25]withTobey Maguirereprising his role asPeter Parker / Spider-Manfrom Raimi'sSpider-Mantrilogy andAndrew Garfieldreturning asPeter Parker / Spider-Manfrom Webb'sThe Amazing Spider-Manfilms.[31]Acameo appearanceof Maguire and Garfield alongside Holland as their respective Spider-Men had previously been considered for theSony Pictures AnimationfilmSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018), but was cut then because Sony felt at that moment that it would be too risky and confusing.[101]At that time,Colliderreported that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film alongsideKirsten DunstasMary Jane Watsonfrom Raimi'sSpider-Manfilm trilogy andEmma StoneasGwen Stacyfrom theAmazing Spider-Manfilms.[102]The first draft of the script included other characters from theSpider-ManandAmazing Spider-Manfilms, such asSally Field'sMay Parker, but the writers felt that including too many characters would negatively affect the story.[16]The rumors about returning actors led to speculation and commentary, with Richard Newby ofThe Hollywood Reporterbelieving that a crossover-style film could "lessen the impact" of Sony's successful animatedInto the Spider-Versefilm.[103]His colleague Graeme McMillan felt a "Spider-Verse" crossover would allow Marvel to "clean up some loose ends ... and fulfill some fan dreams in the process", especially if Marvel and Sony's negotiations meant that they wanted to separate Spider-Man from the MCU.[104]/Film'sHoai-Tran Bui feared the film was becoming over-crowded and wished that Holland could lead a Spider-Man film without a "bigger A-list star showing him the ropes",[105]while Adam B. Vary ofVarietynoted that these reports were not confirmed and questioned whether the returning actors would be making more than cameo appearances.[106]Shortly after, Holland denied that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film.[88]Many of the actors returning from previousSpider-Manfilms were brought to set in cloaks to help prevent their involvements in the film from leaking.[107]Around Christmas 2020, McKenna and Sommers rewrote the introductions of Maguire and Garfield as well as much of the third act in time for those actors to start filming. They had not been able to focus on those scenes earlier because they were busy during filming of much of the first and second acts in the previous months.[16]
Feige confirmed in December 2020 that the film would have connections toMultiverse of Madness.[108]A month later he discussed the fact that the film's title had not yet been announced, acknowledging that it was being referred to by some asSpider-Man 3and revealing that Marvel was referring to it asHomecoming 3internally.[109]Cox had shot material for the film by then.[41]An Atlanta set photo indicated that the film would be set during the Christmas season.[110]Filming occurred atFrederick Douglass High Schoolfrom January 22 to 24.[111][112]The next month, Holland described it as "the most ambitious standalone superhero" film,[99]and again denied the rumors that Maguire and Garfield would appear.[113][8]At the end of February, the film's title was revealed to beSpider-Man: No Way Home, continuing the naming convention of the past two films of featuring "home" in the title.[114]Filming took place atMidtown High Schoolfrom March 19 to 21.[111][115]TheAtlanta Public Schoolssystem had stopped allowing buildings in the district for use as filming locations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but gave this film an exception since both the Frederick Douglass and Midtown schools were previously used as filming locations inHomecoming.[111]Hannibal Buresswas revealed to be reprising his role as gym teacher Coach Wilson,[115]with Buress releasing amusic videoin August 2021 revealing that he had filmed scenes in Atlanta.[44]Holland saidNo Way Homehad more "visceral" fight sequences than the previous two films, with more hand-to-hand combat.[27]Filmingwrappedon March 26, 2021.[116][117]
In April 2021, Molina confirmed that he was appearing in the film, explaining that he had been told not to talk about his role in the film during production but he realized that his appearance had been widely rumored and reported on.[26]Later that month,J. B. Smooverevealed that he was returning asJulius DellfromFar From Home,[46]while Cox stated that he was not involved with the film.[118]In early May, Garfield denied that he had been asked to appear in the film, but later said "never say never",[119][120]whileAngourie Ricewas revealed to be returning asBetty Brantin the film, reprising her role from previous MCU media.[43]Later that month, Stone denied her involvement in the film.[121]
Sony Pictures Group PresidentSanford Panitchacknowledged in May that there had been confusion and frustration from fans regarding the relationship between the SSU and the MCU but stated that there was a plan to clarify this. He believed it was already "getting a little more clear for people [as to] where we're headed" at that time and added that the release ofNo Way Homewould reveal more of this plan. Vary commented that the apparent introduction of multiverse elements inNo Way Homecould be what would allow Holland to appear in both the MCU and the SSU.[122]The official trailer forNo Way Homeconfirmed the involvements ofJon FavreauasHarold "Happy" HoganandBenedict WongasWong, reprising their roles from past MCU films,[19]as well asJ. K. SimmonsasJ. Jonah JamesonfromFar From Home(Simmons previously played a different version of the character in the Raimi trilogy as well).[47]It was also confirmed that the characters Electro and Green Goblin would appear in the film,[19][20][123]with the implication that this incarnation of Green Goblin would beWillem Dafoe's version from the Raimi films.[123]In September 2021, Garfield again denied he was in the film, saying, "No matter what I say... it's either going to be really disappointing for people or it's going to be really exciting".[124]Garfield later described his denials as "rather stressful but also weirdly enjoyable".[125]
In early October, many commentators expectedTom Hardyto reprise his roles asEddie BrockandVenomfrom the SSU filmsVenom(2018) andVenom: Let There Be Carnage(2021), after theLet There Be Carnagemid-credits sceneshowed the characters being transported from their universe (the SSU) to the MCU.[126][127][128]Feige said there was a lot of coordination between theLet There Be CarnageandNo Way Hometeams to create the scene,[129]which was directed by Watts during the production ofNo Way Home.[16]Hardy ultimately appeared as Brock in the film's mid-credits scene,[42]though there had been discussions about integrating him into the film's final battle,[16]as well as bonding Holland's Parker to asymbiote.[130]Later that month,Empire'sissue onNo Way Homestated that the film would include the returns of Doctor Octopus, Electro, Dafoe's Green Goblin,Thomas Haden Church'sFlint Marko / Sandmanfrom Raimi's filmSpider-Man 3(2007) andRhys Ifans'sCurt Connors / Lizardfrom Webb's filmThe Amazing Spider-Man(2012).[131]Church's role in the film was originally meant to be larger, counting with a subplot of his own about Sandman's relationship with his daughter Penny (who was previously portrayed byPerla Haney-Jardine), but the COVID-19 pandemic and the script being rewritten led to his role's reduction, only providing scratch dialogue and some motion-capture at aSan Antonio,Texasparking lot.[132]Watts said these were still unconfirmed rumors and was in "no hurry to confirm or deny appearances" of the characters,[131]while Feige said the rumors were fun for fans but audiences should not expect them all to come true.[133]The film's second trailer confirmed the involvements of Dafoe, Church, and Ifans.[22]Paul Giamatti'sAleksei Sytsevich / RhinofromThe Amazing Spider-Man 2andJake Gyllenhaal'sQuentin Beck / MysteriofromFar From Homewere also considered for inclusion, with McKenna and Sommers playing with the idea of aSinister Sixforming; Rhino, Mysterio, and the Sinister Six ultimately did not appear in the film,[134]thougharchival footageof Gyllenhaal as Beck fromFar From Homewas used inNo Way Home.[50]A cameo appearance by the version ofPeter Parker / Spider-ManfromInsomniac Games'sSpider-Manvideo game serieswas also considered forNo Way Home.[130]Concept art of Doctor Octopus forNo Way Homerevealed that in addition to his original outfit fromSpider-Man 2, there were plans for the character to wear a green-and-yellow comics-accurate costume in the film, but the idea was scrapped.[135]
At the beginning of November,Jorge Lendeborg Jr.revealed that he would be reprising his role asJason IonellofromHomecomingandFar From Homein a similar role to those films that would have "very little to do with the core" story.[136]By the middle of the month, additional photography had been completed for the film.[137]Pascal describedNo Way Homeas "the culmination of theHomecomingtrilogy",[138]andArian Moayedrevealed that he had a role in the film,[139]playingDepartment of Damage Control(DODC) agentCleary.[50]At that time, Dunst confirmed that she would not appear in the film,[140]but also stated that she would "never say no" to reprising her role as Mary Jane Watson.[141]In mid-December,Martin Starrwas confirmed to be appearing asRoger Harringtonin the film, reprising his role from previous MCU media.[45]A teaser trailer forMultiverse of Madnesswas included at the end of the film as a post-credits scene,[142]before being released online shortly afterNo Way Home'stheatrical release.[143]Jeffrey Fordand Leigh Folsom Boyd served as the film's editors.[144]The visual effects were provided byCinesite, Clear Angle Studios, Crafty Apes,Digital Domain, Folks VFX,Framestore,Luma Pictures, Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies, Mr. X, Perception, Secret Lab,Sony Pictures Imageworks, and SSVFX.[145]The scene of Holland's Parker's first confrontation with the Green Goblin in Hogan's apartment went through several different iterations, including one that featuredMichael Keaton'sAdrian Toomes / VulturefromHomecoming, and another in which the Goblin bombs Hogan's apartment with May still inside, presumably killing her in a different manner than how it was depicted in the final film.[146][147][130]
In November 2020,HomecomingandFar From HomecomposerMichael Giacchinowas confirmed to be returning forNo Way Home.[148][149]The film's score album was released digitally on December 17, 2021, with a track titled "Arachnoverture" released as asingleon December 9 and another titled "Exit Through the Lobby" released the following day.[150]Giacchino references themes from previousSpider-Manfilms byHans Zimmer,James Horner,Christopher Young,[151]andDanny Elfman, as well as his own themes fromDoctor Strange(2016).[152]Regarding the use of these other themes, Giacchino did not want their use to be fan service and finding ways to include them in a "very targeted" way. He and Watts were "very much in alignment in terms of when to use them and when not to use them for their maximum effect".[153]
In May 2020, Sony entered a promotional partnership withHyundai Motor Groupto showcase their new models and technologies in the film;[154]Hyundai later released a commercial, titled "Only Way Home", that was directed by Watts to promote the film and theIoniq 5electric-poweredSUV(which appears in the film along with theHyundai Tucson), with Holland and Batalon starring.[155]In late February 2021, Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya released three stills featuring their characters from the film alongside fake logos with the titlesSpider-Man: Phone Home,Spider-Man: Home-Wrecker, andSpider-Man: Home Slice, respectively.[156]The film's official title was announced the next day with a video showing Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya leaving Watts's office (where they supposedly received the fake titles). Batalon and Zendaya note that Holland could not be trusted with the actual title since he had "accidentally" revealed the second film's title. The video ends on a whiteboard showing the film's true title, among various other titles featuring the word "home" that were apparently considered.[114]Jennifer Bisset ofCNETsuggested the fake titles and logos could represent the villains in the film, including Foxx's Electro and Molina's Doctor Octopus,[156]whileTheWrap'sUmberto Gonzalez called them funny "bait-and-switchfakes", and noted thePhone Hometitle referenced a line fromE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial(1982).[157]Gregory Lawrence ofColliderfelt theHome-Wreckertitle could point to the film feeling like a 1990sthriller film, and said the fake titles were a "solid goof" to excite fans. He also compared the stills to the "terrifying/awe-inspiring wonder" ofSteven Spielbergfilms andThe Goonies(1985),[158]while Germain Lussier fromio9said they gave off "subtleNational Treasure,Indiana Jonesvibes".[159]In July 2021, Marvel revealed various toys and figurines for the film, includingFunko Pops,Marvel Legendsfigures, andLegosets.[160]
At the end of August 2021, when asked about the lack of trailer and official images or descriptions for the film, Feige stated that the film was not being "any more or less secret than any of our other projects" and reaffirmed that a trailer would be released before the film's premiere in theaters.[161]Though Sony handles the marketing for the film, their marketing team is in coordination with Disney's to ensure each knows when the other is releasing MCU-related content so it is a "win-win for everybody".[162]On August 22, an apparent leak of the first trailer was shared on social media,[163][164][165]whichThe Hollywood Reporterdeemed "legitimate" after Sony worked to have various copies of the trailer taken down.[163]Adam Chitwood atCollidernoted the built up online "fervor" surrounding the trailer and felt that it would not be able to "live up to the hype fans have built up in their minds". Chitwood continued that the other 2021 film releases from Marvel Studios had not seen a similar level of demand asNo Way Home, pointing out that all of the rumored castings had positioned the film to be a "once-in-a-lifetime moviegoing experience" if they were accurate. He also wondered if Sony was wary of committing marketing that noted the film's December 2021 release date amid the resurgence of theCOVID-19 Delta variant.[166]
The film'steaser trailerwas officially released on August 23 during Sony'sCinemaCon2021 panel.[20]Entertainment Weekly'sDevan Coggan noted that the trailer confirmed the multiverse's role in the film, including elements from the Raimi and Webb films,[6]while Ethan Anderton from/Filmcalled the trailer "nothing short of thrilling" since it confirmed many of the previous rumors about the film.[167]Austen Goslin atPolygonconversely felt much of what had been rumored did not get revealed in the trailer, feeling that the rumors were either false or Marvel was still intending to keep them a secret.[168]Anderton's colleague Joshua Meyer called the trailer "a doozy... packed with jaw-dropping moments" and noted how the film would be adapting the "One More Day" comic book storyline;[169]Newby had previously noted the apparent adaption of "One More Day" and "One Moment in Time" storylines following the reveal of Cumberbatch's casting.[103]Many commentators noted the possible teases of Spider-Man villains Sandman and the Lizard in the trailer as an indication of theSinister Sixforming in the film.[47][123][170]Vinnie Mancuso atColliderwas excited to see the return of Molina and the potential for Dafoe's involvement, but called it a "cheap pop" since it was doing "a disservice to the stories you're trying to tell in the present by reminding the audience how much better things used to be". He also felt the trailer played into "Marvel's ongoing reluctance to let Tom Holland's Spider-Man star in his own Spider-Man movies" since the trailer gave Parker "zero memorable moments" among all of its elements.[171]The trailer had 355.5million global views in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period. This surpassed the record ofAvengers: Endgame(289million views) and more than doubled the views for theSpider-Man: Far From Hometrailer (135 million). It also generated the largest 24-hour social media conversation volume of all-time globally with 4.5 million mentions, made up of 2.91 million in the United States, and 1.5 million internationally; these both exceededAvengers: Endgame'smentions (1.94 million in the United States, 1.38 million internationally).[172]
The second official trailer premiered at a fan screening at theRegal Sherman Oakstheater in Los Angeles on November 16, 2021.[173]Goslin felt the trailer "reveals the full extent of Marvel's Spider-Man multiverse",[174]while his colleague Matt Patches noted the missing appearance of Maguire's or Garfield's Spider-Man in the trailer but felt that it was "entirely possible the actors appear inNo Way Home".[175]Jason Robbins ofColliderwas disappointed by the trailer, saying it was "what we expected, but less", since it just showed the returning villains and had no confirmation of Maguire or Garfield or "further insight into the multiverse".[48]Some commentators said parts of the trailer appeared as though Maguire and Garfield had been edited out of the footage, such as a shot in which the Lizard appears to be struck by an invisible force.[176][177]On November 24, Sony began releasing several videos onTikTokas part of theirThe Daily Bugleviral marketingcampaign featuring Simmons and Rice.[178]In December 2021, the first minute of the film premiered exclusively onLate Night with Seth Meyers,[179]while anewsstandforThe Daily Buglewas set up in New York City in partnership withLiberty Mutualto promote the film.[180]Other marketing partners include the video gamesFortniteandPUBG Mobile, which featured special in-game Spider-Man themed props and costumes,Asus, whoseRepublic of Gamers(ROG) laptop is used by Ned in the film,Xiaomi,iQOO,Continental AG, andTampico Beverages.

Amelia Emberwing ofIGNgave the film 8 out of 10, stating that its "impact on the universe as a whole, as well as the overall emotional beats, all feel earned" while praising the performances of Dafoe, Molina, and Foxx.[246]Pete Hammond ofDeadline Hollywoodpraised Watts's direction and wrote, "Holland, Zendaya, and Batalon are a priceless trio, and the various villains and 'others' who pop in and out make this pure movie fun of the highest order. Fans will be in heaven".[247]Peter Debruge ofVarietypraised Garfield's and Maguire's performances and felt the film "provides enough resolution for the past two decades of Spider-Man adventures that audiences who've tuned out along the way will be rewarded for giving this one a shot".[33]Writing forDen of Geek, Don Kaye gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, for its action sequences, performances and chemistry of the cast, stating that "No Way Homechannels the entire spectrum of Spider-Man movies while setting the character on a course all his own at last".[248]Jennifer Bisset ofCNETpraised the action sequences, performances, and story, writing: "A Russo Brothers influence can almost be felt ushering Holland's third Spider-Man movie into new, weightier territory. If the character is to become the next Tony Stark, this is the way to etch a few more scars into a more interesting hero's facade. If you came for the biggest movie of the year, you'll definitely leave satisfied".[249]
Kevin MaherofThe Timesgave the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying that it was "As satisfying to watch as it is perilous to discuss", and described it as "a dynamite blast of smarty-pants postmodernism that never once abandons its emotional core."[250]Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiangave the film 3 out of 5 stars, praising Watts for "bringing back numerous baddies from the previous Spider-Man universes, delivering a propulsive, slickly choreographed adventure that will appease a broad fanbase this Christmas" but feeling that the script "lacks the expected fizz, that sense of shaggy fun struggling to break through a more robotic plot".[251]Kate Erbland ofIndieWiregave the film a "B−", feeling that Watts's work was "satisfying, emotional, and occasionally unsteady". She found that the script spent "far too long dwelling on the machinations of people and plans we already know, throwing in some awkward misdirection and simply delaying the inevitable".[252]The Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore felt that the inclusion of "multiversal mayhem" addressed the "Iron Man-ification of the character" that made Holland-centric films "least fun".[253]
CNN's Brian Lowry praised the humor and wrote, "What's already apparent, though, is that this movie was conceived to be savored and enjoyed. And in what has become an increasingly elusive phenomenon, that will include whoops and hollers from appreciative fans in theaters, whereSpider-Manwill first reveal its secrets, and then, more than likely, shows off its legs."[254]Richard RoeperofChicago Sun-Timesgave the film 3 out of 4 and praised the performances of Holland and Zendaya, writing: "There's nothing new or particularly memorable about the serviceable CGI and practical effects, but we remain invested in the outcome in large part because Holland remains the best of the cinematic Spider-Men, while Zendaya lends heart and smarts and warmth to every moment she's onscreen. We continue to root for these two to make it, even if the multiverse isn't always on their side."[255]In contrast, Bilge Ebiri ofVulturecalled the film "aggressively mediocre", criticizing the action, comedy and writing, but praising Dafoe – describing him as "once again gets to have some modest fun with his character's divided self" – and Garfield, calling him a "genuine delight" and naming his the film's best performance.[256]Hannah Strong ofLittle White Liescriticized the film for poor character development particularly in regard to Holland's Peter Parker character stating, "It's grating seeing the same character repeatedly fail to learn any lessons or show even a modicum of personal growth". The same review was also generally critical of the film prioritizing fan service over good storytelling.[257]
No Way Homewas nominated for anAcademy Award,[258]threeVisual Effects Societyawards (winning one),[259][260]aCostume Designers Guild Award,[261]aGolden Reel Award,[262]threeNickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards(winning all),[263]fiveCritics' Choice Super Awards(winning three),[264][265]and nineSaturn Awards(winning one),[266]among others. The film was disqualified from consideration for the75th British Academy Film Awardsbecause it was not made available on BAFTA's streaming service, reportedly due to Sony being concerned about piracy.[267]As part of the ceremony's "Oscars Fan Favorite" contest, the three Spider-Men teaming up was one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment,[268]and the film was the favorite to win the "Fan Favorite" film contest according to aMorning Consultsurvey.[269]It ended up finishing second and fourth, respectively.[270]
By August 2019, a fourth film in the franchise was in development alongsideNo Way Home.[56]In February 2021, Holland saidNo Way Homewas the final film under his contract but he hoped to continue playing Spider-Man in the future if asked.[271]That October, Holland saidNo Way Homewas being treated as "the end of a franchise" that began withHomecoming, with any additional solo films featuring the MCU Spider-Man characters to be different from the first trilogy of films and feature a tonal change.[27]A month later, Holland said he was unsure if he should continue making Spider-Man films and felt he would have "done something wrong" if he was still portraying the character in his thirties. He expressed interest in a film focusing on theMiles Moralesversion of Spider-Man instead. Despite this, Pascal hoped to continue working with Holland on future Spider-Man films.[73]Later in November, Pascal said there were plans for another trilogy of Spider-Man films starring Holland, with work on the first of those about to begin,[138]though Sony did not yet have official plans for further MCU Spider-Man films.[272]
Feige confirmed in December that he and Pascal, along with Sony and Disney, were actively beginning to develop the story for the nextSpider-Manfilm following Parker's "momentous decision" inNo Way Home. He promised that the partnership between Sony and Disney would not break down again as it did during the development ofNo Way Home.[273]In April 2022, following Watts' exit as director of Marvel Studios'The Fantastic Four: First Steps(2025) to take a break from blockbuster films,Deadline Hollywoodreported that Sony still expected Watts (along with Holland and Zendaya) to eventually return for the next MCUSpider-Manfilm.[274]Feige said in February 2023 that they had a story for the film with "big ideas" and that writers had begun work on it.[275]Pascal said at the end of May that the film was still in development but that work was put on hold because of the2023 Writers Guild of America strikethat began earlier that month, and that work would resume after the strike concluded.[276]By that time, Holland reiterated that the film was in early stages of development and that he had been involved in meetings about it, which were also put on hold because of the writers' strike.[277]In November 2023, Holland again noted he was part of discussions surrounding the film and reiterated his desire to return only if it would "do justice to the character".[278]Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed the MCU filmShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings(2021), was in early talks to direct the sequel by September 2024.[279]The next month, Holland said filming would begin in mid-2025,[280]and the film was scheduled for release on July 24, 2026, with Cretton's hiring confirmed.[281]In February 2025, the film's release was pushed back a week later to July 31, 2026.[282]In March 2025,Sadie Sinkjoined the cast of the film in an undisclosed role.[283]

On September 1, 1987,the Coca-Cola Companyannounced plans to spin offColumbia Pictures, which it had owned since 1982. Under this arrangement, Coca-Cola would sell its entertainment assets (Coca-Cola's Entertainment Business Sector) toTriStar Pictures, of which it owned 39.6%. Tri-Star would be renamed Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. (CPE), with Coca-Cola owning 49%, its shareholders owning 31%, and Tri-Star's shareholders owning 20%.[7][8]As part of a merger plan, the two television businesses, comprising Columbia/Embassy Television andTri-Star Television, merged altogether to form a new incarnation of the originalColumbia Pictures Television.[9]
The merger enabled three top Tri-Star executives, namely Arnold Messner, who ranTri-Star Telecommunications, Victor A. Kaufman, who ran the main Tri-Star Pictures studio, andScott Siegler, who ranTri-Star Televisionto stay on, while four of the Coca-Cola Entertainment Business Sector departed, namelyBarbara Corday, who ranColumbia/Embassy Televisionas president, Herman Rush and Peter Seale, who ranCoca-Cola Telecommunications, and Brian McGrath, who was the president of the Coca-Cola Entertainment Business Sector.[10]In early December 1987, former Coke EBS vice president Kenneth Lemberger exited the post to joinTri-Star Pictures, displacing Roger Faxon, who had joined Columbia Pictures as senior vice president of the studio.[11]
The merger was approved by shareholders on December 15, 1987, and it was completed two days later. Columbia and Tri-Star brands would be used as separate and autonomous production entities, and would be part of CPE whole, along with the prior assets, units and commitments of the former Coca-Cola Entertainment Business Sector, which included all feature, TV, home video, and pay cable operations as well as the Entertainment Sector's feature production deal withNelson Entertainmentand its investment inCastle Rock Entertainment, andTeleVentures; a company it continues to own, which was linked to three independent companies:Tri-Star Pictures,Stephen J. Cannell ProductionsandWitt/Thomas Productions.Merv Griffin Enterprisescontinue to function as a separate operation.[12]A new company was formed in early 1988 with the Tri-Star name to take over the studio's operations.[13]
In early January 1988, CPE announced that they would revive the Triumph branding for the new worldwide subsidiary,Triumph Releasing Corporation, which was functioned as a theatrical distributor, marketing and promotion forColumbiaandTri-Starfilms, and named Patrick N. Williamson as president of the unit and the company provided administrative services related to distribution of its films in North America, while internationally, would be responsible for the direction of each studio.[14]
On September 28, 1989,Sonyobtained an option to purchase all ofThe Coca-Cola Company's stock (approximately 54 million shares or 49% of the outstanding shares) in CPE for $27 per share.[15]The next day, Sony also announced that it reached an agreement with Guber-Peters Entertainment Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: GPEC; formerlyBarris Industries, Inc.) to acquire CPE for $200 million when Sony hiredPeter GuberandJon Petersto be its co-chairmen.[16]This was all led byNorio Ohga, who was the president and CEO of Sony during that time.[17]
The hiring of Guber and Peters by Sony to run Columbia was conflicted by a previous contract the producers had signed atWarner Bros.Time Warner's chairman,Steve Ross, threatened Sony with a lawsuit forbreach of contract. The lawsuit would be subsequently dropped when Sony sold half-interest inColumbia Houseand cable distribution rights to Columbia's feature films, TV movies, and miniseries to Warner Bros. That same agreement also saw Columbia sell its 35% interest in the Burbank Studios and acquiredLorimar Studios, previously theMGMlot, from Warner Bros.[18][19]
On October 31, 1989, Sony completed a friendlytakeoverbid for the rest of shares (51%) of CPE, which was a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: KPE), and acquired 99.3% of the common stock of the company. On November 8, 1989, Sony completed the acquisition by a "short-form" merger of its wholly owned subsidiary Sony Columbia Acquisition Corporation into CPE under theDelaware General Corporation Law.
