French Exitis a 2020blackcomedy-dramafilm[7][8]directed byAzazel Jacobs,[9]adapted byPatrick deWittfrom his2018 novel. It tells the story of a Manhattan heiress (Michelle Pfeiffer) who moves to Paris with her son (Lucas Hedges) with the little money they have left.
The film had its world premiere at theNew York Film Festivalon October 10, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States and Canada on February 12, 2021. It received mixed reviews from critics, although Pfeiffer's performance was praised and she was nominated for theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.
The bank seizes all the property of Manhattan heiress Frances Price several years after her husband's death. The close-to-penniless widow and her son, Malcolm, are left with few options. They sell everything in their house and relocate to a small apartment in Paris owned by Frances' sister, with the family cat, who happens to be Frances' reincarnated husband.
On the ship passage to Europe, Malcolm meets the fortune teller Madeleine, who predicts the death of a passenger, which occurs shortly afterwards. Madeleine recognizes the connection between the cat Small Frank and her deceased husband Franklin Price.
Once in Paris, Frances befriends her neighbor Mme. Reynard. After Frances tries to strangle Small Frank's cat, it escapes. Frances hires private investigator Julius to find Madeleine, who then holds a séance in which Franklin speaks to them. In flashbacks, the audience learns of the death of Franklin, whom Frances found lying dead on the bed with the cat sitting on it, but only informed the police days later. Malcolm questions his birth and Frances explains that Franklin left them both immediately afterwards.
Malcolm calls his fiancée Susan, whom he left behind in New York. However, she is back together with her previous fiancé Tom. The two visit Malcolm in the Paris apartment, as Susan has feelings for him after Malcolm's call. Tom leaves Paris after a confrontation and Susan stays with Malcolm.
In a second séance with Madeleine alone, Frances gets even with Franklin. Frances then walks through the streets of Paris, pursued by Small Frank.
The movie ends with the continuation of the flashback, in which Frances picks Malcolm up from school and tells him that from now on he will have to get along with her.

David Ehrlich ofIndieWiregave the film a "B−" and wrote: "Jacobs doesn't give us much else to hold on to. For all of its touching moments – and a series of closing grace notes that shimmer with a mystical flair missing from the rest of the film – this gossamer-thin adaptation is hampered by the same ambivalence that's haunted [Pfeiffer's character] Frances for so long."[19]
Pfeiffer received critical acclaim for her performance with many critics dubbing itOscar-worthy andVariety's Pete Dubruge writing that she delivered a role "for which she'll be remembered."[20][21][22][23][24]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
