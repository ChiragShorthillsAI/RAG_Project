The Forever Purgeis a 2021 Americanactionhorror filmdirected by Everardo Valerio Gout and written by series creatorJames DeMonaco, who also produced along withJason BlumandMichael Bay. Originally intended as the final installment, it serves as the fifth film in thePurgefranchiseand a sequel toThe Purge: Election Year. The film starsAna de la Reguera,Tenoch Huerta,Josh Lucas,Cassidy Freeman,Leven Rambin,Alejandro Edda, andWill Patton, and follows a group of people who attempt to escape the United States after an insurrectionist movement continues committing crime and murder nationwide after the 2049 Purge's ending.
Delayed from an original July 2020 date due to theCOVID-19 pandemic,The Forever Purgewas theatrically released on July 2, 2021, byUniversal Pictures. The film grossed $77 million worldwide against its $18 million budget and received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its performances and action sequences but criticism for its writing.[6]
In 2048, eight years afterCharlene Roan's presidential election, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) has been re-elected and have re-instituted the annual Purge withits original rules.Racial supremacyandnativismhave surged nationwide following their re-election, and many outside the ruling party are concerned that the upcoming Purge will inflict more damage on the country than the NFFA realizes. Mexican couple Juan and Adela illegally cross the border into Texas to build a new life near Austin, with Juan working as a farmhand on the Tucker family ranch while Adela works in town.
Ten months later, on the eve of the 2049 Purge, Juan and Adela join a migrant community behind a walled sanctuary with armed security to protect them. As the Purge begins, Adela witnesses a nationalist Purger group, who declare themselves to be the Purge Purification Force (PPF), intent on killing those people that they consider non-American. The migrant community survives the Purge with no incidents. Come morning, Juan and Adela return to their jobs, but both notice that many of their co-workers did not report to work. Adela is attacked by two self-proclaimed Forever Purgers, but she is rescued by her boss, Darius, before the police arrests both for killing their attackers.
Juan and fellow migrant co-worker T.T. discover that the Tucker family has been taken hostage by their white farmhands – Forever Purgers intending to take the ranch for themselves. Patriarch Caleb Tucker sacrifices himself and distracts the Purgers long enough for Juan and T.T. to rescue his son Dylan, Dylan's pregnant wife Cassie, and Dylan's sister Harper. As they drive off to search for Adela, the news confirms that civilians nationwide, connecting via social media, have declared a Forever Purge, opposing NFFA orders to stand down.
The group rescues Adela and Darius from Purgers. Darius stays behind to search for his family while the others escape from a burning Austin. At a gas station, they hear news reports that, to protect non-Purger civilians, Canada and Mexico have opened their borders for the next six hours. Following that, the borders will close and entry will be denied. The group decides to escape across the Mexican border at El Paso.
By the time the group arrives in a chaotic El Paso, the NFFA has invokedmartial lawacross the United States to contain the violence. Fighting through El Paso, Adela and Cassie are split from the group by military forces while Juan, T.T., Dylan, and Harper are captured by the PPF, with their Alpha Leader offering Dylan and Harper a chance to live if they kill T.T. and Juan. When they refuse, the Purgers murder T.T. just before the military intervenes, allowing the group to escape. However, the military is forced to withdraw from El Paso when more Purgers destroy their base. In response, the Canadian and Mexican governments announce the early closure of their borders, leaving those who gathered to cross them vulnerable to the Purgers.
Downtown, Adela protects Cassie from other Purgers, revealing that she and Juan had once been members of aself-defense groupwho trained them to fight against Mexican drug cartels. The diminished group reunites at a hidden safe house run by a local Native American tribe. The tribe's leader, Chiago, offers to transport everyone across the border as refugees. In the desert, Juan, Adela, and Dylan, with Chiago and his men, stand against Alpha and the PPF, to make time for the other refugees to escape. When their ammo runs out, the group draws the PPF in for a close fight with hand weapons. In the ensuing battle, the Purgers are killed and Alpha takes Adela hostage. However, Juan and Dylan work together to subdue and kill Alpha. The trio rejoins the others in a refugee camp across the Mexican border, where Dylan finds Harper and Cassie – and meets his newborn daughter.
News reports indicate that the NFFA has dispatched troops but is effectively being destroyed by the violence it no longer controls; more than two million Americans had crossed the Canadian and Mexican borders as refugees, and civilians in America are rallying to fight back against the Purgers.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 49% based on 161 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "The Forever Purgefails to fully engage with its most frighteningly timely themes, but the franchise remains largely—albeit bluntly—effective."[55]The site's audience consensus reads: "It's more predictable and less satisfying than some other Purge movies, but franchise fans looking for action will find it here."[56]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[57]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B−" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakreported 72% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 53% saying they would definitely recommend it.[52]
The Playlist's Nick Allen gave the film "D+," writing that it "looks like a cheap TV movie" and that it "displays all that makes these movies a failed experiment in blockbuster exploitation."[58]Reviewing forThe A.V. Club, Anya Stanley gave the film a "D" grade, and said: "InThe Forever Purge, we're told a story that a battered nation has heard a lot—a sermon of immigration and class warfare that's too heavy-handed to say anything its prospective audience hasn't been told on countless social media feeds over the last few years."[59]Rick Bentley's review inTribune News Servicecomplained of "a thinly veiled attempt to capitalize on the tensions currently gripping this country. The film’s deep dive into racism comes across as manipulative, trite and uninspired."[60]Dustin Chase wrote inThe Galveston Daily News, "The Forever Purgecomes to Texas to try to redefine stale franchise." Johnny Oleksinski's review inThe New York Poststated: "That idea was fun once, maybe even twice, but by the fifth outing the formula has given way to preachiness and predictability."[61]
Writing inThe Detroit News, Adam Gram stated: "The fifthPurgetalks a big game, employing all sorts of charged political words and theories, but doesn't do anything interesting with them."[62]Peter Vonder Haar's review inThe Houston Pressanalyzed: "The biggest problem withThe Forever Purgeis how it abandons the central conceit of the series. Previous movies focused on the protagonists' struggle to survive until the end of the Purge while simultaneously giving us wider looks at the phenomenon itself. Here, with the murderousness extending indefinitely, the characters' situation is indistinguishable from any of a thousand other shoot-em-ups."[63]Candace McMillan wrote inSeattle Refinedthat the film is "ultimately just a tiresome rehash of an overused adage. It's making an obvious statement about the callous attitude we as Americans take with those less fortunate, without accounting for the many complications and intricacies within our nation as well. But shock, awe, and letdown is all that's left of a franchise that's been bled dry."[64]Benjamin Lee's review inThe Guardianreads, "It’s more of the same in the latestPurgehorror, with more murderous mayhem and more half-baked attempts at social commentary.[65]
Matthew Mongale's review forThe Austin Chronicledismissed the film as "pretty much by the numbers",[66]while Nick Rogers inThe Midwest Film Journalcalled the film: "The creative exhaustion of a once-engaging franchise."[67]Ian Freer inEmpirewrote: "The fifthPurgeouting goes for broke and comes out wanting, working neither as political commentary nor horror-action-thriller."[68]Writing for the siteSlashfilm, Chris Evangelista states " The gunfire is constant, to the point where it becomes numbing. And after a while, you somehow grow bored with all the carnage. There's no emotional heft attached to anything happening here; we barely even care about the main characters...None of this is that thrilling, andThe Forever Purgeoften plays like a film cobbled together from reshoots and studio notes.[69]
AlthoughThe Forever Purgewas intended to be the final installment of the franchise, producerJason Blumstated in June 2021 that he intends to make additionalPurgefilms, and that he is working on convincingJames DeMonacoto continue the story.[70]In July 2021, DeMonaco confirmed his concept for a sixth film to focus onFrank Grillo's character Leo Barnes fromAnarchyandElection Year, and to incorporate a worldwide Purge, a concept developed for a potential third season ofThe Purgetelevision series, which was scrapped.[71][72]

Tenoch Huerta, recognized for his distinguished acting career, also holds an acclaimed role as an anti-racism activist, spurred by his personal encounters with racial prejudice and systemic discrimination.
Huerta formerly collaborated with Poder Prieto, a Mexican collective striving to alter societal perceptions of Brown individuals. His contributions were largely focused on advocating for the accurate and favorable representation of Brown people in various mediums. Furthermore, the collective aimed to redefine the term "Prieto," traditionally a racial slur, by infusing it with a positive context.
Huerta has persistently emphasized the significance of diverse and accurate representation of people of color in film and television, asserting that varied storytelling contributes to authentic cultural narratives.
In 2022, Huerta expanded his activism reach by authoring the book Orgullo Prieto (Black Pride).[14]The book delves into the racist constructs in Mexico and integrates personal narratives to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue.
The same year, Huerta addressedUNESCO's Global Forum against Racism and Discrimination, amplifying his insights on activism and media representation on a global platform.[15]His engagement with UNESCO extended to 2023, where he connected with over 2000 students, underscoring the imperative of recognizing privilege, challenging prevailing systems, and the potential of collective action to effect change.[16]
Huerta was also a participant in a dialogue convened by theUnited Nations' Antiracism Working Group,[17]a discussion held to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. His involvement epitomizes his commitment to confronting racism, an issue now addressed with increased urgency by institutions like the United Nations, largely due to the global resonance of movements like Black Lives Matter.[18]
In June 2023, Huerta was accused of abuse by musician and activist Maria Elena Ríos. Ríos accused him of being a sexual predator and that the Mexico-based activist organization Poder Prieto was deliberately protecting him.[19][20]Huerta has denied the allegations and cited them as the reason for leaving an upcoming Netflix project.[21][22]In 2024, almost a year after the accusations, no judicial complaints have been made.
In August 2024, the actor publicly addressed the allegations against him. Huerta expressed his pain and dismay over the claims, emphasizing that they had significantly impacted his mental health while maintaining his innocence.[23][24]
Following the allegations against him, the actor has received threats of extortion that he has legally reported.[25]
Huerta won Best Actor at the Short Short Film Festival in Mexico City for his performance inAlonso Ruizpalacios'Café paraíso.[26]He has also received five nominations for theAriel Award, winningBest Actorfor his role inDías de Graciain 2012.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
