No Man of Godis a 2021 Americanmystery filmdirected byAmber Sealeyand written byC. Robert Cargill, under the pseudonym of Kit Lesser. The film starsElijah Wood,Luke Kirby,Aleksa PalladinoandRobert Patrick. It is based on real life transcripts selected from conversations between serial killerTed Bundyand FBI Special Agent Bill Hagmaier that happened between 1984 and 1989, and the complicated relationship that formed between them during Bundy's final years on death row.
The film had its world premiere at theTribeca Film Festivalon June 11, 2021.[4][5]It was released in theaters, onvideo on demandand digital in the United States on August 27, 2021, byRLJE Films.[6][7][8]
In 1985, when a select group of special agents of the FBI'sBehavior Science Unitpass ondeath rowinmate Ted Bundy as a case study, newcomer Bill Hagmaier accepts the challenge while knowing Bundy's distrust of theFBI. Through shared letters, Bundy shows interest, and Hagmaier travels to theFlorida State Prisonfor an interview. Bundy and Hagmaier examinepornographyanddetective magazinesas a probable catalyst ofserial killers. Bundy coaxes personal information from Hagmaier about his life to establish trust. Bundy equates investigators to fishermen. The deeper their fishing line goes, the harder it is to catch a killer. He says that one day he may take Hagmaier under the water to see how deep it goes.
Bill meets with Ted again in 1986. Ted is shown crime scene photos of theGreen River caseand gives his assessment on the patterns of the elusive murderer. Through Bill's calculating questioning, Ted discloses information about his own patterns.Â Ted asks Bill if he could kill someone. Bill explains that, due to his being anFBI agent, it could happen, but this answer is not what Ted was seeking. Back inQuantico, Virginia, Unit ChiefRoger Depuecautions Bill not to get too close to someone like Bundy.
While sharing stories about their children during their next meeting in 1987, Ted senses that Bill is getting too deep in his mind and taunts him to speculate on what he would do if he escaped from prison. Bill describes it with a good amount of accuracy and Ted verbally attacks Bill, then settles down and begins to disclose more intimate details of his life and what may have led him to murder but dispels the myths about him. He reveals that he and Bill could easily change places, which deeply afflicts Bill.
As Ted is lobbying for astay of executionin 1989,Governor Martinezsigns thedeath warrant, and Ted is to die byelectrocutionin seven days. Hearing of the execution, the media and a crowd begin to mass outside the prison. Ted is now ready to confess his crimes but will only speak with Bill. Though Bill is supervising interviews with investigators from several states, he arrives to find Ted's civil attorney, Carolyn Lieberman, taking charge. Ted believes holding back certain information could overturn the execution, buying him more time for further details.[9]Carolyn doesn't want Bill's influence as an FBI agent at the interviews but Ted insists he attends, calling Bill his best friend. Bill urges Ted not to play games with the governor and asks how many women he killed. Ted confesses to 30 deaths. At the interviews, Ted is evasive with his answers, only divulging information to a few murders. Ignoring Bill's conditions that no media is to be involved, Carolyn schedules Ted to interview withDr. James Dobson, an influential evangelical Christian author and psychologist, whom she believes will help with apardon. After the interview, Dobson reveals to Carolyn the governor was never going to grant the pardon.
A day before the execution, thewardeninforms Bill that a last-minute sanityhearingwill take place. While multiple consultations will be conducted, the decision to proceed with the execution will rest entirely on Bill'stestimonyto apsychiatric board, which ultimately declares Ted sane. Outside the prison, the spirited crowd grows in anticipation, while inside Bill assists Ted in writing a letter to his mother. Bill asks to be taken under the water. With harsh details, Ted exposes how he lured and killed a victim, which leaves Bill overwhelmed and in tears.
That night, Ted thanks Bill for being a friend to him. Ted suddenly threatenssuicide, but Bill is hardened by theultimatum. Ted has an outburst of desperation, asking why it's happening to him, still showing no remorse for his crimes. Infuriated, Bill exclaims his victims didn't prepare for death. Ted takes to his knees in prayer. As Bill prepares to leave, Ted asks him if he understands why he killed. Bill tells him, "Because you wanted to." Just moments before the execution, Bill learns he has been removed as a witness to the execution and others will take his place. Left alone in the warden's office, Bill makes a phone call to his family. While Bill is speaking with his son, the crowd outside erupts in cheers as Bundy is declared dead.
The film's writer Cargill, when on the horror-comedy podcast,Pod of Madness, discussed why he wanted to write the film. He explained, "There have been a lot of movies and a lot of media made about Ted Bundy, and one of the things that bugged me a lot was that it's all kind of selling the myth of Ted Bundy and kind of glorifying him in a way. And the deeper you dig into the story you realize there's nothing to mystify here, there's nothing amazing about him."[10]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 80 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "No Man of Godmay not offer much in terms of an original take on this oft-told story, but excellent performances make it tough to turn away."[11]According toMetacritic, which sampled 21 critics and calculated a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, the film received "general favorable" reviews.[12]

Christopher Robert Cargill(born September 8, 1975) is an American screenwriter, novelist, podcast host, and former film critic known under the pseudonyms Massawyrm (onAin't It Cool News) and Carlyle (onSpill.com). Cargill currently resides inAustin, Texas, with his wife.[1]He is known for writing the filmsSinister(2012),Sinister 2(2015),Doctor Strange(2016), andThe Black Phone(2021). He is a frequent writing collaborator ofScott Derrickson.
Cargill was raised in a military family, growing up on army bases around the United States. He held several jobs prior to writing, including video store clerk and travel agent.[citation needed]
Cargill wrote his first article in 2000, when he volunteered to write a review of the movieCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonfor a website called "Guerilla Films."  His article managed to get the highest amount of traffic of over 50,000 hits, "a HUGE deal" at the time, which secured him the job to write more reviews.[citation needed]
While working for Guerilla Films, Cargill began spending time with Ain't It Cool News' Eric Vespe (AKA 'Quint' on the site), which landed him a job on Ain't It Cool's "Indie Indie Column," a previously abandoned post.[2]He began writing for Ain't It Cool News under the name Massawyrm in May 2001.[3]His first review for the blog was of Jon Favreau's movie, Made.[3]During his work as a blogging critic, Cargill met various directors, which occasionally led to small roles in independent productions.[4]In 2011, he toldJordan Gass-PoorÃ©with Slackerwood that it was getting "tougher and tougher" to write movie reviews because of his relationships with people in the movie industry.[3]"I've always had a strict code about writing about films made by people I'm friends with," said Cargill. "It's harder to write objectively about film without people feeling that you're being biased."[3]Besides his work for Ain't It Cool News and his involvement with Spill.com, he also did freelance work forFilm.com[5]andHollywood.com(the site that owned Spill.com).[1]
I considered every film another day of classes and writing a review a home work assignment and it was graded by everyone who wrote nasty comments on the internet.
Having wanted to be a fiction writer from a young age, Cargill considered every film he reviewed and its feedback as a learning experience. According to an interview withThe Austin Chroniclehe compared it to "a strenuous, endless crash courseâmaybe even a master classâin what does and doesn't work in a story."[4][6]
On the 26th of February 2013, Cargill released his first novel,Dreams and Shadows, anurban fantasystory of folklore and mythology, which also follows three modern characters from childhood to adulthood.[7]Subsequent novels includedSea of RustandDay Zero.
The idea for his first film came to fruition when he met up with a fan and friendScott Derricksonat a bar in Las Vegas where he pitched his idea forSinister. Derrickson, showing great interest in this concept, contacted producerJason Blumwho particularly liked the simplicity of the concept and understood the urge to make it as fast as possible before it could be made by anyone else. Shooting of the movie started in September 2011, 6 months after[2]and was first screened atSouth by Southwest. In an interview with Film.com, Cargill stated that his days as a film critic were over for the time being due to his success and dedication to his new-found career path. "I may pop in every once in a while and write up reviews, but ever since I was a child, I've wanted to be a fiction writer, and now I have the chance to do it in both formats that I am in love with."[2]Sinister was released to positive reviews with many praising the snuff film segments, directing, cinematography, atmosphere, and acting. It was a box office success grossing over $87 million on a $3 million budget. Both Cargill and Derrickson returned as writers forSinister 2(2015), which was directed byCiaran Foy.[8]Unlike its predecessor, the sequel was critically panned. Many criticisms were aimed at the overuse of jump scares, horror cliches, story, and heavy amounts of excessive violence and gore. Cargill and Derrickson were working on a movie adaptation of theDeus Exvideo games.[9][10]They both left the project afterKevin Feigehired them to work on a film adaptation ofDoctor Strangein 2014, which would become the 14th film in theMarvel Cinematic Universe.[11][12]
Cargill, along with Derrickson andJon Spaihts, worked on the script for Marvel'sDoctor Strange(2016).[13]The film received positive reviews from critics and audiences, With praise being aimed towards the acting, special effects, and musical score. It grossed over $677 million worldwide. Cargill and Derrickson were set to return forDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madnessbut left due to "creative differences".[14]Sam Raimiwas hired to helm the project after they left.[15]More recently, the writing duo of Derrickson and Cargill signed a deal with Blumhouse Television.[16]
Cargill, under the pseudonym of Kit Lesser, wrote a biopic about FBI agent William Hagmaier (played byElijah Wood) and his relationship with serial killerTed Bundy.[17]"There have been a lot of movies and a lot of media made about Ted Bundy, and one of the things that bugged me a lot was that it's all kind of selling the myth of Ted Bundy and kind of glorifying him in a way," Cargill told Jordan Gass-Poore, the host of the horror-comedy podcast, Pod of Madness. "And the deeper you dig into the story you realize there's nothing to mystify here, there's nothing amazing about him." The film was released in 2021 asNo Man of God.
Derrickson's departure from directingDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madnessled him toThe Black Phone, a project he and Cargill had already planned on making. It is an adaptation ofJoe Hill'sshort story of the same name. The film premiered atFantastic Feston September 25, 2021, and was theatrically released byUniversal Pictureson June 24, 2022. It has grossed $157.2 million and received generally positive reviews from critics for its performances and faithfulness to the source material. It received praise from Joe Hill. In October 2023, the sequel was officially announced by Universal Pictures with a scheduled release date of June 27, 2025.[18]The following month, it was reported that Hawke, Thames, McGraw, Davies and Mora would reprise their roles in the sequel. Derrickson and Cargill also returned to write the script.[19]
Cargill and Derrickson will also team up to write the script forThe Outer Limits, a movie based on the influential 1960s television showof the same name.  The film, produced by MGM, will be adapted from a single episode of the classic show, "Demon with a Glass Hand."[20]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (FullÂ list...)
AmÃ©lie of Leuchtenberg(1812â1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor PedroÂ I. She was the fourth child ofEugÃ¨ne de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with AmÃ©lie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria AmÃ©liawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and AmÃ©lie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of AmÃ©lie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich DÃ¼rck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
