Annetteis a 2021musicalromanticdramafilm directed byLeos Caraxin his English-language directorial debut. The film's story and music were written byRon Mael,Russell Mael, with lyrics co-written by Carax. The film, which has been described as arock opera, follows a stand-up comedian (Adam Driver) and his opera singer wife (Marion Cotillard), and how their lives are changed when they have their first child.Simon Helbergand Devyn McDowell also appear.
Aninternational co-productionbetweenFrance,Germany,Switzerland,Belgium, theUnited States,MexicoandJapan,Annettewas premiered on 6 July 2021 as the opening film at the2021 Cannes Film Festival,[8]where Carax received theBest Directoraward. It was released in France the next day byUGC Distributionand in the United States on 20 August byAmazon Studios. The film received positive reviews from critics.
After a swift courtship, provocative stand-up comedian Henry McHenry publicly declares his engagement to world-famous soprano Ann Desfranoux. Shortly afterwards, Ann gives birth to their daughter Annette, portrayed by a woodenmarionettepuppet. The marriage becomes rocky when Henry begins to take care of Annette while Ann's career flourishes and takes her overseas.
Later, Ann has dreams about six women who come forward with allegations of past abuse at the hands of Henry and nightmares about Henry almost killing her. Back home, Henry's career begins to spiral, exacerbated by an onstage meltdown, and he comes to resent Ann's continued success. The two schedule a private cruise with the goal of mending their relationship. However, the cruise ends in disaster when Ann falls overboard during a stormy night after Henry drunkenly forces her to waltz with him. After realizing that his wife is dead, Henry and Annette get to an island using a lifeboat. There, both fall asleep, when Ann's ghost suddenly appears and gives her voice to infant Annette as a form of revenge, so she can haunt Henry.
Though cleared of legal suspicion for Ann's death, Henry finds himself at a financial dead-end without her income. He contacts Ann's former accompanist, revealing Annette's singing voice and suggesting they use her gift for a musical act. The accompanist reluctantly agrees, having been in love with Ann, and as they tour, Baby Annette becomes a worldwide hit. Henry continues to drink heavily and stay out late, haunted by memories of Ann. One night, when returning home, Henry overhears Annette singing a rendition of “We Love Each Other So Much”, which was Ann and Henry's song. He confronts the accompanist, who implies that he is Annette's real father. In retaliation, Henry drowns him in the backyard pool, witnessed by Annette from her bedroom window. Henry plans one final performance at the "Hyperbowl" halftime show, but Annette refuses to sing, instead declaring, "Daddy kills people," to the packed stadium. Henry is tried and convicted.
A few years later, Annette visits her father in prison. Annette, suddenly portrayed by a living human girl, denies his attempts of reconciliation and even blames her mother for using her to get revenge. She tells him that he now has "nothing to love". After the living Annette leaves, the Annette puppet lies lifeless on the floor.

O. Scottdescribed it as a "highly cerebral, formally complex film about unbridled emotion" that "masters its own paradoxes. [...] A work of art propelled by a skepticism about where art comes from and why we value it the way we do. A fantastical film that attacks some of our culture’s most cherished fantasies. Utterly unreal and completely truthful."[32]
"So May We Start" was shortlisted for theAcademy Award for Best Original Song,[41]but not nominated.

UGCis a cinema operator inFranceandBelgium, operating 57 cinemas as of 2022. It is also a major film production and distribution company.
UGC was originally an exclusively French operator, privatized in 1971, who merged with several regional cinema companies running 22 cinemas.[1]The name originally stood forUnion Générale Cinématographique, but today only the initials are used. The company is focused on the business side of the film business and French-dubbed versions, showing little interest in the screening of artistic cinema, on the contrary to Pathé and Gaumont cinemas, except in some UGC Paris theatres where the programming is very diversified and includes both subtitled and dubbed versions. Out of Paris, in some cities like Nantes, Bordeaux or Lyon, a part of this diversified programming does exist, but mostly UGC cinemas are like Pathé and Gaumont cinemas. Its competitors includePathé Cinémas,Cinéville,CGRandKinepolis Group.
In 2016,Kinepolis Grouphad sold the four Belgian Utopolis cinemas it had happened to acquire when it had taken overUtopia Groupto UGC.[2]UGC had already owned three Belgian cinemas (one inAntwerpand two inBrussels) and now more than doubled that number, adding one cinema each inAarschot,Lommel,MechelenandTurnhout.
As of January 2022, UGC had:

The 4 multiplexes consisted of 66 screens and 15,000 total seats.
In Spain UGC had 5 multiplexes: three inMadridand one each inValladolidandCadiz.
Odeon and UCI Cinema Grouppurchased in 2011 the UGC Cinemas in Italy which are integrated in UCI Cinemas Italy and in Spain which were integrated in the local chain of cinemasCinesa.[3]
UGC was formerly also a leading UK cinema owner following the purchase ofRichard Branson'sVirgin CinemaGroup, which it purchased in October 1999.[4]In December 2004, the business was sold to Blackstone Group and joined with Cine-UK to trade asCineworld.[5]UGC's chain in the UK and Ireland consisted of:

TheRadio-télévision belge de la Communauté française("Belgian Radio-television  of the French Community"), shortened toRTBF(branded asrtbf.be), is apublic service broadcasterfor theFrench-speaking Community of Belgium. Its counterpart in theFlemish Communityis the Dutch-languageVRT(Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie), and in theGerman-speaking Communityit isBRF(Belgischer Rundfunk).
The RTBF operates five television channels (La Une,Tipik,La Trois,Arte BelgiqueandTipikVision) together with a number of radio channels, includingLa Première,RTBF Mix,VivaCité,Musiq'3,Classic 21, andTipik.
The organisation's headquarters inBrussels, which is shared withVRT, is sometimes referred to colloquially asReyers.[1][2][3]This comes from the name of the avenue where the RTBF/VRT's main building is located, theBoulevard Auguste Reyers/Auguste Reyerslaan.
Originally named the Belgian National Broadcasting Institute (French:INR, Institut national belge de radiodiffusion;Dutch:NIR, Belgisch Nationaal Instituut voor de Radio-omroep), the state-owned broadcasting organisation was established by law on 18 June 1930,[citation needed]and from 1938 was housed in theFlagey Building, also known as theRadio House, a purpose-built building in the"paquebot" styleofArt Decoarchitecture.[4][5]
On 14 June 1940, the INR was forced to cease broadcasting as a result of the German invasion. The German occupying forces, who now oversaw its management, changed the INR's name toRadio Bruxelles. A number of INR personnel were able to relocate to theBBC's studios in London from where they broadcast asRadio Belgique/Radio Belgiëunder theOffice de Radiodiffusion Nationale Belge(RNB) established by theBelgian government in exile's Ministry of Information.[citation needed]
At the end ofthe warthe INR and the RNB coexisted until 14 September 1945, when a Royal Decree merged the two and restored the INR's original mission. The INR was one of 23 broadcasting organisations that founded theEuropean Broadcasting Unionin 1950. Television broadcasting from Brussels began in 1953, with two hours of programming each day. In 1960 the INR was subsumed into the RTB (Radio-Télévision Belge) and moved to new quarters at the Reyers building in 1967. The RTB's first broadcast in colour,Le Jardin Extraordinaire(a gardening and nature programme), was transmitted in 1971. Two years later, the RTB began broadcastingnewsin colour.[citation needed]
In 1977, broadcasting became a concern for Belgium'slanguage communities, rather than the national government as a whole. Accordingly, the French-language section of the RTB became the RTBF (Radio-Télévision Belge de la Communauté française) and a second television channel was set up with the nameRTbis.[6]In 1979RTbisbecameTélé 2.[7]Along with French channelsTF1,Antenne 2,FR3and Swiss channelTSR, the RTBF jointly established the European French-speaking channelTV5in 1984. On 21 March 1988,Télé 2becameTélé 21.[7]On 27 September 1989 a joint-venture company of the RTBF andVivendiwas set up with the nameCanal Plus TVCF, which subsequently becameCanal Plus Belgiquein May 1995. In 1993,Télé 21was replaced byArte/21andSports 21.[citation needed]
In mid-January 2010, the RTBF adopted the new branding of RTBF.be in its main logo.[8]The change was made because of the growing importance of new media; the ".be" suffix stressed those new developments.
On 11 June 2013, the RTBF was one of the few European public broadcasters to join in condemning the closure ofGreece's public broadcaster,ERT.[citation needed]
By 2011, the analogue systems for RTBF.be were planned to be phased out forWallonia.
On 13 December 2006, at 20:21CET(19:21UTC), the RTBF replaced an edition of its regular current affairs programmeQuestions à la Unewith afake special news reportin which it was claimed thatFlandershad proclaimed independence, effectively dissolving the Belgian state. The programme had been preceded by a caption reading "This may not be fiction", which was repeated intermittently as a subtitle to the images on the screen. After the first half-hour of the 90-minute broadcast, however – by which point RTBF.be's response line had been flooded with calls – this was replaced with a caption reading "This is fiction".
The video featured images of news reporters standing in front of theFlemish Parliament, while Flemish separatists waved theflag of Flandersbehind them. Off to the side, Francophone and Belgian nationalists were waving Belgian flags. The report also featured footage ofKing AlbertandQueen Paolagetting on a military jet toCongo, a former Belgian colony.
The RTBF justified the hoax on the grounds that it raised the issue ofFlemish nationalism, but others felt that it raised the issue of how much the public can trust the press.
As of August 2024[update], theMedia and Journalism Research Centerevaluated the RTBF to be "Independent State Funded and State Managed/Owned Media" under itsState Media Matrix.[9][10]
In September 2024,French Community of BelgiumMinister of MediaJacqueline Galantcriticized RTBF for airing a segment titled "How to be less racist?", which in her opinion was biased and lacked pluralism. Galant was in turn criticized by theEuropean Federation of Journalistsfor alleged editorial interference.[11][12]
RTBF notably caused controversy in January 2025 by delaying the broadcast ofDonald Trump'ssecond inaugural speechby two minutes, in order to prevent the live broadcast of statements inciting hatred. The decision was condemned ascensorshipbyReformist Movementparty leaderGeorges-Louis Bouchezand prompted an investigation from Galant.[13][14][15]
Television channels are transmitted:
TheVideo on demand(VOD) offer of the RTBF is available on several platforms:
The RTBF broadcasts radio channels in either analogue format (FMand digital format (usingDABandDVB-T). All channels are also broadcast live over the Internet.
They also have aTMCservice transmitted onClassic 21.

Linked page for 'Leos Carax' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leos_Carax):
Alex Christophe Dupont[1][2](born 1960),[3]best known asLeos Carax(French:[leɔskaʁaks]), is a Frenchfilm director, critic and writer. Carax is noted for his poetic style and his tortured depictions of love. His first major work wasBoy Meets Girl(1984), and his notable works includeLes Amants du Pont-Neuf(1991),Pola X(1999),Holy Motors(2012) andAnnette(2021). For the last, he won theCannes Film Festival Award for Best Directorat the2021 Cannes Film Festival. His professional name is an anagram of his real name, 'Alex', and 'Oscar'.
Carax was born Alex Christophe Dupont inSuresnes,Hauts-de-Seine, acommunein thesuburbs of Paris, France.[1]His mother is American and his father is French.[citation needed]
Carax's film career began with a series of short films, and as a film critic, before he releasedBoy Meets Girl(1984), which established his reputation for a mature visual style. It also saw the first grouping of Carax withDenis LavantandcinematographerJean-Yves Escoffier. His next film wasMauvais Sang(literallyBad Bloodbut mostly known asThe Night is Young) in 1986, which alienated some of his audience, but continued to explore the complexities of love in the modern world, this time through a darker, more criminal viewpoint. The work was clearly an homage toFrench New Wavecinema, and his use of such actresses asJuliette Binochewas a tribute to his influences, especiallyJean-Luc Godard. The film was entered into the37th Berlin International Film Festival.[4]
Five years later, Carax returned to directing withLes Amants du Pont-Neuf, an expensive undertaking as Parisian authorities granted him only 10 days to film onPont Neuf. His initial reaction to the problems of filming on a public bridge had been to construct a model of the bridge in the community ofLansargues, inSouthern France. But on the first day of filming Lavant severely injured his thumb, which pushed the movie back by a month. Subsequent financial difficulties further pushed filming over a much longer period than intended. The movie was released to critical acclaim and opened the door for Carax to enter more experimental waters with his fourth feature,Pola X(1999), an adaptation ofHerman Melville'sPierre: or, The Ambiguities.

Ronald David Mael(born August 12, 1945)[1]is an American musician, songwriter, composer and record producer.[2]He is the keyboard player and principal songwriter in the bandSparks, which he founded with vocalist, occasional songwriter and younger brotherRussell Maelin 1971. Mael is known for his quirky and idiosyncratic approach to songwriting,[3]his intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style and for his deadpan and low key, scowling demeanour onstage often remaining motionless over his keyboard in sharp contrast to Russell's animated and hyperactive frontman antics. Ron Mael is also noted for his conservative clothes and distinctive moustache. The Mael brothers are the founders of Lil' Beethoven Records.
Ronald David Mael was born on August 12, 1945, inCulver City, California. The Mael brothers grew up inPacific Palisades– an affluent beach neighbourhood of Los Angeles – with their father, Meyer Mael,[4][5]who was a graphic designer and caricaturist for theHollywood Citizen-News,[6][7]and their mother, Miriam (née Moskowitz), a librarian. Both Meyer and Miriam were the children ofJewishimmigrants, Meyer from Russia and Austria and Miriam from Poland;[8][9]despite this, a source affiliated with the brothers' 2021 documentary stated that they "weren't raised, nor do they identify as Jewish", and the documentary does not mention their Jewish heritage.[10]Much of the Mael brothers' initial inspiration came from their father taking them to the cinema as children, where they developed an interest in film, visual arts and narrative. Meyer died when Mael was 11.[11]
After being educated atPalisades High School, both brothers enrolled atUCLA;[12]Ron began a course in cinema and graphic arts in 1963 while Russell studied theatre arts and filmmaking between 1966 and 1968.[13]It was during their time at UCLA the brothers formed their first band, The Urban Renewal Project, who recorded a series of demos in 1967.
Ron Mael plays the keyboards and synthesizers and writes most of the songs for Sparks. When the band hit the peak of its popularity in the 1970s, he was well known for his strange appearance, often remaining motionless over his keyboard in sharp contrast to Russell's animated and hyperactive frontman antics. Ron's conservative clothes and unfashionable,Charlie Chaplin-esquetoothbrush moustacheattracted much attention, as does his currentpencil moustache. Onstage, Ron alternates between playing the keyboard and engaging in comic mime routines, often in connection with projections on backdrop. A feature of a live Sparks show is Ron's dance routine, which he continues to perform into his late 70s.
For the first two albums with Halfnelson/Sparks, Mael played aWurlitzer electronic piano, but found that it did not stand up to road use because the metal reeds broke frequently. When Sparks relocated to the UK, Mael began using anRMI Electra-Piano, played through anEchoplextape echo unit, and this distinctive sound featured prominently on their breakthrough single "This Town Ain't Big Enough For The Both Of Us", the albumsKimono My HouseandPropagandaand in their live shows. Since 1981, he has used variousYamahaandRolandkeyboards and synthesizers live. That year, he altered the Roland logo on the back of hisRoland Jupiter-8to read "Ronald", which he has done on all of his keyboards since then.[14]He currently uses aYamaha Motif XF8.
The pair appeared as themselves in the 1977disaster filmRollercoaster, performing live. They also appeared in episode twenty-two of season six of theGilmore Girls.
In a rare non-Sparks related musical turn, Ron and Russell Mael wrote the lyrics toTelex's1982 album,Sex.
In June 2018,Edgar Wrightannounced he would be makinga documentaryon the cultpop-rockband Sparks.[15]He had covered the band's concert in London in May at O2 Forum Kentish Town. This concert would also be a part of the documentary.[16][17]The film,The Sparks Brothers,  had its world premiere at the2021 Sundance Film Festivalon January 30, 2021.[18]
In 2017, a reviewer noted that while the brothers' biographies recount an LA childhood in which they surfed and were both models for mail order catalogues, their private lives are otherwise almost entirely unknown. "Well, we're in good company withBob Dylan", was their reported response. "We feel the less you do know, it keeps the mythology and the image in a better position." Even to the question of whether they have partners or spouses, they refused to give an indication, insisting that "the vagueness is more interesting than the reality."[19]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
