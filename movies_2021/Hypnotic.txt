The Guardian'sBenjamin Lee gave the film 1/5 stars, writing, "For someone under the spell, an hour can feel like a minute, an enviable experience for anyone actually watchingHypnotic, an unrewarding slog being fished out of the garbage for Halloween no tricks or treats, just tripe."[6]Christy Lemire, writing forRogerEbert.com, gave it 1/4 stars. She said the film "only occasionally rises to the potential of its wild premise, thanks mostly to a crazy-eyed, licking-his-chops performance from Jason O'Mara. He knows exactly what kind of material he's working with here. For the most part, though,Hypnoticis dopey, but never quite dopey enough."[7]
G. Allan Johnson of theSan Francisco Chroniclewas more positive, saying the film was "the kind of made-for-cable-level movie where a pedestrian script... with the usual horror cliches is elevated by strong acting, no-nonsense direction and a couple of neat twists."[8]Lena Wilson ofThe New York Timeswrote, "While the resulting cat-and-mouse dynamic is predictable, particularly if you've ever watched aLifetimemovie,Hypnotictakes its cartoonishness to admirable heights."[9]
