In 1973, nine-year-old JR Maguire and his mother Dorothy move back in with her parents onLong Island. Abandoned by his deadbeat father Johnny, a radio DJ known as "the Voice", JR grows up with his mother's working class family. He finds a surrogate father in his uncle Charlie, the owner of a local bar, "TheDickens".[2]
JR often listens to the Voice on the radio, and Johnny calls with plans to take him to a baseball game, but fails to show up and later flees the state. Imparting life lessons to JR, Charlie shares his love of reading and encourages him to become a writer, while Dorothy is determined that her son will have the college education she never had. Though her own well-educated father never made anything of his life, she insists that JR will one day attendHarvardorYaleand become a lawyer.
Johnny makes a brief visit, beating up Charlie when he heckles him for his absence in JR's life. Confronting a school psychologist for exploiting JR to hit on Dorothy, Charlie is impressed by his nephew's writing. JR's grandfather accompanies him to a father-and-son breakfast, and explains that Dorothy is having her cancerousthyroidremoved. She recovers, and JR's knack for word puzzles earns him a spot in Charlie and his friends' bowling league.
As a teenager, JR has an interview at Yale and meets a priest on the train toNew Haven. He is admitted to the university, to his family's delight, and later brings his roommates home to meet Charlie, having their first of-age drinks at The Dickens. JR strikes up a romance with his classmate Sidney, who brings him home toWestport, Connecticut. After sneaking him up to her room for the night, she reveals that she is seeing someone else, leading to an uncomfortable breakfast with her "lower-upper-middle class" parents before he departs.
Continuing his studies, JR encounters the same priest on the train, and is unsuccessful in winning Sidney back. Graduating in 1986, he receives one of his father's sporadic phone calls. JR presents his mother with a class ring, but disappoints her by eschewing law school and moving home to work on his novel. Ignoring his friend Wesley's advice, he continues to pursue Sidney with guidance from Charlie, and is hired as a trainee atThe New York Times.
Learning that Sidney has married her college boyfriend, JR is let go from the Times. Charlie is briefly hospitalized, and encourages JR to incorporate his recent setbacks into his novel. On Charlie's advice, JR finds his father inNorth Carolina, but realizes that he remains an abusive alcoholic. Johnny assaults his girlfriend and JR has him arrested, finally standing up to his father.
Returning home, where his mother has found a new job, JR moves toManhattan, but not before Charlie gives him his car. Charlie and his drinking buddies see his nephew off, and JR is determined to prove himself as a writer. During the credits, young JR spends a day at the beach with Charlie and his friends.

William J. Monahan(born November 3, 1960) is an Americanscreenwriterandnovelist. His second produced screenplay, an adaptation ofAndrew Lau's 2002 gangster filmInfernal Affairs, earned him aWriters Guild of America AwardandAcademy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.Martin Scorsesedirected it under the titleThe Departed(2006).
Monahan was born inDorchester, Boston. He attended theUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst, where he studiedElizabethanandJacobean drama.[1]He moved toNew York Cityand contributed to thealternative weeklynewspaperNew York Pressand the magazinesTalk,Maxim, andSpy.[2][3]In 1997 Monahan won aPushcart Prizefor his short story "A Relation of Various Accidents Observable in Some Animals Included in Vacuo".[4]Monahan was an editor atSpyduring the magazine's final years, where he would come in at the close of the monthly issue to rewrite articles and improve jokes.[2]
In 1999Talkmagazinedebuted, and Monahan contributed a travelogue onGloucester, Massachusetts, to the first issue.[5]In 2000 Monahan's first novel,Light House: A Trifle, was finally published, and it garnered critical acclaim;The New York Timesproclaimed, "Monahan's cocksure prose gallops along" andBookPage Fictioncalled Monahan "a worthy successor toKingsley Amis."[6][7][8]In the second half of 2001 Monahan wrote a fictional column at theNew York Pressunder the pseudonym of Claude La Badarian, which ran for 13 weeks.[9][10]
Warner Bros.optionedthefilm rightsto the novelLight House: A Trifle.[11][12]The screenplay adaptation has not been produced.Light Housewas released in 2000. A few years later, he bought back the rights and took the novel off the market.[11][13]
In 200120th Century Foxbought Monahan'sspec scriptTripoli, aboutWilliam Eaton'sepic march on Tripoli during theBarbary Wars, in a deal worth mid-six figures in American dollars, with Mark Gordon attached as producer.[14]The script was given toRidley Scottto direct.  Monahan met with Scott to discussTripoli, and Scott mentioned his desire to direct a film about knights. Monahan suggested theCrusadesas a setting, reasoning that "you've got every conceivable plot imaginable there, which is far more exotic than fiction".  Scott was captivated by Monahan's pitch and hired him to write the screenplay forKingdom of Heaven.Tripoliwas eventually shelved, but Monahan retained ownership of the screenplay and therefore the right to consider new offers at a later date.[15][16]
Monahan steadily secured work in the film industry throughout the 2000s.Brad Pitt's production company, Plan B, hired Monahan to write an adaptation of Hong Kong directorAndrew Lau's gangster filmInfernal Affairs.  Monahan respunInfernal Affairsas a battle between Irish American gangsters and cops in Boston's Southie district, andMartin Scorsesedirected the completed screenplay under the titleThe Departedfor Warner Bros.[17][18]Monahan's work on the film would later earn him two Best Adapted Screenplay awards, from the Writers Guild of America and the Academy Awards.
Kingdom of Heavenwas the first of Monahan's screenplays to be produced into a film.  Monahan had negotiated aproduction write-through contractforKingdom of Heaven, which allowed him to be present on the movie sets to make modifications to theshooting scriptduring production.[citation needed]It was poorly received by critics when it was released in theaters in 2005.Kingdomwas critically reappraised when it was released on DVD in the form of adirector's cutthat contained an additional 45 minutes of footage previously shot from Monahan's shooting script.[citation needed]Some critics were pleased with the extended version of the film.[19]
Monahan's second produced screenplay wasThe Departed, an adaptation of theHong Kong action filmInfernal Affairs.Jack Nicholson, one of the leads in the film, influenced the screenplay. "I had written the role as a post-sexual 68-year-old Irishman. Jack is post-sexual exactly never," Monahan said later. "What Jack did is great. Did he change the words? Not any of the good ones."[13][20]Monahan received considerable praise from critics when the film was released in theaters, in 2006, and was applauded for accurately depicting the city of Boston. Monahan used his intimate knowledge of the way Bostonians talk and act, learned from his youth spent in the manyneighborhoods of Boston, to create characters thatThe Boston Globedescribed as distinctly indigenous to the city.[21]
By the end of 2006The Departedhad won many critics' prizes. Monahan was honored byThe Boston Society of Film Criticswith the award for best screenplay, by theChicago Film Critics Associationfor best adapted screenplay, and by the Southeastern Film Critics Association with another best adapted screenplay award.[22][23][24]Monahan took an unusual route for a screenwriter and hired apublicistto run a campaign promoting his screenplay during awards season.[25]Monahan ended up winning two Best Adapted Screenplay awards forThe Departed, from theWriters Guild of Americaand theAcademy Awards.[26][27]He received an award for his writing in film at the US-Ireland Alliance's second annual "Oscar Wilde: Honoring Irish Writing in Film" ceremony.[6]
In 2006 Monahan negotiated afirst-look producing dealwith Warner Bros., which gave the studio aright of first refusalon any films produced by Henceforth, the production company he started. In return Henceforth received the film rights to produceJohn Pearson'strue crimebookThe Gamblers, a property which Warner Bros. had previously acquired.[28]
In 2007 Monahan was hired to work on two film projects: an adaptation of the Hong Kong filmConfession of Painand an originalrock and rollfilm,The Long Play. Monahan was initially assigned toexecutive produceand write the adaptation forConfession of Pain, under production byLeonardo DiCaprio's company, Appian Way, for Warner Bros. Pictures.[29]It would represent his second adaption of anAndrew LauandAlan Makfilm. Monahan's other assignment was to rewrite a screenplay about the history of the rock music business calledThe Long Play, the brainchild ofMick Jagger, lead singer ofThe Rolling Stones, which had been incubating at Jagger's production company, Jagged Films atDisney. Martin Scorsese became involved while the film project was at Disney and subsequently negotiated aturnaround dealto bringThe Long Playto Paramount.[30]However, neither of these projects were completed.[verification needed]
Monahan's directorial debut wasLondon Boulevard, released in 2010, which he also produced. An adaption of aKen Bruenwork by the same name, it was received with both criticism and praise, withThe Hollywood Reporterstating that as director he "sashays winningly" into the premise of Bruen's "stylish line in mean-streets poetry", further commenting the film as "adapted sharply".[31]Others adjudged the film as unfocused, complaining of "a surplus of plot threads that don't have space to play out, and accordingly com[ing] across as clichés",[32]that he "ended up with more than he can chew for his first time in the director's chair".[33]
A few years later, a version ofThe Gamblerwas finally generated, as written and executive produced. The film received mixed reviews, with some people complementingJessica Lange's performance,[34][35][36]while others, includingPeter TraversfromRolling Stone, calling the film's unclear character motivations "wearying".[37]This remake also suffered from comparison and contrasting with the original film on which it's based.[38]
His most recent directorial and producer credit was the filmMojave, which he also wrote.[39]Announced on March 22, 2012,[40]and cast between December 4 until well past principal photography began,[41][42][43][44][45]production was stalled until September 27, 2013.[41][44][46]The film was released on DirecTV Cinema on December 3, 2015, prior to opening in alimited releaseon January 22, 2016.[47]TheRotten Tomatoesconsensus for the movie is that it "has no shortage of talent on either side of the camera; unfortunately, it amounts to little more than a frustrating missed opportunity."[48]Sean Burns ripped into the movie, calling it "elliptical and at times preposterously entertaining, [a movie] that both sends up and embraces every chest-beating trope in that old alpha 'He-Man of letters' tradition", and dances with the idea that some of the movie "is Monahan indulging in a bit of sardonic self-flaggelation [sic] for all his success in the industry".[49]TheObserver's Rex Reed labeled it "gibberish with guns and phony literary pretentiousness about two thugs in a duel of weapons and words that goes nowhere fast", contending that his high-quality work onThe Departedwas inexplicable, as he had "written nothing of value since". Continuing, he said that "as a director he evokes gales of guffaws".[50]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
