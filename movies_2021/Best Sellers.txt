Young Lucy Stanbridge has inherited her father's once successful publishing house. She must try to keep it afloat in face of a recent streak of disastrous releases, so she seeks the cantankerous, once best-selling writer Harris Shaw for an unpublished manuscript and go on tour with her, but he proves to be hard to handle.
The film was an official selection at theBerlin International Film Festival. It was released in the United States and Canada on September 17, 2021, byScreen Media FilmsandMongrel Media, respectively.
Lucy Stanbridge is a young publisher who inherited her father's once successful publishing house. To keep it afloat in face of a recent streak of disastrous releases, she and her assistant Rachel scour their list of former best sellers and find legendary author Harris Shaw owes them a book.
Rachel tries to dissuade Lucy from seeking Harris' help, as the cantankerous old writer has not published a book in 50 years. He also is famed to be difficult. She calls him a drunken recluse and a madman. He has some unusual stipulations in his contract, including there will be no revisions or editing of his manuscript and Harris in turn is obligated to do a book tour for it.
As Harris does not answer Lucy's calls, she and Rachel drive to his Westchester home. On the way, Rachel reads out loud rumors about Harris, including being thrown out of Ireland for disorderly conduct and accidentally shooting an assistant. Arriving to the house, as he is unresponsive to their knocks, they enter through the back. Lucy shows Harris the contract, but he drives them off with a shotgun.
Back inNYC, just as Lucy is about to sign over Stanbridge Publishing to Jack Sinclair, a reluctant Harris gives his unpublished manuscript to her. She rips up the contract and negotiates with the writer. As Harris will not let her edit the book, he must go on tour with her, but his wild antics prove to be hard to handle.
At their first book reading, Harris reads a short story from Penthouse, then faces theNYTbook critic saying everything from critics is bullshite and assaults him. He loses most of the scheduled book readings, but picks up new ones in bars. Harris continues to not read from his book, but rather says bullshite over and over. Videos of him go viral, but they do not inspire people to buy the book.
Jack turns up on the tour, and Lucy almost agrees to sell him the company. They begin to hook up, when he lets slip that the new offer is lower, due to the detrimental tour. Lucy kicks him out, then goes to confront Harris. She loses it on him, but surprisingly he says he will read from it at the next booked reading.
However, Harris is not able to. Lucy had an epiphany, and starts to get random young people to read out excerpts of the book. Uploading the videoed readings online works, and they start selling books. One evening, after Lucy unsuccessfully tries to prep him forJimmy Fallon, it sounds like Harris might be receptive to Lucy's edits, however he is not. Lucy drinks alongside him, gets sick in the toilet but again seems to connect with him.
On the way back to NYC, Lucy has to make a stop. Her father Joseph is in a home due to severe dementia. Seeing Harris affects him, so finally the truth comes out. Harris' wife Elisabeth edited his first book, but did not get the credit. Her death shortly after their child's death at childbirth prevented Harris from getting any more material published.
The upset Harris storms off. Hours later, he enters a bookshop, and lights up a display of books. Hospitalised, the arson has drawn attention to the book. Later on, Lucy is told that Harris' heart, lungs and liver are shot. Just as his book hits thebest-sellerlist, she drives him to his home to live out his last days.
Lucy has tidied up the house, and retrieved his cat. Harris' creditors arrive, warning that if his 500,000 debt is not paid off, they will sell the house. Lucy sells Stanbridge Publishing to Jack, and forces him to leave with a shotgun.
Lucy cares for Harris until he passes away a short time later. She spreads his ashes in the same spot where they had spread Elisabeth's not long ago. Afterwards, Lucy finds a type-written note in his typewriiter that directs her to a trunk full of unpublished manuscripts in the attic. She calls Rachel to enlist her help in editing the works.

Michael Caine was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite atSt Olave's Hospitalin theRotherhithedistrict of London on 14 March 1933,[10][11][12][13]the son of cook andcharwomanEllen Frances Marie (née Burchell; 1901–1989)[14][15]and afish marketporter also called Maurice Joseph Micklewhite (1899–1956). His father was from aCatholicIrish Travellerfamily background.[16]Caine was raised in his mother'sProtestantfaith.[17]He had a younger brother,Stanley(1935–2013), who also became an actor, and an older maternal half-brother named David Burchell. He grew up in London'sSouthwarkdistrict; during theSecond World War, he wasevacuated100 miles (160 km) toNorth Runcton, Norfolk, where he made his acting debut at the village school and had a pet horse called Lottie.[18][19]
After the war, Caine's father wasdemobilisedand the family were rehoused by the council in Marshall Gardens in London'sElephant and Castlearea, where they lived in aprefabricated housemade in Canada[20]as much of London's housing stock had been destroyed duringthe Blitzin 1940 and 1941. Caine later wrote in his autobiography, "The prefabs, as they were known, were intended to be temporary homes while London was reconstructed, but we ended up living there for eighteen years—and for us, after a cramped flat with an outside toilet, it was luxury."[21]
At the age of 10, Caine acted in a school play as the father of the ugly sisters inCinderella. His trousers' zipper was undone, prompting the audience to laugh, which inspired him to pursue an acting career.[22]In 1944, he passed hiseleven-plusexamination, winning a scholarship toHackney Downs School.[23]After a year there, he moved toWilson's SchoolinCamberwell, which he left at age 16 after gainingSchool Certificatesin six subjects. He then worked briefly as a filing clerk and messenger for a film company inVictoriaand film producerJay LewisonWardour Street.[24]
In 1952, Caine wascalled upto do hisnational service. Between 1952 and 1954 he served in theBritish Army'sRoyal Fusiliers, first at theBritish Army of the RhineHeadquarters inIserlohn,West Germany, and then on active service in theKorean War.
Caine, seeing first-hand how the Chinese usedhuman wavetactics, was left with the sense that thecommunistgovernment did not care about its citizens. Having been previously sympathetic towards the ideals of communism, Caine was left repelled by it.[25]He experienced a situation in which he thought he was going to die, the memory of which stayed with him and "formed his character". In his 2010 autobiographyThe Elephant to Hollywood, he wrote that "The rest of my life I have lived every bloody moment from the moment I wake up until the time I go to sleep."[26][27][28][29]
Caine has said that he would like to see the return of national service in Britain, to help combatyouth violence, stating: "I'm just saying, put them in the Army for six months. You're there to learn how to defend your country. You belong to the country. Then, when you come out, you have a sense of belonging, rather than a sense of violence."[30]
Caine's film debut was an uncreditedwalk-onrole inMorning Departure(1950). A few years later inHorsham, Sussex, he responded to an advertisement inThe Stagefor an assistant stage manager who would also perform bit parts for the Horsham-based Westminster Repertory Company, who were performing at theCarfaxElectric Theatre.[31]Adopting the stage name "Michael White", in July 1953 he was cast as the drunkard Hindley in the company's production ofWuthering Heights.[32][33][clarification needed]He moved to theLowestoftRepertory Company inSuffolkfor a year when he was 21. It was here that he met his first wife,Patricia Haines.[34]He has described the first nine years of his career as "really, really brutal"[35]as well as "more like purgatory than paradise".[18]He appeared in nine plays during his time at the Lowestoft Rep at the Arcadia Theatre with Jackson Stanley's Standard Players.
When his career took him to London in 1954 after his provincial apprenticeship, his agent informed him that there was already a Michael White performing as an actor in London and that he had to come up with a new name immediately.[32]Speaking to his agent from atelephone boothinLeicester Square, London, he looked around for inspiration, noted thatThe Caine Mutinywas being shown at theOdeon Cinema, and decided to change his name to "Michael Caine".[32]He joked on television in 1987 that, had a tree partly blocking his view been a few feet to the left, he might have been called "Michael Mutiny". He also later joked in interviews that, had he looked the other way, he would have ended up as "MichaelOne Hundred and One Dalmatians".[36]In 1958, Caine played the minor role of a court orderly in a BBC Television adaptation of the story,The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial.[37]
Caine moved in with another rising cockney actor,Terence Stamp, and began hanging out with him andPeter O'Toolein the London party scene after he had become O'Toole'sunderstudyinLindsay Anderson'sWest Endstaging ofWillis Hall'sThe Long and the Short and the Tallin 1959.[32]Caine took over the role when O'Toole left to makeLawrence of Arabiaand went on to a four-month tour of the UK and Ireland.[32]Caine's first film role was as one of the privates inGeorge Baker's platoon in the 1956 filmA Hill in Korea. The stars of the film were Baker,Harry Andrews,Stanley BakerandMichael Medwin, withStephen BoydandRonald Lewis;Robert Shawalso had a small part. Caine also appeared regularly on television in small roles. His first credited role on the BBC was in 1956, where he played Boudousse in theJean AnouilhplayThe Lark. Other parts included three roles inDixon of Dock Greenin 1957, 1958 and 1959, prisoner-of-war seriesEscape(1957), and the crime/thriller dramaMister Charlesworth(1958).
Caine continued to appear on television, in serialsThe Golden GirlandNo Wreath for the General, but was then cast in the playThe Compartment, written byJohnny Speight, atwo-handeralso starringFrank Finlay. This was followed by main roles in other plays including the character Tosh inSomewhere for the Night, aSunday-Night Playwritten byBill Naughtontelevised on Sunday 3 December 1961, another two-hander by Johnny Speight,The Playmates, and two editions of BBC plays strandFirst Night,Funny Noises with Their MouthsandThe Way with Reggie(both 1963). He also acted in radio plays, includingBill Naughton'sLooking for Frankieon theBBC Home Service(1963). A big break came for Caine when he was cast as Meff inJames Saunders'CockneycomedyNext Time I'll Sing To You, when this play was presented at theNew Arts Theatrein London on 23 January 1963.[38]Scenes from the play's performance were featured in the April 1963 issue ofTheatre Worldmagazine.[39]
When this play moved to theCriterioninPiccadillywithMichael Codrondirecting, he was visited backstage byStanley Baker, one of the four stars in Caine's first film,A Hill in Korea, who told him about the part of a Cockney private in his upcoming filmZulu, a film Baker was producing and starring in. Baker told Caine to meet the director,Cy Endfield, who informed him that he already had given the part toJames Booth, a fellow Cockney who was Caine's friend, because he "looked more Cockney" than Caine did. Endfield then told the 6'2" Caine that he did not look like a Cockney but like an officer, and offered him a screen test for the role of a snobbish, upper class officer after Caine assured him that he could do aposh accent. Caine believes Endfield offered him, a Cockney, the role of an aristocrat because, being American, he did not have the endemic British class-prejudice. Though he tested poorly, Endfield gave him the part that would make him a film star.[40]
Location shooting forZulutook place inNatal, South Africa, for 14 weeks in 1963.[41][42][43]According to his 2010 autobiographyThe Elephant to Hollywood, Caine had been signed to a seven-year contract byJoseph E. Levine, whoseEmbassy Filmswas distributingZulu. After the return of the cast to England and the completion of the film, Levine released him from the contract, telling him, "I know you're not, but you gotta face the fact that you look like a queer on screen." Levine gave his contract to hisZuluco-star James Booth.[44]Subsequently, Caine's agent got him cast in the BBC productionHamlet at Elsinore(1964) asHoratio, in support ofChristopher Plummer'sHamlet. Horatio was the only classical role which Caine, who had never received dramatic training, would ever play. Caine wrote, "...I decided that if my on-screen appearance was going to be an issue, then I would use it to bring out all Horatio's ambiguous sexuality."[45]
Caine's roles as effete-seeming aristocrats were to contrast with his next projects, in which he was to become notable for using aregional accent, rather than theReceived Pronunciationthen considered proper for film actors. At that time his working-classCockneyspeech stood out to American and British audiences alike, as didthe Beatles'Liverpudlianaccents.Zuluwas followed by two of Caine's best-known roles: the rough-edged petty-crook-turned-spyHarry PalmerinThe Ipcress File(1965) and the titular womanising young Cockney inAlfie(1966). In a 2016 interview Caine citedAlfieas his favourite film of his career, saying, "it made me a star in America as well, and it was my first nomination for an Academy Award".[46]He went on to play Harry Palmer in a further four films,Funeral in Berlin(1966),Billion Dollar Brain(1967),Bullet to Beijing(1995) andMidnight in Saint Petersburg(1996).[47]Caine made his first film in Hollywood in 1966, after an invitation fromShirley MacLaineto play opposite her inGambit. During the first two weeks, whilst staying atthe Beverly Hills Hotel, he met long-term friendsJohn Wayneand agent"Swifty" Lazar. Wayne was a fan of Caine's performance inAlfieand suggested to Caine, "Speak slow and speak low". Caine was always grateful for that advice.[48]Caine starred in the filmThe Magus(1968) which, althoughBAFTA-nominated for Best Cinematography, failed at the box office.
Caine starred in the 1969 comedycaper filmThe Italian Jobas Charlie Croker, the leader of a Cockney criminal gang released from prison with the intention of doing a "big job" in Italy to steal gold bullion from an armoured security truck. One of the most celebrated roles of his career, in a 2002 poll his line "You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!" was voted the second-funniest line in film (after "He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy" fromMonty Python'sLife of Brian),[49]and favourite one-liner in a 2003 poll of 1,000 film fans.[50]Culminating in acliffhanger,The Italian Jobhas one of the most discussed end scenes in film; what happened to the coachload of gold teetering over the edge of a cliff has been debated in the decades since the film was released.[51][52]
After working onThe Italian JobwithNoël Coward, and a role asRAFfighter pilotsquadron leaderCanfield in the all-star cast ofBattle of Britain(both 1969), Caine played the lead inGet Carter(1971), a British gangster film. Caine also starred in a comedy thriller,Pulp(1972). Caine continued with successes includingSleuth(1972) oppositeLaurence Olivier, andJohn Huston'sThe Man Who Would Be King(1975) co-starringSean Connery, which received widespread acclaim.[53]The Timesapplauded the "lovely double act of Caine and Connery, clowning to their doom", while Huston paid tribute to Caine's improvisation as an actor: "Michael is one of the most intelligent men among the artists I've known. I don't particularly care to throw the ball to an actor and let him improvise, but with Michael it's different. I just let him get on with it."[53]In 1974, Caine appeared inThe Black Windmill, co-starringDonald Pleasence.
In 1976, Caine appeared inTom Mankiewicz's screen adaptation of theJack HigginsnovelThe Eagle Has LandedasOberst(Colonel) Kurt Steiner, the commander of aLuftwaffeparatroop unit disguised as Polishparatroopers, whose mission was to kidnap or kill the then-British Prime MinisterWinston Churchill, alongside co-starsDonald Sutherland,Robert Duvall,Jenny Agutterand Donald Pleasence. Caine also was part of an all-star cast inA Bridge Too Far(1977).[54]In 1978, Caine starred inSilver Bears, an adaptation ofPaul Erdman's 1974 novel of the same name, and co-starred in the Academy Award-winningCalifornia Suite. In the late 1970s, Caine's choice of roles was frequently criticised—something to which he has referred with self-deprecating comments about taking parts strictly for the money. He averaged two films a year, but these included such films asThe Swarm(1978) (although critically panned it was Academy Award-nominated for Best Costume Design),Ashanti(1979) andBeyond the Poseidon Adventure(1979).
In the early 1980s Caine appeared inThe Island(1980),The Hand(1981), and had a reunion with hisSleuthco-star Laurence Olivier inThe Jigsaw Man(1982).

For his performance he won his firstAcademy AwardforBest Supporting Actor.[55]Peter BradshawofThe Guardianwrote in 2011, "Caine's performance, so fervent, so agonisingly dedicated, actually gains in force and touching sincerity with the years."[56]Caine also played a suave English conman, opposite a clumsy American played bySteve Martin, in the crime comedyDirty Rotten Scoundrels(1988), directed byFrank Oz. The film earned him aGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedynomination, losing toTom HanksinBig(1988).[57]
Caine's other successful films (critically or financially) were the 1980 Golden Globe-nominatedslasher filmDressed to Kill, the 1981war filmEscape to VictoryfeaturingSylvester Stalloneand footballers from the 1960s and 1970s, includingPeléandBobby Moore, the 1982 filmDeathtrap, andMona Lisa(1986). In 1987, Caine narratedHero, theofficial filmof the1986 FIFA World Cup.[58]That year he starred in the thriller and spy filmThe Fourth ProtocolalongsidePierce Brosnan. In 1988 he played Chief Insp.Frederick Abberlinein the two-part TV dramaJack the Ripper, which co-starredJane Seymourand was produced to coincide with the 100th anniversary of theJack the Rippermurder spree in Victorian London.[59]Despite his success in the 1980s, Caine also appeared in some poorly received films such asBlame It on Rio(1984), theDick ClementandIan La FrenaiscomedyWater(1985), the fourth and final film in theJawsfranchise,Jaws: The Revenge(1987), andWithout a Clue(1988) (portrayingSherlock Holmes). Caine's commitment to filmingJaws: The Revengein theBahamasmeant that he was unable to receive his Academy Award forHannah and Her Sistersin person and Dianne Wiest accepted it on his behalf. Caine said ofJaws: The Revenge, "I have never seen the film, but by all accounts it was terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific."[60][61]
"It was absolutely perfect at that time for what I wanted. I could make it, and my daughter could see it. That's why I did it. And it was lovely."
In the 1990s, Caine found good parts harder to come by. He played the mysterious bartender Mike inMr. Destinyin 1990 and appeared withRoger MooreinBullseye!(1990).He playedEbenezer ScroogeinThe Muppet Christmas Carol(1992).[63][64]Having been chosen byBrian Henson, Caine stated: "I'm going to play this movie like I'm working with theRoyal Shakespeare Company. I will never wink, I will never do anything Muppety. I am going to play Scrooge as if it is an utterly dramatic role and there are no puppets around me."[65]He played the beleaguered stage director Lloyd Fellowes in the film adaptation ofNoises Off(1992). He also played a villain in theSteven SeagalfilmOn Deadly Ground(1994). He was starred twostraight to videoHarry Palmer sequels and a few television films.

In 2001, Caine starred in the ensemble dramedyLast OrdersstarringHelen Mirren,Bob Hoskins, andTom Courtenay. Caine's next filmThe Quiet American(2002) won him great critical acclaim withRoger Ebertwriting, "[it's] a performance that seems to descend perfectly formed. There is no artifice in it, no unneeded energy, no tricks, no effort".[67]Caine earned his sixthAcademy Awardnomination as well as aGolden Globe AwardandBritish Academy Film Awardfor his performance.
Several of Caine's classic films have been remade, includingThe Italian Job,Get Carter,AlfieandSleuth. Caine appeared inGet Carterthe 2000 American action thriller film directed by Stephen Kay; a remake of his 1971 filmGet Carter, in which a younger Michael Caine played the title role. Here in the 2000 remake, Caine's role was originally relegated to a one-scene cameo appearance, which he agreed to do as a favor to his friend Sylvester Stallone. However, after a test screening, additional scenes were scripted and shot to expand his role. The film was released in the U.S. on 6 October 2000. Critical reaction was negative, and the film flopped at the box office, with worldwide earnings of approximately only $19 million against a production budget of nearly $64 million. Stallone said: "Believe it or not, I think Get Carter was really underrated. That was a big disappointment. I learned the hard way that [remakes], even if you do it better than the original, there’s a tremendous nostalgia attached to the original. And quite often they’re not done as well."  In the2007 remakeofSleuth, Caine took over the roleLaurence Olivierplayed in the1972 versionandJude Lawplayed Caine's original role. Caine is one of the few actors to have played a starring role in two versions of the same film. In an interview with CNN, Law spoke of his admiration for Caine: "I learned so much just from watching how he monitored his performance, and also how little he has to do. He's a master technician and sometimes he was doing stuff I didn't see, I couldn't register. I'd go back and watch it on the monitor, it was like 'Oh my God, the amount of variety he's put in there is breathtaking".[68]
Caine also starred in multiple comedies during this time, including playing Austin's father inAustin Powers in Goldmember(2002). In 2003 he co-starred withRobert Duvall, andHaley Joel Osmentin the family comedySecondhand Lions. Caine played family elder Henry Lair in the 2004 filmAround the Bend.

The film received an American release during theCOVID-19 pandemicin September 2020 after being delayed multiple times and became a box office disappointment, despite receiving positive reviews.[82][83]Caine also appeared in the children's fantasy film,Come Away(2020) starringAngelina Jolie,David Oyelowo, andGugu Mbatha-Raw. The film premiered at theSundance Film Festivalto mixed reviews, with critics praising its performances and lavish production design.[84][85]In the 2021 filmTwist, an adaptation ofCharles Dickens'Oliver Twistset in the present day, Caine playsFagin.[86]In interviews promoting the 2021 filmBest Sellers, Caine suggested that he would not make another film, citing difficulty in walking and his new interest in novel-writing developed during theCOVID-19 lockdowns.[87]However, his representatives toldVarietythat he was not retiring from acting.[88]In 2022, Caine filmedThe Great Escaper, a British-French feature film starring Caine andGlenda Jackson, based on the true-life story of a BritishWorld War IIveteran who 'broke out' of his nursing home to attend the 70th anniversaryD-Daycommemorations in France, in June 2014.[89]The film was released on 6 October 2023.[89]
Caine officially confirmed his retirement from acting on 13 October 2023, mainly because of the decreasing likelihood of him getting any more leading roles.[90]Caine announced his retirement from acting in a BBCTodayradio programme interview withMartha Kearney. Referring toThe Great Escaperhe said, "I keep saying I'm going to retire, well I am now, because I figured, I've had a picture which is — I played the lead and it's got incredible reviews. The only parts I'm liable to get now are old men, 90-year-old men, and I thought well I might as well leave with all this. I've got wonderful reviews. What am I going to do to beat this?"[91]
"I kept my cockney accent in order to let other working class boys know that if I made it, they could do it too."
Caine is regarded as a British cultural icon, with Mairi Mackay of CNN stating: "Michael Caine has been personifying British cool since theswinging sixties. He has brought some of British cinema's most iconic characters to life and introduced his very own laid-backcockneygangster into pop culture. He doggedly retained a regional accent at a time when the plummy tones ofReceived Pronunciationwere considered obligatory. It is a sweet irony that his accent has become his calling card."[68]In 2015The Timescalled Caine "the epitome of Sixties cool in his first outing as the secret agent Harry Palmer".[7]A trailer for his second role as Palmer described him as possessing "horn rims, cockney wit and an iron fist".[92]
With his distinctive voice and manner of speaking, Caine is a popular subject for impersonators and mimics.[93]Most Caine impressions include the catchphrase "Not a lot of people know that."[68]The catchphrase emanates from Caine's habit of informing people of obscure "interesting facts" that he has collected.[94]Referring to Caine as being the "biggest mine ofuseless information",Peter Sellersinitiated thecatchphrasewhen he appeared on BBC1'sParkinsonshow on 28 October 1972 and said:
Not many people know that. This is my Michael Caine impression. You see, Mike's always quoting from theGuinness Book of Records. At the drop of a hat he'll trot one out. 'Did you know that it takes a man in a tweed suit five-and-a-half seconds to fall from the top ofBig Bento the ground?' Now there's not many people who know that![95]
Caine later spoke of how Sellers used his impression of him as hisanswering machinemessage in the 1970s: "I called Peter one day, he wasn't in. And there was me saying, 'My name is Michael Caine. I just want you to know that Peter Sellers is not in. Not many people know that.' He invented that 'not many people know that.' And then everybody who rang him, they got me saying, 'Not many people know that.'"[96]Over the years Caine himself had parodied his catchphrase and his "interesting facts", and has imitated others' impressions of him.[97]In an interview withMichael Parkinsonin 2007, Caine commented on the impersonations of his voice, "I can do it. 'Hello. My name is Michael Caine. Not many people know that.' I sound like a bloody moron. You know where they've got me now? On birthday cards. 'It's your birthday today. Not many people know that'. Now they've got me on Satellite navigation. It's me going, 'take the second turn on the right, and you'll wind up right in the shit.'"[97]In 1983, Caine used his "not a lot of people know that" phrase as a joke in the filmEducating Rita.[68]
The comedy sketch showHarry Enfield's Television Programmeincluded a series of sketches in whichPaul Whitehouseplayed a character called Michael Paine; an amalgam of previous Michael Caine impressions, who in a reference to Caine's characterHarry PalmerfromThe Ipcress Filewears oversized, thick-rimmed glasses and a trench coat. He introduces himself with the line, "My name is Michael Paine, and I am a nosy neighbour" and in a spoof of the stakeout at the beginning ofThe Ipcress File, recounts to the camera the 'suspiciously' mundane behaviour of his neighbours, before saying, "Not a lot of people know that I know that".[98]Caine's Harry Palmer character (with the glasses, the girls, and disregard for authority) was among the many British pop cultural influences forMike Myers'Austin Powersfilms.[99]At Myers' request, Caine himself starred inAustin Powers in Goldmember(2002), with his portrayal of Nigel Powers, father of Austin Powers, spoofing Harry Palmer.[99]
A parody of Caine appears in the animated seriesUgly Americans, in the episode "The Dork Knight", which also parodies the filmThe Dark Knight. In the episode, Caine appears as himself, portrayed in the light of his Alfred Pennyworth interpretation, and constantly annoys the protagonists with endless anecdotes of his career.
The 2010 television seriesThe Trip, starringRob BrydonandSteve Coogan, featured improvised scenes in which the two leads argue over who can do the better Michael Caine impression.[100]Among the lines they repeat in their attempts to outdo each other are, "You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!" and, "She was only sixteen years old"—fromThe Italian JobandGet Carter, respectively.[100]Coogan and Brydon later did their impressions from a balcony at the Royal Albert Hall during a celebration of Caine's work, only to be interrupted by the real Caine informing them that they were out of shape: "For me, it's a full-time job."[101]
Craig Fergusonran segments on his show where he parodied Caine, usually while wearing aspace suit.[102]In a 2010 interview withThe Telegraph, Caine spoke of the impersonations and how everyone he meets quotes lines at him, to the point he quotes them quoting him.[98]When asked whether he is ever tired of telling his anecdotes, Caine stated: "I enjoy making people laugh. The trick is to tell them against yourself. If you praise yourself your stories aren't funny."[98]
In 2018, Caine starred in aBritish Airwayspre-flight safety video, appearing with six other British celebrities, including actressesOlivia ColmanandNaomie Harris. Promoting the Flying Start children's charity partnership between BA andComic Relief, they are featured 'auditioning' in humorous sketches while also highlighting important safety messages.[103]

They met after Caine saw her in aMaxwell Housecoffee commercial and a friend gave him her telephone number. He called her every day for ten days until she finally agreed to meet him.[116]They have a daughter, Natasha Haleema.[109][117]Baksh is aMuslimwhile Caine is a Christian. He reflected in 2009, "My wife is a Muslim and she does Muslim stuff; I'm a Christian and I do Christian stuff, and no questions ever come up. The media view of Muslims is different from mine, which is very benign and peaceful".[118]
Proud of his working-class roots, Caine has discussed the opportunities his film career gave him: "I got to play football withPelé, for God's sake. And I danced withBob Fosse."[98]He also became close friends withJohn Lennon, stating: "With John and I it was a case of bonding because we were both working class and we shared a sense of humour. We were pretending we weren't who people thought we were."[98]His closest friends included twoJames Bondactors,Sean ConneryandRoger Moore.[98]
Some time after his mother died, Caine and his younger brother,Stanley, learned they had an elder half-brother named David. He suffered from severeepilepsyand had been kept inCane Hill Mental Hospitalhis entire life. Although their mother regularly visited her first son in the hospital, even her husband did not know the child existed. David died in 1992.[119]
In July 2016, Cainechanged his namebydeed pollto his long-time stage name to simplify security checks at airports. Caine stated that because the security guard often recognised him but was unaware of his real name, it would waste a considerable amount of his time as he tried to prove that he and "Maurice Joseph Micklewhite" were the same person:
"[A security guard] would say, 'Hi Michael Caine,' and suddenly I'd be giving him a passport with a different name on it. I could stand there for an hour. So I changed my name."[120]
Caine is a fan ofchill-out music, and he released a compilation CD calledCainedin 2007 on theUMTVrecord label.[121][122]He met his good friendElton Johnand was discussing musical tastes, when Caine said that he had been creating chilloutmix tapesas an amateur for years.[122][123]Caine and Elton John had also appeared on the same episode ofParkinson, where they sang an impromptu version of thepubtune "Knees Up Mother Brown".[124]Also in music, Caine provided vocal samples for the ska-pop bandMadnessfor their 1984 hit "Michael Caine", as his daughter was a fan. He has sung in film roles as well, includingLittle Voiceand for the 1992 musical filmThe Muppet Christmas Carol.[125]
Caine quit his 80-a-day smoking habit in the early 1970s after a lecture fromTony Curtis.[126]He is a supporter of the football club,Chelsea FC.[127]Caine is also a fan ofcricket. This was alluded to byGary Oldman, who acted with Caine inThe Dark Knight Rises, when he talked about Caine's acting methods: "It's, 'Take one'. He got it. 'Take two', got it. 'Take three', got it. He's just on the money. ... He doesn't fuck around because he wants to get back to cricket."[128]
Trivia books written by Caine includeNot Many People Know That!,And Not Many People Know This Either!,Michael Caine's Moving Picture Show, andNot a Lot of People Know This Is 1988. Proceeds from the books went to theNational Playing Fields Association, a UK charity for which Caine served as vice president, and which aims to protect and promote open spaces for sports and recreation in British cities and towns.[129]Starting in 1976 Caine became part owner ofLangan's Brasserieand at one point had ownership in seven restaurants in the UK and United States.[130]
Caine has often been outspoken about his political views, referring to himself as a "left-wing Tory" influenced by both hisworking classbackground andKorean Warservice.[131][132]He left the United Kingdom for the United States in the late 1970s, citing theincome taxlevied on top earners by theLabourgovernment ofJames Callaghan, which then stood at 83%.[133]He lived inBeverly Hillsduring that time, but returned to the UK eight years later when taxes had been lowered by theConservativegovernment ofMargaret Thatcher:
I realised that's not asocialistcountry, it's acommunistcountry without a dictator, so I left and I was never going to come back. Maggie Thatcher came in and put the taxes back down and in the end, you know, you don't mind paying tax. What am I going to do? Not pay tax and drive around in aRolls-Royce, withcripplesbegging on the street like you see in some countries?[134]
Following the launch of his filmHarry Brownin 2009, Caine called for the reintroduction ofnational servicein the UK to give young people "a sense of belonging, rather than a sense of violence".[135]
In 2009, Caine publicly criticised theLabour governmentofGordon Brownfor its new 50% income tax rate on top earners and threatened to return to the United States if his taxes were increased further.[132]During the run up to the2010 general election, Caine publicly endorsed theConservative Partyand appeared with then-party leaderDavid Cameronfor the launch of a civilian non-compulsory "National Service" for sixteen-year-olds, although Caine stated he had previously supportedNew Labourunder the leadership ofTony Blairin1997.[136]In July 2014, Caine was reported to have been a celebrity investor in atax avoidancescheme called Liberty.[137]In November 2014, Caine described the proposedmansion taxby then Labour leaderEd Milibandas "preposterous and silly".[138]
Caine voted in favour ofBrexitin the2016 European Referendum, stating he would rather be a "poor master than a rich servant".[139]He said he was a reluctant Leaver; "I don't know what to vote for. Both are scary. To me, you've now got in Europe a sort of government-by-proxy of everybody, who has now got carried away. Unless there is some extremely significant changes, we should get out."[140]
In November 2024, following the election of Labour Party leaderSir Keir Starmeras Prime Minister in theJuly of that year, Caine supported the petition on theUK Parliament petitions websitethat demands anew general electionin the UK by sharing it on hisXaccount.[141]

They liked the concept for the character and createdApril Ludgate.[42][13][6][41]Plaza, who said that in real life she was like Poehler's earnestly hard-working character, took inspiration from her younger sister for April's apathetic disposition.[43][44][5]Plaza played the role from 2009 to 2015.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
