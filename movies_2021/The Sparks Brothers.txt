Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Edgar Howard Wright(born 18 April 1974) is an English filmmaker. He is known for his fast-paced and kinetic, satiricalgenre films, which feature extensive utilisation of expressive popular music,Steadicamtracking shots,dolly zoomsand a signature editing style that includes transitions,whip pansand wipes.[1]He first made independent short films before making his first feature filmA Fistful of Fingersin 1995. Wright created and directed the comedy seriesAsylumin 1996, written withDavid Walliams. After directing several other television shows, Wright directed the sitcomSpaced(1999–2001), which aired for two series and starred frequent collaboratorsSimon PeggandNick Frost.
In 2004, Wright directed the zombie comedyShaun of the Dead,starring Pegg and Frost, the first film in Wright'sThree Flavours Cornettotrilogy. The film was co-written with Pegg—as were the next two entries in the trilogy, thebuddy copfilmHot Fuzz(2007) and the science fiction comedyThe World's End(2013). In 2010, Wright co-wrote and directed the action comedy filmScott Pilgrim vs. the World, an adaptation ofthe graphic novel series. Along withJoe CornishandSteven Moffat, he adaptedThe Adventures of Tintin(2011) forSteven Spielberg. Wright and Cornish co-wrote the screenplay for theMarvel Cinematic UniversefilmAnt-Manin 2015, which Wright intended to direct but abandoned, citing creative differences.[2]He has also written and directed the action filmBaby Driver(2017), the documentaryThe Sparks Brothers,and the psychological horror filmLast Night in Soho(both 2021).
Edgar Howard Wright was born on 18 April 1974 inPoole,Dorsetand grew up predominantly inWellsinSomerset. He has an older brother, Oscar, who is an artist.[3][4]He attendedThe Blue School, Wellsfrom 1985 to 1992, and is honoured by a plaque at the school. His school drama teacher, Peter Wild, later played acameo roleinHot Fuzz.[5]
Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, he directed many short films, first on aSuper-8camera that was a gift from a family member and later on aVideo-8camcorder that he won in a competition on the television-programmeGoing Live. These films were mostly comedic pastiches of popular genres, such as the super hero-inspiredCarbolic SoapandDirty HarrytributeDead Right(which was featured on the DVD release ofHot Fuzz).[citation needed]
From 1992 to 1994, Wright attended the Bournemouth and Poole College of Art and Design (nowArts University Bournemouth) and received anNDin Audio-Visual Design.[6]
In June 2018, Arts University Bournemouth awarded Wright an Honorary Fellowship. On receiving the award Wright said that he still thought very fondly of his time there.[7]
Wright made his feature film debut in 1995 with a low budget, independentspoofwestern,A Fistful of Fingers, which was picked up for a limited theatrical release and broadcast on thesatellite TVchannelSky Movies.[8]Despite Wright's dissatisfaction with the finished product,[9]it caught the attention of comediansMatt LucasandDavid Walliams, who subsequently chose him as the director of theirParamount Comedychannel productionMash and Peas. During this time he also worked onBBC-programmes such asIs It Bill Bailey?,Alexei Sayle's Merry-Go-RoundandSir Bernard's Stately Homes. In an interview with journalist and authorRobert K. ElderforThe Film That Changed My Life, Wright attributes his edgy and comedic style to his love forAn American Werewolf in London.
I've always been fascinated by horror films and genre films. And horror films harboured a fascination for me and always have been something I've wanted to watch and wanted to make. Equally, I'm very fascinated by comedy. I suppose the reason that this film changed my life is that very early on in my film-watching experiences, I saw a film that was so sophisticated in its tone and what it managed to achieve.[10]
In 1998 writer/actorsSimon PeggandJessica Hyneswere in the early stages of developing their sitcomSpacedforChannel 4and thought of asking Wright to direct, having fondly remembered working with him on the 1996 Paramount comedyAsylum. Wright gaveSpacedan unusual look for the sitcom genre, with dramatic camera angles and movement borrowed from the visual language ofscience fictionandhorror films.[11]Instead of shying away from these influences Wright makes an active effort to show his referencing, adding a 'Homage-O-Meter' to all of his releases, a device that displays each directorial nod he has made during shooting. In 2002, he made appearances as a scientist and a technician named Eddie Yorque during both series ofLook Around You, a BBC-programme created by a member of theSpacedcast,Peter Serafinowicz. He also made two brief appearances inSpaced, one in which he can be seen, along with other crew members on the series, lying asleep in Daisy Steiner's squat as she prepares to leave for her new house. The other is a brief appearance during the montage in the episode "Gone" where Daisy describes to Tim what she thinks would be a fun night out for the two. Edgar issitting on the tube(with a beard) next to Tim and Daisy.
The critical success ofSpacedpaved the way for Wright and Pegg to move to the big screen withShaun of the Dead, azombie comedywhich mixed a "Brit flick"romantic comedystyle with homages to the horror classics ofGeorge A. RomeroandSam Raimi. The film was a success critically and financially, and its rooting in American genre cinema helped to make it an international hit.
The pair planned a trilogy of British genre comedies which were connected not by narrative but by their shared traits and motifs. The trilogy was named "The Three-Flavours-Cornetto-Trilogy" by the pair due to a running joke about the British ice cream productCornettoand its effectiveness as a hangover cure. Wright explained to Clark Collis in an interview forEntertainment Weekly, "We put that joke inShaun of the Deadwhere Nick asks for a Cornetto first thing in the morning. When I was at college, it was my hangover cure—probably stillismy hangover cure. Then we put it intoHot Fuzzbecause we thought it would be a funny recurring thing. One journalist in the United Kingdom said, 'Is this going to be your theme as a trilogy?' and I said, 'Yes, it's likeKrzysztof Kieślowski's Three Colours trilogy. This is the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy.' It was just a joke that stuck." Collis observes that the films also feature "a running gag involving garden fences."[12]
The second instalment was the comedy action thrillerHot Fuzz. Production started in March 2006 and the film was released in February 2007 in the United Kingdom and April 2007 in the United States. It revolves around Pegg's character, Nicholas Angel, a police officer who is transferred from London to rural Sandford, where grisly events soon take place. In 2007, Wright also directed a fake trailer insert forQuentin TarantinoandRobert Rodriguez'sGrindhouse, called "Don't".[13]It was a plotless trailer that mocked horror clichés, with lines such as, "If you... are thinking... of going ... into... this... house... DON'T!".
In 2010,Scott Pilgrim vs. the Worldwas released; its over-$85 million budget[14]dwarfed the £8 million budget[15]ofHot Fuzz. The film, based on thegraphic novelseriesScott Pilgrim, was co-written, co-produced and directed by Wright. It took in roughly half its budget in box office,[16]in spite of its critical reception and praise from fellow directors such asKevin Smith,Quentin TarantinoandJason Reitman.[14]In November 2011,The Adventures of Tintin, directed bySteven Spielberg, produced byPeter Jackson, and based onHergé'sThe Adventures of Tintinwas released. Wright co-wrote the film with writing partnerJoe CornishandSteven Moffat. The film also co-starred Wright's frequent collaborators Simon Pegg andNick Frost. The third instalment of the Cornetto trilogy,The World's End, premiered in London on 10 July 2013. The film is about several friends who reunite when one decides to repeat a pub crawl they did 20 years earlier. They have to get toThe World's Endpub without ending up in the gutter to do this, but some unusual powers are at work and what happens to them may determine what happens to humans as a species.[17]
Wright had been developing alive-action filmbased on theMarvel ComicssuperheroAnt-Manwith Joe Cornish since 2006.[18]However, on 23 May 2014, Wright andMarvel Studiosissued a joint statement announcing that Wright would exit the movie due to creative differences.[19]According to Wright, he had been hired as writer-director but became unhappy when Marvel wanted to write a new script. In 2017, he said: "The most diplomatic answer is I wanted to make a Marvel movie but I don't think they really wanted to make an Edgar Wright movie ... having written all my other movies, that's a tough thing to move forward. Suddenly becoming a director for hire on it, you’re sort of less emotionally invested and you start to wonder why you’re there, really."[20]He was replaced byPeyton Reedas director, withAdam McKayand starPaul Ruddrewriting the screenplay. He and Cornish received both screenplay and story credits, with Wright also credited as executive producer.[21]
In July 2014, Wright announced that his next film would beBaby Driver. Wright has described the film as "kind of like a musical", andDeadline Hollywooddescribed it as "a collision of crime, action, music, and sound". The film starsAnsel Elgort,Kevin Spacey,Lily James,Eiza González,Jon Hamm, andJamie Foxx.[22]The film began production on 11 February 2016 in Atlanta, and was released on 28 June 2017.[23][24][25][26]

In 2020 it was announced that Wright had formed a production company with his longtime collaboratorsNira Park,Joe Cornishand Rachel Prior,Complete Fiction. That same day, it was reported that the production company had signed a deal withNetflixto tackle adaptations ofLockwood & Co.,The Murders of Molly Southbourne,andThe City of Brass. The production company is also set to produce another Netflix original series, albeit one that is under wraps and has several feature films in development withWorking Title Films.[40]
In April 2022 Wright was appointed to theBritish Film Institute's Board of Governors for a four-year term, saying he was "excited to see what I can do to help promote their incredible efforts in curating, preserving, producing and educating".[41]In 2023, Wright announced viaTwitterthatScott Pilgrimwould be returning as ananimeadaptation[42]with the film's original actors as the voice cast.Scott Pilgrim Takes Offwas released on 17 November 2023 forNetflix, with Wright as an executive producer.[43]

Wright has stated inThe Film That Changed My Lifethat the film that most influenced him wasJohn Landis'sAn American Werewolf in London. Wright also mentionedSam Raimi'sEvil Dead IIand theCoen brothers'Raising Arizonaas films that made him want to be a director.[45]
Wright began dating American actressAnna Kendrickin 2009, after they met while filmingScott Pilgrim vs. the World.[46][47][48]They split up in March 2013.[49]
In December 2007, Wright began guest programming atRepertory theatretheNew Beverly Cinemafollowing a sold-out screening of his films.

Ronald David Mael(born August 12, 1945)[1]is an American musician, songwriter, composer and record producer.[2]He is the keyboard player and principal songwriter in the bandSparks, which he founded with vocalist, occasional songwriter and younger brotherRussell Maelin 1971. Mael is known for his quirky and idiosyncratic approach to songwriting,[3]his intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style and for his deadpan and low key, scowling demeanour onstage often remaining motionless over his keyboard in sharp contrast to Russell's animated and hyperactive frontman antics. Ron Mael is also noted for his conservative clothes and distinctive moustache. The Mael brothers are the founders of Lil' Beethoven Records.
Ronald David Mael was born on August 12, 1945, inCulver City, California. The Mael brothers grew up inPacific Palisades– an affluent beach neighbourhood of Los Angeles – with their father, Meyer Mael,[4][5]who was a graphic designer and caricaturist for theHollywood Citizen-News,[6][7]and their mother, Miriam (née Moskowitz), a librarian. Both Meyer and Miriam were the children ofJewishimmigrants, Meyer from Russia and Austria and Miriam from Poland;[8][9]despite this, a source affiliated with the brothers' 2021 documentary stated that they "weren't raised, nor do they identify as Jewish", and the documentary does not mention their Jewish heritage.[10]Much of the Mael brothers' initial inspiration came from their father taking them to the cinema as children, where they developed an interest in film, visual arts and narrative. Meyer died when Mael was 11.[11]
After being educated atPalisades High School, both brothers enrolled atUCLA;[12]Ron began a course in cinema and graphic arts in 1963 while Russell studied theatre arts and filmmaking between 1966 and 1968.[13]It was during their time at UCLA the brothers formed their first band, The Urban Renewal Project, who recorded a series of demos in 1967.
Ron Mael plays the keyboards and synthesizers and writes most of the songs for Sparks. When the band hit the peak of its popularity in the 1970s, he was well known for his strange appearance, often remaining motionless over his keyboard in sharp contrast to Russell's animated and hyperactive frontman antics. Ron's conservative clothes and unfashionable,Charlie Chaplin-esquetoothbrush moustacheattracted much attention, as does his currentpencil moustache. Onstage, Ron alternates between playing the keyboard and engaging in comic mime routines, often in connection with projections on backdrop. A feature of a live Sparks show is Ron's dance routine, which he continues to perform into his late 70s.
For the first two albums with Halfnelson/Sparks, Mael played aWurlitzer electronic piano, but found that it did not stand up to road use because the metal reeds broke frequently. When Sparks relocated to the UK, Mael began using anRMI Electra-Piano, played through anEchoplextape echo unit, and this distinctive sound featured prominently on their breakthrough single "This Town Ain't Big Enough For The Both Of Us", the albumsKimono My HouseandPropagandaand in their live shows. Since 1981, he has used variousYamahaandRolandkeyboards and synthesizers live. That year, he altered the Roland logo on the back of hisRoland Jupiter-8to read "Ronald", which he has done on all of his keyboards since then.[14]He currently uses aYamaha Motif XF8.
The pair appeared as themselves in the 1977disaster filmRollercoaster, performing live. They also appeared in episode twenty-two of season six of theGilmore Girls.
In a rare non-Sparks related musical turn, Ron and Russell Mael wrote the lyrics toTelex's1982 album,Sex.
In June 2018,Edgar Wrightannounced he would be makinga documentaryon the cultpop-rockband Sparks.[15]He had covered the band's concert in London in May at O2 Forum Kentish Town. This concert would also be a part of the documentary.[16][17]The film,The Sparks Brothers,  had its world premiere at the2021 Sundance Film Festivalon January 30, 2021.[18]
In 2017, a reviewer noted that while the brothers' biographies recount an LA childhood in which they surfed and were both models for mail order catalogues, their private lives are otherwise almost entirely unknown. "Well, we're in good company withBob Dylan", was their reported response. "We feel the less you do know, it keeps the mythology and the image in a better position." Even to the question of whether they have partners or spouses, they refused to give an indication, insisting that "the vagueness is more interesting than the reality."[19]

The Mael brothers grew up inPacific Palisades– a relatively affluent beach neighbourhood of Los Angeles – with their father Meyer, who was a graphic designer and caricaturist for theHollywood Citizen-News, and their mother, Miriam (néeMoskowitz), a librarian.[1]Both Meyer and Miriam were the children ofJewishimmigrants, Meyer ofAustrianandRussiandescent and MiriamPolish;[2][3]despite this, a source affiliated with the brothers' 2021 documentary stated that they "weren't raised, nor do they identify as Jewish", and the documentary does not mention their Jewish heritage.[4]Even though he played soccer and lacrosse all throughout high school, much of his inspiration came from his father taking him to the cinema as a child, where he developed an interest in film, visual arts and narrative. Meyer died when Mael was 8.[5]
After graduating fromPalisades High School, both brothers enrolled atUCLA;[6]Ron began a course in cinema and graphic arts in 1963 while Russell studied theatre arts and filmmaking during 1966–1968.
Mael is known for his widevocal range, and his most notable vocal trait is a far-reachingfalsetto. AnNMEreview described Russell's vocal range as a "stratospheric blend ofMarc BolanandTiny Tim".[7]
He has recorded 26 albums with his band, Sparks.[8]The band has acult followingaround the world and are best known for the song "This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us", which reached No. 2 on theUK Singles Chart.[9]
The pair appeared as themselves in the 1977 disaster filmRollercoaster, performing live. They also appeared in episode 22 of season 6 ofGilmore Girls. Mael appeared in a cameo as a gallows singer in the 2018 WesternDamsel, and both he and Ron appear as themselves inAnnette, a musical film directed byLeos Caraxthat they wrote and composed.
In June 2018,Edgar Wrightannounced he would be makinga documentaryon Sparks.[10]He had covered the band's concert in London in May at O2 Forum Kentish Town. This concert would also be a part of the documentary.[11][12]The film,The Sparks Brothers, had its world premiere at the2021 Sundance Film Festivalon January 30, 2021.[13]
Since the late 1980s Sparks have almost exclusively recorded in Russell's home studio, to escape the limitations of expensive studio time and maintain creative independence.[14]He mixes and engineers their work, and the brothers co-produce.[15]
In 2017, a reviewer noted that while the brothers' biographies recount a Los Angeles childhood in which they surfed and were both models for mail order catalogues, their private lives are otherwise almost entirely unknown. "Well, we're in good company withBob Dylan", was their reported response. "We feel the less you do know, it keeps the mythology and the image in a better position." Even to the question of whether they have partners or spouses, they refused to give an indication, insisting that "the vagueness is more interesting than the reality."[16]
It was, however, mentioned inEdgar Wright's 2021 documentaryThe Sparks Brothersthat Russell dated Miss Christine ofThe GTOs, and had a brief fling withthe Go-Go'smemberJane Wiedlin, who was an additional vocalist on the Sparks track "Cool Places".[17]
