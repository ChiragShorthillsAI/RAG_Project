The Spine of Nightis a 2021 Americanadult animateddark fantasyhorror filmwritten and directed byPhilip GelattandMorgan Galen King.[1]It starsRichard E. Grant,Lucy Lawless,Patton Oswalt,Betty Gabriel, andJoe Manganiello.
The film was completed usingrotoscoped animation, and traces the centuries-long journey of a magical plant that bestows terrible power upon the user, as it inspires despots, empires, andblack magic.[2]
The story begins with the witch-queen Tzod ascending a snowy mountain.  At its peak, in a giant skull, she confronts the guardian of a mystic flower known as the Bloom.  While the guardian initially threatens her and tries to drive her away, she shows an identical flower, explaining that her people had found where it had cast a seed long ago.
She then begins to tell the events that have led her here, which largely concern a renegade scholar named Ghal-Sur.  After both he and Tzod are thrown in the prison of a young tyrant, she uses the power of the Bloom to help them escape.  Shortly thereafter, Ghal-Sur murders the queen and steals the Bloom from her;  when he returns to his fellow scholars, he is imprisoned for a time, but manages to convince some of them to assist as he performs a ritual to unlock more of the Bloom's power.  He then becomes a tyrant in his own right, marching armies across the countryside and eventually creating great war machines to expand his conquest.  An unknown number of years later, a trio of assassins attempt to stop him, managing only to incinerate his stores of the Bloom instead; the last trace of it travels downstream until it finds the corpse of Tzod, resurrecting her and driving her to seek the guardian as she did in the beginning.
The Guardian also tells the story of the Bloom itself:  The giant skull it rests in was the last god before men killed it, but even that god was the progeny of a greater god, whose severed head formed the world, and the Bloom communicates to those who bear it that this cycle goes on upward and upward without end, eternal and violent.  The Guardian Tzod meets is only the most recent, as they exist in their own cycle: many come seeking the bloom, and each guardian has discovered the bloom, learned its secrets, and concluded its knowledge is unbearable to the world at large.  Each Guardian has defended the bloom for the rest of their lives, until they became too weary, and allowed themselves to be felled by a prospective seeker of the Bloom who learns the massive truth of the universe and decides to conceal it, becoming the next Guardian. It is revealed that the present Guardian had breathed across the Bloom when he first learned its truth, and was the one to initially spread seeds of it.
In the present, Tzod beckons Ghal-Sur to the mountain peak where the Bloom rests, and while his soldiers quickly mortally wound her, she is able to use the Bloom's power to raise the bodies of the previous guardians, who butcher the soldiers and allow Tzod to deal a deathblow to Ghal-Sur.  She is incinerated by the release of power, her skull spinning out into the stars like that of the god who formed the world, while the seeds of the Bloom scatter on the wind.
The Spine of Nightwas directed by Philip Gelatt and Morgan Galen King, who also wrote the script. While King previously worked as an animator, Gelatt is known for his previous work on live-action films. He made the cult horror filmThey Remainand wrote the script for the science fiction mystery dramaEuropa Report. He also wrote the script for 15 episodes of the seriesLove, Death & Robots. After seeing King's short film 'Exordium,' Gelatt approached King about expanding the film into a feature length rotoscoped epic. This project became The Spine of Night.[3]
They wanted to tell an adult story within the fantasy genre. The aesthetic they found appropriate for this was the hand-drawn rotoscope animation, which was preferred in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The drawings were created on the computer, but classically at 12 frames per second, as is usual in rotoscope animation. In this animation technique, artists hand-draw over live-action footage, frame by frame. The hand-animation took seven years, and weeks before the film's premiere atSouth by Southwest, the entire film was almost lost when King'sMicrosoft Windowssystem auto-updated while he slept.[4]
Gelatt and King drew inspiration for their work from fantasy and science fiction illustrations by Frank Frazetta and the work of animatorRalph Bakshi, in particular his 1983 filmFire and Ice.[5]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full¬†list...)
Am√©lie of Leuchtenberg(1812‚Äì1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro¬†I. She was the fourth child ofEug√®ne de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Am√©lie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Am√©liawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Am√©lie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Am√©lie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich D√ºrck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
