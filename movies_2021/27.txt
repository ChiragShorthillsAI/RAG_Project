Appearing in supporting roles areAndré Holland,Bill Camp,Gbenga Akinnagbe,Antoinette Crowe-Legacy, andAlexander Skarsgård. It was filmed inblack-and-white.
Passinghad its world premiere at the2021 Sundance Film Festival, on January 30, 2021, and began alimited theatrical releaseon October 27, 2021, prior to streaming onNetflixon November 10.
The film received acclaim from critics, who praised Hall's screenplay and direction, and the performances of Thompson and Negga. The film was named one of the top ten films of 2021 by theAfrican American Film Critics Association.[2]For her performance, Negga was nominated for theGolden Globe Award, theBAFTAand theScreen Actors Guild Awardfor Best Supporting Actress.
In 1920s New York City, Irene Redfield, a light-skinned black woman living inHarlem, meets a childhood friend, Clare Bellew, by chance at a hotel dining room. Irene is married to a Black doctor. She learns that Clare has been "passing" as white and has married a wealthy white man from Chicago.
Clare invites Irene to her hotel room, so they can talk more openly. Clare explains that after her father died, she was raised by her two white aunts. She married her husband, John, when she was very young. They are interrupted by John, who openly despises and degrades Black people, unaware of his wife's or Irene's racial background. Irene leaves the hotel, angry with Clare, and refuses to respond when Clare writes to her.  However, after Clare unexpectedly shows up at Irene's home and apologizes for the encounter, they rekindle their friendship.
Clare wants to associate with Black people again and invites herself to a dance party that Irene is organizing. Most of the guests at the party find Clare charming, including Irene's husband, Brian. That evening, Irene reveals Clare's secret to her friend, novel writer Hugh Wentworth, who seems less impressed with Clare than the others.
As time passes, Clare becomes involved in all aspects of Irene's life, often joining Irene and Brian to their outings. At first, Irene seems happy to have Clare around, but soon she becomes disillusioned with her and starts to resent her presence. Brian, also dissatisfied, attempts to teach his and Irene's children about some of the harshness of racism in America, as Irene refuses to move anywhere else. Irene believes that the children are too young to learn about the worst events and she and Brian argue about it, further straining their marriage. Brian invites Clare to a tea party from which Irene has purposely excluded her.
When out shopping with her friend, Felise, who is obviously Black, Irene encounters John. She hurries away, as he begins to realize the truth about his wife's racial background. Irene tries to warn Clare but decides against it when she is unable to reach her by phone.
As Brian, Irene, and Clare are on their way to Felise's Christmas party on the top floor of a six-story building, Irene asks Clare what she would do if John ever learned the truth. Clare replies that she would move back to Harlem to be with Irene, who is troubled by this. During the party, Irene remains silent, avoiding the other guests. She opens a large vertical window to smoke.
Suddenly, John angrily forces himself into the apartment demanding to see Clare. She remains calm and moves next to Irene who is standing by the window. John accuses her of being a "dirty liar" and lunges towards her. Clare falls backward out of the window, but it is not clear whether John or Irene pushed her or if she deliberately jumped.
In horror, the other guests rush outside, not knowing whether Clare is dead.  Irene slowly goes downstairs, where the police are questioning guests. Brian says that he believes John pushed Clare, but, when asked, Irene says that she believes the fall was an accident. The film ends with the police declaringdeath by misadventure, Irene sobbing in Brian's arms, and Clare's body being carried away by medics.
It was announced in August 2018 thatRebecca Hallwould be making her directorial debut on the adaptation of theNella Larsennovel, withTessa ThompsonandRuth Neggaset to star in the lead roles.[3]
Hall had begun writing the screenplay a decade earlier, upon reflecting on her own family's history. Her American mother, opera singerMaria Ewing, was ofmixed raceand some of her relatives passed as white, while her father was a white British film and theatre director.
When Hall presented Negga with a screenplay, the actress decided to collaborate to get the film made. She was surprised that Larsen's novel was not better known, as she had been "completely astounded,” when reading it.[4]Thompson said that the film would be shot in black and white, to represent the texture of the period.[5]
André Hollandwas cast in October 2019.[6]In November 2019,Alexander Skarsgårdjoined the cast.[7]
With less than a month to go before filming and production set to begin, Hall was still $500,000 short on her desired $10 million budget. She applied for two grants, to cover the difference.[8]Filming began in November 2019, inNew York City.[9]
The film is inblack and white. Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardianpraised the use of a4:3 aspect ratio, as in this film, it was "both fitting and practical, given a smaller budget".[10]Into the third week of filming, the Hugh Wentworth role, originally intended forBenedict Cumberbatch, remained uncast. Budgetary realities and the tight filming timeline meant the production would need an actor who lived in New York. On November 21,Bill Campsigned on, and filming wrapped in December after a 23-day shoot.[8]
Passinghad its world premiere at the2021 Sundance Film Festivalon January 30, 2021.[11]Shortly after,Netflixacquired distribution rights to the film for around $15 million.[12]It also screened at theNew York Film Festivalon October 3, 2021.[13][14]The film had alimited theatrical releaseon October 27, 2021, prior to streaming on Netflix on November 10.[15]
According toSamba TV, the film was watched in 653,000 households over its first three days of release.[16]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 90% of 250 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's consensus reads: "WhilePassing's delicate approach has a dampening effect on its story, debuting director Rebecca Hall makes the most of an impressive cast—and handles thorny themes with impressive dexterity."[17]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 85 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[18]
Kevin MaherofThe Timesgave the film 4 out of 5 stars, calling it, "a mesmerizing, deeply disquieting experience."[19]Jessica Kiang, writing forVariety, said that the film is "unerring, deceptively delicate, quiet and immaculate, like that final fall of snow."[20]
In his review forThe Guardian,Peter Bradshawpraised Hall's direction, calling the film, "a very stylish piece of work from Hall."[21]Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardian, gave the film a negative review of 2 out of 5 stars, arguing that it had "disappointing lack of verve" and was "inert".[10]
The performances of Negga and Thompson, in particular, received praise. In a very positive review for theChicago Tribune,Michael Phillipsgave the film a perfect score of four out of four stars and wrote of their performances: "What Thompson and Negga accomplish on screen, in this extraordinarily detailed portrait, becomes a master class in incremental revelations."[22]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterlauded Thompson for her "unshowy, beautifully internalized performance,” and Simran Hans called Negga "magnetic" in her review forThe Guardian.[23][24]InTime Magazine's annual list,Stephanie Zacharekranked Negga's performance among the ten best of 2021.[25]
FilmmakerAntonio Campospraised the film, calling it "one of the strongest debut features I've ever seen. Rebecca [Hall]'s grasp of visual storytelling is astounding. It's one thing to know where to put the camera and compose a shot, but to understand how to convey your themes visually is something that even experienced filmmakers struggle with. Rebecca's use of negative space, light and shadow, along with her choices in what was shown and what wasn't to convey not only suspense but her characters' internal struggles, exhibits such a mastery of craft that it is hard to believe she hasn’t been making films her whole life."[26]

Film4 Productionsis a British film production company owned byChannel Four Television Corporation. The company has been responsible for backing many films made in the United Kingdom. The company's first production wasWalter, directed byStephen Frears, which was released in 1982. It is especially known for its gritty,kitchen sink-style films andperiod dramas.
In 1981, producerDavid Roseleft theBBCfor Channel 4 where he was appointed the Commissioning Editor for Fiction byJeremy Isaacs, the channel's founding Chief Executive but became mostly identified with theFilm on Fourstrand. With an initial overall budget of £6 million a year,Channel Four Filmswas to invest in twenty films annually for Film on Four.[1]The first film backed wasNeil Jordan's debut filmAngel(1982).[2]The first film shown as part of Film on Four wasStephen Frears'sWalterwhich was screened on 2 November 1982, the launch date of Channel 4.P'tang, Yang, Kipperbangscreened the following day was also an early highlight.[3]Originally, the company's films were intended for television screenings alone; the "holdback" system prevented investment in theatrical films by television companies because of the length of time (then three years) before broadcasters could screen them. An agreement soon concluded with the Cinema Exhibitors Association allowed a brief period of cinema exhibition if the budget of the films was below £1.25 million.[3]Channel Four Films struck several deals with other film production companies including theBFI Production Board,Goldcrest FilmsandMerchant Ivory.[3]By 1984, Channel Four Films were investing in a third of the feature films made in the UK.[4]
Channel Four's Business Development Department was formed in 1983 for TV and film sales[5]and they also invested in foreign films includingWim Wenders'Paris, Texas(1984) andJan Svankmajer'sAlice(1988).[3]In 1985FilmFour Internationalwas created as a separate international film sales arm and to invest in foreign film, includingAndrei Tarkovsky'sThe Sacrifice(1986).[5][2][3]
Channel Four Film's first big hit was Frears' third feature film for the cinema,My Beautiful Laundrette, in 1985.[6]Originally shot in16mmfor Channel 4 it was met with such critical acclaim at theEdinburgh Film Festivalthat it was acquired byOrion Classicsand distributed to cinemas and became an international success.[7][8][2]
In 1987, FilmFour International agreed a licensing deal with Orion Classics to handle US distribution of two more FilmFour features,Rita, Sue and Bob TooandA Month in the Country.[9]By 1987, Channel 4 had an interest in half the films being made in the United Kingdom.[10]
Rose and Channel Four Films are credited by many as being a significant figure in the regeneration of British cinema and particularly remembered for films such asWish You Were Here,Dance With a Stranger,Mona Lisa, andLetter to Brezhnev. Channel Four Films also invested in earlyWorking Title Filmsas well as most of the films of Frears,Ken LoachandMike Leigh.[2]Leigh told writerHannah Rothschildaround 2008 that Film on Four had saved the British film industry: "This is a non-negotiable, historical fact of life and anybody who suggests that this isn't the case is simply either suffering from some kind of ignorance or has got some terrible chip."[1]
Rose remained in his post as Commissioning Editor until March 1990.[6]During his tenure at Channel 4, Rose approved the making of 136 films, half of which received cinema screenings.[11]Of the films Rose backed, 20 were from overseas sources, including work by directorsTheo Angelopoulos,Andrei TarkovskyandWim Wenders.[12]The company also helped British minority filmmakers includingPo-Chih Leong(Ping Pong(1986));Horace Ové(Playing Away(1986)) andHanif Kureishi(My Beautiful Laundrette;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid(1987)). This continued after Rose's departure with films directed byGurinder Chadha(Bhaji on the Beach(1993)) andSteve McQueen(Hunger(2008)).[13]
David Aukinjoined as head of drama in October 1990 and took over responsibility for Film on Four.[6]He changed his title to head of film in 1997 which he remained until 1998.[2]
The company had another big international success with Jordan'sThe Crying Gamein 1992.[2]In addition it was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Pictureas wasHowards Endthe same year.Damagealso received an Academy Award nomination that year.[6]Later in 1993, Leigh'sNakedand Loach'sRaining Stoneswere entered into competition at the1993 Cannes Film Festival.[6]
The following year,Mike Newell'sFour Weddings and a Funeralbecame thehighest-grossing UK film of all timeandDanny Boyle'sTrainspotting(1996) was also very successful.[2]
In the 1990s, Channel Four partnered withThe Samuel Goldwyn Companyto create a distribution company to release Channel Four films and Goldwyn films in the UK but Goldwyn pulled out late on and in August 1995,Film Four Distributorswas formed.[14]Its first release wasBlue Juice(1995) and its first major successes wereSecrets & LiesandBrassed Offin 1996.[15][16][2]
In 1998, the company was re-branded asFilmFourwith an annual budget of £32 million for 8 to 10 films.[6]East Is East(1999) becomes their biggest self-funded film.[6]In 2000, the company signed a three-year deal withWarner Bros.to make seven films with budgets of more than £13 million but their first,Charlotte Gray(2001) was not the success they hoped for.[6]
The company cut its budget and staff significantly in 2002, due to mounting losses, and was reintegrated into the drama department of Channel 4. The name "Film4 Productions" was introduced in 2006 to tie in with the relaunch of the FilmFour broadcast channel asFilm4.[citation needed]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
