Kushner'ssix-word memoirwas "At least I never votedRepublican."[23][24]Hiscriticism of the Israeli government's treatment ofPalestiniansand the increasedreligious extremisminIsraeli politicsand culture has created some controversy with American Jews,[25]including some opposition to his receiving an honorary doctorate at the 2006 commencement ofBrandeis University. During the controversy, quotes critical ofZionismand Israel made by Kushner were circulated. Kushner said at the time that his quotes were "grossly mischaracterized". Kushner told theJewish Advocatein an interview, "All that anybody seems to be reading is a couple of right-wing Web sites taking things deliberately out of context and excluding anything that would complicate the picture by making me seem like a reasonable person, which I basically think I am."[26]
In an interview with theJewish Independent, Kushner commented, "I want the state of Israel to continue to exist. I've always said that. I've never said anything else. My positions have been lied about and misrepresented in so many ways. People claim that I'm for aone-state solution, which is not true." He later stated that he hopes that "there might be a merging of the two countries because [they're] geographically kind of ridiculous looking on a map", although he acknowledged that political realities make this unlikely in the near future.[27]Kushner has received backlash from family members due to his political views of Israel.[28]
On May 2, 2011, the Board of Trustees of theCity University of New York(CUNY),[29]at their monthly public meeting, voted to remove (by tabling to avoid debate) Kushner's name from the list of people invited to receive honorary degrees, based on a statement by trustee Jeffrey S. Wiesenfeld about Kushner's purported statements and beliefs about Zionism and Israel.[30][31]In response, theCUNY Graduate Center Advocatebegan a live blog on the "Kushner Crisis" situation, including news coverage and statements of support from faculty and academics.[32]Three days later, CUNY issued a public statement that the Board is independent.[33]
On May 6, three previous honorees stated they intended to return their degrees:Barbara Ehrenreich,Michael Cunningham, andEllen Schrecker.[11]Wiesenfeld said that if Kushner would renounce his anti-Israel statements in front of the Board, he would be willing to vote for him.[34]The same day, the Board moved to reverse its decision.[35]Kushner accepted the honorary doctorate at the June 3 graduation for the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.[36]
In March 2024, Kushner was one of several signatories of "A Statement From Jewish Americans Opposing AIPAC", a letter denouncingAIPAC'slobbying efforts in the United States government.[37]
Kushner and his partner,Mark Harris, held a commitment ceremony in April 2003,[38]the first same-sex commitment ceremony to be featured in the Vows column ofThe New York Times.[39]In summer 2008, Kushner and Harris were legally married at the town hall inProvincetown, Massachusetts.[40]

There's something depressing about it, also carnal, wild, and primal," Faist explained.[37]For his performance, Faist received a nomination forBest Actor in a Supporting Roleat the75th British Academy Film Awards.[38]
Faist made hisWest Enddebut in the stage adaptation ofBrokeback MountainasJack Twist, oppositeLucas HedgesasEnnis Del Mar, in May 2023.[39]The production received mixed reviews but Faist earned acclaim with Arifa Akbar ofThe Guardianwriting, "[the two leads] chemistry comes alive as boyish romance, with play fighting and suddenly grabbing ardour...both actors are compelling, Faist especially so as the ebullient Jack".[40]Faist portrayed photographerDanny LyoninJeff Nichols'The BikeridersoppositeAustin Butler,Jodie ComerandTom Hardy.[41]Faist practiced photography and spent a weekend with Lyon, in addition to studying Lyon's personal audio recordings and other material.[42]The film premiered at the 2023Telluride Film Festivalto positive reviews.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
