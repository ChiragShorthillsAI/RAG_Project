Worthis a2021Americanbiographical filmwritten and co-produced byMax Borensteinand directed bySara Colangelo. Based on the memoir by lawyerKenneth Feinberg, the film depicts Feinberg's handling of theSeptember 11th Victim Compensation Fund. It starsMichael Keaton,Stanley Tucci,Amy Ryan,Tate Donovan,Talia Balsam, andLaura Benanti. The film premiered at2020 Sundance Film Festivalon January 24, 2020, where it was acquired byNetflixandHigher Ground Productions. The film was given alimited theatrical releasein the United States on August 27, 2021, followed by a streaming release on Netflix on September 3.
The film opens withKenneth Feinbergdetailing the law's recognition of the monetary value of a person's life to his class atColumbia University. Some time later, theSeptember 11 attacksoccur. Feinberg is appointed theSpecial Masterof theSeptember 11th Victim Compensation Fundwhile his law partner, Camille Biros, is appointed as his administrative deputy. Feinberg develops a rigid formula for each payout based on the victim's income, and is instructed that if he cannot convince at least 80 percent of the 7,000 estimated victims to sign on then they will be eligible to file a lawsuit which they may lose (as well as the pressure from the political administrations to save the airlines from being sued, leading to financial disaster). Feinberg is given until December 22, 2003, to accomplish this.
At an introductory meeting with victims in which he attempts to explain the rules governing the fund, Feinberg is perceived as insensitive to the losses suffered by attendees. The hostile group is calmed when Charles Wolf, the husband of a woman killed in the attacks, demands that they listen to what Feinberg has to say. After the meeting, Feinberg is confronted by Frank Donato, the brother of a deceasedNew York City Fire Department(FDNY) firefighter, Nick. His brother had re-entered the tower to find him after communication, which may not have reached Nick, warned that the building would fail. Frank demands that Feinberg includes this information in the report to remedy this flaw in the communication system for first responders. Feinberg deflects that demand in lawyerly fashion. Feinberg also is disturbed to learn that Wolf was offended by the callous nature of the fund's formula and has started a protest group.
Biros leads the staff in holding meetings with victims and is moved by the story of a gay man, Graham Morris, whose partner (whose parents vehemently denied that their son was gay) was killed in the attack. Due to the rules governing the fund, he cannot be compensated as he is a resident of the state of Virginia, which does not recognize civil partnerships. Feinberg also meets with several lawyers representing the loved ones of upper-class victims of the attacks, who want more money, which threatens the success of the group as a whole. As the months drag on, the fund manages to attract only a fraction of the necessary applicants, leading Feinberg to hold a private meeting with Wolf in which the latter accuses Feinberg of serving only the interests of theBush administration.
A lawyer representing Donato's extra-marital partner calls Feinberg to inform him that Donato has two daughters from that relationship who qualify for compensation. This leads Feinberg to try to inform Donato's widow to convince her to sign on after she had earlier refused. As the months drag on, Feinberg is increasingly unsuccessful in convincing victims to file for compensation from the government fund. After Wolf approaches him one evening at the opera and recounts an anecdote from years earlier in which his deceased wife encouraged him to persevere in the face of failure, Feinberg finds his spirit renewed.
Feinberg and Biros begin to use the discretion government gave him to expand the rules to cover as many victims as they can under the fund. Feinberg begins to meet victims. He constructs a shrine in his office from the various mementos given to him by fund applicants. When Wolf sees that Feinberg truly cares for the victims of the attacks, he is able to convince his fellow victims to trust Feinberg. By the deadline, the vast majority of those eligible for compensation sign the forms, ensuring the success of the project. Feinberg is visited by Donato's widow to sign on behalf of her husband's children. Biros tearfully calls Morris to inform him that while she was unable to help him as the gay partner of a victim, because his state did not recognize their relationship, the fund did compensate many other gay couples who lived in states that recognized same-sex unions. The film ends with a title card stating that Feinberg and Biros were able to distribute billions in government money to 97 percent of eligible victims and that they continue to work on similar cases.

Michael John Douglas, the youngest of seven children, was born atOhio Valley HospitalinKennedy Township, Pennsylvania,[2]on September 5, 1951.[3]He was raised betweenMcKees Rocks,[4]CoraopolisandRobinson Township, Pennsylvania.[5][6]His father, George A.

Keaton first appeared on TV in the Pittsburgh public television programsWhere the Heart IsandMister Rogers' Neighborhood(1975). ForMister Rogershe played one of the "Flying Zucchini Brothers"[17]and served as a full-time production assistant.[18](In 2003, afterFred Rogers' death, Keaton hosted aPBSmemorial tribute,Fred Rogers: America's Favorite Neighbor;[19]in 2018, he hosted a 50th anniversary special of the series for PBS,Mister Rogers: It's You I Like.[20]) Keaton also worked as an actor inPittsburgh theatre; he played the role of Rick in the Pittsburgh premiere ofDavid Rabe'sSticks and Boneswith the Pittsburgh Poor Players.[21]He also performed stand-up comedy during his early years to supplement his income.[22]
Keaton left Pittsburgh and moved to Los Angeles to begin auditioning for various TV parts. He popped up in various popular TV shows includingMaudeandThe Mary Tyler Moore Hour. He decided to use a stage name to satisfySAGrules, as there were already an actor (Michael Douglas) and daytime host (Mike Douglas) with the same or similar names. In response to questions as to whether he selected his new surname due to an attraction to actressDiane Keaton, or inhomageto silent film actorBuster Keaton, he has responded by saying "it had nothing to do with that".[23][24]Keaton has said in several interviews that he searched a phone book under "K", saw "Keaton" and decided to stop looking.[25][26]Keaton's film debut came in a small non-speaking role in theJoan RiversfilmRabbit Test(1978).[27]
His next big break was working alongsideJim Belushiin the short-lived comedy seriesWorking Stiffs, which showcased his comedic talent and led to a co-starring role in the comedyNight Shift(1982) directed byRon Howard. This was his breakout role as the fast-talking schemer Bill "Billy Blaze" Blazejowski and earned Keaton some critical acclaim.[28]
Night Shiftled to Keaton becoming a leading man in the 1983 comedy hitMr. Mom. Keaton was pigeonholed as a comic lead during this time with films likeJohnny Dangerously(1984),Gung Ho(1986),The Squeeze(1987), andThe Dream Team(1989), though Keaton tried to transition to dramatic leads as early as 1984, playing a hockey player inTouch and Go, which was shelved until 1986.Woody Allencast Keaton as the lead inThe Purple Rose of Cairothe following year, but after filming began Allen felt Keaton was "too modern" and reshot his scenes withJeff Danielsin the final film, further delaying his transition to drama in the public eye.[29]WhenTouch and Gowas finally released in 1986 the studio was still unsure of how to market the film, making the poster, trailer and TV spots similar toMr. Mom, which resulted in the film not finding its target audience.
1988 was a seminal year in Keaton's career, in which he landed two major unconventional roles, forever changing his image to audiences.

According toLes Daniels's reference bookBatman: The Complete History, Keaton initially believed the film would be similar in tone to the1960s TV seriesstarringAdam Westbut he understood the darker, brooding side of Batman the film was going for after readingFrank Miller's comic book miniseries,The Dark Knight Returns, which he portrayed to much fan approval.[36]Keaton later reprised the role for the sequelBatman Returns(1992), which was another critically acclaimed success.[37]He was initially set to reprise the role again for a third Batman film, even going as far as to show up for costume fitting.

Maron is from aJewishfamily, originally fromPolandandUkraine, includingDrohobych.[14][15]He lived inWayne, New Jerseyuntil he was six.[16]Maron's father joined theU.S. Air Forcefor two years for hismedical residencyinAlaska, and so Maron and his family moved there. When his father left the Air Force, he moved the family toAlbuquerque, New Mexicoand started a medical practice.[2]Maron lived in Albuquerque from third grade through high school.[17]He graduated fromHighland High School.[18]
In 1986, Maron graduated fromBoston Universitywith a B.A. in English literature.[19][20]
Maron first performed stand-up in 1987 when he was 24 years old.[21]His professional comedy career began atThe Comedy Storein Los Angeles, where he became an associate ofSam Kinison.[22][23]He later moved to New York City and became part of theNew York alternative comedyscene. During the summer of 1994, he appeared several times on Monday open-mic night, coordinated by Tracey Metzger, at the now-closed Greenwich Village location of theBoston Comedy Club. He auditioned unsuccessfully for the 1995Saturday Night Livecast overhaul and attributes being passed over to being high during a meeting with show creator and producerLorne Michaels.[2][24][25]
Maron continued to be a stand-up comedian and also began to appear on television; his voice was used in episodes ofDr. Katz, Professional Therapist,[26]and he hostedShort Attention Span Theaterfor a time.[6]He also recorded half-hour specials forHBOandComedy Central Presentsas well as comedy showcases like theCam Neely Foundationfundraiser, which also featured performers such asJon Stewart,Denis LearyandSteven Wright. He frequently appeared in the live alternative stand-up series he had organized withJaneane GarofalocalledEating It, which used the rock barLuna Loungein New York'sLower East Sideas its venue, from the 1990s until the building was razed in 2005.[27]
His first one-man show,Jerusalem Syndrome, had an extendedoff-Broadwayrun in 2000 and was released in book form in 2001. In 2009, he began workshopping another one-man show,Scorching the Earth. According to Maron (inScorching The Earth), these two shows "bookend" his relationship with his second wife, comicMishna Wolff, which ended in a bitter divorce.[28][29]
In May 2008, he toured withEugene MirmanandAndy KindlerinStand Uppity: Comedy That Makes You Feel Better About Yourself and Superior to Others.In January 2009, a collaboration withSam Seder, which had begun in September 2007 as a weekly hour-long video webcast becameBreakroom Live with Maron & Seder, produced by Air America.[30]Until its cancellation in July 2009, the show was webcast live weekdays at 3 p.m. Eastern, with episodes archived for later viewing. In its final incarnation, the show was informal, taking place in the actual break room of Air America Media, with the cafeteria vending machines just off-camera. This meant occasional distractions when Air America staff and management alike would occasionally come in for food and drink. Maron and Seder held court in an online "post-show chat" with viewers, in an even less formal continuation of each webcast, after the credits had rolled.
Maron's stand-up act is marked by his commitment to self-revelation and cultural analysis. He is particularly known for relentless on-stage exploration of his own relationships with family, girlfriends, and other stand-up comedians whom he has known and befriended over his years in the business.[31]In October 2013, Maron released his first hour-long special through Netflix,Marc Maron: Thinky Pain.[32]Maron would follow this with another special,More Later, which was released in December 2015 throughEpix.[33]
Kliph Nesteroff's 2015 bookThe Comedians: Drunks, Thieves, Scoundrels and the History of American Comedyis dedicated to Maron.[34]
His 2023 specialFrom Bleak to Darkwas namedNew Yorkmagazine's "No. 1 Best Comedy Special of 2023."[35]
From almost the first day of theliberal talk radionetworkAir America's broadcasts in 2004, Maron co-hostedMorning Sedition, a three-hour early-morningradio showwithMark Rileythat aired weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern time.[36]The show was unique in the Air America lineup in its heavy reliance on both live and pre-produced sketch comedy, utilizing the talents of staff writers as well as the on-air hosts. The format was aleft-leaningnear-satire of typical morning "Buddy" radio programs, including recurring characters, interviews and listener call-in segments, and it attracted a loyal fan base.[37]
As 2005 came to an end, it became known that Maron's contract would not be renewed on its December 1, 2005, end date because of problems with then Air America executive Danny Goldberg. Goldberg reportedly did not "get" the comedy or agree with the satiric and often angry tone set by Maron and other writers (Jim EarlandKent Jones) for a morning drive-time show. On November 28, 2005, it was officially announced that Maron's contract had not been renewed. His lastMorning Seditionbroadcast was on December 16, 2005, and the show was discontinued shortly thereafter.[36]
On February 28, 2006, Maron began hosting a nighttime radio program withJim Earlas a sidekick forKTLK Progressive Talk 1150AMin Los Angeles calledThe Marc Maron Showfrom 10:00 pm until midnight PST. The program was frequently delayed (sometimes for over an hour) owing to KTLK's contractual agreement to broadcast local sports events that would often go into overtime.The Marc Maron Showwas never nationally syndicated by Air America despite reported contractual clauses promising such. The show was streamed online live, but the show was not publicized, and the existence of the stream was not well promoted.[citation needed]
On July 5, it was announced that Maron's final episode would be on July 14. A few days before that date, Maron bluntly discussed his long struggle with Air America Radio's executives on-air. In 2008, Marc andSam Sederexpanded their prior collaboration on a weekly hour-long video webcast (streamed at The Sam Seder Show website) into a daily show (and "post-show chat") produced by Air America Media[38]calledMaron v. Seder.[39]The show becameBreakroom Live with Maron & Sederstarting in 2009 and could be viewed on Air America Media's website.[40]On July 15, 2009, after less than one year, Air America Media canceledBreakroom Live. According to the show's hosts, the cancellation was for financial reasons.[41]Ironically, the day before the cancellation, the show got some of the first real publicity it had ever received when MaximumFun.org posted its podcast of an interview with Maron onThe Sound of Young America.[42]
On the finalBreakroom Livewebcast, Maron said that this marked the third time since 2005 he'd been told by an executive at the network that his services would not be required in the immediate future. Co-host Sam Seder pointed out that this would be the end of hisfourthshow at Air America since the troubled network's inception.[43]
Due to a precarious state in his comedic career, on September 1, 2009, Maron began a twice-weeklypodcastcalledWTF with Marc Maronin what Maron would later describe in a 2015 interview as a "Hail Mary pass"; his first-ever guest was fellow stand-upJeff Ross.[44][45]In a free-form discussion, Maron and his guests touch on topics like the arc of the interviewees' careers, their shared past experiences, and stories from the road.[38]As of 2024, Maron has released more than 1,500 episodes of the show, garnering critical acclaim and more than 600 million downloads;[46][47][48]notable guests includePresident Barack Obama,Sir Paul McCartney,Robin Williams,Jerry Seinfeld,Chris Rock,Lorne Michaels,Leonardo DiCaprio, andBrad Pitt. The show has been noted for its influence on other long-form interview podcasts that emerged after its debut.[49][50][51]In April 2021, it was announced that Maron and his producer Brendan McDonald would be the recipients of the first-ever Governors Award by the Podcast Academy for Excellence in Audio (The Ambies) for their work onWTF.[52]The success of Maron's podcast opened up numerous other avenues on film and TV as well as giving him a massive boost to audience attendance at his stand-up shows.
His only major film credit for many years was a small part credited as "angry promoter" in the 2000Cameron CrowefilmAlmost Famous, in which he is first seen fighting withNoah Taylor's character and then yelling at and chasing after the main characters as they drive away on a bus, at which point he yells, "Lock the gates!" which is now used in the intro to his podcasts.[53]He was also featured at the Luna Lounge in the 1997 mockumentaryWho's the Caboose?starringSarah SilvermanandSam Seder.[54]In 2019, Maron starred in aLynn Shelton–directed comedy film titledSword of Trust.[55]In 2020, Maron played publicist Ron Oberman oppositeJohnny Flynn'syoung David Bowie in the movieStardust.[56]

Maron, a television series created by and starring Maron for a 10-episode first season, premiered onIFCon May 3, 2013.[59]The show is loosely autobiographical, revolving around Maron's life as a twice-divorced sober comedian running a comedy podcast out of his garage but establishing many differences between the real-life Maron and the version of him on TV. As the executive producer and star ofMaron, Maron appeared in all 51 episodes of the show from 2013 to 2016, portraying a fictionalized version of himself.[60]The show ended in 2016 after four seasons onIFC.[61]Maron directed two episodes of the show, "The Joke" and "Ex-Pod."

In an interview withKCRW, Maron stated, "I have no idea why they asked me to play guitar on the track. I'm only good at one thing on the guitar. It just so happens it was exactly the thing they needed."[71]
Reviews for the solo were positive.IFC's Melissa Locker said "Marc Maron plays a mean guitar."[72]Spin's Chris Martins called the guitar solo a "shredfest" as well as "angular."[73]The Strangercalled it "a frequency-fraying guitar solo that's better than you'd expect, although it won't makeJ Mascisjealous."[74]
Maron wrote and performed on the score for his filmSword of Trust.[75]
Maron lived inAstoria, Queens, through the 1990s and most of the 2000s, but moved back to Los Angeles in late 2009.[76]Maron also speaks openly of his caring for numerous stray cats that he takes into his home. This has led him to refer to his home, on theWTFpodcast, as the "Cat Ranch".[77]After his cat Boomer went missing, Maron began incorporating the catchphrase "Boomer lives!" to the end of each podcast. Since then, he has one addition to the "Cat Ranch" by the name of Buster Kitten. LaFonda died in December 2019. After she passed, Maron briefly replaced "Boomer lives!" with "LaFonda lives!" for a few episodes of his podcast. Monkey died in August 2020.

Maron has been married twice, to Kimberly Reiss andMishna Wolff, a former stand-up comedian. Both relationships have figured prominently in his act. During numerous appearances at theEdinburgh Fringefestival in 2007, Maron riffed on his then-recent separation and divorce from Wolff.
