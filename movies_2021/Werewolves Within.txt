Forest ranger Finn Wheeler is assigned to cover Beaverfield, a small town where the residents are divided over a pipeline proposed by businessman Sam Parker. Upon arriving, Finn befriends mail carrier Cecily Moore while also meeting Trisha Anderson and her unfaithful husband Pete, wealthy couple Devon and Joaquim Wolfson, blue-collar workers Gwen and Marcus, and isolationist Emerson Flint. That night, a blizzard knocks out all power in Beaverfield, forcing the residents to take refuge in a lodge owned by Jeanine Sherman. The power outage occurs right before Trisha's dog is killed by an unknown assailant, which increases tensions in the town. Further conflict arises when Finn discovers that all of Beaverfield's generators were sabotaged and the body of Jeanine's missing husband Dave is underneath the lodge's porch.
The residents attempt to barricade themselves in the lodge for safety, but Pete has his hand bitten off by the same unknown assailant. Environmentalist Dr. Jane Ellis, an opponent of the pipeline, concludes that the assailant is a werewolf who is one of the lodge's current inhabitants. After announcing her findings, Dr. Ellis dies in front of Parker under ambiguous circumstances; Parker claims she committed suicide.
Those remaining in the lodge initially consider staying together to force the assailant out of hiding, but ultimately all but Finn and Cecily leave for their homes. However, with tensions having reached a boiling point in Beaverfield, the residents begin to kill each other out of self-interests. After nearly all the townsfolk are killed, Finn is attacked by Parker, who accuses Finn of being the werewolf because he worked in locations where previous attacks occurred. Finn counters that there is no werewolf and Parker intentionally caused the paranoia gripping Beaverfield in order to have his proposed pipeline approved. Parker gains the upper hand against Finn, but a dying Joaquim manages to kill him.
While Finn and Cecily recuperate in the town's bar, Finn learns that Dave was Beaverfield's previous mail carrier after finding undelivered packages in the back room and Dave's name tag. He then realizes Cecily is the werewolf. Confronted by Finn, Cecily acknowledges she turned the residents against each other to make feasting on them easier. She subsequently attempts to kill Finn in her werewolf form, but Finn defeats her with the help of Emerson. Still alive, Cecily makes a final effort to attack Finn and Emerson before Jeanine finishes her off with a crossbow.
In October 2018, it was announcedWerewolves Withinwas being developed as a feature film, withMishna Wolffset to write the screenplay for the film, whileUbisoft Motion Pictureswould produce.[4]Director Josh Ruben joined after his first feature film,Scare Me(2020), attracted the attention ofUbisoft, who provided him with "a V.R. thing to play [the game]", he said.[5]In January 2020, it was announcedSam Richardsonhad joined the cast of the film and would serve as a producer, withJosh Rubento direct.[6]In February 2020,Michael Chernus,Michaela Watkins,Cheyenne Jackson,Milana Vayntrub,George Basil,Sarah Burns,Catherine Curtin, Wayne Duvall,Harvey Guillén, and Rebecca Henderson joined the cast of the film.[7][8]
Principal photographybegan on February 3, 2020.[9][10]While the video game is set in a medieval village, the film is set in the modern day and was shot in New York State'sHudson Valley, near the town ofWoodstock.[5]Locations included Main Street inPhoenicia, New York, and The Phoenicia Belle bed-and-breakfast,[11]as well asCooper Lake,[9]and The Golden Notebook bookstore in Woodstock.[9]The historic Fleischmanns Yeast family estate, now the retreat center, Spillian, inFleischmanns, New York, served as the Beaverfield Inn, and as production headquarters.[12]
Ruben said the film's low budget prevented it from being able to afford to license theU.S. Postal Servicelogo, resulting in cast-member Milana Vayntrub playing a postal worker for the "'National Mail Service' or something." He also explained that the cast's wardrobe was deliberately exaggerated: "I wanted the wardrobes to look like they might get turned into action figures. Someday, someone may want to dress up as these characters forHalloween."[5]
AfterIFC Filmsacquired distribution rights to the film,Werewolves Withinhad its world premiere at theTribeca Film Festivalin June 2021.[13]The film received alimited theatrical releasein the United States on June 25, 2021, followed byvideo on demandon July 2, 2021.[14]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 148 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Werewolves Withinis the rare horror comedy that offers equal helpings of either genre – and adds up to a whole lot of fun in the bargain."[16]It is the highest-rated film based on a video game on Rotten Tomatoes.[3][17]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 17 critic reviews, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[18]As of 2025[update]it is the highest-rated film based on a video game on Metacritic.[19][20][21]
Tomris Laffley ofVarietysaid that "despite all the severed, bloody body parts ...Werewolves Withinis more playfully thrilling than scary in tone" and that the screenwriter "fashions all her characters with memorable attributes and plenty of social observations, yielding a compelling range of suspects none of which you can write off entirely."[22]Calling the film "Cluewith werewolves", A.A. Dowd ofThe A.V. Clubgave the film a B- grade, saying that Ruben's "sensibilities shine lunar bright through the way the film privileges collisions of personality in contained spaces over creature-feature thrills."[23]Jennifer Ouellette ofArs Technicawrote, "Werewolves Withinis first and foremost a successful comedy, and the ridiculously talented cast members all possess the skills and onscreen ensemble chemistry to make the script come alive."[24]The Guardian'sLeslie Felperin gave it 4 out of 5 stars, calling it a "goofy horror comedy" and saying it "just goes to prove that if you have a great cast, smart direction and witty script you can just about get away with murder."[25]
Noel Murray of theLos Angeles Timescalled it "[b]oth funny and snappy," and that its "catchy concept is made even more entertaining by a cast of accomplished comic actors." However, he also said there was "an overall lack of urgency or danger, related to the comedic tone. Because the characters are a bit silly, it's hard to become too invested in whether or not they get disemboweled."[26]The Age'sJake Wilson gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars, calling it "a film that wants to please and to some extent succeeds in doing so, without ever being very funny or very alarming."[27]The New York Times'Lena Wilson wrote, "Werewolves Withincould interrogate sexism, classism or America's increasingly divided politics, among other things. Instead, this overstuffed script drips with blink-and-you'll-miss-them jokes that lampoon everything and challenge nothing, least of all monstrosity itself."[28]
In a review ofWerewolves WithininBlack Gate, Sue Granquist said "why do I thinkWerewolves Withinis worthy? First of all, its origin story is kind of cool."[29]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
