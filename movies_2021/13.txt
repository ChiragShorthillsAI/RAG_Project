Free Cityis anonline game[8]developed by Soonami Studios. Its "players" (the online persons who have real lives beyond Free City) wear sunglasses and spend their time fighting each other and causing mayhem. Thenon-player characters(NPCs) accept the chaos while living out their scripted lives, unaware that the world they live in is a video game. These NPCs include Guy, who works as a clerk in Free City's bank with his best friend, security guard Buddy.
Unemployed software developer Millie Rusk playsFree Cityto find proof that Soonami stole the source code from the concept game she developed,Life Itself,which included novelartificial intelligencetechniques for its NPCs. Her friend and co-developer Walter "Keys" McKey is reluctant to help, as he now works in technical support at Soonami. Millie'savatar"MolotovGirl" catches Guy's attention by singing his favorite song "Fantasy". Guy then begins to deviate from his programming, accidentally shooting a player robbing the bank and leaving with her character's sunglasses.
Believing Guy to be a hacker disguised as an NPC, Keys and his coworker Mouser unsuccessfully try to ban him from the game. Accessing the players' view of the game, Guy visits new areas and meets Millie atvloggerRevenjamin Buttons' stash house, where they attempt to steal evidence leading to her source code. Believing Guy to be anovice player, she advises him tolevel up. Guy rapidly progresses through the game by completing missions benevolently, standing out from other players and becoming a worldwide sensation known as "Blue Shirt Guy".
As Keys realizes that Guy truly is an NPC, other NPCs that Guy interacts with also begin to develop self-awareness. However,Free City 2is due to release in 48 hours and will replaceFree City,terminating all of its NPCs. Millie tells Guy the truth about his existence, but he becomes distraught and breaks off contact. Guy eventually realizes that there is something more to an NPC's existence, and goes with Buddy to get the evidence Millie wanted from Buttons, who accidentallyglitchedthrough the edge ofFree City's map and discovered an older build ofLife Itself, recording avideo clipin the process. Guy's popularity threatens the plans of Soonami's CEO Antwan Hovachelik to launchFree City 2, so he orders a server reboot which resets Guy's memories. Guy regains his self-awareness when Millie kisses him.
Guy recalls the location of an island containing remnants of theLife Itselfbuild and they attempt to reach it before theFree City 2launch wipes all old content from the servers. Antwan fires Keys, has every player removed fromFree City,and sends an unfinished Guy-resembling character named Dude into the game. Initially overwhelmed, Guy then puts his sunglasses on Dude, distracting him. Guy then proceeds to the island. Furious, Antwan begins smashing the game servers with an axe in a last-ditch attempt to stop Guy, erasing Buddy and much of the game world, while firing Mouser. Before he can destroy the final server, Millie offers a deal to not sue him for copyright infringement and surrender theFree Cityfranchise's profits to him in exchange for her creation.
Sometime later, sales forFree City 2slip because ofbugsin the code andlaggingonline play. An embattled Antwan is in the crosshairs, but claims he is a victim of circumstance. Millie salvages her code and along with Keys and Mouser, releases theindie gameFree Life, which includes Guy, Dude, and the other NPCs fromFree City. Guy reveals to Millie that his code is actually a love letter to her from Keys. During the development ofLife Itself,Keys had encoded what he knew about her tastes into an AI routine in the game, which was eventually incorporated intoFree City, explaining why Guy felt drawn to MolotovGirl. After Millie leaves the game, she and Keys kiss. Meanwhile, Guy and Dude reunite with Buddy, who was reconstructed.

In August 2016,Matt Liebermanspent three weeks writing the first draft of thespec scriptforFree Guy.[20]This was sold and entered development at 20th Century Fox prior tobeing acquiredbyThe Walt Disney Company.Free Guyis one of the first Fox films to continue production under Disney's ownership, as well as under the studio's new name of20th Century Studios.[21]DirectorShawn Levyoriginally passed on the script. After he was introduced toRyan Reynoldsby a mutual friendHugh Jackman(whom Levy directed inReal Steeland Reynolds costarred with inX-Men Origins: Wolverine), Levy and Reynolds decided to work onFree Guyafter rereading it together.[4]Reynolds, who also produced the film, said, "I haven't been this fully immersed and engaged in something sinceDeadpool."[21]Levy had previously been attached to the filmUncharted, an adaptation of thevideo game series of the same name, before he left to makeFree Guy.[22]
Principal photography began on May 14, 2019,[23]inBoston, mostly around the city'sFinancial District.[24][25]It also took place in theMassachusettscities ofWorcester,[26]Framingham(in the former Framingham Savings Bank building),[27]andWeymouth(at the formerNaval Air Station),[28]as well as atRevere Beach[29]and theParamount Picturesstudio headquarters inLos Angeles,California. Filming concluded on July 31, 2019.[23]
Levy decided to hire production designerEthan Tobmanover other candidates with more feature film experience after being inspired by the energy he brought to the project. Together they created a visual bible laying out the rules for their video game world. To split the real world from the in-game look they specified colors, lenses, composition and framing, camera movement, and other details.[22]Levy found it liberating to be influenced by other games and films but not required to make a direct adaptation of an existing franchise.[22]Tobman said the film's game-world design drew primary inspiration from games likeSimCity,The SimsandRed Dead Redemption 2, while also acknowledging thematic inspiration fromGrand Theft AutoandFortnite.[8]In order to help Reynolds fully tap into his Guy character after Deadpool, Levy suggested that he tap into his Canadian background and act very friendly, full of joy, a typical Canadian citizen. He also found inspiration in Peter Sellers' role inBeing Thereand Will Ferrell's role inElfbecause they played characters who were similar to Guy's character being simple-minded.[30]
The film features several weapons from other video game and film franchises, including a Mega Buster fromMega Man, alightsaberfromStar Wars, one ofFortnite'spickaxes, thegravity gunfromHalf-Life 2, the portal gun fromPortal, as well asCaptain America'sshieldandHulk's fist from theMarvel Cinematic Universe. When the film was acquired by Disney, which owns theMarvelandStar Warsfranchises, the filmmakers made a request to use iconic weapons from those properties, and were granted permission to use everything they requested.[16][8][22]The cameo byChris Evanswas suggested by Reynolds' wifeBlake Lively.[31]Levy contacted Evans, who was already in Boston shootingDefending Jacoband asked if he would come by for ten minutes, and he agreed.[32]
The film's score was composed byChristophe Beck.[33]Portions of the film's score are sampled from the Disney animated short filmPaperman, which Beck had previously scored. Levy had originally intended to use the song "Your Love" bythe Outfield, but Reynolds suggested using "Fantasy" byMariah Careyinstead.[16]Reynolds talked to Carey about obtaining permission to use it and she allowed them to use the song throughout the film.[34]A cover version of "Fantasy" sung by Comer was also used in the film.[16][22]
When promoting the film in 2019, Reynolds and Waititi joked that it was nice to work together for the first time, pretending that they knew nothing about their previous experience working together on the poorly-received 2011Green Lanternfilm.[35][36][37]In July 2021, Reynolds released a video onYouTubetitledDeadpool and Korg React, in which he reprised his role asWade Wilson/Deadpoolfrom theX-Menfilm seriesand Waititi reprised his role asKorgfrom theMarvel Cinematic Universereacting to the trailer toFree Guy.[38]
On August 12, 2021, Dude became a purchasable outfit in the video gameFortnitealongside a series of optional quests placed into the game to allow players to unlock anemotewith Reynolds's voice.[39]Free Guy's marketing team created parody posters in the style of other video games, includingSuper Mario 64,Minecraft,Among Us,Grand Theft Auto: Vice City,Mega Man,Street Fighter II,Doom, andAnimal Crossing: New Horizons.[40]

Peter Debruge ofVarietymagazine called the film an "at-times unwieldy mashup of multiple-reality blockbusters likeThe MatrixandThe Lego Movie" and said that "Free Guyis a lot of fun, despite the fact that Levy and the screenwriters seem to be changing the rules as they go."[66]Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timeslauded both the "perfectly cast" Reynolds and "superb and charming Jodie Comer." Giving the film three out of four stars, he wrote "Thanks in large part to the vibrant, funny, sweet, endearing work by Reynolds and Comer,Free Guydelivers."[67]A.A. Dowd ofThe A.V. Clubgave the film a C+ grade and said, "For all its casual mayhem,Free Guyturns out to be a rather cuddly crowdpleaser, a high-concept blockbuster trifle with bubblegum ice cream clogging its circuits." Dowd contrasted the film withThe Truman Show, saying "Reynolds replicates that slightly unhinged Truman Burbank grin but not the desperation behind it."[68]Nick De Semlyen ofEmpirewas critical of the film; he compared it unfavorably to 2018'sReady Player One, and said that although it is "eager to please" it "doesn't really hang together, even as you're watching it."[69]

[The first movie] was such a joyous experience -- so to hear that that may be in the cards sound like a ton of fun."[87]
In September 2023, Levy said the story for the sequel was being revised in response to the filmBarbie. Levy stated, "We are developing a sequel, but the truth is that you now have Barbie that has obviously left a mark about a character in a fictional world who comes to self-awareness. So, we're only gonna makeFree Guy 2if it's different than the first movie and if it's different from other movies."[88]

While in high school, Comer's friends removed her from their dance group when a holiday with her family clashed with rehearsals for the school's talent show, prompting her to instead perform her Hillsborough disaster monologue for the show.[10]Although she did not win, her performance prompted her drama teacher to call in a favour from friends in the entertainment industry, allowing her to audition for aBBC Radio 4play.[11]This became her first acting job, with her co-stars advising her to get an agent and telling her that she could have a successful acting career.[12][13]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
