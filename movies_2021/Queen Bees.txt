Fiercely independent senior Helen is under pressure from her daughter Laura to move into Pine Grove retirement community. The widowed Helen opposes this, but has little option after she locks herself out of her home—again—while a fire from her cooking destroys her kitchen. Repairs will take at least a month, and she moves temporarily into Pine Grove.
At Pine Grove, Helen initially has trouble fitting into a social scene dominated by the Queen Bees, led by Janet, and by the few unattached males, such as Arthur. Her mother's loneliness dismays Laura, a real estate agent who has connections to the owners of the real estate Pine Grove would like to expand onto, and she threatens facility manager Ken that if her mother does not fit in, the real estate will be sold to another potential buyer. After the sudden death of a bridge partner, Queen Bee Sally gives Helen a chance as her replacement. With bridge to interest her, and a growing relationship with a new resident, Dan Simpson, Helen begins to feel more at home.
Helen becomes close to Sally, and when Helen suggests the facility is just like high school, Sally reminds her it is worse: high school eventually ends with graduation and the start of adult life, whereas Pine Grove's residents have only death or medical deterioration in front of them. Still, Helen is reluctant to let the relationship with Dan progress far, as she feels loyal to the memory of her late husband, which also makes her unwilling to sell the family home. Janet remains hostile to Helen, and after witnessing Ken and Dan arguing, and Ken threatening the older man that an agreement they have made will be exposed to Helen, Janet learns that Ken has hired Dan, a retired staff member of one of Pine Grove's rivals, to move in and make Helen more accepting of the life there. Helen earns the friendship of Janet (who has been abandoned by her family) by arranging a surprise birthday party for her, but by then Janet has already told Laura who Dan is, and she tells her mother. Convinced that Dan has only been nice to her because he has been paid to be, Helen breaks off their relationship.
Learning that Dan has been kicked out of the community and has returned his salary, Helen reconsiders, but when she goes to Dan's forwarding address, finds a woman there. The two reconcile when Helen learns the woman is his sister and Dan professes his love for Helen. The couple marries. Helen sells her house, and the two will reside at Pine Grove.

His first film wasIrma la Douce(1963), in which he had an uncreditedbit partas a U.S. soldier with a transistor radio more interested in a baseball game than the girl.[24]According toFilminkmagazine:
People thought Caan was going to be a star pretty much from the get-go. And it's not hard to see why. Watch him in his early movies and TV appearances, and he's simply got "it": he was handsome, virile-looking, and could act (New York trained, Broadway broken). Most of all, he had X factor: a nervous energy and intensity that you can feel off the screen. A lot of stars take a while to warm up – Caan was good from the beginning.[25]
Caan's first substantial film role was as a punk hoodlum who gets his eyes poked out in the 1964thrillerLady in a Cage, which starredOlivia de Havilland, who praised Caan's performance.[26]He had roles inThe Alfred Hitchcock HourandWagon Train.[27]He was fourth-billed in a Western feature,The Glory Guys(1965).[28]He turned down the starring role in a TV series around this time, saying, "I want to be an actor not a millionaire."[29]
In 1965, Caan landed his first starring role, inHoward Hawks' auto-racing dramaRed Line 7000.[30]It was not a financial success.

None of these films, apart fromEl Dorado, was particularly successful at the box office, includingRabbit, Run(1970), based on theJohn Updikenovel of the same name, in which Caan had the lead. He said it "was a film I really wanted to do, really wanted to be involved with."[39]"No one would put me in a movie", he later recalled. "They all said, 'His pictures never make money'."[40]
Caan returned to the small screen with the TV movieBrian's Song(1971), playing dying football playerBrian Piccolo, oppositeBilly Dee Williams.[41]Caan did not want to return to television and turned down the role several times,[42]but changed his mind after reading the script. The film was a huge critical success and Caan's performance earned him an Emmy nomination.[40]He got a deal to make a film and agreed to be inT.R. Baskin.[43]
The following year, Coppola cast him as the short-temperedSonny CorleoneinThe Godfather. Originally, Caan was cast asMichael Corleone(Sonny's youngest brother); both Coppola and Caan demanded that this role be played byAl Pacino, so Caan could play Sonny instead.Robert De Nirowas also considered to play Sonny. Although another actor,Carmine Caridi, was already signed to play Sonny, the studio eventually insisted on having Caan,[44]so he remained in the production.[45]Caan was nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actorfor his performance in the film,[46]along with co-starsRobert Duvalland Pacino.[47]Caan was closely identified with the role for years afterward: "They called me a wiseguy. I won Italian of the Year twice in New York, and I'm Jewish, not Italian.... I was denied in a country club once. Oh yeah, the guy sat in front of the board, and he says, 'No, no, he's a wiseguy, been downtown. He's amade guy.' I thought, What? Are you out of your mind?"[48]
Caan was now established as a leading movie star.[49]He was in a road movie,Slither(1973), based on a script byW. D. Richter;[50]and a romantic comedy withMarsha Mason,Cinderella Liberty(1973), directed byMark Rydell.[51]He received good reviews for playing the title role inThe Gambler(1974), based on a script byJames Tobackoriginally written forRobert De Niro, and directed byKarel Reisz.[52]More popular at the box office was the action comedyFreebie and the Bean(1974) withAlan Arkin.[53]
Caan reprised his role as Sonny Corleone for a flashback scene inThe Godfather Part II(1974).[54]He had a hit withFunny Lady(1975) playingBilly RoseoppositeBarbra Streisand'sFanny Brice.[55]Caan starred in two action films,Norman Jewison'sRollerball(1975) as a star athlete of a deadly extreme sport,[56]andSam Peckinpah'sThe Killer Elite(1975). Both were popular, though Caan hatedElite.[57]He made a cameo inMel Brooks'Silent Movie(1976),[58]and tried comedy with Rydell'sHarry and Walter Go to New York(1976).[59]Caan was so unhappy with the latter he sacked his management.[60]He said he did not want to makeEliteorHarrybut "people kept telling me I had to be commercial."[61]
Caan was one of many stars in the war filmA Bridge Too Far(1977).[62]He had a change of pace when he went to France to makeAnother Man, Another Chance(1977) for directorClaude LelouchalongsideGeneviève Bujold,[63]which Caan did for "peanuts"[64]and "loved" the experience.[60]
Back in the United States, Caan made a modern-day Western,Comes a Horseman(1978), withJane Fondafor directorAlan J. Pakula.[65]He was reunited with Marsha Mason in the film adaptation ofNeil Simon's autobiographicalChapter Two(1979).[66]Caan later said he only did the film for the money as he was trying to raise money for his directorial debut, but it was a success at the box office.[67]
In 1978, Caan directedHide in Plain Sight, a film about a father searching for his children, who were lost in theWitness Protection Program.[68]Despite critical praise, the film was only moderately successful with the public.[69]
During Caan's peak years of stardom, he rejected a series of starring roles that proved to be successes for other actors, in films includingM*A*S*H,The French Connection,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,Close Encounters of the Third Kind,Kramer vs. Kramer("it was such middle class bourgeois baloney"[70]),Apocalypse Now(because Coppola "mentioned something about 16 weeks in the Philippine jungles"[64]),Blade Runner,Love Story, andSuperman("I didn't want to wear the cape".[64]).[70][71]In 1977, Caan rated several of his movies out of ten –The Godfather(10),Freebie and the Bean(4),Cinderella Liberty(8),The Gambler(8),Funny Lady(9),Rollerball(8),The Killer Elite(5),Harry and Walter Go to New York(0),Slither(4),A Bridge Too Far(7), andAnother Man Another Chance(10).[60]He also liked his performances inThe Rain PeopleandThief.[72]
Caan had a role in Claude Lelouch'sLes Uns et les Autres(1981), which was popular in France,[73]and won the Technical Grand Prize at the1984 Cannes Film Festival.[74]InHollywood, Caan appeared in theneo-noirfilmThief(1981), directed byMichael Mann, in which he played a professionalsafe cracker.[75]Although the film was not successful at the time, Caan's performance was widely lauded and the movie has acquired something of a cult following.[76]Caan always praised Mann's script and direction and often said that, next toThe Godfather,Thiefwas the movie of which he was proudest.[77]
From 1982 to 1987, Caan suffered from depression over his sister's death fromleukemia, a growing problem withcocaine, and what he described as "Hollywood burnout"[70]and did not act in any films.
In a 1992 interview, Caan said that this was a time when "a lot of mediocrity was produced. Because I think that directors got to the point where they made themselves too important. They didn't want anything or anybody to distract from their directorial prowess. There were actors who were good and capable, but they would distract from the special effects. It was a period of time when I said, 'I'm not going to work again.'"[78]
He walked off the set ofThe Holcroft Covenantand was replaced byMichael Caine. Caan devoted much of his time during these years to coaching children's sports.[16]In 1985, he was in a car crash.[79]Caan considered retiring for good but instead of being "set for life", as he believed, he found out one day that "I was flat-ass broke... I didn't want to work. But then when the dogs got hungry and I saw their ribs, I decided that maybe now it's a good idea."[80]
Caan returned to acting in 1987, when Coppola cast him as an army platoon sergeant for the3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)inGardens of Stone, a movie that dealt with the effect of theVietnam Waron the United States homefront.[81]He only received a quarter of his pre-hiatus salary, and then had to kick in tens of thousands more to the completion bond company because ofHolcroft. "I don't know what it is, but, boy, when you're down, they like to stomp on you", he said.[80]The movie was not a popular success butAlien Nation(1988), where Caan played a cop who partnered with an alien, did well. The film received atelevision spinoff.[82]He had a support role as Spaldoni, under much make up, inWarren Beatty'sDick Tracy.[83]
Caan was planning to make an action film in Italy, but then heardRob Reinerwas looking for a leading man in his adaptation ofStephen King'sMisery(1990). Since the script forMiserycalled for the male lead, Paul Sheldon, to spend most of his time lying in bed tormented by his nurse, the role was turned down by many of Hollywood's leading actors before Caan accepted.[80]Caan had a small role inThe Dark Backward(1991) and co-starred withBette Midlerin the expensiveFor the Boys(1991), directed by Rydell who called Caan "one of the four or five best actors in America".[70]

Her only charting album wasBeauty and the Beard(1964), on which she was accompanied by trumpeterAl Hirt. Other career highlights included appearing onThe Jack Benny Programin 1961 and singing theBachelor in Paradisetheme at the34th Academy Awardsin 1962. Her contract with RCA Victor ended in 1966. In 1963,Life Magazinementioned that her recordings had sold in excess of half a million units.[20]
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she had hits on the dance charts, the most successful being 1979's "Love Rush", which peaked at number eight on the disco/dance charts.[21]In 2001, working withArt Greenhaw, she recorded the albumGod Is Love: The Gospel Sessions. The album went on to earn a Grammy nomination (forty years after her first) and also aDove Awardnomination for gospel album of the year. Her albumAnn-Margret's Christmas Carol Collection, also produced and arranged by Greenhaw, was recorded in 2004.[22]2011 saw the release of "God is Love: The Gospel Sessions 2"
In 2023, she went back into the studio to record a full-length album of new recordings for Cleopatra Records. "Born to Be Wild" featured 13 covers including "Splish Splash", "Earth Angel", "Son of A Preacher Man", and a new take on "Teach Me Tonight" featuringPat Boone. Other guest performers includedPete Townshend,The Fuzztones,Paul Shaffer,The Oak Ridge Boys, and more.[23]The album was released on 14 April 2023, on vinyl, compact disc, and on all streaming platforms.
In 1961, Ann-Margret filmed ascreen testat20th Century Foxand was signed to a seven-year contract.[24]She made her film debut in a loan-out toUnited ArtistsinFrank Capra'sPocketful of MiracleswithBette Davis; it is a remake of Capra's ownLady for a Day(1933). For her performance Ann-Margret was awarded her firstGolden Globe, forNew Actress of the YearalongsideJane FondaandChristine Kaufmann.[25]
Then came a 1962 remake ofRodgers and Hammerstein's musicalState Fair, in which she played the "bad girl" role of Emily oppositeBobby DarinandPat Boone. She had previously tested for the part of Margie, the "good girl", but the studio bosses deemed her too seductive for that role.[26]In her autobiography, Ann-Margret wrote that the two roles seemed to represent the two sides of her real-life personality. She was shy and reserved offstage but wildly exuberant and sensuous onstage, transforming "from Little Miss Lollipop to Sexpot-Banshee", in her words.[27]In a 2021 retrospective of Ann-Margret's career forFilmInk, Stephen Vagg argued "she wasn't that well cast as a bad girl. Because she had so much energy and shape, producers thought she was; but she was more effective in parts closer to what she was in real life: an energetic good girl with a twinkle in the eye."[28]
Her performance as the all-American teenager Kim inBye Bye Birdie(1963) made her a major star. Its premiere at Radio City Music Hall, 16 years after her first visit to the famed theater, was the highest first-week grossing film to date at the Music Hall.Lifemagazine put her on the cover for the second time and announced that the "torrid dancing almost replaces the central heating in the theater."[29][30]Her performance earned her a Golden Globe nomination forBest Actress. She was then asked to sing "Baby Won't You Please Come Home" at PresidentJohn F. Kennedy's private birthday party at theWaldorf Astoria New York, one year afterMarilyn Monroe's famous "Happy Birthday to You".[31]A few months later, Ann-Margret voiced an animated version of herself, named "Ann-Margrock", on the television seriesThe Flintstones.[32]She sang the ballad "The Littlest Lamb" as alullabyas well as the rocker, "Ain't Gonna Be a Fool".
Ann-Margret metElvis Presleyon theMGMsoundstage when the two filmedViva Las Vegas(1964).Filminkargued "She had so much energy and pep that she had blown her previous three male co-stars off screen, but Elvis could match her. He was the best on-screen partner she ever had, and she was his."[28]She recorded three duets with Presley for the film: "The Lady Loves Me", "You're the Boss", and "Today, Tomorrow, and Forever"; only "The Lady Loves Me" made it into the final film and none of them were commercially released until years after Presley's death, due to concerns byColonel Tom Parkerthat Ann-Margret's presence threatened to overshadow Elvis.[33]ChoreographerDavid Winterswas hired because Ann-Margret was his dance student and recommended him for the job.[34]It was Winters' first choreographer credit on film. He would go on to become a common collaborator for both Presley and Ann-Margret.
Bye Bye BirdieandViva Las Vegashad established Ann-Margret as Hollywood's biggest new star, but a string of box-office flops followed until October 1965. The first,Kitten with a Whip, saw Ann-Margret give a "balls-to-the-wall performance" as a juvenile delinquent who entraps a politician.[28]She followed up withThe Pleasure Seekers, yet another musical romantic comedy. Ann-Margret was excited to do her next project,Bus Riley's Back in Town; its writerWilliam Ingehad penned her favorite filmSplendor in the Grass(1961). However Inge was so infuriated by the result that he took his name off the credits ofBus Riley. She then featured inOnce a Thief, a crime film intended to be astar-making vehiclefor French actorAlain Delonin the United States.[28]The actress learned decades later that during this time she had been offered the title role inCat Ballou, a critically acclaimed box-office smash that theAmerican Film Instituteranked as the tenth greatestWestern filmof all time. Her agent had turned down the role without telling her.[35][36]Ann-Margret broke her flop streak withThe Cincinnati Kid, in which she played afemme fataleoppositeSteve McQueen. It was her first hit sinceViva Las Vegas, but her role was not a large one.[28]
While she was working onOnce a Thief, she met her future husbandRoger Smith, who after his successful run on the private-eye television series77 Sunset Strip, was performing a live club show at thehungry ion a bill withBill CosbyandDon Adams. That meeting began their courtship, which was met with resistance from her parents.[37]
Ann-Margret starred in four films in 1966.Made in Paris, the first of these, was a fashion-focused romantic comedy in which Ann-Margret received top billing.FilmInkattributes its box office failure to "dodgy writing and uninspiring male leads".[28]A month after its release, she teamed up with entertainersChuck DayandMickey Jonesfor aUSOtour to entertain U.S. servicemen inSouth Vietnamand other parts of South-East Asia. A moderately successfulremakeof the classicJohn FordWesternStagecoachfollowed, with Ann-Margret essaying the role of a prostitute. She then starred in the "hopelessly confused"sex comedyThe Swingerwhich, in Stephen Vagg's words, "came close to killing her Hollywood career more than any other [film] by virtue of its sheer incompetence."[28]Ann-Margret ended 1966 by featuring in the hitDean Martin–starrerMurderers' Row, a spy spoof. Looking at Ann-Margret's uneven draw at the box office, Vagg points out that afterViva Las Vegas, her roles in hit films "had been parts any girl could have played" but the star vehicles that were tailored for her were all flops.[28]
During a lull in her film career in July 1967, Ann-Margret gave her first live performance in Las Vegas, with her husband Roger Smith (whom she had married that May) taking over as her manager after that engagement. Elvis Presley and his entourage came to see her during the show's five-week run and celebrate backstage. According to Ann-Margret's autobiography, Presley sent her a guitar-shaped floral arrangement for each of her Vegas openings.[38]After the first Vegas run ended, she followed with aCBStelevision specialThe Ann-Margret Show, produced and directed byDavid Winterson 1 December 1968, with guest-starsBob Hope,Jack Benny,Danny Thomas, andCarol Burnett. Then, she returned toSaigonas part of Hope's Christmas show.

David Winters and the show were nominated for a Primetime Emmy in Outstanding Choreography.[39]

In 1971, she starred inCarnal Knowledgeby directorMike Nichols, playing the girlfriend of a neglectful, arguably abusive character played byJack Nicholson. She was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actress, and won theGolden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.Filminkargued this amounted to a comeback "in a way...because she never really regained her former status as an above-the-title star of feature films – her follow-up movies were 'girl' parts... the seventies were tough times for female stars who were not Barbra Streisand."[28]
On the set ofThe Train Robbersin Durango, Mexico, in June 1972, she told Nancy Anderson ofCopley News Servicethat she had been on the "grapefruit diet" and had lost almost 20 pounds (134 to 115) eating unsweetened citrus.[40]

She required meticulousfacial reconstructive surgerythat required wiring her mouth shut and putting her on a liquid diet. Unable to work for ten weeks, she returned to the stage almost back to normal.[41]
Throughout the 1970s, Ann-Margret balanced her live musical performances with a string of dramatic film roles that played against her glamorous image. In 1973, she starred withJohn WayneinThe Train Robbers. Then came the musicalTommyin 1975, for which she received her second Oscar nomination, this time for theAcademy Award for Best Actress. In addition, she has been nominated for tenGolden Globe Awards, winning five, including herBest Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or MusicalforTommy.On 17 August 1977, Ann-Margret and Roger Smith traveled to Memphis to attend Elvis Presley's funeral.[42]Three months later, she hostedMemories of Elvisfeaturing abridged versions of theElvis1968 TV andAloha from Hawaiispecials.[43]

First coming to prominence as an original cast member on the hit TV comedy seriesSaturday Night Livein 1975, she went on to win back-to-backEmmy Awardsfor Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series on the 1980s sitcomKate & Allieportraying the role of Allison "Allie" Lowell. Curtin later starred in the hit series3rd Rock from the Sun(1996–2001), playing the role ofDr. Mary Albright.
Curtin has also appeared in many movie roles, includingCharleneinThe Librarianseries of movies (2004–2008). She reprised one of herSaturday Night Livecharacters, Prymaat (Clorhone) Conehead, in the 1993 filmConeheads. She is sometimes referred to as the "Queen ofDeadpan".[2]The Philadelphia Inquireronce called her a "refreshing drop of acid".[3]She was included on a 1986 list of the "Top Prime Time Actors and Actresses of All Time".[4]
Jane Therese Curtin was born inCambridge, Massachusetts,[5]one of four  children born to Mary Constance (née Farrell) and John Joseph Curtin, who owned an insurance agency.[6]Her maternal ancestry is Irish,[7]and her paternal, Curtin, ancestry is also Irish, originally from Newmarket-on-Fergus,County Clare. Curtin has one younger brother, Larry Curtin, who lives in South Florida;[8]and an older brother, John J. "Jack" Curtin (d.2008).[9]Her younger sister, Virginia (Ginny), died in 2001. Curtin is a cousin of actress and writerValerie Curtin. Her uncle was the radio personality Joseph Curtin.
She was raised Roman Catholic, and grew up inWellesley, Massachusetts. She graduated fromNewton Country Day School of the Sacred HeartinNewtonin 1965. Curtin earned an associate degree fromElizabeth Seton Junior Collegein New York City, class of 1967.[10]She then attendedNortheastern Universityfrom 1967 to 1968 before dropping out of college to pursue a career in comedy.[5]
She has served as a U.S. Committee National Ambassador forUNICEF. In 1968, Curtin decided to pursue comedy as a career and dropped out of college. She joined a comedy group, The Proposition, and performed with them until 1972. She starred inPretzels, an off-Broadway play written by Curtin,John Forster,Judith Kahan, andFred Grandy, in 1974.
One of the originalNot Ready For Prime Time PlayersofNBC'sSaturday Night Live(1975), Curtin remained on the show through the 1979–1980 season. Guest hostEric Idlesaid that Curtin was "very much a 'Let's come in, let's know our lines, let's do it properly, and go' ... She was very sensible, very focused", and disliked the drug culture in which many of the cast participated. Show writerAl Frankenstated that she "was so steady. Had a really strong moral center, and as such was disgusted by much of the show and the people around it".[11]
On the show, and mirroring her own low-key real life, she frequently playedstraight-womancharacters, often as afoiltoJohn BelushiandGilda Radner. Curtin anchoredSNL's "Weekend Update" segment from 1976 to 1977, paired withDan Aykroydfrom 1977 to 1978 andBill Murrayfrom 1978 to 1980. On occasional "Weekend Update" segments, her newscaster character served as a foil to Belushi, who often gave a rambling and out-of-control "commentary" on events of the day. During these sketches, she timidly tried to get Belushi to come to the point, which would only make him angrier. Curtin's newscaster also introduced baseball expertChico Escuela(Garrett Morris), a heavily accentedDominican, who started his sketches by saying, "Thank you,Hane", before repeating his famous catchphrase, "Baseball been bery, bery good to me!" She also introducedRoseanne Roseannadanna(Radner) and would listen in exasperated silence at Roseannadanna's disjointed commentary before ultimately cutting her off.  In addition, she sang in the "Chevy's Girls" sketch in season two, episode two, alongsideLaraine Newmanand Radner, and sang again with Newman and Radner as a trio backing up Morris as he sang the song Three Little Words for the cold opening of the Season 4 premier episode.
In a parody of the "Point-Counterpoint" segment of the news program60 Minutes, Curtin delivered a controlled liberal viewpoint (à laShana Alexander) vs. Aykroyd, who (in the manner ofJames J. Kilpatrick) epitomized theright-wingview, albeit with an over-the-top "attack" journalist slant. Curtin presented theliberal"Point" portion first. Then Aykroyd presented the "Counterpoint" portion, sometimes beginning with the statement, "Jane, you ignorantslut," to which she replied, "Dan, you pompous ass." The recurring segment has been discussed in an article on "How to Respectfully Disagree" inThe Chronicle of Higher Education.[12]
Curtin is also well known for her role in theConeheadsketches as Prymaat (wife/mother of the Conehead family), and as Enid Loopner (in sketches with Radner and Murray). She is one of many cast members who appear in the retrospective compilation DVDThe Women of SNL(2010, 97 minutes).[13]

As withSNL, her mostly strait-laced character was often confounded by the zany and whimsical antics of the Solomon family.
In 1997, Curtin narrated two episodes of the documentary television seriesUnderstanding,[14]and she has done voice work forRecessandCyberchase. She guest starred onSesame Streetin 1985.
Curtin also starred withFred Savagein theABCsitcomCrumbs, which debuted in January 2006 and was cancelled in May of that year. She also guest-starred onGary Unmarriedas Connie, Allison's mother.[15]In 2012, she joinedUnforgettableas Dr. Joanne Webster, a gifted but crustymedical examiner; in 2014, she occasionally reprised her role as the first Guardian onThe Librarians. In 2020, she had a co-starring role as a quirky mother-in-law on the ABC sitcomUnited We Fall.
In 1980, Curtin starred with Susan Saint James and Jessica Lange in the moderate hitHow to Beat the High Cost of Living. In 1993, Curtin and Dan Aykroyd were reunited inConeheads, a full-length motion picture based on their popularSNLcharacters.
