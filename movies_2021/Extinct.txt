Extinctis a 2021 animatedscience fictioncomedy filmdirected byDavid Silverman, and co-directed byRaymond S. Persi, from a screenplay byJoel Cohen,John Frink, andRob LaZebnik.[6]The film features the voices ofRachel Bloom,Adam Devine,Zazie Beetz,Ken Jeong,Catherine O'Hara,Benedict Wong,Reggie Watts, andJim Jefferies. The story follows Op and Ed, a pair of adorablelagomorph-like creatures with giant holes in the center, called the "flummels". They find themselves transported from their island home in the year 1835 to modern-dayShanghai.
Extinctwas released in Russia on February 11, 2021. It was later released theatrically bySky Cinemain the United Kingdom on August 20, 2021, and then was released worldwide onNetflixon November 19, 2021.
Siblings Op and Ed (a species of fluffyrabbit-like creatures with holes in her center, known as the "flummels") are native to theGalápagos Islands. The flummels are ostracized by their community, due to Op's proneness to disaster, and are labelled weird. Just beforeCharles Darwindiscovers their island during one of his voyages, Op and Ed find and fall into a large flower that teleports them to modern-dayShanghai, where they meet and befriend a white poodle named Clarance. The flummels learn their species is now extinct after Darwin found the island destroyed by a volcanic eruption.
Clarance brings them to the Time Terminal, a pavilion where Clarance's owner, Dr. Lee Chung, kept and studied the flowers and their seeds, which have time-traveling properties. Op accidentally knocks some seeds out, causing the Terminal to malfunction and sending Clarance to 1915 Antarctica, along with the seed that leads the flummels home. In Antarctica, Clarance is captured byErnest Shackleton's expedition team. With the help of the Extinctables — a team of extinct animals composed of Dottie, adodo bird; Burnie, aTasmanian thylacine; Alma, a femaleMacrauchenia; and Hoss, a maleTriceratops, who were bought by Dr. Chung to the Terminal — Op and Ed travel through each seed in order to find the one that can bring them home and rescue Clarance.
Following a falling out with Ed, Op returns to the flummels' time, where she attempts to warn the rest of the flummels about the volcano. Clarance imprisons her, telling her that flummels ruined his life and that he is actually behind their extinction. Clarance had been adopted by Dr. Chung, but after Dr. Chung was charmed by the adorable flummels, Clarance went maverick, pushing Dr. Chung into one of the flowers and destroying the seed that would send him back. He then caused the flummels' extinction by planting a drone bomb. Following Ed's arrival after seeing the video Op made, they make several attempts to escape and stop the bomb, eventually deploying a seed to move the entire island into the present day. Clarance survives, but Dr. Chung arrives and punishes him by sending him back to 1915 Antarctica, thanking the flummels and the Extinctables.
A year later, Op and Ed are finally accepted by their community, while Dottie surprises Ed by laying a blueish egg shaped like a flummel. The egg hatches, but the creature inside the egg is unknown.
In a mid-credits scene, Op surprises Ed by pulling Wally into the Time Terminal. Wally exclaims that they have so much to talk about, while Op leaves to "get him a glass of water".

Silverman is largely credited with creating most of the "rules" for drawingThe Simpsons. He is frequently called upon to animate difficult or especially important scenes, becoming go-to in Season 2 when he animated the first of Homer's many "rants, freak-outs, and heart attacks".[8]He appeared during the end credits of theSimpsonsepisode "Goo Goo Gai Pan" giving a quick method of drawingBart, and is a frequent participant on theSimpsonsDVDaudio commentaries. A cartoon rendering of him can be seen in "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show", where he is the animator who draws Poochie (along with renderings of otherSimpsonsstaffers).

Other representative examples of Silverman's work onThe Simpsonsinclude Homer's histrionic, spasmodic heart attack in "Homer's Triple Bypass", Homer's demented hysterics over the iconic painting of poker-playing canines in "Treehouse of Horror IV" and subsequent turn as an even-more-deranged appropriation of Jack Nicholson's character from "The Shining" in "Treehouse of Horror V", and Homer's over-the-top sugar diatribe from "Lisa's Rival".
Silverman worked withSavage Steve Hollandto createKlutter!forFox Kids. It was produced byFox KidsCompany, Savage Studios Ltd, andFilm Roman. It was part ofEek!

He has written several episodes of the American animatedsitcomThe Simpsons, many of which he co-wrote with his former writing partnerDon Payne. Frink and Payne started their career in television writing for the short-lived sitcomHope and Gloria. They wrote their first episode ofThe Simpsonsin 2000, and Frink still works on the show as a writer andexecutive producer.
Frink was born inWhitesboro, New York. A graduate ofEmerson CollegeinBoston, Massachusetts, he holds a degree increative writing. Frink began his career as a writer for several sitcoms together with his writing partner at the time,Don Payne.[1][2]The two met atUCLA, where Frink was the boss of the Media Laboratory in which Payne worked. Payne has said to the website TheFutonCritic.com that "one day we were both trying to write individually so I said, 'why don't we pool our resources and write together and see what happens?'"[3]In 2006, Payne told theLos Angeles Timesthat "I hooked up with a writing partner, John Frink, out of college. I wanted to do films. He wanted to do television."[2]The pair reached the agreement that they would pursue a career in the medium that they first got a job offer in—whether it be film or television. They eventually ended up writing for television sitcoms such asHope and Gloria(1995–1996) andThe Brian Benben Show(1998).[2]These sitcoms were short-lived and Payne has deemed them as failures.[1]
Frink and Payne joined the writing staff of the animated sitcomThe Simpsonsin 1999, participating in the show's communal rewriting process beginning in its eleventh season. The earliest episode co-written by Frink and Payne was the season twelve episode "Insane Clown Poppy",[1]itself a holdover from season 11. "Treehouse of Horror XI", another season 11 holdover written by the pair, was broadcast earlier than "Insane Clown Poppy", but was produced after.[1]Payne said in an interview withTV Squadin 2006 that "My partner and I were actually working on one of a long string of failed sitcoms (and most sitcoms are failed sitcoms!) On the day a show is officially cancelled, it's kind of a tradition for the writing staff to go out to a restaurant, eat a nice meal, and drown their sorrows. On the way there, a writer namedJace Richdale(who had also worked onThe Simpsons) told my partner and me thatThe Simpsonswas looking for some writers. He wanted to know if we'd be interested in it, because he would recommend us. My jaw literally dropped. So he contacted the show-runner, a guy namedMike Scully, who read ourspec scriptand met with us, then hired us on."[1]
After a few years of working onThe Simpsonstogether, Frink and Payne's writing partnership ended.[1][2]They both continued to work on the show, though, and Payne has described their split-up as amicable.[3]The first episode Frink wrote on his own was season fifteen's "Bart-Mangled Banner" (2004). Since the twenty-first season ofThe Simpsons(2009–2010), he has been credited as anexecutive producer.
TheSimpsonscharacterProfessor Frink, aThe Nutty Professor-esque scientist, was named after Frink, although the character was introduced before he was hired as a writer on the show.[4][5]
