K. Simmons,Nina Arianda,Tony Hale,Alia Shawkat,Jake Lacy, andClark Greggare featured in supporting roles.
It received alimited theatrical releasebyAmazon Studiosin the United States on December 10, 2021, prior to streaming worldwide onPrime Videoon December 21, 2021. The film received generally positive reviews from critics who praised the performances of the cast, particularly those of Kidman and Bardem. The film received three nominations at the94th Academy Awards:Best Actorfor Bardem,Best Actressfor Kidman andBest Supporting Actorfor Simmons. It also received three nominations at the79th Golden Globe AwardsincludingBest Actor – Motion Picture Dramafor Bardem andBest Screenplayfor Sorkin, with Kidman winningBest Actress – Motion Picture Drama.
The film is told from three perspectives: "present-day" interviews withI Love Lucy's lead writersJess Oppenheimer,Madelyn Pugh, andBob Carroll Jr.; flashbacks throughoutLucille BallandDesi Arnaz's relationship; and preparations for filming an episode of the show in 1953.
In 1939, Ball is an actress contracted toRKO Pictures, earning the moniker "Queen of theB-Movies". Cast in the failed comedyToo Many Girls, she falls in love with her costar, Cuban singer Arnaz. He assures her of her talent as a physical comedian, and she confides her dream of simply making a home with someone. They marry and buy a house in Hollywood, but struggle to spend time together, with Arnaz busy fronting his Desi Arnaz Orchestra while Ball continues her film career with little success.
After serving inWorld War II, Arnaz resumes touring with his orchestra, and Ball lands a starring role in 1942'sThe Big Street. She meets with RKO PresidentCharles Koerner, expecting to become an established star likeRita HayworthandJudy Holliday. Instead, he terminates her contract, largely due to her age, and suggests she use her voice for radio. In 1948, she is cast in the radio showMy Favorite Husband, which becomes a massive success.
CBSsuggests turningMy Favorite Husbandinto a television show, sponsored by cigarette companyPhilip Morris. Hoping to bring her and Arnaz closer together, Ball agrees on the condition that he plays her on-screen husband; the executives initially refuse to have an "all-American" star with a Cuban husband, but are forced to concede. By 1951, the show is renamedI Love Lucyand becomes a smash hit with nearly 60 million viewers each week.
Ball and Arnaz produce the show in Los Angeles through their companyDesilu Productions, with a three-camera system designed by Arnaz allowing East Coast viewers to watch live without static, while accommodating a studio audience. Dealing with friction between her costarsWilliam Frawley, who is often drunk, andVivian Vance, who resents Ball's attempts to make her less attractive, Ball clashes with the directors and writers over her exacting demands.
Walter Winchell's radio program claims to have evidence of Ball'sCommunistties, alarmingI Love Lucy's crew that their show will be shut down. Ball admits to registering with the party when she was young and influenced by a relative, and Arnaz frustrates her by announcing that she innocently marked the wrong box. They inform the writers she is pregnant with their second child, planning to integrate this into future episodes, but executivesrefuse to alloweven the word "pregnant" on the air.
Ball confronts her husband for often staying out late, but he proves that a tabloid photo of him with another woman was taken months ago. After Frawley suggests that Arnaz's behavior stems from feeling emasculated by Ball taking over many of the show's business and creative decisions, she asks Oppenheimer, the officialshowrunner, to help save her marriage. Instead of offering him a producer credit, Oppenheimer assures Arnaz he has top billing as the "I" inI Love Lucy, but he rejects the patronizing gesture. Arnaz reaches out to the head of Philip Morris directly, securing permission to introduce Ball's pregnancy into the show.
The night of filming a new episode, a newspaper article declares Ball a Communist, though she was cleared during anHUAChearing. Arnaz addresses the studio audience about the accusations and takes a live call withFBIDirectorJ. Edgar Hoover, who confirms that Lucy was cleared of all charges. Celebrating backstage, Ball confronts Arnaz with a lipstick-stained handkerchief, which he claims is hers, but she shows him another handkerchief with her own lipstick, and he finally admits to his infidelity.
As filming begins, Ball momentarily loses her concentration, triggered by Arnaz'scatchphrase— "Lucy, I'm home". An epilogue reveals that Ball filed for divorce after the taping of their last show in 1960.
The project was first announced in September 2015, withCate Blanchettannounced to star asLucille BallandAaron Sorkinwriting the screenplay.[1]The film was acquired byAmazon Studiosin August 2017.[2]
Production was originally given atax creditto film in California in November 2019,[3]and producers were revealed to be meeting with directors in January 2020.[4]However, by January 2021, Blanchett had dropped out of the project, withNicole Kidmanin negotiations to replace her andJavier Bardemin negotiations to portrayDesi Arnaz. Sorkin, having enjoyed the experience of directingThe Trial of the Chicago 7, had elected to serve as director himself.[5]The casting of Kidman was met with some controversy on social media, butLucie Arnazspoke out in defense of Kidman's casting.[6]In February,J. K. SimmonsandNina Ariandawere cast to portrayWilliam FrawleyandVivian Vancerespectively.[7]
Filming began on March 29, 2021, in Los Angeles, withTony Hale,Alia Shawkat,Jake Lacy, andClark Greggadded to the cast.[8][9]The production canceled filming atChateau Marmontdue to backlash against the establishment.[10]In September 2021, the film was in post-production.[11]The set design was led by Emmy-nominated set decorator Ellen Brill and production designer Jon Hutman.[12]Daniel Pembertoncomposed thefilm score, which was released byLakeshore Recordson December 17, 2021.[13]
The filmpremieredin New York City and Los Angeles on December 2, 2021, and December 6, 2021, respectively.[14][15]It was released in alimited releaseexclusively in the United States on December 10, 2021, before streaming globally onPrime Videoon December 21, 2021.[16]
Though Amazon does not publicly release box office grosses, the film made an estimated $150,000 from 450 theaters on its first day, and a total of $450,000 in its opening weekend.[17]
Thereview aggregation websiteRotten Tomatoesreports an approval rating of 68% based on 281 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Being the Ricardoscan't hope to truly capture its subjects' brilliant star power, but Nicole Kidman has a ball with Aaron Sorkin's spitfire dialogue."[18]Metacriticgave the film a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[19]
Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film a three and a half out of four stars, and pointed out how, despite unfavorable reactions in response to the casting of Kidman and Bardem in the lead roles, "Bardem does a solid job of capturing Arnaz' charismatic stage presence, business acumen and duplicitous ways with the ladies, while Kidman is outstanding at reminding us there were two Lucys [...] It's not an impersonation so much as it is a fully realized characterization."[20]Mark FeeneyfromThe Boston Globementioned that Kidman gets "the smokiness of Ball's voice. And in the black-and-white that's used for scenes from the sitcom the physical resemblance is uncanny. It's Kidman playing one Lucy as that Lucy plays another", and mentioned how, although Bardem doesn't physically resemble his character much, "that's not a problem, since what Bardem does convey, and it matters a lot more, is Arnaz's babalu gusto and coiled-spring alertness."[21]Lindsey Bahr of theAssociated Pressstated that "while no one is going to mistake either Kidman or Bardem for either of their real-life counterparts, they were hired to be actors, not mimics and do a terrific job bringing to life the spirit of their characters off-camera lives, illustrating a full, complex, adult relationship."[22]
Stephanie ZacharekfromTimementioned how "Kidman makes a fine Lucille Ball in many ways", such as when "capturing Ball's smarts", and continued on by saying that "Bardem is terrific as Arnaz, finding complexities in the man that we might not have known were there."[23]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterstated that "the performances of Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as golden-age TV's best-loved couple can't be faulted", describing Bardem's performance as "oozing charisma" and showing "a roguish charm and a shrewd mind" as Arnaz. He also reiterated that despite Kidman not physically resembling Ball, "she plays the laser-focused professionalism and self-preservation with stirring conviction, and she nails the dual on- and off-camera personae in her movements, and above all, in vocal distinctions between the raspy heavy smoker in the writers' room and the squawking comic on TV."[24]
FilmmakerGary Rosspraised the film, saying "The period is impeccably rendered, the performances are dazzling ... The script sparkles, and darts and dashes as Aaron's always do. His collaboration with cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Jon Hutman is a beautiful tone poem that underscores the subtext of the piece."[25]
Reception of the casting of a European actor (Bardem) to play aCuban-Americancharacter (Arnaz) was more negative,[26][27][28][29][30][31]with reporter Laura Bradley noting that "Hollywoodhas a well-established history of hiring Spanish actors to play characters from the countries theSpaniardscolonized."[32]Director Sorkin defended the casting decision by saying that "having an actor who was born in Spain playing a character who was born in Cuba was not demeaning. And it wasn't just the casting consultant who agreed, Lucy and Desi'sCuban-American daughterdidn't have a problem with it. So, I'm very comfortable with it."[33]ACuban-American criticnoted wryly that "a Spaniard portraying aSantiaguerowas gonna be an uneasy pill to swallow for that most clannish of people known as Cubans. Everyone inHialeahwas probably having a fit."[34]Additionally, as a sign of the Hollywood view of Cubans, some Spanish-language media accused the film of having Bardem "darken" his skin to appear "more Cuban", when in fact Arnaz was lighter-skinned than Bardem.[35]It was also pointed out that it was the second time that Bardem has been cast to portray a Cuban (the first being a film about Cuban writerReinaldo Arenas).[35]A major newspaper in Spain accused Bardem of "cultural appropriation" while also noting that Arnaz was "a direct descendant of families from Spain."[36]On the other side of the casting controversy, a separate majorSpanish newspaperendorsed the casting of Bardem as Arnaz, noting that Arnaz had "more in common with Bardem [lineage to Spain] than with any other Hispanic [non Spaniard] actor."[37]
Additionally, it was also pointed out that one of the key principal tenets of the film – the point that in 1953 Arnaz had personal issues with Communism[38][39]because his family had been "kicked out of Cuba because of Communism"[40][41][42]– was incorrect,[42][43][34][44][41][45]as the much laterCuban Communist Revolutiondid not take over the island until 1959[46]and theArnaz family had migrated to the United States in 1933[43][44]as a result of the "Revolt of the Sergeants",[45][47]not theCastro Revolution.
Stu Shostak, the host of the podcast "Stu's Show" and a personal friend of Lucille Ball, had negative things to say about the movie. As someone who extensively studied vintage TV and interviewed many people who were involved withI Love Lucy, he expressed criticism at how the cast was portrayed, the factual inaccuracies of the script (J. Edgar Hoover never called on the set), and how the actor's relationships with each other weren't as frosty (nor as chummy, in some situations) as they were portrayed in the film. Ultimately, he found the film to be a disgrace to Lucy and Desi's legacy, and hoped that people would "let them rest in peace" going forward.[48]
The film achieved significant success for Amazon, debuting at No. 1 onPrime Videoduring its opening weekend and becoming one of the top debuts for a movie drama release.[49]

On television, he portrayed José Menendez in theNetflixcrimeanthology seriesMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story(2024).
Bardem married actressPenélope Cruzin 2010 and together they have two children. In January 2018, Bardem became the ambassador ofGreenpeacefor the protection ofAntarctica.[1]
Bardem was born on 1 March 1969 inLas Palmas de Gran Canaria, in theCanary Islands, Spain. His mother,Pilar Bardem(1939–2021), was an actress, and his father, José Carlos Encinas Doussinague (1931–1995), was the son of a cattle rancher from theprovince of Salamanca.[2]According to Pilar's memoirs, José had a "capricious and violent will," and shot up the front door. He changed jobs more than 10 times, leading to evictions and the children going hungry. The two separated shortly after Javier's birth.[3][4]His mother raised him and his elder siblings,CarlosandMónica, alone (another sibling died shortly after birth), both of whom have also pursued an acting career. His father died of leukemia in 1995.[2][5]
On his mother’s side, Bardem comes from a long line of filmmakers and actors dating back to the earliest days of Spanish cinema. He is a grandson of actorsRafael BardemandMatilde Muñoz Sampedro(sister of actressesMercedesandGuadalupe),[6]and a nephew of screenwriter and directorJuan Antonio Bardem.[7]On the latter's side, he is a cousin of filmmakerMiguel Bardem.[8]His uncle Juan Antonio was imprisoned by theFranco regimefor hisanti-fascistfilms.[5]Bardem was brought up in the Roman Catholic faith by his grandmother.[9][10]
As a child, he spent time at theatres and on film sets.[5]In 1974, he made his first television appearance, inFernando Fernán Gómez's television seriesEl pícaro[es](The Scoundrel).[11][5][12]He also playedrugbyfor the junior Spanish National Team.[13][14]Though he grew up in a family full of actors, Bardem did not see himself going into the family business, and painting was his preferred medium.[15]He went on to study painting for four years at Madrid'sEscuela de Artes y oficios.[13][16]In need of money, he took acting jobs to support his painting but felt he was a bad painter and eventually abandoned it as a career.[15]
In 1989, for the Spanish comedy showEl Día Por Delante(The Day Ahead), he had to wear aSupermancostume for a comedic sketch, a job that made him question whether he wanted to be an actor at all.[17]Bardem also worked as a stripper (for one day) during his struggling acting career.[18]
Bardem came to notice in a small role in his first major motion picture,The Ages of Lulu, when he was 21, in which he appeared along with his mother,Pilar Bardem. He also appeared in minor roles inAmo tu cama ricaandHigh Heels.[19]Bigas Luna, the director ofLulu, was sufficiently impressed to give him the leading male role in his next film,Jamón Jamónin 1992, in which Bardem played a would-beunderwear modelandbullfighter. The film, which also starred his eventual wifePenélope Cruz, was a major international success.[13]Bardem featured inSancho Gracia'sHuidos,[19]and starred in Bigas Luna's next filmGolden Balls(1993).
Bardem's talent did not go unnoticed in theEnglish-speaking world. In 1997,John Malkovichwas the first to approach him, then a 27-year-old, for a role in English, but the Spanish actor turned down the offer because his English was still poor.[14][20]His first English-speaking role came that same year, in with directorÁlex de la Iglesia'sPerdita Durango, playing asantería-practicing bank robber.
After starring in about two dozen films in his native country, he gained international recognition inJulian Schnabel'sBefore Night Fallsin 2000, portrayingCubanpoetReinaldo Arenas.[13]He received praise from his idolAl Pacino; the message Pacino left on Bardem's answering machine was something he considers one of the most beautiful gifts he has ever received.[5]For that role, he received a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Actor, the first for a Spaniard. Immediately after, he turned down the role of Danny Witwer inMinority Reportwhich eventually went toColin Farrell.[21]Instead, in 2002, Bardem starred in Malkovich's directorial debut,The Dancer Upstairs. Malkovich originally had Bardem in mind for the role of the detective's assistant, but the movie's time trying to find financing gave Bardem time to learn English and take on the lead role of the detective. "I will always be grateful to him because he really gave me my very first chance to work in English", Bardem has said of Malkovich.[14][20]
Bardem won Best Actor at theVenice Film Festivalfor his role inMar Adentro(2004), released in the United States asThe Sea Inside, in which he portrayed thequadriplegicturnedassisted suicideactivistRamón Sampedro. He made his Hollywood debut in a brief appearance as a crime lord who summonsTom Cruise's hitman to do the dirty work of dispatching witnesses in the crime dramaCollateral. He stars inMiloš Forman's 2006 filmGoya's GhostsoppositeNatalie Portman, where he plays a twisted monk during theSpanish Inquisition.[22]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
