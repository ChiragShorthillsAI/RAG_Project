In 1939, Stan Carlisle hides a corpse under the floorboards of a run-down house before setting the house ablaze. That evening, he walks into a traveling carnival and watches ageek showin which a deranged man eats a live chicken. Stan runs into the carnival's strongman and is offered a temporary job for the night. He is subsequently convinced by carnival owner Clem to stay and begins working with "Madame Zeena", the carnival'sclairvoyantact, and heralcoholichusband Pete.
Stan begins courting fellow performer Molly and asks her to leave the carnival with him, but she refuses. Madame Zeena and Pete teach Stan how to use the coded language andcold readingtricks in their act, while warning him against pretending tospeak to the dead. Stan also learns that Clem hires troubled alcoholics to be his geeks, then gives themopium-laced alcohol so they stay. One night, Pete asks Stan for alcohol and is found dead the next day.
Local law enforcement raid the carnival after learning about the geek show. Stan uses his cold reading skills to placate the local sheriff and manipulate him into showing leniency. Shortly thereafter, Molly agrees to leave the carnival with Stan.
Two years later, Stan runs a successfulpsychic actfor the wealthy elite ofBuffalo. Molly performs as his assistant, but their relationship has deteriorated as Stan demands perfection from Molly. During a performance,psychologistDr. Lilith Ritter interrupts and tries to expose their act. Stan bests and humiliates Ritter with his cold reading skills, then reads the man sitting with Ritter, Judge Kimball. After the show, Kimball asks Stan to help him and his wife communicate with their dead son. Stan agrees over Molly's objections.
Stan meets with Ritter to purchase information on Kimball. Ritter agrees but requests Stan sit for a psychotherapy session in lieu of payment. That night, Molly invites Madame Zeena and other performers to the hotel for an impromptu party. Madame Zeena warns Stan not to do Kimball's reading, claiming to have read his plans fromtarot.
Stan performs a successful reading for Kimball and his wife and is paid handsomely. He offers to split the fee with Ritter, but she declines, instead agreeing to hide the money from Molly. Stan informs Ritter that Kimball has offered to introduce him to Ezra Grindle, a very wealthy industrialist and her former patient. At Stan's request, Ritter reluctantly provides incomplete information about Grindle; Stan steals the rest from her records, learning that Grindle forced anabortionon a young woman named Dorrie, and that she likely died from the botched procedure. After successfully convincing Grindle that he is a true medium, Stan starts an affair with Ritter and begins drinking.
Stan holds regular sessions with Grindle for exorbitant fees while Grindle demands that Stan make Dorrie'sspiritmaterialize. Stan plans to have Molly pose as Dorrie, which she agrees to do only if she can leave Stan. On the day Stan plans to materialize Dorrie, Kimball's wife murders her husband and commits suicide to be reunited with their son. That night, Grindle confesses he hurt more women after Dorrie's death. Immediately after, Molly makes her appearance as Dorrie, but her disguise fails upon close inspection. After Grindle threatens Stan and strikes Molly, Stan beats Grindle to a pulp and runs over Grindle's bodyguard with his car, killing them both. Horrified, Molly leaves.
Stan arrives at Ritter's office to retrieve his savings, but she betrays him and withholds almost all of it. He attacks her but is forced to escape when security arrives. A flashback reveals he killed his bedridden father by intentionally exposing him tohypothermiabefore burning his house down.
Months later, Stan, now homeless and an alcoholic, sees ads for Madame Zeena. Stan finds a new carnival and learns that his old carnival went out of business. Stan desperately pitches his mentalist act to the new owner, who rejects it based on Stan's appearance and the act being out of fashion. The owner then offers him a drink and temporary work as a geek, which Stan accepts.
In addition,Romina Power, daughter of actorTyrone Power, who played Stanton in the1947 film, has an uncredited cameo as a viewer of Stanton's show.[6]
The project was announced in December 2017, whenGuillermo del Tororevealed that he would be attached to write and direct a film adaptation ofWilliam Lindsay Gresham's1946 novel.[7]The film marks a departure for del Toro, as it contains no supernatural elements, as opposed to his previous films. Del Toro considered this to be a standalone adaptation of Gresham's novel, as opposed to a remake of the1947 film versionstarringTyrone Power. He stated: "Well, what it is is that book was given to me in 1992 by Ron Perlman before I saw the Tyrone Power movie, and I loved the book. My adaptation that I've done with [co-writer] Kim Morgan is not necessarily—the entire book is impossible, it's a saga. But there are elements that are darker in the book, and it's the first chance I have—in my short films I wanted to do noir. It was horror and noir. And now is the first chance I have to do a real underbelly of society type of movie. [There are] no supernatural elements. Just a straight, really dark story." Del Toro also revealed the film would be aiming for anR-rating, saying: "big R. Double R!"[8]
Dan LaustsenandAlexandre Desplatwere announced to serve as the film's cinematographer and composer, respectively, both having previously collaborated with del Toro inThe Shape of Water(2017).[9]
In April 2019,Leonardo DiCaprioentered negotiations to star in the film.[10]But by June 2019,Bradley Cooperentered early negotiations to replace DiCaprio.[11]Del Toro stated that he and Cooper quickly connected with each other when del Toro met Cooper in the latter's house to discuss the role: "We started talking script and then this started mirroring our thoughts about life and the way we viewed the world. We entered strange, darker times that led to 'Nightmare Alley' for me, and [changed the] way I view the world." Del Toro also believed that Cooper's experience as a director helped strengthen their connection, stating, "A director is an actor and an actor is a director. There is no separation of the craft... that took awhile for me to get used to. I normally create and guide these little Fabergé eggs of movies, obsessively detailed. All of a sudden we were on an adventure. I will never shoot a movie the same way." Del Toro further discussed his collaborative relationship with Cooper while filming:[12]
Curiosity and integrity are the two things, they are very bonded [...] We're like truffle hunters, smelling for that, looking for certain truth, not verisimilitude or realism but truth which is a higher form of telling a story. How we get to it is only through curiosity. When we have collaborators, the main reward is a point of view that you can literally bounce off, or get bounced off, and seek for the truth... I found it a blessing at age 56 in this movie to find the marvel of complicity and curiosity. 'Is this all we can do with that scene, with that shot?' You keep seeking.
In August 2019,Cate Blanchettwas in negotiations to join the film.[13]Both Cooper and Blanchett were confirmed to star the next month, along with the addition ofRooney Mara.[14]Toni ColletteandDavid Strathairnwere added in September, with Strathairn replacingMichael Shannonwho dropped out due to scheduling conflicts.[15][16]Collette praised del Toro's capabilities as a director, and described the film as a "period drama" and "unlike some of his other work."[17]Willem Dafoewas cast in October[18]andHolt McCallanywould join the next month.[19]Ron PerlmanandRichard Jenkinswere both confirmed in January 2020.[20]In February 2020,Mary SteenburgenandRomina Power, the daughter of Tyrone Power, joined the cast of the film.[21]In March 2020,Paul Andersonjoined the cast of the film.[citation needed]
Principal photographybegan in January 2020 inToronto, Canada.[22][23]Production temporarily moved toBuffalo, New Yorkin February 2020, in order for del Toro to take advantage of the city's architecture and unfamiliar setting: "I wanted to find a city that was really interesting to visit for an audience, that was not a city they were overtly familiar with." Scenes were filmed in and outside of Buffalo'sNiagara SquareandCity Hall, and required the use of fake snow, much to the surprise of the crew, as Buffalo is widely known for its heavy snowfall during the winter season.[24]
Principal photography was initially set to begin in September 2019, but was delayed to accommodate Cooper's schedule.[25]"We shot the second half before the first half," Cooper revealed. "We didn't want to do it that way. Things happened to us, with sets and other actors' availability and water, the snow and all that. I was the cause. I had moved to New York and said, 'I can't do it right now. Let me get settled.'" In March 2020, Del Toro himself shut down production on the film after rising concerns regarding theCOVID-19 pandemic: "We stopped the shoot a week before [the industry shut down] [...] That saved us. Nobody to my knowledge in the cast or the crew got coronavirus."[26]Del Toro later reflected that "Stopping was not mandatory back then, but we both felt if we don't stop now and someone gets sick — we said, 'we gotta stop.' Nobody was expecting it. Everybody went to lunch and came back six months later."[12]Searchlight's parent,Walt Disney Studios, officially halted production on the film soon after.[27]
Del Toro revealed that when production was shut down, approximately 45% of the film was shot, and he spent his time editing available footage during the hiatus. Del Toro also composed an 80-page safety precaution guideline to be used when production was to resume, which he was hoping to do in late 2020.[26]Varietyreported that Blanchett had completed her scenes prior to the shutdown.[28]
Production resumed in September 2020 in Toronto.[29]In an interview, Collette discussed some of the film's safety protocols: "[...] I've got to say, I think, you couldn't get any safer than a film set. They're so regimented and disciplined and demanding in terms of having to toe the line and everyone does their best to not get it. You really are in a bubble and the whole of Toronto is in masks and you're just sanitizing your hands a million times a day and trying not to be in big crowds and you just have to be mindful of that. Especially when you're working, because there's a bigger risk there. It's not just you, it's everyone else, you know?" Collette also revealed that del Toro had shot almost four hours of footage.[17]By November 2020, principal photography was completed and re-shoots had commenced.[30]Production officially wrapped in December 2020.[31]
Del Toro and Cooper reflected that the unexpected shooting schedule benefited the film's structure. Del Toro remarked that "It was a blessing [...] I believe wholeheartedly life gives you what you need, not what you want. You have a window to look at everything. It was incredible. We got to see these characters, when [Stanton Carlisle] was full of himself and arrogant and certain and seeking. We were able to go back six months in between all this and were able to analyze and see not only that character but what we needed to rewrite to be able to go back to a set. If your pores are open, the movie finds you. Each movie tells you what it needs." Cooper further stated that "This movie needed that rigor. Thank god we had that time. As simple a story is, it demanded all our concentration and focus, all that time. I don't think we realized how much it demanded of us at the beginning. That was the discovery. There is arrogance. You think you can do it, then, 'how is this possible?'"
Cooper further reflected on his relationship with del Toro over the course of filming:[12]
We [made]Nightmare Alleyfor the last two and a half years [...] It was a unique experience, going through the pandemic, taking six months off and revisiting it. We not only become lifelong friends, but it was an artistic experience.
Due to scheduling conflicts, Desplat exited the film, resulting inNathan Johnsonbeing brought in as replacement.[32]
It had its world premiere at theAlice Tully HallinNew Yorkon December 1, 2021, accompanied by simultaneous screenings at theAcademy Museum of Motion PicturesinLos Angelesand theTIFF Bell LightboxinToronto.[33][34]The film was theatrically released on December 17, 2021, after having been rescheduled from its original release date of December 3, 2021.[35]

Nightmare Alleymade $225,000 from Thursday night previews and an estimated $1.19 million by Friday. Its low opening was attributed to it being primarily meant for the audiences in the older age ranges (who had avoided going out to see movies amidst theCOVID-19 pandemic), low interest among the movie-going audience, and the release ofSpider-Man: No Way Homeon the same date.[42][43][3]It went on to debut to $2.8 million from 2,145 theatres during the weekend, finishing fifth at the box office.[44][3]Men made up 56% of the audience during its opening, with those in the age range of 25–54 composing 55% of ticket sales and those above 45 composing 29%.

Mark KermodeofThe Observergave the film 5 out of 5, writing: "From its bruised colour palette to its spiralling descent into madness and degradation, this is deliciously damnable fare, looking back through the prism of Del Toro's adventurous oeuvre to the existential angst of his vampiric feature debut,Cronos."[50]Linda Marric ofThe Jewish Chroniclealso gave 5 out of 5, writing: "Del Toro employs a mixture of stylish old Hollywood sensibilities with B movie tropes to bring us an engaging and gorgeously acted psychological thriller."[51]Clarisse Loughrey ofThe Independentalso gave the film 5 out of 5, writing: "Del Toro can do worldbuilding in his sleep, but you might also find Cooper's brittle performance, filled with such elemental sadness, hard to shake off.Nightmare Alleyis the shadow that lingers."[52]Peter BradshawofThe Guardiangave the film 4 out of 5, praising it as "a spectacular noir melodrama boasting gruesomely enjoyable performances and freaky twists."[53]
Robbie CollinofThe Daily Telegraphwas more critical, giving the film 2 out of 5 stars and describing it as "an act of origami-level homage: it's all folded together in impressively fiddly ways, but the result is an angular, inert approximation, lacking in the original's breath or heat."[54]Kevin MaherofThe Timesalso gave the 2 out of 5 stars, praising its set design, but added: "there's little else in this drastically overstretched narrative (150 minutes!) to hold any attention beyond a cursory awareness that, yes, we’re watching an oddly literal melodrama about bad people doing very bad things, very slowly."[55]
Martin Scorseseauthored an essay in theLos Angeles Timesurging readers to seek out the film, crediting Del Toro's films as being "lovingly and passionately crafted" and arguing thatNightmare Alleyis "truer to the animating spirit offilm noirthan the many 'homages' that have been made over the years and are still being made now."[56]

His first movie was supposed to be a stop-motion sci-fi feature calledOmnivore, about a lizard-man born in a savage land where everything tries to eat everything else.[17]He and his team built sets and about 100 puppets over a three-year period prior to filming. Vandals burglarized the studio one night and destroyed the puppets and sets, which put an end to his project as del Toro decided to switch to a live-action film,Cronos.[18][19]
Del Toro studiedspecial effectsand make-up with special-effects artistDick Smith.[20]He spent 10 years as a special-effects make-up designer and formed his own company, Necropia. He also co-founded theGuadalajara International Film Festival. Later in his directing career, he formed his own production company, the Tequila Gang.[21]
In 1997, at the age of 33, Guillermo was given a $30 million budget fromMiramax Films(then owned byDisney) to shoot another film,Mimic. He was ultimately unhappy with the way Miramax treated him during production, which led to his friendJames Cameronalmost coming to blows with Miramax co-founder and ownerHarvey Weinsteinduring the70th Academy Awards.[22]
Del Toro has directed a wide variety of films, fromcomic bookadaptations (Blade II,Hellboyand its sequelHellboy II: The Golden Army) to historical fantasy andhorror films, two of which are set in Spain in the context of theSpanish Civil Warunder theauthoritarianrule ofFrancisco Franco. These two films,The Devil's BackboneandPan's Labyrinth, are among his most critically acclaimed works. They share similar settings, protagonists and themes with the 1973 Spanish filmThe Spirit of the Beehive, widely considered to be the finest Spanish film of the 1970s.[23]
I cannot pontificate about it, but by the time I'm done, I will have done one movie, and it's all the movies I want.
People say, you know, "I like your Spanish movies more than I like your English-language movies because they are not as personal," and I go "Fuck, you're wrong!"Hellboyis as personal to me asPan's Labyrinth. They're tonally different, and yes, of course you can like one more than the other—the other one may seem banal or whatever it is that you don't like. But it really is part of the same movie. You make one movie.Hitchcockdid one movie, all his life.
Del Toro views the horror genre as inherently political, explaining, "Much like fairy tales, there are two facets of horror. One is pro-institution, which is the most reprehensible type of fairy tale: Don't wander into the woods, and always obey your parents. The other type of fairy tale is completely anarchic and antiestablishment."[24]
He is close friends with two other prominent and critically praised Mexican filmmakersAlfonso CuarónandAlejandro González Iñárritu.[25]The three often influence each other's directorial decisions, and have been interviewed together byCharlie Rose. Cuarón was one of the producers ofPan's Labyrinth, while Iñárritu assisted in editing the film. The three filmmakers, referred to as the "Three Amigos" founded the production companyCha Cha Cha Films, whose first release was 2008'sRudo y Cursi.[26][27]

In 2012, del Toro participated in theSight & Soundfilm poll. Held every 10 years to select the greatest films of all time, contemporary directors are asked to select their 10 favorite films. Del Toro chose:[76]
Del Toro updated his list for the 2022 edition of the poll:[77]
Del Toro met and began dating Lorenza Newton, cousin of singerGuadalupe Pineda, when they were both studying at the Instituto de Ciencias in Guadalajara. They were married in 1986 and had two daughters together[78]before divorcing in September 2017.[79]In 2021, he married Kim Morgan, an American film historian who was formerly married to Canadian filmmakerGuy Maddin.[80]
Del Toro maintains homes inTorontoandLos Angeles, and returns to his nativeGuadalajaraevery six weeks to visit his family.[81]He also owns two houses devoted exclusively to his collection of books, poster artwork, and other belongings pertaining to his work. He explained, "As a kid, I dreamed of having a house with secret passages and a room where it rained 24 hours a day. The point of being over 40 is to fulfill the desires you've been harboring since you were 7."[24]
In a 2007 interview, del Toro described his political position as "a little tooliberal". He pointed out that the villains in most of his films (such as theindustrialistinCronos, theNazisinHellboy,Italian FascisminPinocchio, and theFrancoistsinPan's Labyrinth) are united by the common attribute ofauthoritarianism: "I hate structure. I'm completely anti-structural in terms of believing in institutions. I hate them. I hate any institutionalized social, religious, or economic thing."[82]
RaisedCatholic, del Toro toldCharlie Rosein a 2009 interview that his upbringing was excessively "morbid" and said, "I mercifullylapsedas a Catholic... but asBuñuelused to say, 'I'm an atheist, thank God.'" He insists that he is spiritually "not with Buñuel" and that he is "once a Catholic, always a Catholic, in a way". He concluded, "I believe in Man. I believe in mankind, as the worst and the best that has happened to this world."[83]He has also responded to the claim that he views his art as his religion: "It is. To me, art and storytelling serve primal, spiritual functions in my daily life. Whether I'm telling a bedtime story to my kids or trying to mount a movie or write a short story or a novel, I take it very seriously."[24]Nevertheless, he became a "ragingatheist" after seeing a pile of human fetuses while volunteering at a Mexican hospital.[84]He also said that he was horrified by the way the Catholic Church complied withFrancoist Spain, and even had a character in one of his films quote what actual priests would say toRepublican factionmembers in concentration camps.[85]Upon discovering the religious beliefs of English writerC. S. Lewis, del Toro stated that he could no longer relate to Lewis and his work, despite having done so beforehand.[86]He described Lewis as "too Catholic" for him, despite the fact that Lewis was never a Catholic.[87]
Del Toro is not entirely disparaging of Catholicism, and his background continues to influence his work. While discussingThe Shape of Water, he mentioned the Catholic influence on the film: "A very Catholic notion is the humble force, or the force of humility, that gets revealed as a god like figure toward the end. It's also used in fairy tales. In fairy tales, in fact, there is an entire strand of tales that would be encompassed by the title 'The Magical Fish'. And [it's] not exactly a secret that afish is a Christian symbol." In the same interview, he said, "I don't think there is life beyond death, I don't. But I do believe that we get this clarity in the last minute of our life. The titles we achieved, the honors we managed, they all vanish. You are left alone with you and your deeds and the things you didn't do. And that moment of clarity gives you either peace or the most tremendous fear, because you finally have no cover, and you finally realize exactly who you are."[88]
In an interview for his book and exhibitionGuillermo del Toro at Home with Monsters, del Toro stated in 2016, "A lot ofMexican Catholicdogma, the way it's taught, it's about existing in a state of grace, which I found impossible to reconcile with the much darker view of the world and myself, even as a child. I couldn't make sense of impulses like rage or envy and, when I was older, more complex ones, you know. I felt there was a deep cleansing allowing for imperfection through the figure of a monster. Monsters are the patron saints of imperfection."[89]
Del Toro is highly skeptical ofAI in filmmaking, telling theBritish Film Institutein September 2024, "I saw a demo of AI [being used for animation] and I thought, 'Oh, that's what people think animation is: giving prompts and the computer does it. [...] AI has demonstrated that it can dosemi-compellingscreensavers—that's essentially that. And I think the value of art is not how much it costs and how little effort it requires, it's how much you would risk to be in its presence. Are [screensavers] going to make [viewers] cry because they lost a son, a mother? Because they misspent their youth? No. [AI is] in the hands of people that don't think about it as a tool but as a solution. [...] It should be, if at all, optional."[90]
While studying at university, del Toro published his first book when he wrote a biography of English filmmakerAlfred Hitchcock, whom he has long praised and admired.[91]
In 2010, del Toro revealed that he was a fan of video games, describing them as "the comic books of our time" and "a medium that gains no respect among theintelligentsia". He referred to the video gamesIcoandShadow of the Colossusas masterpieces.[92]He later citedAsteroids,Cosmology of Kyoto,Gadget: Invention, Travel, & Adventure, andGalagaas his personal favorite games.[93]
Del Toro's favorite film monsters areFrankenstein's monster, theXenomorph,Gill-man,Godzilla, andthe Thing.[94]Frankenstein in particular has a special meaning for him, in both film and literature, as he claims he has a "Frankenstein fetish to a degree that is unhealthy". He said, "It's the most important book of my life, so you know if I get to it, whenever I get to it, it will be the right way."[95]He usually watches three films a day,[96]and listsBrazil,Nosferatu,Freaks, andBram Stoker's Draculaamong his favorite horrors.[97][98]
Del Toro is also a fan of Japanesemangaandanime, having called the animeDoraemon"the greatest kids series ever created".[99]He has citedHayao Miyazakias one of his influences and one of his favorite storytellers in any medium, having identified with his style and influence through hisToei AnimationandStudio Ghibliprojects likeThe Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots,Heidi, Girl of the Alps,My Neighbor Totoro, andThe Boy and the Heronfrom childhood to adulthood, praising how he evokes the emotion of recognizing an impossible beauty only existing in films and realistically depicting brutal themes that affect the best and the worth of humanity, deeming Miyazaki an entirely genuine one-of-a-kind creator who exists fully in his art.[100]
Del Toro is highly interested in theculture of Victorian England. He said, "I have a room of my library at home called 'The Dickens Room'. It has every work byCharles Dickens,Wilkie Collins, and many other Victorian novelists, plus hundreds of works about Victorian London and its customs, etiquette, architecture. I'm aJack the Ripperaficionado, too. My museum/home has a huge amount of Ripperology in it."[101]
In 2019, del Toro paid for the flights of the Mexican teams to attend the 60thInternational Mathematical Olympiad(IMO) in South Africa and the United Kingdom, after the Mexican chapter of the IMO announced the government had suspended financing for the youngsters.[102][103]
Del Toro has an honorary doctorate from theNational Autonomous University of Mexico(UNAM). In November 2022, UNAM awarded him theHonoris CausaDoctorate for his "contributions to culture and his support for the youth".[104]
Del Toro's father, Federico del Toro Torres, was kidnapped in Guadalajara around 1997. Del Toro's family had to pay twice the amount originally asked for as a ransom ($1 million). Immediately after learning of the kidnapping, fellow filmmakerJames Cameron, a friend of del Toro since they met after the production ofCronos, offered to help del Toro pay for the ransom, which del Toro accepted.[105]72 days after Federico was kidnapped, the ransom was paid and he was released. The culprits were never apprehended, nor was the money ever recovered.[106]The event prompted del Toro, his parents, and his siblings to move abroad. In a 2008 interview withTimemagazine, he mentioned the kidnapping of his father: "Every day, every week, something happens that reminds me that I am in involuntary exile [from my country]."[107][24]
Additionally, del Toro has written or co-written unproduced screenplays for adaptations ofJustice League Dark(titledDark Universe),Beauty and the Beast(titledBeauty),At the Mountains of Madness,The Count of Monte Cristo(titledThe Left Hand of Darkness),Spanky(titledMephisto's Bridge),Superstitious,The Coffin,Drood,The List of Seven,The Wind in the Willows, as well as ones for potential remakes ofFantastic VoyageandThe Haunted Mansion.[109]

You just frame them, give them circumstances, and that character will happen."[24]Principal photography for the film took place in thePhilippinesand required Dafoe to undergoboot camp training.[25]Los Angeles TimeswriterSheila Bensonpraised his performance and found it to be "particularly fine" to see Dafoe play "something other than a psychopath".[26]At the59th Academy Awards, Dafoe was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[27]Dafoe provided his voice to the documentaryDear America: Letters Home from Vietnam(1987) and, in 1988, Dafoe starred in another film set during the Vietnam War, this time as Buck McGriff in the action thrillerOff Limits.[28][29]His second release of 1988 wasMartin Scorsese's epic dramaThe Last Temptation of Christ, in which Dafoe portrayed Jesus.

"I really made a conscious effort to mix it up, not because in itself it's not the job of an actor to do all different things, but for me that's what I'm interested in. You've got to be careful because you've got to work with what you have, not just for vanity's sake, but I think the best part of being an actor sometimes is the opportunity to transform yourself superficially, and deeply."

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
