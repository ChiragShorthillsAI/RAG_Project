The film was again directed byTom McGrathfrom a screenplay byMichael McCullers, and a story by McGrath and McCullers. It stars the voices ofJames Marsden,Amy Sedaris,Ariana Greenblatt,Jeff Goldblum, andEva Longoria, withAlec Baldwin,Jimmy Kimmel, andLisa Kudrowreprising their roles from the first film. The plot follows the now-adult Templeton brothers who are brought back together after Tim's daughter Tina requests their help for Baby Corp to stop a professor from erasing childhoods worldwide.
Plans for aBoss Babysequel were announced in May 2017 with McGrath returning to direct. Animation began at DWA Glendale and some production assets were borrowed fromJellyfish Pictures, with voice acting being done remotely due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.
The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 2, 2021, in traditional and selectRealD 3D,Dolby Cinemaand4DXlocations, by Universal Pictures; it also streamed on paid tiers ofPeacockfor 60 days. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed over $146 million worldwide against a budget of $82 million.
Tim Templeton is now an adult and lives with his wife Carol and their two daughters, 7-year-old Tabitha and infant Tina. Tim's younger brother Ted is a successfulCEOand is always absent. One night, Tim discovers that Tina comes from Baby Corp, just as how Ted did, and that she has been assigned for a "special mission" that requires Ted's presence. Tim refuses to call Ted, saying that he will never come. However, Tina leaves a fake voicemail for Ted, luring him to the Templetons' house.
The next morning, Ted arrives and Tim explains to him that Tina is a Baby Corp dispatch. Tina introduces the brothers to a new formula that will allow them to turn back into children for 48 hours in order to infiltrate Tabitha's school and figure out what Dr. Erwin Armstrong, founder and principal of the Acorn Center for Advanced Childhood, is planning behind parents' backs.
At the school, Tim, now as his 7-year-old self, follows Tabitha to her class while baby Ted is placed with other babies. Ted rallies the babies to help him get out of the playroom so that he can go to Armstrong's office to investigate. Tim tries to get sent to the principal's office by disrupting class, but is instead put in "The Box" for timeout. Ted discovers that Armstrong is actually a baby himself with his robot suit, having run away from home after realizing that he was smarter than his parents and now makes money by creating popular phone apps. His ultimate plan is to get rid of every parent on B-Day, so that they cannot tell their children what to do anymore.
On the night of a holiday pageant, where Tabitha is supposed to sing a solo, the brothers and Tina plan to expose Armstrong. However, they learn that B-Day is set to happen that night through Armstrong's new app, QT-Snap, which will hypnotize the parents into mindless zombies. Both Tim and Ted are caught by Armstrong's ninja babies and are put in The Box, which slowly starts to fill with water. Tabitha performs her solo, but when she sees that Tim has not shown up, she runs off the stage crying. She is consoled by Tina, who reveals her identity and her mission. Tabitha agrees to help her younger sister by getting to the server and shutting down QT-Snap before it can go worldwide. Tim and Ted escape from The Box with the help of Tabitha's pet pony Precious.
Tim and Ted reach the server first, but they are stopped by Armstrong, who calls the zombie parents for backup. While the brothers hold them back as the formula starts to wear off, Tina and Tabitha get up to the server. Tabitha is able to hack in and pull up the shutdown screen, but is interrupted by Armstrong. The sisters then set off a candy lava volcanousing Mentos and soda, destroying the servers and turning all parents back to normal. Tina then reveals that bringing Tim and Ted back together was her true mission. The whole Templeton family gathers to celebrate Christmas, while Armstrong returns to his own family.

Thomas Floyd ofThe Washington Postgave the film 2.5/4 stars, writing that "...there's a severe case of sequel-itis, as returning director Tom McGrath and screenwriter Michael McCullers go to farcical lengths to re-create the original movie's gags, story beats and character dynamics. Still,Family Businessmanages to largely improve on its predecessor, with the help of savvy casting and surprisingly pointed social satire."[35]Writing for theLos Angeles Times, Michael Ordoña said: "It's more of the same, for better or worse, but likely with enough bells and whistles — especially those new characters — to please younger fans."[36]
Writing forThe A.V. Club, Katie Rife gave the film a "C+" grade and said: "...it's nothing to get worked up about, in part because thisBoss Babymoves too quickly to inspire thought about much of anything. Compared to the first film,Family Businessmoves along at a swift and stimulating clip, with fewer diversions into world-building and hallucinatory internal logic."[37]Carlos Aguilar of theTheWrapwrote: "Family Businessoffers an array of half-baked conflicts, all crying out to be noticed, while the creators are apparently unsure of which requires the most urgent attention."[38]

His family was based in a small village called Llongoria,Belmonte de Miranda, Asturias, Spain.Longoriais the Castillanized form of thisAsturian-languagesurname.
In 1767, her seventh great-grandfather received almost 4,000 acres (16 km2) of land along theRio Grandein a land grant from KingCharles III of Spain. The family retained this land for more than a century. After the US-Mexican border was moved southwards in the aftermath of theMexican–American War, the land ended up on the American side of the border. Her family had to deal with the influx of United States settlers following the Mexican–American War and theAmerican Civil War.[140]

Her ancestors include many other Maya on both sides of her family.[142][143]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
