The film stars Rex as a middle-aged, newly retiredporn starwho leaves Los Angeles for his small Texas hometown, plotting his way back to the life he once had. Along the way, he begins dating a 17-year-old girl.
The film premiered at the74th Cannes Film Festivalin competition for thePalme d'Oron July 14, 2021. It was released inselect theatersin the United States on December 10, 2021, byA24. It received praise for its direction and Rex's performance and received a variety of awards and nominations. TheNational Board of Reviewlisted it among the top ten films of the year.

Washed up and down-on-his-luck L. A. pornstar Mikey "Saber" Davies returns to his hometown of Texas City, Texas for the first time in 17 years to start over. After a two day busride and with $22 on him, he arrives at the modest home of his estranged wife and fellow ex-pornstar, Lexi, to whom he is still married on paper, and her mother, Lil, begging them to let him stay. They reluctantly agree but insist that he get a job and do household chores. Over the course of the day, Mikey has several job interviews, but due to the long gap in his resume and his fame as an adult film actor, nobody hires him. Desperate, he reaches out to Leondria, the drug dealer mother of an old schoolmate, to give him back his old job sellingmarijuanafor her. Leondria and her daughter June suspect that Mikey will smoke it himself, but their business arrangement continues after he returns with his earnings.
Since he doesn't have a car, he moves around on Lexi's old kids bicycle.
After sleeping on the couch for several nights, Mikey starts having sex with Lexi. Eventually, she invites him to share her bedroom again. Mikey gives Lexi and Lil a month's rent in advance and takes them to a donut shop to celebrate. He becomes smitten with Raylee, a 17-year-old girl who works at the counter and goes by the name Strawberry. He returns and persuades her to let him sell marijuana to the construction workers who frequent the shop. They soon start a sexual relationship. One night, after sex, she plays him a piano version of "Bye Bye Bye" byNSYNC.
Mikey also befriends Lexi's neighbor Lonnie, whom Lexi used to babysit, when he was younger. They spend some time together, but during a visit to the mall, Mikey learns that Lonnie ispretending to be an Army veteranto sell US flags and witnesses him getting humiliated and thrown into the mall fountain by two actual veterans, who see through him.
Mikey persuades Strawberry to break up with Nash, her high school boyfriend, after finding out she was not single when they met. Nash and his parents confront Mikey in the donut shop parking lot and beat him up.
Mikey repeatedly tries to persuade Strawberry to travel with him to Los Angeles to pursue a career in pornography, which he plans on managing and which is his way back into the business. They grow closer, causing him to become distant from Lexi. When he disappears for a weekend with Strawberry, Lexi grows suspicious and they argue. Mikey berates her and brags about the $3,000 he made selling drugs.
While riding in Lonnie's car, Mikey brags about his success with Strawberry and his comeback, which distracts Lonnie and makes him almost miss their exit, causing them to swerve across traffic, creating amultiple-vehicle collisionwhich results in several injuries, but which they avoid. They flee the scene and Mikey begs Lonnie to hide his involvement. Mikey is anxious, but Lonnie assumes full responsibility for the crash when he is arrested.
Using the crash as an excuse, Mikey visits Strawberry at work and asks her to come to Los Angeles with him and start her porn career. She agrees and quits her job. That night, Mikey tells Lexi that he is leaving for Los Angeles in the morning. That night, Lexi and Lil convince Leondria to send her adult children, June and her brothers, to seize the $3,000 that Mikey earned from selling her pot. They confront him while he is sleeping and take the money. Mikey flees naked out of the bedroom window and he runs to Leondria's house, begging her to return his money. Explaining that he is being punished for selling her marijuana to the unionized construction workers, she gives Mikey $200 and tells him to leave or be beaten up. Humiliated, he leaves with a few possessions in a trash bag. After traveling all night on foot to Strawberry's house, he imagines seeing her dressed in a bikini in her doorway as his eyes well with tears.
The low $1.1 million budget that the film was able to secure forced Baker to abandon a larger project and devote himself toRed Rocket.[4][5][6]Baker and Bergoch conceived of the idea for the Saber character while researching the adult film industry for their filmStarlet(2012), during which they met a number of men who fit thearchetypeof a "suitcase pimp", which Baker defines as "male talent who lives off a female talent in the adult film world."[7][8]
With regard to casting, Baker hadSimon Rexin mind five years previous to shooting but had never introduced himself. On October 23, 2020, Baker called Rex and convinced him to send an audition tape viaiPhone, giving him just five minutes to prepare.[9]Rex drove to Texas to avoid post-flight quarantine rules relating to theCOVID-19 pandemic, as filming was set to begin in three days.[9]David Rooney, writing for theHollywood Reporter, referred to the casting of Rex as a "winking joke" as he had starred in solo masturbation videos for agay pornographycompany before establishing himself in his career.[10][11]Baker had asked Rex to trust him, so Rex did not tell his agent about the film until after shooting had ended.[12]Baker first approachedSuzanna Sonin 2018 after a screening ofDon't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot10 days after she moved to Los Angeles, then did not call her for two years.[13]Darbone was a waiter at a restaurant inNederlandwhen Baker approached him because he "liked his look". Rodriguez, who had been a regular at the Donut Hole location which was near the plant she worked at before she was laid off, was walking her dog when Baker pulled over to ask her to audition.[14]

Securing the rights to the song "Bye Bye Bye" was not part of the initial budget. All five members ofNSYNChad to approve its use.[22][23]ActressSuzanna Sonrecorded acover versionof the song for the official motion picture soundtrack.[24]
Baker has "devoted [his] career to tell stories that remove stigma and normalize lifestyles" ofsex workersthrough his films.[25]Baker stated that inRed Rockethe wanted to pay homage to "Italian eroticism" andsexploitationfilms by directors from the 1970s likeFernando Di LeoandUmberto Lenzi. He was also inspired bySteven Spielberg'sThe Sugarland Expressfor the outdoor scenes.[23]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 90% of 206 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Led by Simon Rex's magnetic performance,Red Rocketis another vibrant, ground-level look at modern American life from director/co-writer Sean Baker."[48]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 76 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[49]
InDeadline Hollywood,Todd McCarthywrote that "[e]ven before much happens, the sense of a very specific location and cultural mindset [inRed Rocket] is very intense." He praised both Baker and leadSimon Rexfor their "tremendous energy" and said the film "feels as creatively pure as a novel by a kid just out of college."[50]Matt Zoller SeitzofRogerEbert.com, on the other hand, described it as a "rambling 130-minute film", calling the middle section "wherein Mikey ensnares [the] freckle-faced 17-year-old donut shop employee... Strawberry (Suzanna Son)" and schemes their escape to Los Angeles so that he can lead her toadult filmstardom as "one-note and repetitious" in particular.[51]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporteralso criticized the film mildly for "prolixstretches", saying "it could have used some tightening. But it's a pleasure to put yourself in Baker's capable hands."[10]SaidPeter BradshawofThe Guardian: "WithRed Rocket, Sean Baker has given us an adult American pastoral, essentially a comedy, and another study of tough lives at the margin, close in spirit to his lo-fi breakthroughTangerine."[52]Richard LawsoninVanity Fairwrote, "Baker's choice is a rather perfect one—in contextual terms and actual ones, too. Rex's performance is fleet and nimble, gregarious and shaded in darkness. He and Baker make staccato music together."[11]
Some reactions to the film stirred a debate aboutsexual moralityin film in the post-MeTooera. Seitz ofRogerEbert.comconcluded thatRed Rocketis "the least of the list" of Baker and Bergoch's "impressive library of realistic movies about the rainbow coalition of the American underclass", and went on to question moments in the sexually graphicRed Rocketwhere, "if the filmmakers aren't exactlyendorsingtheir protagonist's middle-aged, borderlinepedo-pimp obsession with Strawberry, they're not being as rigorous about mediating it as they should."[51]Brianna Zigler inGawkerresponded by defending the film's portrayal of a morally objectionable protagonist:
[T]he world is not a comfortable place, and it's often rigged in favor of guys like Mikey Saber. No matter how much of a cancerous loser we know him to be, his inflated sense of self is so grand that his losses still translate into wins. Is Mikey the sort of person I would like to be? No, but he's worth thinking about, and even trying to understand because he exists in this world with the rest of us. There is no moral high ground to be gained from disavowing art which dares to contend with the fact that people are not perfect bastions of moral good; that we can align ourselves with ugliness because ugliness exists in us all. If Mikey Saber gets off too easy for you, it's because he'd probably get away with it in real life.[53]
Variety'sClayton Davis said the film's "risqué" subject matter could be a hindrance but encouraged award voters to nominate Rex, Baker, and Bergoch forAcademy Awards.[54]John WatersincludedRed Rocketon his list of Top Ten films of 2021.[55]FilmmakerBette Gordonpraised the film, saying that it "flows organically due to Sean Baker's love of discovering place and his desire to listen to the voices of the community of people who live there."[56]
Red Rocketwas ineligible forScreen Actors Guild Awardnominations.[75]

In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
