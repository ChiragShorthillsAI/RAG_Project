Respectis a 2021 Americanbiographicalmusicaldramafilm directed byLiesl Tommy(in her featuredirectorial debut), written byTracey Scott WilsonandCallie Khouri, based on the life of American singerAretha Franklin. The film starsJennifer Hudsonas Franklin, withForest Whitaker,Marlon Wayans,Audra McDonald,Marc Maron,Tituss Burgess, andMary J. Bligein supporting roles. The film follows the first three decades of Franklin's life, from being born as a musical prodigy in an affluentAfrican-Americanfamily, the repercussions of losing her mother at age 10 to her arduous rise to international musical stardom, while enduring an abusive marriage, ultimately concluding with the recording of her influential live albumAmazing Grace(1972).
A film on Franklin's life was in development for a long time with Franklin herself involved in the pre-production, however the film languished indevelopment hellfor years due to lack of finding a suitable candidate. Following release of the musical filmDreamgirls(2006), Franklin asked Hudson to play her but did not finalize her decision until seeing her in the Broadway musicalThe Color Purple. The film began production in early 2019 and had concluded by February 2020. The film is dedicated to Franklin, who died in 2018.
After much delay and postponement, due to the burgeoningCOVID-19 pandemic,Respectpremiered in Los Angeles on August 8, 2021,[2]and was released theatrically in the United States on August 13, 2021, byUnited Artists Releasing, and in other territories byUniversal Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances, the film's production values, and costume design, but received criticism for its screenplay and long running time.
In 1952, 10-year-oldAretha Franklinlives with her fatherC.L., pastor ofDetroit’s largest Baptist church, and her siblings Cecil,Erma, andCarolyn. Aretha’s father often has her sing for parties at their home, while her motherBarbara, separated from C.L., encourages her independence. The predatory actions of a family friend, combined with the sudden death of Barbara, traumatize Aretha, who ceases to speak for weeks until her father demands that she sing at church.
Seven years later, Aretha is a teen mother of two boys, but refuses to name their father. Touring as a gospel singer with family friendMartin Luther King Jr., she meets local producerTed White, but C.L. warns him to stay away. C.L. surprises Aretha with a meeting withColumbia RecordsexecutiveJohn Hammond. She accepts a contract to record jazz standards, including "Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive."
Four albums later, Aretha lacks a signature hit. At a club, she attempts to honor family friendDinah Washingtonby performing one of Dinah’s songs; outraged, Dinah advises Aretha to find songs that move her. Struggling with the controlling influence of her father, Aretha begins a relationship with Ted. She brings him home to meet her family, leading C.L. to nearly shoot him, but announces Ted as her manager.
Two years later, Ted and Aretha are married with a child. After nine albums with no real success, Aretha is dropped by Columbia. Ted secures a deal with veteran producerJerry WexlerofAtlantic Records, who introduces her to a group of white musicians inMuscle Shoalsin 1967. There, Aretha records "I Never Loved A Man (The Way I Love You)", but a jealous Ted becomes violent with her.
Returning to Detroit with a black eye, Aretha reconnects with her family. Realizing her song has been released, becoming her first hit, Aretha takes a more hands-on role in her career. She makes her sisters her new backup singers and, despite their misgivings, reunites with Ted. Aretha and Carolyn are inspired to re-arrangeOtis Redding's "Respect"; their version becomes a #1 single, launching Aretha to stardom by her 25th birthday.
At a Detroit concert, Dr. King honors Aretha for her support of the Civil Rights Movement, proclaiming February 16 "Aretha Franklin Day". She has another signature hit, "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman", but her career is complicated by Ted's increasingly volatile behavior. Embarking on a European tour in 1968, Aretha is confronted with aTimemagazinecover story about Ted's abuse, and finally casts him out of her life.
Dating her tour manager Ken Cunningham, Aretha eventually has her fourth child. In the wake ofDr. King's assassination, Aretha's father drunkenly argues with her over the direction of the Movement, telling her that she no longer walks inthe Spirit. Aretha continues to release hits but overworks herself, coping with the pressure through alcohol, and rejects her family's attempts to help her.
During a performance inColumbus, Georgia, a drunken Aretha falls from the stage. On a downward spiral and estranged from Ken and her family, she is consoled by a vision of her late mother. Aretha finds the strength to quit drinking, leading Ken to reconcile with her, and returns to her gospel roots. She approaches Wexler with the idea to produce her own gospel album, and he agrees on the condition that the recording of the album be filmed for a documentary.
Beginning rehearsals, Aretha confides in family friendJames Cleveland, now a respected gospel artist. The day of the album's recording, her father arrives to reconcile with her. The service begins and, with her family in attendance, Aretha sings her arrangement of the hymn,Amazing Grace.An epilogue reveals Aretha Franklin's legacy as a world-famous artist and the “Queen of Soul”.

OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on 191 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "This standard-issue biopic falls shy of its subject's transcendent brilliance, but Jennifer Hudson's starring performance absolutely commandsRespect."[31]OnMetacritic, the film has an aggregate score of 61 out of 100 based on 43 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[32]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakreported filmgoers gave it an 89% positive score.[26]
In a positive review fromThe New York Times,Manohla Dargisstated that the film "finds its own groove" and praised the performances of Mary J. Blige and Jennifer Hudson."[33]Odie Henderson ofRogerEbert.comgave the film a score of 3 out of 4 stars, writing that "Hudson performs with the same tireless intensity Re was known for throughout her career. It's a damn entertaining movie." Henderson also said: "There's a fair amount of ugliness in Franklin's story—sexual assault, domestic abuse, alcoholism—and it's to the film's credit that it resists the temptation to treat these issues salaciously. ButRespectnever goes deeper than a surface-level exploration of how these traumas affected Franklin."[34]
Writing forVariety, Peter Debruge called the film an "overly respectful biopic [that] steers clear of revealing the traumas that shaped the soul legend" and said: "ThoughRespectcan feel a little soft in the drama department, it delivers the added pleasure of hearing Hudson re-create Franklin's key songs, from the early jazz standards she covered for Columbia to her reinvention of the Otis Redding single that lends the film its name."[35]Also writing forVariety, Cassie Da Costa praised Hudson's portrayal of Franklin, saying: "Bringing an incredible mix of gestural subtlety and musical power, it cannot be said enough what Hudson achieves here by transmitting a rich sense of interiority, staying true to who Franklin was in private with every look given, word spoken, and melisma sung."[36]
Pete Hammond ofDeadlinealso praised Hudson's performance, saying; "This is Jennifer Hudson's triumph merged with the spirit and guidance from an even greater voice above. Hudson's performance is an electrifying sight to behold."[37]Sasha StonefromAwards Daily, praised the film and especially Hudson's performance, saying: "Hudson's performance is partly her incredible voice. She suspends time in reverie whenever she sings. But this performance also establishes her as an actress capable of navigating the ever-changing waters of Franklin's complicated life—from a young wife who doesn't quite understand exactly what kind of gift she actually has, through to finding a way to honor her own creative spirit."[38]Writing forTime,Stephanie ZacharekcalledRespect"both entertaining and emotionally revelatory" and praised the performances of the cast, especially Hudson's, saying: "It's Hudson's job to play the adult version of that girl, and she shoulders it with something like tenderness. The easy thing, when you're playing a strong, potent character, is to bite down; Hudson never does. This is a terrific performance, underplayed in all the right ways, an emotionally detailed portrait of a woman who knew what she wanted and knew she could deliver—but who also moved through life knowing that she'd been cruelly robbed of that thing we so sentimentally call childhood."[39]
FilmmakersAllison AndersandMax Hechtmanpraised the film, with Anders praising Tommy's direction in particular by saying "When we love music as much as I do, and clearly as much as Liesl Tommy does, you have to be careful not to stop the story or the character's journey for a musical number. And from beginning to end, the music is driving these characters and this powerful story of a woman finding her voice and self-respect. And what a voice. And I'm not just talking about Aretha. Thank you, Liesl Tommy, for yours."[40][41]

Linked page for 'Liesl Tommy' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liesl_Tommy):
Liesl Tommy(/ˈliːsəl/)[1]is a South African-American director. Primarily known for her stage work, Tommy became the first woman of color to be nominated for theTony Award for Best Direction of a Play, for directing theBroadwayproduction ofDanai Gurira'sEclipsed(2017). She also guest directedThe Walking Deadepisode "Chokepoint". She made her feature film directorial debut with the biopicRespect, based on the life of singerAretha Franklin, starringJennifer Hudsonand released in August 2021.
Tommy was born inCape Town, South Africaduringapartheidand experienced racial segregation as a non-white citizen.[citation needed]The family lived in the Factretontownship.[2]Her father was a high-school teacher and politically active against the apartheid regime.[2]In 1985, when the South African government declared astate of emergency, Tommy's family emigrated to the USA where her father had studiedUrban PlanningatMITon aFulbrightscholarshipin the 1970s. They moved toBostonwhen Tommy was 15 years old. She attendedNewton North High Schoolwhere she was one of the few black students. Tommy stated that while in high school, she found a common language and purpose through theatre and made that her main focus.[2][3]
After graduation, Tommy studied acting with Clare Davidson inLondon.[2]After she returned to Boston, she worked as apre-schoolteacher at Project AFRIC (Advancement for Families Rich in Children),[4]a program working with at-risk families in theRoxburyarea of Boston.[2]
Tommy has directed theatre all over the United States, includingCenter Stage(Baltimore, Maryland),Dallas Theater Center(Dallas, Texas),California Shakespeare Theater(San Francisco, California), Sundance East Africa,Berkeley Repertory Theatre(Berkeley, California), andLa Jolla Playhouse(La Jolla, California).[5]
She is known for "re-envisioning" classic plays by creating retellings drawn from her own personal experiences and stories in life. Tommy's aesthetic is physical and visceral and she is interested in portraying the violence of being a human on stage through physical violence and/or violent exchanges.[6]
Tommy's training as an actor has influenced her directorial style, particularly the way that she runs her rehearsals. She finds textual analysis and table work important during the rehearsal process and refrains from putting the play on its feet until she knows the actors have a sense of their characters. She also tries to give the actors the chance to drive the piece so that the audience has a chance to see people being free onstage.[6]Tommy explained her directing philosophy: "My job as a director is to drag that story and drag that audience along for a ride they'll never forget. I don't care about having a signature. I just care about how to make the story as rock and roll as possible and as thrilling as possible. I do have a strong point of view, and there are certain things I explore over and over again in my shows, because there are things I'm working through as an artist."[7]
Tommy has made it a mission of hers to advocate for a more diverse theatre experience in her shows. Her 2012 production ofHamletat California Shakespeare Theatre featured numerous African-American actors, including the title roles of Hamlet andOphelia. She has directed plays by celebrated playwrights such asAugust Wilson'sThe Piano LessonatYale Repertory Theatrein 2011 andRuinedbyLynn Nottageat Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2011.
One of her remake of a classical production was a version ofLes Misérablesat Dallas Theater Center she directed in 2014. This production included a racially diverse cast that challenged typical casting types and explored themes of African political demonstrations and "social justice". She had never seen a production ofLes Misérablesbefore she directed it, but she did read the book when she was a young girl and had a mission to tell a story of student uprisings.[6]Growing up in South Africa she was surrounded by political and social uprising and she thought it would be beneficial to bring her own experiences into the production.
Tommy believes that theatre should be meaningful and "to change you".[8]Her resume encompasses a wide variety of plays that put this philosophy into action. One of her latest productions,Eclipsed, written byDanai Guriratells the story of five Liberian women trying to survive toward the end of the Second Liberian War. This production starredLupita Nyong'oand became the first-ever all-female-cast play written and directed by a female to premiere on Broadway. Before its move to New York, Tommy faced criticism thatEclipsedwas too similar toRuinedbyLynn Nottage. When Ms. Nottage saw the play she agreed that there were similarities, but argued that as a whole it was a completely different story about different women and completely different circumstances.[9]Tommy received aTony Awardnomination for directing forEclipsed, making her the first African-American female director to have received a best directing nomination for a play at the Tony Awards.[10]
Her directing credits include a theatrical version of the animated Disney filmFrozenat the Hyperion at Disneyland in Anaheim, California.[11]She directedKid Victory, a new musical producedOff-Broadwayat theVineyard Theatrein 2017.[12]Tommy was named early on to directing the world premiere ofPass Overby Antoinette Nwandu at theSteppenwolf Theatre Company,[13]however, at its premiereDanya Taymorwas listed as director.[14]
In March 2018, Tommy was hired to directBorn a Crime, the film adaption of theautobiography of the same namebyTrevor Noah.[15]Liesl directed theAretha FranklinbiopicRespectwithJennifer Hudsonportraying Franklin.[16]

She's almost laughing at how horrible her life has been. I don't think she sees herself as a victim. And she feels an incredible connection to her music – she can't sing a song if she doesn't have some emotional connection to it, which I really understand".[36]

He frequently appeared in the live alternative stand-up series he had organized withJaneane GarofalocalledEating It, which used the rock barLuna Loungein New York'sLower East Sideas its venue, from the 1990s until the building was razed in 2005.[27]
His first one-man show,Jerusalem Syndrome, had an extendedoff-Broadwayrun in 2000 and was released in book form in 2001. In 2009, he began workshopping another one-man show,Scorching the Earth. According to Maron (inScorching The Earth), these two shows "bookend" his relationship with his second wife, comicMishna Wolff, which ended in a bitter divorce.[28][29]
In May 2008, he toured withEugene MirmanandAndy KindlerinStand Uppity: Comedy That Makes You Feel Better About Yourself and Superior to Others.In January 2009, a collaboration withSam Seder, which had begun in September 2007 as a weekly hour-long video webcast becameBreakroom Live with Maron & Seder, produced by Air America.[30]Until its cancellation in July 2009, the show was webcast live weekdays at 3 p.m. Eastern, with episodes archived for later viewing. In its final incarnation, the show was informal, taking place in the actual break room of Air America Media, with the cafeteria vending machines just off-camera. This meant occasional distractions when Air America staff and management alike would occasionally come in for food and drink. Maron and Seder held court in an online "post-show chat" with viewers, in an even less formal continuation of each webcast, after the credits had rolled.
Maron's stand-up act is marked by his commitment to self-revelation and cultural analysis. He is particularly known for relentless on-stage exploration of his own relationships with family, girlfriends, and other stand-up comedians whom he has known and befriended over his years in the business.[31]In October 2013, Maron released his first hour-long special through Netflix,Marc Maron: Thinky Pain.[32]Maron would follow this with another special,More Later, which was released in December 2015 throughEpix.[33]
Kliph Nesteroff's 2015 bookThe Comedians: Drunks, Thieves, Scoundrels and the History of American Comedyis dedicated to Maron.[34]
His 2023 specialFrom Bleak to Darkwas namedNew Yorkmagazine's "No. 1 Best Comedy Special of 2023."[35]
From almost the first day of theliberal talk radionetworkAir America's broadcasts in 2004, Maron co-hostedMorning Sedition, a three-hour early-morningradio showwithMark Rileythat aired weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern time.[36]The show was unique in the Air America lineup in its heavy reliance on both live and pre-produced sketch comedy, utilizing the talents of staff writers as well as the on-air hosts. The format was aleft-leaningnear-satire of typical morning "Buddy" radio programs, including recurring characters, interviews and listener call-in segments, and it attracted a loyal fan base.[37]
As 2005 came to an end, it became known that Maron's contract would not be renewed on its December 1, 2005, end date because of problems with then Air America executive Danny Goldberg. Goldberg reportedly did not "get" the comedy or agree with the satiric and often angry tone set by Maron and other writers (Jim EarlandKent Jones) for a morning drive-time show. On November 28, 2005, it was officially announced that Maron's contract had not been renewed. His lastMorning Seditionbroadcast was on December 16, 2005, and the show was discontinued shortly thereafter.[36]
On February 28, 2006, Maron began hosting a nighttime radio program withJim Earlas a sidekick forKTLK Progressive Talk 1150AMin Los Angeles calledThe Marc Maron Showfrom 10:00 pm until midnight PST. The program was frequently delayed (sometimes for over an hour) owing to KTLK's contractual agreement to broadcast local sports events that would often go into overtime.The Marc Maron Showwas never nationally syndicated by Air America despite reported contractual clauses promising such. The show was streamed online live, but the show was not publicized, and the existence of the stream was not well promoted.[citation needed]
On July 5, it was announced that Maron's final episode would be on July 14. A few days before that date, Maron bluntly discussed his long struggle with Air America Radio's executives on-air. In 2008, Marc andSam Sederexpanded their prior collaboration on a weekly hour-long video webcast (streamed at The Sam Seder Show website) into a daily show (and "post-show chat") produced by Air America Media[38]calledMaron v. Seder.[39]The show becameBreakroom Live with Maron & Sederstarting in 2009 and could be viewed on Air America Media's website.[40]On July 15, 2009, after less than one year, Air America Media canceledBreakroom Live. According to the show's hosts, the cancellation was for financial reasons.[41]Ironically, the day before the cancellation, the show got some of the first real publicity it had ever received when MaximumFun.org posted its podcast of an interview with Maron onThe Sound of Young America.[42]
On the finalBreakroom Livewebcast, Maron said that this marked the third time since 2005 he'd been told by an executive at the network that his services would not be required in the immediate future. Co-host Sam Seder pointed out that this would be the end of hisfourthshow at Air America since the troubled network's inception.[43]
Due to a precarious state in his comedic career, on September 1, 2009, Maron began a twice-weeklypodcastcalledWTF with Marc Maronin what Maron would later describe in a 2015 interview as a "Hail Mary pass"; his first-ever guest was fellow stand-upJeff Ross.[44][45]In a free-form discussion, Maron and his guests touch on topics like the arc of the interviewees' careers, their shared past experiences, and stories from the road.[38]As of 2024, Maron has released more than 1,500 episodes of the show, garnering critical acclaim and more than 600 million downloads;[46][47][48]notable guests includePresident Barack Obama,Sir Paul McCartney,Robin Williams,Jerry Seinfeld,Chris Rock,Lorne Michaels,Leonardo DiCaprio, andBrad Pitt. The show has been noted for its influence on other long-form interview podcasts that emerged after its debut.[49][50][51]In April 2021, it was announced that Maron and his producer Brendan McDonald would be the recipients of the first-ever Governors Award by the Podcast Academy for Excellence in Audio (The Ambies) for their work onWTF.[52]The success of Maron's podcast opened up numerous other avenues on film and TV as well as giving him a massive boost to audience attendance at his stand-up shows.
His only major film credit for many years was a small part credited as "angry promoter" in the 2000Cameron CrowefilmAlmost Famous, in which he is first seen fighting withNoah Taylor's character and then yelling at and chasing after the main characters as they drive away on a bus, at which point he yells, "Lock the gates!" which is now used in the intro to his podcasts.[53]He was also featured at the Luna Lounge in the 1997 mockumentaryWho's the Caboose?starringSarah SilvermanandSam Seder.[54]In 2019, Maron starred in aLynn Shelton–directed comedy film titledSword of Trust.[55]In 2020, Maron played publicist Ron Oberman oppositeJohnny Flynn'syoung David Bowie in the movieStardust.[56]

Maron, a television series created by and starring Maron for a 10-episode first season, premiered onIFCon May 3, 2013.[59]The show is loosely autobiographical, revolving around Maron's life as a twice-divorced sober comedian running a comedy podcast out of his garage but establishing many differences between the real-life Maron and the version of him on TV. As the executive producer and star ofMaron, Maron appeared in all 51 episodes of the show from 2013 to 2016, portraying a fictionalized version of himself.[60]The show ended in 2016 after four seasons onIFC.[61]Maron directed two episodes of the show, "The Joke" and "Ex-Pod."

In an interview withKCRW, Maron stated, "I have no idea why they asked me to play guitar on the track. I'm only good at one thing on the guitar. It just so happens it was exactly the thing they needed."[71]
Reviews for the solo were positive.IFC's Melissa Locker said "Marc Maron plays a mean guitar."[72]Spin's Chris Martins called the guitar solo a "shredfest" as well as "angular."[73]The Strangercalled it "a frequency-fraying guitar solo that's better than you'd expect, although it won't makeJ Mascisjealous."[74]
Maron wrote and performed on the score for his filmSword of Trust.[75]
Maron lived inAstoria, Queens, through the 1990s and most of the 2000s, but moved back to Los Angeles in late 2009.[76]Maron also speaks openly of his caring for numerous stray cats that he takes into his home. This has led him to refer to his home, on theWTFpodcast, as the "Cat Ranch".[77]After his cat Boomer went missing, Maron began incorporating the catchphrase "Boomer lives!" to the end of each podcast. Since then, he has one addition to the "Cat Ranch" by the name of Buster Kitten. LaFonda died in December 2019. After she passed, Maron briefly replaced "Boomer lives!" with "LaFonda lives!" for a few episodes of his podcast. Monkey died in August 2020. He now usually concludes his podcast with some guitar playing and the phrase "Boomer lives... LaFonda... Monkey... Cat angels everywhere!" Maron currently lives inGlendale, Los Angeles, with his two cats, Buster and Sammy.[78]

Mary Jane Blige[1][10]was born on January 11, 1971, atFordham Hospitalinthe Bronx, New York City, to nurse Cora and jazz musician Thomas Blige. She has an older sister, LaTonya Blige-DaCosta, a younger half-brother, Bruce Miller, and a younger half-sister, Jonquell, both from a relationship Blige's mother had with another man after divorcing her first husband.[11][12]
Blige spent her early childhood inRichmond Hill, Georgia,[13][6]where she sang in aPentecostalchurch.[14]She and her family later moved back to New York and resided in the Schlobohm Housing Projects, located inYonkers.[15]The family subsisted on her mother's earnings as a nurse after her father left the family in the mid-1970s.[16]Her father was aVietnam Warveteran who suffered frompost-traumatic stress disorderandalcoholism.[15]
At age five, she wasmolestedby a family friend; as a teenager she endured years ofsexual harassmentfrom her peers.[17]She would eventually turn to alcohol, drugs and promiscuous sex to try to numb the pain.[18]Blige dropped out of high school in her junior year.[19]
Influenced by the music ofAretha Franklin,Chaka KhanandGladys Knight,[20][21]she began pursuing a musical career. Blige spent a short time in a Yonkers band namedPridewith band drummer Eddie D'Aprile. In early 1988, she recorded an impromptu cover ofAnita Baker's "Caught Up in the Rapture" at a recording booth in the Galleria Mall inWhite Plains, New York. Her mother's boyfriend at the time later played the cassette for Jeff Redd, a recording artist andA&Rrunner forUptown Records.[11]Redd sent it to the president andCEOof the label,Andre Harrell. Harrell met with Blige, and in 1989 at the age of 18, she was signed to the label as a backup vocalist for artists such asFather MC,[22]becoming the company's youngest and first female artist.[14]
After being signed to Uptown, Blige began working with record producerSean Combs, also known as Puff Daddy.[23]He became theexecutive producerand produced a majority of her first album.[24]The titleWhat's the 411?[25]was an indication by Blige of being the "real deal".[26]What's the 411?established Blige as a dynamic storyteller whose performances of love narrative drew upon both her musical influences and her lived experiences as an icon of the hip-hop-generation.[27]The music was described as "revelatory on a frequent basis".[19]Blige was noted for having a "tough girl persona and streetwise lyrics".[28]On July 28, 1992,Uptown/MCA RecordsreleasedWhat's the 411?,  to positive reviews from critics.[29]What's the 411?peaked at number six on theBillboard200and topped theTop R&B/Hip-Hop Albumschart.[30]It also peaked at number 53 on theUK Albums Chart.[31]It was certified three timesPlatinumby theRIAA.[32]According toEntertainment Weekly's Dave DiMartino, with the record's commercial success and Blige's "powerful, soulful voice and hip-hop attitude", she "solidly connected with an audience that has never seen a woman donew jack swingbut loves it just the same".[33]According toDave McAleer, Blige became the most successful new female R&B artist of 1992 in the United States.[34]
What's the 411?earned her twoSoul Train Music Awardsin 1993: Best New R&B Artist and Best R&B Album, Female.[35]It was also voted the year's 30th best album in thePazz & Jop—an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published byThe Village Voice.[36]By August 2010, the album had sold 3,318,000 copies in the US.[37]What's the 411?has since been viewed by critics as one of the 1990s' most important records.[29]Blige's combination of vocals over a hip hopbeatproved influential incontemporary R&B.[38]With the album, she was dubbed the reigning "Queen of Hip Hop Soul"
The album's success spun offWhat's the 411? Remix, a remix album released in December that was used to extend the life of theWhat's the 411?singles on the radio into 1994, as Blige recorded her follow-up album.
Following the success of her debut album and aremixed versionin 1993, Blige went into the recording studio in the winter of 1993 to record her second album,My Life.[39]The album was a breakthrough for Blige, who at this point was in aclinical depression, battling both drugs and alcohol – as well as being in an abusive relationship withK-Ci Hailey.[40][41]On November 29, 1994, Uptown/MCAreleasedMy Lifeto positive reviews. The album peaked at number seven on the USBillboard200and number one of theTop R&B/Hip-Hop Albumschart for selling 481,000 copies in its first week and remaining atop the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart for an unprecedented eight weeks. It ultimately spent 46 weeks on theBillboard200 and 84 weeks on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. In 2002,My Lifewas ranked number 57 onBlender's list of the 100 greatest American albums of all time.[42]The following year,Rolling Stoneplaced it at number 279 on their500 Greatest Albums of All Time,[43]and in 2006, the record was included inTime's 100 greatest albums of all-time list.[44]
Blige involved herself in several outside projects, recording a cover ofAretha Franklin's "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" for the soundtrack to theFOXseriesNew York Undercover, and "Everyday It Rains" (co-written by R&B singerFaith Evans) for the soundtrack to the hip hopdocumentary,The Show. Later in the year, she recorded theBabyface-penned and produced "Not Gon' Cry", for the soundtrack to the motion pictureWaiting to Exhale. The platinum-selling single rose to number two on theBillboardHot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in early 1996. Blige gained her first two Grammy nominations and won the1996 Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Groupfor her collaboration withMethod Manon "I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By". Shortly after, Blige was featured onJay-Z's breakthrough single, "Can't Knock the Hustle", from his debutReasonable Doubt(1996) and withGhostface Killahon "All That I Got Is You" from his debut,Ironman, which was also released that year. In addition, Blige co-wrote four songs, providedbackground vocalsand was featured prominently on two singles with fellowR&BsingerCaseon hisself-titled debut album(1996) including the US top 20 hit, "Touch Me, Tease Me", which also featured then up-and-coming rapperFoxy Brown.
What's the 411?highlights the featuring of woman centered narratives although in this album her narratives were regularly policed and told through male emcees. Nonetheless, it marked the start of a transition towards black women centered narratives that focused on the daily experiences and troubles of the black experience through the lens of women rather than necessarily singing about black trauma. Treva B. Lindsey, in her piece "If You Look in My Life: Love, Hip-Hop Soul, and Contemporary African-American Womanhood", highlights the regulating by men saying, "Although the lyrics onWhat's the 411?establish an African American woman-centered discourse, male artists' words of adoration and longing first introduce listeners to Blige as a hip-hop storyteller.What's the 411?, therefore, functions as an African American woman-centered storytelling space created largely by black men."[45]
On April 22, 1997, MCA Records (parent company to Uptown Records, which was in the process of being dismantled) released Blige's third album,Share My World. By then, she and Combs had dissolved their working relationship. In his place were theTrackmasters, who executive-produced the project along withSteve Stoute. Sharing production duties were producersJimmy Jam and Terry Lewis,R. Kelly,BabyfaceandRodney Jerkins. The album was made at a time when Blige was trying to "get her life together", by trying to overcome drugs and alcohol, as well as the ending of her relationship with Hailey. After an encounter with a person who threatened her life the previous year, she tried to quit the unhealthy lifestyle and make more upbeat, happier music. As a result, songs such as "Love Is All We Need" and "Share My World" were made.
Share My Worlddebuted at number one on theBillboard200and spawned five hit singles: "Love Is All We Need" (featuringNas), "I Can Love You" (featuringLil' Kim), "Everything", "Missing You" (UK only) and "Seven Days" (featuringGeorge Benson). In February 1997, Blige performed her hit at the time, "Not Gon' Cry", at the1997 Grammy Awards, which gained her a third Grammy Award nomination, her first forBest Female R&B Vocal Performance, as Blige was recording the follow-up toMy Life. In early 1998, Blige won an American Music Award for "Favorite Soul/R&B Album". That summer, she embarked on the Share My World Tour, which resulted in a Gold-certifiedlive albumreleased later that year, simply titledThe Tour. The album spawned one single, "Misty Blue".
On August 17, 1999, Blige's fourth album, titledMarywas released. It marked a departure from her more familiar hip hop-oriented sound; this set featured a more earthy, whimsical, andadult contemporary-tinged collection of songs, reminiscent of the 1970s to early 1980s soul. She also appeared onIn Concert: A Benefit for the Crossroads Centre at AntiguawithEric Claptonin 1999. On December 14, 1999, the album was re-released as a double-disc set. The second disc was enhanced with the music videos for the singles "All That I Can Say" and "Deep Inside" and included two bonus tracks: "Sincerity" (featuringNas, Andy Hogan andDMX) and "Confrontation" (a collaboration with hip hop duoFunkmaster Flex&Big Kaporiginally from their 1999 albumThe Tunnel).
TheMaryalbum was critically praised, becoming her most nominated release to date, and was certified double platinum. It was not as commercially successful as Blige's prior releases, though all of the singles: "All That I Can Say", "Deep Inside", "Your Child", and "Give Me You" performed considerably on the radio. In the meantime, MCA used the album to expand Blige's demographic into the nightclub market, as club-friendlydanceremixesof theMarysingles were released. The club remix of "Your Child" peaked at number-one on theBillboard'sHot Dance Club Playchart in October 2000. In 2001, a Japan-only compilation,Ballads, was released. The album featured covers ofStevie Wonder's "Overjoyed", and previous recordings ofAretha Franklin's "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" andDorothy Moore's "Misty Blue". In 1999,George Michaeland Mary J. Blige covered the song 'As' written by Stevie Wonder, and worldwide outside of the United States, it was the second single from George Michael's greatest hits albumLadies & Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael. It became a top ten UK pop hit, reaching number four on the chart. It was not released on the U.S. version of the greatest hits collection or as a single in the U.S. Michael cited Blige's record company president for pulling the track in America after Michael's arrest for committing a lewd act. In January 2001, Blige performed as a special guest in theSuper Bowl XXXV halftime show.[46]
On August 28, 2001, MCA released Blige's fifth studio album,No More Drama. The first single in the album, "Family Affair" (produced byDr. Dre) became her first and only number-one single on theBillboardHot 100, where it remained for six consecutive weeks. It was followed by two further hit singles, the European-only single "Dance for Me" featuringCommonwith samples from "The Bed's Too Big Without You" byThe Police, and theJimmy Jam and Terry Lewis-producedtitle track(originally recorded for theMaryalbum), which sampled "Nadia's Theme", the piano-driven theme song to the daytime dramaThe Young and the Restless. Though the album sold nearly two million copies in the U.S., MCA was underwhelmed by its sales, and subsequently repackaged and re-released the album on January 29, 2002. TheNo More Dramare-release featured a new album cover and deleted three of the songs from the original track listing, while adding two brand-new songs—one of which was the fourth single and top twenty Hot 100 hit "Rainy Dayz", (featuringJa Rule), plus two remixes; one of the title track, serviced by Sean Combs/Puff Daddy and the single version of "Dance for Me" featuring Common. Blige won a Grammy for 'Best Female R&B Vocal Performance' for the song "He Think I Don't Know". In April 2002, Blige performed withShakirawith the song "Love Is a Battlefield" onVH1 Divasshow live in Las Vegas, she also performed "No More Drama" and "Rainy Dayz" as a duet with the returningWhitney Houston.
On July 22, 2002, MCA releasedDance for Me, a collection of club remixes of some of her past top hits including theJunior Vasquezremix of "Your Child", and theThunderpussmix of "No More Drama". This album was released in a limited edition double pack 12" vinyl for DJ-friendly play in nightclubs.
On August 26, 2003, Blige's sixth albumLove & Lifewas released onGeffen Records(which had absorbed MCA Records.) Blige heavily collaborated with her one-time producer Sean Combs for this set. Due to the history between them onWhat's the 411?andMy Life, which is generally regarded as their best work, and Blige having just come off of a successful fifth album, expectations were high for the reunion effort.
Despite the album debuting at number one on theBillboard200 and becoming Blige's fourth consecutive UK top ten album,Love & Life's lead-off single, the Diddy-produced "Love @ 1st Sight", which featured Method Man, barely cracked the top ten on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, while altogether missing the top twenty on the Hot 100 (although peaking inside the UK top twenty). The following singles, "Ooh!", "Not Today" featuringEve, "Whenever I Say Your Name" featuringStingon the international re-release, and "It's a Wrap" fared worse. Although the album was certified platinum, it became Blige's lowest-selling at the time. Critics and fans alike largely panned the disc, citing a lack of consistency and noticeable ploys to recapture the early Blige/Combs glory. Blige and Combs reportedly struggled and clashed during the making of this album, and again parted ways upon the completion of it.
The album became Blige's first album in six years to debut at number one on theBillboard200, selling 285,298 copies in the first week.[47]Love & Lifereceived mixed reviews from music critics.[48]AllMusicgave it 4 stars and said the album "beamed with joy" andRolling Stonegave it three stars, saying "You may not always love Blige's music, but you will feel her". The album was eventually certified Platinum by the RIAA for shipping over 1,000,000 copies in the US.[32]The album was nominated for theBest Contemporary R&B Albumat the46th Grammy Awards.
Geffen Records released Blige's seventh studio album,The Breakthroughon December 20, 2005. For the album, Blige collaborated with J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, Rodney Jerkins,will.i.am,Bryan-Michael Cox,9th Wonder, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis,Raphael Saadiq,Cool and Dre, and Dre & Vidal. The cover art was photographed byMarkus Klinko&Indrani. It debuted at number one on both theBillboard200 and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Selling 727,000 copies in its first week, it became the biggest first-week sales for an R&B solo female artist inSoundScanhistory,[49][50]the fifth largest first-week sales for a female artist, and the fourth largest debut of 2005.
The lead-off single, "Be Without You", peaked at number three on theBillboardHot 100, while peaking at number one on the R&B chart for a record-setting fifteen consecutive weeks; it remained on the chart for over sixteen months. "Be Without You" found success in the UK (peaking in the lower end of the top forty) it became Blige's longest charting single on theUK Singles Chart. It is her second-longest charting single to date. The album produced three more singles including two more top-five R&B hits—"Enough Cryin'", which features Blige'salter egoBrook-Lynn (as whom she appeared on the remix toBusta Rhymes's "Touch It" in 2006); and "Take Me as I Am" (whichsamplesLonnie Liston Smith's "A Garden of Peace").

Called the  "Queen of Hip-Hop Soul", Blige is credited with influencing the musical marriage of hip hop and R&B.[157]Ethan Brown ofThe New Yorkersays that albums "What's the 411?" and "My Life", in hindsight, invented "the sample-heavy sound that reinvigorated urban radio and became a blueprint for nineties hip-hop and R&B".[158]Tom Horan ofThe Daily Telegraphcomments that Blige, being an immensely influential figure in popular music, "invented what is now called R&B by successfully combining female vocals with muscular hip hop rhythm tracks.

African American scholars have noted the implications of Blige's presentation and representation of black womanhood and femininity in the typically male-dominated and centric sphere of hip hop. Blending the vocal techniques of rapping in hip hop with aspirational messages in R&B, Blige is credited with articulating black women's experiences in a "more factual and objective"[163]manner than typicalstereotypes and tropes of black womenin the media. Using her personal experiences and struggles with her family as source material for her songs, Blige refutes notions of black female hypersexuality by "imploring women to love and empower themselves through both autonomy and intimacy."[164]This desire for love does more than connect to her audience members. With particular attention on her single "Real Love", critics note how the song is "a performative text, declaratively demand[ing] recognition of Blige's full humanity and, more broadly, that of hip-hop-generation women."[164]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
