The Unholyis a 2021 Americansupernatural horror filmwritten, produced, and directed byEvan Spiliotopoulos(in hisdirectorial debut), based on the 1983 novelShrinebyJames Herbert. Produced bySam Raimithrough hisGhost House Picturesbanner, it starsJeffrey Dean Morgan,Katie Aselton,William Sadler,Diogo Morgado, Cricket Brown, andCary Elwes. The film follows on a disgraced journalist (Morgan) who discovers a series of seemingly divine miracles in a small New England town and uses them to resurrect his career, though those "miracles" may have a much darker source.[4]
The project was announced in December 2018 under theworking titleShrine, withSony Picturesadapting Herbert's novel of the same name. The cast was announced between 2018 and 2020, withprincipal photographycommencing inBoston, but on March 14, 2020, filming was suspended because of theCOVID-19 pandemic.
The Unholywas theatrically released in the United States on April 2, 2021. Despite the film received generally negative reviews from critics, it was considered a box office success, grossing $31 million worldwide against a budget of $10 million.
In 1845, in Banfield,Massachusetts, Mary Elnor, a woman who has been accused ofwitchcraft, is hanged from a tree and set on fire. After she dies, however, her ash is kept in a kern doll, indicating the doll has been possessed by Mary's spirit.
In the present day, disgraced journalist Gerry Fenn works a job reporting on all things unusual. An assignment takes him toBoston, where the purported strange activity is revealed to be a teenage prank. While preparing to leave, he discovers the doll and crushes it, accidentally freeing Mary's spirit. Gerry later gets into an accident while driving away after seeing a young girl, Alice Pagett, run across the road. He follows Alice to the tree where Mary was hanged, the site where he found the doll, and hears her speak before collapsing. He takes her to a church and learns that Alice is deaf and mute. Gerry decides to stay in town to investigate what he thinks could be a real story of the supernatural.
The following day, Alice stuns the community by speaking, proclaiming that she has been cured by theVirgin Mary. This launches a media furore that is further propelled by other seemingly miraculous healings. During one of them, a statue of the Virgin Mary near thechancelof the church cries tears of blood. TheCatholic Churchsends Monsignor Delgarde to investigate the claims, assisted by Bishop Gyles. Alice tells Gerry that while she has been speaking to an entity named Mary, she has only assumed that it was the Virgin Mary. Beginning to suspect that something sinister is occurring due to visions of "Mary" as a horrific creature, Gerry finds a partner in Father William Hagan, Alice's maternal uncle, whom she healed, but also suspects the healings' true nature. Hagan discovers a book detailing Mary Elnor, who performed miracles for Satan. Before he has the chance to warn anybody, Elnor attacks him. His body is found hanging in the church. Gyles convinces Gerry to keep the apparent suicide of Hagan quiet as it will tarnish the divine occurrences; Hagan's death is declared an accident.
Gerry befriends Natalie Gates, the town's physician, and reveals that he was found fabricating stories. That is why he now reports hoax stories, hoping this event will relaunch his career. The pair comes across the information Hagan discovered, revealing Elnor sold her soul toSatanin order to gain power. Satan would allow her and her descendants (one of whom being Alice) to perform "miracles" prompting people to pledge themselves to her, and in turn, Satan. Elnor tries to kill Gerry, but Delgarde drives her away with prayer and acrucifix. Gerry and Delgarde are shocked to learn that Gyles was aware of Elnor's story but thought that it was not connected to the recent miracles. He warns Gerry that any attempt to share his views on the situation will fall on deaf ears due to Gerry's tarnished reputation.
Alice, who they believe is unaware of Mary's true nature, wishes to hold achurch serviceby the tree and broadcast it to the masses. Delgarde warns that those pledging themselves to Elnor would make her stronger and condemn theirsoultoHell. Gerry, Natalie and Delgarde try to perform a ritual in the church to stop this, but Elnor appears and crushes Delgarde with a burning cross.
Once the service begins, Alice urges everyone to pledge themselves to Mary three times. Gerry manages to stop the crowd from fully pledging by claiming that the miracles were just more of his hoaxes, that they were all a result of the placebo effect. Natalie communicates with Alice using sign language, urging her to stop the service. Mary speaks to Alice, entreating her to continue it or never speak again. Realizing Mary's true nature, Alice confirms that the miracles were not of God. The tree bursts into flames, causing all the attendants to flee in panic as an angry Mary emerges from it. She incinerates Gyles before attempting to kill Gerry, but Alice sacrifices herself to save his life. This causes Mary to disappear, as Alice was her link to the living world. Struck by Alice's sacrifice, Gerry begs God to save her life. She comes back to life but is once again deaf and mute. All the people whom Alice cured soon return to their prior state.

In March 2021, the film's new title was announced asThe Unholy,[10]along with atrailerand a scheduled release date of April 2, 2021.[11]The film released digitally on May 25, 2021, and onBlu-ray,DVDandUltra HD Blu-rayon June 22, 2021.[12]
The Unholygrossed $15.6 million in the United States and Canada and $15.4 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $31 million.[2]
The Unholygrossed $1.2 million on its first day and a total of $3.2 million from 1,850 theaters its opening weekend, finishing second at the box office behind fellow newcomerGodzilla vs. Kong.[13]The film dropped 23% to $2.4 million in its second weekend,[14]then made $2 million in its third.[1]
Review aggregatorRotten Tomatoesreports that 27% of 60 critics gave the film a positive review and an average rating of 4.90/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Rarely scary and often dull,The Unholyfalls back on the same tired tropes that have already been done to death by countless other religious horror movies."[15]Metacriticassigned a weighted average score of 36 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[16]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakreported 52% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 37% saying they would definitely recommend it.[13]
Alonso Duraldeof theTheWrapsaid that "you've seen this one before, countless times" and wrote: "Sam Raimi is a producer here, and it's hard not to think about how he might have mined this material both for provocation and for fright; hisDrag Me to Hellremains the gold standard of how to scare the heck out of an audience within the restrictions of PG-13. What we get instead here is a tepid little chiller with an overqualified cast."[17]
Movieguide, which reviews films from a Christian perspective, opined thatThe Unholyis a "well-made, captivating horror movie with a strong Christian worldview. It’s clear early on that the Christian characters recognize the tension between good and evil".[18]
The film was met with controversy fromCatholicsalmost immediately once the promotional cycle started.Michiganbased Reverend Gordon Reigle said of the concept, “Mary is the mother of Jesus Christ and, therefore, the spiritual mother to all Christians. Does anyone enjoy seeing their mother mocked or offended? I don’t think so”.[19]

Screen Gemsis an American film production company owned bySony Pictures Entertainment, a subsidiary of Japanese multinational conglomerate,Sony Group Corporation.[1]TheScreen Gemsbrand has served several different purposes for its parent companies over the decades since its incorporation, initially as a cartoon studio, then a television studio, and later on as a film studio. The label currently serves as a film production that specializes in genre films, mainly horror.[2]
Screen Gems is a member of theMotion Picture Association(MPA).[3]
When producerPat Sullivancame toHarry Warnerto sign a contract with him on his andOtto Messmer's seriesFelix the Cat, he declined and instead told his soon-to-be former secretaryMargaret J. Winklerthat she should form her own company and take control of the distribution of the series. Winkler formed M.J. Winkler Productions and soon also took control ofMaxandDave Fleischer's seriesOut of the Inkwell. By 1923 she and Sullivan were arguing, and that same year the Fleischer Brothers formed their own distribution company named Red Seal. Winkler saw an unreleased short calledAlice's Wonderland, a cartoon produced and directed byWalt Disney, and became impressed with the short. The two agreed to make a series about the cartoon. In 1924,Charles Mintzmarried Winkler, and the latter's career began to decline. Mintz quickly assumed Winkler's role in the company, later rebranding it Winkler Pictures.
In 1925 Winkler's renewal contract for the Felix shorts was written, yet Winkler declined to renew due to her dispute with Sullivan. The following year theAlice Comediesstopped being distributed by Winkler. After Mintz become involved with the progress it was clear that Disney was unhappy with the production costs on cartoons, and he asked Disney andUb Iwerksto develop a new character. The result wasOswald the Lucky Rabbit, the first animated character forUniversal Pictures.[4]In February 1928, when the character proved more successful than expected, Disney sought to meet with Mintz over the budget, wanting to spend more on the cartoons. Mintz refused, and hired away all ofWalt Disney Studios's animators except Iwerks, Les Clark, and Johnny Cannon, who all refused to leave Disney. He moved the production of the Oswald cartoons to Winkler Pictures, along with Margaret Winkler's brother, George. After losing the Oswald contract toWalter Lantz, Mintz focused onKrazy Kat(a character from a comic strip by cartoonistGeorge Herriman), which was the output of a Winkler-distributed property.
M.J. Winkler Productions became known as Winkler Pictures after Mintz took over in 1926 and partnered withColumbia Picturesfor distribution in 1929. In 1931, when the studio moved from New York to California, it was renamed The Charles Mintz Studio.[5]
The Charles Mintz studio became known as Screen Gems in 1933. The name was originally used in 1933, whenColumbia Picturesacquired a stake in Charles Mintz's animation studio.[6]The name was derived from an early Columbia Pictures slogan, "Gems of the Screen"; itself a takeoff on the song "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean".[7]Mintz was nominated for twoAcademy Awardsfor Best Short Subject. His first nomination was in 1935 forHoliday Land, and he was nominated again in 1937 forThe Little Match Girl. For about a decade,Charles MintzproducedKrazy Kat,Scrappy, and theColor Rhapsodyanimated short series Columbia Pictures. Also, between 1937 to 1940, several Color Rhapsody films were subcontracted toUb Iwerkswith the use of his ownanimation studio.
The studio's color cartoons were well received, while some other cartoons were not, mainly the laterKrazy KatandScrappyshorts. Animator Isidore Klein was particularly frustrated with theKrazy Katcartoons as it bear little resemblance to Herriman's comic strip by the mid 1930s (despite attempting to make a more faithful cartoon with the 1936 shortLil' Ainjil, which Klein was disappointed by the final product).[8]Furthermore, Columbia gave Mintz strict financial obligations where they advance a certain amount of money, resulting Mintz repeatedly running intocost overruns.[9]In 1939, after becoming indebted to Columbia and suffering from declining health, Mintz relinquished ownership of his studio and the Screen Gems name to Columbia to settle longstanding financial problems.[10]He would later pass away on December 30, 1939, from a heart attack.Krazy Katwas discontinued the following year, while the Scrappy cartoons ended a year afterwards.
By 1940, Columbia would oversee management of the studio following ownership. The studio's production manager, Jimmy Bronis, became the studio head but was shortly replaced by Mintz's brother-in-law, George Winkler. The following year, Columbia decided to hireFrank Tashlin, previously a writer forWalt Disney Productionsand director forLeon Schlesinger Productions, as the studio head instead.[11]Tashlin had a profound effect to the studio as he planned to revitalize it to greater heights. There, he would hire many displaced animators from the 1941Disney animators' strike, as well as making the decision of firing the bulk of their initial in-house staff (includingArthur Davis,Manny Gould,Lou Lilly, Ben Harrison and Winkler). He would also direct the shortThe Fox and the Grapes. Based on theAesop fable of the same name, the short would inadvertently spawn Columbia's most successful characters withThe Fox and the Crow, a comic duo of a refined Fox and a street-wise Crow. Tashlin was later replaced by Ben Schwalb as producer in April 1942, but continued to work there as a creative supervisor.[12]
Tashlin proved to be very influential to his staff, as he allowed and encouraged them to pursue the wildest of ideas under his supervision. However, his stay at Screen Gems would be short-lived, as he would later leave the studio in June following an argument with Columbia higher-ups.[12][13]When interviewed by Michael Barrier, he said that the management "can't stay happy long when things are going well, so we ended up in another fracas and I left."[11]He was replaced byDave Fleischer(who produced the 1942 WWII shortSong of Victoryunder Tashlin's supervision), previously the co-founder and head supervisor ofFleischer Studios.John Hubleydescribed Fleischer as being very detached from his employees, calling him "one of the world's intellectual lightweights". He was also known for editing completed cartoons in a way that broke continuity.[14]He was later fired and succeeded by a revolving door of producers, including musician Paul Worth,Three StoogesproducerHugh McCollumand ex-Schlesinger assistants Ray Katz and Henry Binder. The studio would also create several more recurring characters around this time, includingTito and His Burrito,Flippy,Flop the Cat, Igor Puzzlewitz,Willoughby Wren,and an adaptation ofAl Capp'scomic seriesLi'l Abner, with varying levels of success.
Tashlin's departure had an immediate effect to the studio in a direction standpoint, with animation historians noting that the quality of there cartoons had declined soon after. Film historianLeonard Maltinclaimed that after Tashlin left, the studio "tried to maintain some spirit on-screen, with varying results. Screen Gems cartoons of the 1940s feature some of the least endearing cartoon characters ever created, and suffer from misguided story direction," which was seen in shorts such asMass Mouse Meeting(1943) andGiddy-Yapping(1944).[15]Hubley, who went on to directProfessor Tall and Mr. Small,He Can't Make It StickandThe Rocky Road to Ruin(all 1943) with Paul Sommer, said to have disliked his work at the studio, and that Columbia "hated" the cartoons they were making.[14]Capp was also reportedly displeased with the quality of theLi'l Abnercartoons, which was discontinued after five cartoons,[16]and the shorts produced by Katz and Binder were criticized for being "pale carbons of the Warner Brothers shorts,"[17]to the point of creating clone characters ofSylvester the Cat, andDaffy Duck, respectively.[18]
In addition to Tashlin's departure, many of the ex-Disney animators that he hired also left for other studios; the inability to hire and maintain more experienced directors and storymen, as well as Columbia's mismanagement were also argued as other key factors to the studios diminished quality. Some staff members during this period included Bob Wickersham, Alec Geiss, Sid Marcus (one of the few pre-Tashlin artists who stayed in the studio), Howard Swift andAlex Lovy.Bob Clampettwas also brought in as a gag writer before setting up his own brief animation studio forRepublic Pictures, whileLooney TunewritersMichael MalteseandTedd Piercewere said to have moonlighted for a few cartoons.[19][20]
Screen Gems was, in an attempt to keep costs low, the last American animation studio to stop producing black and white cartoons. The final black-and-white Screen Gems shorts appeared in 1946, over three years after the second-longest holdouts (Famous Studiosand Leon Schlesinger Productions). During that same year, Columbia, still dissatisfied of the studios output, decided to shut its doors for good, but continured to release a back catalog of shorts up until 1949.[21]The studio name was later repurposed for a television division, while the former Seward Street facility, which Screen Gems occupied since 1940, was taken over byWalter Lantz Productionsin 1947.[22]
The Screen Gems cartoons were regarded as ones of varying quality, comparable to those produced byFamous StudiosandTerrytoons. In spite of the studio's internal affairs, the Screen Gems' cartoons were still moderately successful, with three more cartoons achievingAcademy Awards nominations. The cartoons produced and supervised by Tashlin were also praised for his attempts at revitalizing the studio. However, Screen Gems never achieved a level of success comparable toWalt Disney Productions,Warner Bros. Cartoons,Walter Lantz Productionsand theMGM Cartoon Studio. The studio's purpose was assumed by an outside producer,United Productions of America(UPA), whose cartoons, includingGerald McBoing-Boingand theMr. Magooseries, were major critical and commercial successes. Following UPA, a deal withHanna-Barberawas made in 1957, which lasted until 1967.
In 1999,Columbia TriStar International TelevisionproducedTotally Tooned In- a syndicated TV package showcasing Columbia's classic cartoon library. With the aid of animation historianJerry Beck, Columbia restored and remastered the majority of the color Screen Gems cartoons (as well as all the UPA cartoons) from their original 35mm elements. The show aired in several international markets before making its American television debut onAntenna TVon January 8, 2011. They would later be aired onToon In With Meon theMeTVNetwork in November 2021.[23]Despite these restoration efforts,Sony Pictures Home Entertainmenthas no current plans to release these shorts on DVD or Blu-ray. Since CPE Holdings, Inc. became dormant on May 9, 2024,Sony Pictures Releasingnow owns the theatrical distribution on behalf ofColumbia Pictures, whileSony Pictures Televisionowns the television distribution on behalf of CPT Holdings, Inc. to the majority of the color Screen Gems cartoons (as well as all the UPA cartoons) library.
All series were distributed by Columbia unless otherwise noted.[24]
Ralph Cohn, the son of Columbia co-founderJack Cohnand nephew of Columbia headHarry Cohn, founded Pioneer Telefilms, a television commercial production company, in 1947. Ralph later wrote a 50-page memo arguing that Columbia should be the first major film studio to move into television. Although Harry wasn't convinced by the suggestion, Columbia invested $50,000 acquiring Pioneer and reorganized it as Screen Gems.[26]The studio started its new business in New York on April 15, 1949.[27]
By 1951, Screen Gems became a full-fledged television studio by producing and syndicating several popular shows(seebelow). Within a few months, Ralph Cohn had sold a half-hour dramatic anthology concept to theFord Motor Companywhich becameFord Theatre, which was one of the first times a major Hollywood movie studio had produced content for television. They also produced seven episodes of the first season ofCavalcade of America.[28][29]
The name "Screen Gems," at the time, was used to hide the fact that the film studio was entering television production and distribution. Many film studios saw television as a threat to their business, thus it was expected that they would shun the medium. However, Columbia was one of a few studios who branched out to television under a pseudonym to conceal the true ownership of the television arm. That is until 1955, when Columbia decided to usethe woman from its logounder the Screen Gems banner, officially billing itself as a part of "the Hollywood studios of Columbia Pictures", as spoken in announcements at the end of some Screen Gems series.
By 1952, the studio had produced a series of about 100 film-record coordinated releases for television under the brand "TV Disk Jockey Toons" in which the films "synchronize perfectly with the records".[30]
In 1954, the studio started producingFather Knows Beston CBS andThe Adventures of Rin Tin Tinon ABC, which became their biggest successes at the time.[26]
On July 1, 1956, studio veteranIrving Briskinstepped down as stage manager of Columbia Pictures and formed his own production company Briskin Productions, Inc. to release series through Screen Gems and supervise all of its productions.[31]On December 10, 1956, Screen Gems expanded into television syndication by acquiring Hygo Television Films (a.k.a. Serials Inc.) and its affiliated company United Television Films, Inc. Hygo Television Films was founded in 1951 by Jerome Hyams, who also acquired United Television Films in 1955 that was founded by Archie Mayers.[32]
During that year, the studio began syndicating Columbia Pictures' theatrical film library to television, including the series of two-reel short subjects starringThe Three Stoogesin 1957. Earlier on August 2, 1957, they also acquired syndication rights to "Shock Theater", a package ofUniversal Pictureshorror films (later shifted toMCA TV), which was enormously successful in reviving that genre.[33]
From 1958 to 1974, under President John H. Mitchell and Vice President of ProductionHarry Ackerman, Screen Gems delivered TV shows and sitcoms:Dennis the Menace,The Donna Reed Show,Hazel,Here Come the Brides,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,Gidget,Bewitched,I Dream of Jeannie,The Flying Nun,The Monkees,The Girl with Something ExtraandThe Partridge Family.
It was also the first distributor forHanna-Barbera Productions, an animation studio founded byWilliam HannaandJoseph Barberaafter leavingMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and was also the distributor of theSoupy Salesshow. The company also entered a co-production deal withCanada'sCTV Television Networkand produced several shows, many of which were filmed or taped inTorontofor distribution to Canadian stations (Showdown,The Pierre Berton Show).[citation needed]The company even expanded as far asAustralia, opening Screen Gems Australia to produce shows for that country's networks, includingThe Graham Kennedy Showfor theNine Network.[34]
In the late 1950s, Screen Gems also entered into ownership and operation of television stations. Stations owned by Screen Gems over the years included KCPX (Salt Lake City; nowKTVX, owned byNexstar Media Group),WVUE-DT(New Orleans; now owned byGray Television),WAPA-TV(San Juan; now owned by the Hemisphere Media Group),WNJU(Linden, NJ; nowTelemundo/NBCUniversalO&O), and several radio stations as well, including 50,000-watt clear channelWWVA(Wheeling, WV; now owned byiHeartMedia). As a result, in funding its acquisitions, 18% of Screen Gems' shares was spun off from Columbia and it became a publicly-traded company on the NYSE until 1968. Screen Gems also provided technical assistance and partial control of a private television station inVenezuela,Canal 11 Televisión, which existed from 1966 to 1968.[35][36]
In 1963, William Dozier, who was one of the top Screen Gems employees, and senior vice president of production left to start out Greenway Productions, with a non-exclusive agreement with the studio for joint distribution of its TV productions.[37]Even though none of Greenway's shows went to SG, Greenway immediately struck out a deal with rival television producer20th Century-Fox Televisionin 1964.[38]
In 1963, Screen Gens entered music publishing with the purchase ofDon Kirshner'sAldon Musicwith Kirshner named head of the Columbia-Screen Gems music division.  Four years later, he departed Screen Gems after coming into conflict withThe Monkeesover their desire to play on their records.Lester Sillreplaced Kirshner, and remained head of music publishing until 1985.  Screen Gems-Columbia Music was sold to EMI for $23.5 million in 1976.
From 1964 to 1969, former child starJackie Cooperwas Vice President of Program Development. He was responsible for packaging series (such asBewitched) and other projects and selling them to the networks.
For the 1965–1966 season, Screen Gems announced that they would sign three big creative programmers to develop new series, which was announced in June 1964. Among them was writerSidney Sheldon, directorHy Averback, and writerDavid Swift.[39]
In 1965, Columbia Pictures acquired a fifty per cent interest in the New York-based commercialproduction companyEUE, which was incorporated into Screen Gems and renamedEUE/Screen Gems. The studios were sold in 1982 to longtime Columbia Pictures executive George Cooney shortly after Columbia Pictures was sold toThe Coca-Cola Company.
On December 23, 1968, Screen Gems merged with its parent company Columbia Pictures Corporation and became part of the newly formed Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. for $24.5 million.[40]
In the following year, formerABCvice president of programmingLeonard Goldbergjoined Screen Gems, displacing Jackie Cooper as vice president of program development.[41]Goldberg failed to receive the same level of success as Cooper. His shows all tanked after one season, with the exception ofThe Partridge Family, and he abruptly left after three years, with the most notable other production of Goldberg's tenure at Screen Gems being the 1971 television movieBrian's Song. He then formed a production company with producerAaron Spelling.[42]
In 1971,Douglas S. Cramer, former executive VP in charge of production atParamount Television, set up a SG-affiliated production firm, The Douglas S. Cramer Company, to produce projects for feature films and TV projects via Columbia Pictures.[43]In 1972,David Gerber, who had left20th Century Fox Television, set up a SG-affiliated production company to produce his own projects with that company. The most notable of these productions wasPolice Story, an NBC police crime drama.[42]In 1973, Allan Blye andChris Beardevia Blye-Bearde Productions signed an independent production agreement with Screen Gems to develop their own projects.[44]Also that year, Harry Ackerman, who was vice president of production left the studio to start his own production company to be affiliated withParamount Television.[45]
On May 6, 1974, Screen Gems was renamed toColumbia Pictures Televisionas suggested by then-studio presidentDavid Gerber, who succeeded Art Frankel as his studio president.[46]The final notable production from this incarnation of Screen Gems before the name change was the 1974miniseriesQB VII. Columbia was, technically, the last major studio to enter television by name.
Changes in corporate ownership of Columbia came in 1982, when Coca-Cola bought the company, although continuing to trade under the CPT name.  In the mid-1980s, Coca-Cola reorganized its television holdings to create Coca-Cola Television, merging CPT with the television unit of Embassy Communications as Columbia/Embassy Television, although both companies continued to use separate identities until January 2, 1988, when it andTri-Star Televisionwere merged under the CPT name.[47]Columbia also ranColex Enterprises, a joint venture withLBS Communicationsto distribute most of the Screen Gems library, which ended in 1987.[48]In 1985, the name was brought back byColumbia Pictures Televisionto distribute classic television series from its vaults to first-run syndication.[49]
On December 18, 1987, Coca-Cola spun off its entertainment holdings and sold it toTri-Star Pictures, Inc.for $3.1 billion. It was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc., also creating Columbia/Tri-Star by merging Columbia and Tri-Star. Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names.[50]In 1989,SonyCorporation of Japan purchased Columbia Pictures Entertainment. On August 11, 1991, Columbia Pictures Entertainment was renamed asSony Pictures Entertainmentas a film production-distribution subsidiary and subsequently combined CPT with a revived TriStar Television on February 21, 1994 to formColumbia TriStar Television. The name "Screen Gems" was also utilized for a syndicated hour-long program for classic television calledScreen Gems Networkthat first aired in 1999 and ran until 2002.[51]
The television division is presently known asSony Pictures Television.

On December 8, 1998, Screen Gems was resurrected as a fourth speciality film-producing arm of Sony's Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group. It was created afterTriumph Filmsclosed.[55]Screen Gems produces and releases "films that fall between the wide-release films traditionally developed and distributed by Columbia Pictures and those released bySony Pictures Classics".[56]Many of its releases are of the horror,[2]thriller, action, drama, comedy and urban genres, making the unit similar toDimension Films(part ofLantern Entertainment),Hollywood PictureswithSearchlight Pictures(divisions ofThe Walt Disney Company), andRogue Pictures(when it was formally owned byRelativity Mediaand before that,Universal Pictures).
As of 2023,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter(2016) is Screen Gems' highest-grossing film with over $300 million dollars worldwide in box office earnings.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
