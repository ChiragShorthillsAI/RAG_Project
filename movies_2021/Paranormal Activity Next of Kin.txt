Margot and hercameramanfriend Chris want to make adocumentaryabout Margot's past. Her mother, Sarah, abandoned her outside a hospital, and she wonders what drove Sarah to make such a decision. Through a genetics site, she and Chris meet her blood relative Samuel, who is anAmishcurrently going through hisrumspringa. The team is joined by Dale, their documentary'ssoundman. Samuel leads them to Beiler Farm, where he and Margot's mother came from.
Jacob, the patriarch of the commune and Sarah's father and Margot's grandfather, welcomes the team, and they find lodging. Strange events occur; Margot finds a little girl brushing her doll's hair in the barn. The doll is named Sarah, and the girl cryptically says that Sarah is "still there." Margot later hears sounds from her mother's old room and sees a spirit.
The group interviews Jacob. He tells them about the free-spirited Sarah, who defied their practices by sleeping with a boy and getting pregnant. Instead of being forced to give up Margot to an adoptive family, she instead left her at a hospital. Sarah is now assumed dead. Margot's team finds a church that Jacob prevents them from entering. That night, the team discovers a strange ritual in the barn in which a newborn two-headed goat is sacrificed.
Determined to find out the commune's secrets, Margot and Chris break into the church. They discover paintings depicting the demonic figureAsmodeus, as well as a deep pit. Margot sneaks into Jacob's room the next day and discovers that he and Samuel had known about her being Sarah's daughter and had orchestrated her arrival. A ghoulish being attacks Margot that night. The next day, Chris and Dale find her catatonic with her sheets soaked with blood.
Chris and Dale hitch a ride into town for their car battery and are informed by the mailman that the people at Beiler Farm are not Amish. They research the demon Asmodeus: According to myth, the Norwegian village of Beskytter suffered a massacre believed to be caused by Asmodeus. They trapped the demon inside the body of a woman, and the demon continues to be passed from mother to daughter in the bloodline. Margot is next in line and this is why she was brought to the settlement.
When Chris and Dale return, Margot has disappeared. While Dale leaves to install their car battery, Chris enters the church to search for Margot. After encountering and killing Jacob, Chris rescues Margot from the bottom of the pit, but they are pursued by a skeletal creature. The creature kills Dale and pursues Margot and Chris in the barn. Margot, realizing that the creature is Sarah possessed by Asmodeus, calls her by her name. Taking advantage of her mother's weakened state, she sends Sarah falling to her death onto a spiked row of farm tools.
With the death of Sarah, Asmodeus wreaks havoc in Beiler Farm, with the residents killing each other and the livestock and homes burning. Margot and Chris flee the farm in their car. Later, police officers arrive and encounter a demonically-possessed Samuel emulating a baby's cry. Samuel forces the police officers to die by suicide before driving away in a police cruiser.

William Eubank(born November 15, 1982) is an Americanfilm director,screenwriterandcinematographer. On his first feature film,Love, released in 2011, in addition to directorial and director of photography duties, Eubank also served asproduction designer.[3][4]His second feature film,The Signal, premiered at the2014 Sundance Film Festivaland was released in theaters byFocus Featureson June 13, 2014.[5]His third feature film, the science-fiction horror filmUnderwater, was released in January 2020 by20th Century Fox.[6][7]
Eubank was born on November 15, 1982, inHolyoke,Massachusetts.[8]His father, Carlyle Eubank II, is afine art consultant, formerChristie'srepresentative, and adviser to theOffice of Fine Artsat theState Department.[9][10][11]His mother, Patricia Reeder Eubank, is achildren's bookauthor and illustrator.[12]The second of four siblings, Eubank has one older sister and two younger brothers, and grew up in theSanta Ynez Valley, anoted wine-producing regionnorth ofLos Angeles.[13][14]
Growing up he was inspired by his grandfather, a formerUS Navy cinematographer; from the stories he would tell – one involved operating a camera while flying underneath theGolden Gate Bridge– Eubank decided he wanted to either attend theUnited States Naval Academyor become a cinematographer, eventually settling on the latter.[8][15][16]Eubank grew up involved inScoutingand, like filmmakersSteven SpielbergandDavid Lynch, is anEagle Scout.[17][18]
When Eubank was young, he had an interesting experience with theverisimilitudeof cinema. At the time that he first watched the 1974 filmChinatown, set in the year 1937, Eubank was unaware that it was aperiod piece, assuming it to have been made contemporaneously in 1937. When he found out it had been made almost four decades after the era it depicted, Eubank came to a realization about film's power.[19]: 14:33
Eubank began accepting jobs as a director or cinematographer at age 18. A number of Eubank's early works featured the use of in-cameraspeed 'ramping'. As a cinematographer andcamera operator, Eubank was hired by theUFCto film fights in this style.[20]Eubank was never hired to directcommercials, but did releasespecs, as well as reels and camera tests.[21]Eubank was accepted intoUCLAwhere he tookcosmologyclasses that he would later cite as an influence on his films' ideas.[22]After attending UCLA for two years, he had not made it into thefilm program, and, impatient, he dropped out and went to work atPanavisionWoodland Hillsas a camera repair technician anddigital imaging technician.[23][16]
Eubank would become a seasoned Panavision employee, staying at the company for the next eight years.[24]Eubank attended theSundance Film Festivalfive times representing Panavision, dreaming of attending as a director. He would meet with his Navy cinematographer grandfather, who lived in Salt Lake City, who insisted Eubank would someday attend with a film.[8][15][25]
While at Sundance and elsewhere, it was Eubank's job to promote and provide support for the PanavisedCineAlta F900, which had singularly moved Hollywood into the digital cinema era with its use in the production ofGeorge Lucas's 2002 filmStar Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, the third, and first major, feature film to be released that was shot entirely on a24pdigital camera.[16][26]Using his position at Panavision, Eubank convinced the Australian cinema product manufacturerBlackmagic Designto send him an early edition of anSDIcapture card.[27]Using this early card and the brand-neweSATAdrives that had just appeared on the market, Eubank stacked 14 hard drives on top of each other and drilled a hole into aPower Mac G4in order to create anNLE systemon a personal computer that could directly capture the F900'sFull HD 1080pfootage.[28]When the working result was seen at Panavision, co-workers agreed a shift was about to occur in the industry.[27]
After working at Panavision for some time, Eubank was occasionally given permission to borrowcameras and lensesfor his tests. When Panavision eventually tabulated what he had used, they realized he had been given the loan of what would have been multiple million dollars worth of rental fees.[19]: 4:25[24]Eubank describes his time at Panavision as serving as his film school.[16]Sent to sets of films likeCollateralandSuperman Returns, Eubank would take a notebook and draw diagrams of where thegafferhad placed all the lights and would then go see the film when it came out and compare the on-screen results to his journals.[24]Eubank credits Panavision's kindness to him as being essential: "I owe my entire career to those guys".[29]
In 2007, Eubank was approached byTom DeLongeto create material for thealternative rockbandAngels & Airwaves. Eubank directed a number of music videos for the band, including the video for the single "Surrender".[30][31]Eubank also wrote and directed the feature filmLove, commissioned and produced by Angels & Airwaves. The film was inspired byTerrence Malick'sThe Thin Red Lineand asks according to Eubank: "[W]hat are we, as human beings, going to leave behind when we cease to exist one day…?"[32]Sight & Soundclaimed that the film showed "concern with the relationship between the human mind and everything beyond it (other minds, […] God, the universe)" and put forward that the film's ending could function as "a metaphor for the individual’s interface with otherness".[4]
Eubank spent four years working on the film, serving as the film'sproduction designerand constructing both theInternational Space StationandCivil War-battleground sets for the film in his parents' backyard himself over the course of nine months.[33][34]Eubank based his building of the ISS set onNASAphotography andskateboard rampdesigns and his staging of the battle scenes on Civil War paintings.[32][35]The filming was frequently interrupted by weather and the sounds of frogs and his family's neighbor operating aweedwhacker.[32]On February 2, 2011, the film premiered at theSanta Barbara International Film Festival. It later screened at eleven other festivals worldwide, including theAthens International Film Festival, where Eubank won the "Best Director" award. On August 10, 2011,National CineMediareleased the film.
WhileLovewas still being edited, Eubank began writing a second screenplay,The Signal. He collaborated on the script with fellow screenwritersDavid Frigerioand his brother,Carlyle Eubank.[36]In an interview, Eubank described his first thoughts for the project: "I'm a big fan ofThe Twilight Zone, of whatRod Serlingused to do as a storyteller, and I always wanted to do one of those – a story with intangibility and strangeness that makes you say, 'What the heck is going on?' I’d been thinking about the concept of an individual thrust into a specific and extreme situation, the true nature of which this person would have to uncover."[25]Before production could begin, Eubank worked assecond unitdirector on the 2013RegencyfilmBroken City. Soon after,The Signalfound producers: Brian Kavanaugh-Jones ofInsidiousand Tyler Davidson ofTake Shelter, and production could begin.
Eubank described his main inspirations for the film as filmmakersStanley Kubrickand David Lynch, and also said that thematically the filmsPi,MoonandCubewere on his mind.[25]His visual inspiration was drawn fromSpaghetti Westerns,Man on FireandHanna.[21]Eubank decided to shoot the film in2.39:1 theatrical anamorphic format, saying: "No other ratio allows you to stare right into an actor’s eyes; the performance can erupt."[25]When it came to the film'spacing, scale andrhythm, Eubank began with a goal to make the film feel small and then suddenly large, explaining: "I wanted the opening to feel super free, and like aroad movie, [and] in a weird way small, so that by the time [I] was going to ramp things up both emotionally [and] technically… it really was going to slowly burn until it got to that sort of firecracker end. I think that that level of contrast within a film is interesting. It's not something I really see that much."[37]He and David Lanzenberg, the director of photography, chose to leave aLowCon filteron for the entire time to reducedigitaledginess.[29]
To cast the film, Eubank met with actors overSkypefrom New Mexico, settling on Australian actorBrenton Thwaites, English actorOlivia Cookeand American actorBeau Knapp. For props, Eubank worked withLegacy Effectsto design custom pieces. After two years of pre-production,The Signalbegan shooting in Albuquerque, where it was occasionally hampered by sandstorms.[25]The film's 29-day shoot took place in New Mexico and Ohio.
Eubank choseBrian Berdan, who had worked on David Lynch'sBlue VelvetandTwin Peaks, to edit the film. Berdan and Eubank had collaborated before, Berdan having editedLove. Eubank described his work with Berdan, saying: "Brian’s sensibilities are different from mine; on my first film,Love, I realized that Brian had another way of looking at things than I did. I’ve come to appreciate his perspective, his fresh viewpoint, so much."[25]
While praising the film's "exquisite visual design",Varietycalled it "ultimately quite silly".[38]
In 2016, Eubank began work on the20th Century FoxandChernin EntertainmentfilmUnderwater. Eubank's third feature was his largest production so far.[6][39]From a script byBlack Listscreenwriter Brian Duffield,Underwaterfollows a crew of deep-sea researchers who must navigate across the ocean floor after their station is destroyed. Eubank castKristen StewartandJessica Henwickin the lead roles. The film also featuresT. J. Miller,Vincent Cassel,John Gallagher Jr.andGunner Wright, who worked with Eubank previously onLove. Eubank choseMontenegrincinematographerBojan Bazellito lens the movie. The film began shooting in March 2017 inNew Orleans, and completed principal photography on May 28, 2017. It was edited once again by Brian Berdan.Underwaterwas released to theatres on January 10, 2020.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
