Lincoln Loud, the middle child and only son of Lynn Loud Sr and Rita Loud, spends his time assisting his sisters—Lori, Leni, Luna, Luan, Lynn Jr, Lucy, Lana, Lola and Lisa—as they go about their day-to-day duties, while also teaching his youngest sister, Lily, how to cope with living in a large family. After a particularly successful day in which the sisters all win awards, they celebrate at the family restaurant, Lynn's Table. There, the Loud sisters are praised by fans while Lincoln is pushed to the side and ignored. Feeling that he is living in their shadows, he consults his best friend, Clyde McBride, who tells him about the time he learnt his grandmother's side of the family was from Paris.
Inspired, Lincoln asks his parents the same question and Lisa manages to trace Lynn Sr's heritage toScotland. The Loud family then heads to Scotland for a week-long vacation on a hectic trip involving parachuting from a cargo hold, flying in a hot air balloon, and traveling in a submarine. During the trip, Lori has a call with her boyfriend, Roberto "Bobby" Santiago Jr, but the signal service goes bad, causing Bobby to think that Lori broke up with him and set off for Scotland to find her. Upon arriving in the Scottish town of Loch Loud, a town filled with many oddities, the Loud Family learns from a boy named Scott—who Leni falls in love with—and Loch Loud's citizens that they are descendants of Scottish royalty. They are led to a castle ran bygroundskeeperAngus and the disgruntledproperty caretakerMorag.
Angus then shows the family members a painting of their ancestors that bears a striking resemblance to them and reveals they ruled the town for many years before sailing away forever. Lincoln eventually learns from Angus that his own ancestral counterpart, the Duke of the family, was the most special member of the family, much to his delight. Wanting to become the new Duke of Loch Loud, Lincoln partakes in many community service events to help restore the village to its former glory and eventually guilt-trips the rest of the family into moving to Scotland forever because they no longer have to share one bathroom.
The Louds adjust to their discovery and enjoy their time in the castle, while experiencing the ghost of their ancestor, Lucille Loud, as well Lela, a baby dragon who grows very fast whenever she eats, but Morag becomes frustrated with the family after living in the castle peacefully and quietly for many days. She then devises a plan, like her own ancestor, Aggie, to get the family to leave Loch Loud forever by hypnotizing Lela with a magic gemstone known as the Dragon Stone and the royal scepter.
After the sisters begin to get attention in the village, Morag tricks Lincoln into riding Lela to try to get back his attention. While he rides the dragon, she uses the gemstone and scepter to hypnotize it into destroying the town, so that Lincoln would be blamed for the chaos. Feeling guilty for the damage, Lincoln asks the family to return home to Royal Woods. As the family leaves for home, Morag proceeds to make herself the new duchess of the town, much to the displeasure of villagers, who find her attitude intolerable. In retaliation, she hypnotizes Lela again to cause more destruction to the village in order for the villagers to comply with her.
Lucille tells the family of Morag's plan and what she's doing to the town. The Louds then head back to the town on a rowboat to defeat Morag and un-hypnotize Lela. The sisters eventually get the scepter back and Lincoln, using his magic skills and with help from Lily, destroys the Dragon Stone, which breaks Lela out of her spell. In response, Lela drops Morag on an island filled with noisyseals, ending her reign of terror. The citizens of Loch Loud congratulate the family and ask Lincoln to resume his place as the duke of the kingdom, though Lincoln declines and instead offers the crown to Angus instead, feeling he deserves it more. This decision is approved by the citizens and the other ghosts of the Loud ancestors. Lincoln admits to the family he wishes he were special as his sisters, though his sisters tell him that he is special because he takes care of them, and the family happily hugs.
After helping repair the village, the Loud family says goodbye to Angus and the villagers and sets sail back home to Royal Woods. Bobby arrives to reunite with Lori only to find that she left. Clyde welcomes Lincoln back to Royal Woods with some duke-themed cream puffs.
During the credits, still images are shown that include, but are not limited to, the Duke's ghost riding Lela, Bobby reuniting with Lori, Leni contacting Scott online, Lincoln winning a 3rd place trophy at a magic show, Lela having laid three eggs, and Angus and the ghosts deciding to rescue Morag, who now works as the groundskeeper, succeeding Angus, albeit with Lela keeping her in line.

All the while, it also delivers a rollicking, giggle-packed tale of castles, dragons and backstabbing caretakers".[24]Common Sense Media's review published onThe Washington Postnoted that parents should "expect some name-calling like 'loser' and 'stinkin' Lincoln'," but noted that, "overall this is a funny, heartwarming story that the whole family can enjoy".[25]

The joint venture would mostly produce new material, though a Nickelodeon executive did not rule out the possibility of making films based onThe Ren & Stimpy Show,RugratsandDoug.[2]None of the movies were produced due to the 1994 acquisition of Paramount Pictures by Nickelodeon's parent company,Viacom, and they would distribute the movies instead.
