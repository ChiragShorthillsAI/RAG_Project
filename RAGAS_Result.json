            "Malick saidA Hidden Lifewould have a more structured narrative than his previous works: \"Lately—I keep insisting, only very lately—have I been working without a script and I've lately repented the idea. The last picture we shot, and we're now cutting, went back to a script that was very well ordered.\" This makes it his first linear, plot-driven film sinceThe New World(2005). He added, \"There's a lot of strain when working without a script because you can lose track of where you are. It's very hard to coordinate with others who are working on the film. Production designers and location managers arrive in the morning and don't know what we're going to shoot or where we're going to shoot. The reason we did it was to try and get moments that are spontaneous and free. As a movie director, you always feel with a script that you're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. And with no script, there's no round hole, there's just air. But I'm backing away from that style now.\"[9]"

He drew inspiration from his grandmother's obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to create the story of a pregnant housewife who develops the disorder pica, which causes her to ingest inanimate objects. Mirabella-Davis stated that his grandmother developed various rituals of control due to her unhappy marriage and the increasing sense of powerlessness in her life. She was eventually placed in a mental institution, where she received treatments such as electroshock therapy, insulin shock therapy, and a non-consensual lobotomy. Mirabella-Davis wanted to make a film about his grandmother's experience, but he realized that hand washing, her primary OCD symptom, was not very cinematic. Instead, he chose to focus on pica and explore the attraction that people with this disorder have to ingesting objects.[3]"

This prompts the children to perform acts of kindness, which gradually inspire the rest of the townsfolk to end their ancient dispute and make Smeerensburg a happy town.

The three children climb out of their window and join the boy, Peter, who takes them all to a tropical island with an activevolcano, which Peter calls \"Mother\". The island is populated by other children, including their long-lost cousin Thomas, who has not aged a day in over seven years. Peter explains that Mother's spirit resides in the volcano and prevents the children from aging, so long as they believe in her. They later discover a large glowing fish, which is Mother's other form with Wendy then secretly coming across a dated photograph of a deceased family of islanders (in some sort of subterranean shrine decorated with paintings deep beneath a sea cave) that include Peter and concludes Mother must've saved him from a natural disaster (that killed the other islanders) and shared her powers with Peter making him ageless."

The documentary foreshadowed Scorsese's next project, the epicGangs of New York(2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famousCinecittàfilm studios.

LikeThe Age of Innocence, it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actorLeonardo DiCaprio, who became a fixture in later Scorsese films.

Others include the 2011 Frenchgraphic novelYesterdayby David Blot and Jérémie Royer (the title, again, alluding to the Beatles song),[63][64][65]the 1990s British sitcomGoodnight Sweetheart,[66]the 2006 French filmJean-Philippe,[67][68]and Nick Milligan's 2013 novelEnormity.[69]Danny Boyle has said he was not aware of earlier works with similar premises when he read the script but had later become aware of a French film and British sitcom with a similar premise after the film's first trailer was revealed.[11]",
            "Peter BradshawofThe Guardiangave the film four out of five stars, writing \"although this film can be a bit hokey and uncertain on narrative development, the puppyish zest and fun summoned up by Curtis and Boyle carry it along.\"[53]Robbie Collinalso responded positively in his review forThe Daily Telegraph, saying the film \"rallies in style for a beautifully judged and surprisingly moving finale, which owes a lot to Patel and James's chemistry.\"[54]Owen GleibermanofVariety, meanwhile, was less enthusiastic, claiming the film had little soul and calling it a \"rom-com wallpapered with the Beatles' greatness.\"[55]Laura Snapes ofThe GuardiancalledYesterday\"the latest jukebox movie to put its women on mute.\"[56]"

His moods become imbalanced and his delusions return. The news that Beth is expecting a new baby with Paul also gives rise to Adam's insecurities about being unwanted and feeling like a burden. Nevertheless, Adam's grades improve so much that his essay is selected to be read at graduation. He asks Maya to the prom and she accepts.",

He is temporarily suspended, with the reasoning that it is for the students' safety. Adam lashes out at Paul, believing that an email Paul wrote to Sister Catherine the previous night is behind the suspension.\nThe suspension bars Adam from attending the prom, but he goes anyway. Before he leaves, he takes an overdose of his medication, believing it will help the night go smoothly. He meets Maya there, but as they dance, the dark voice plagues him and he begins to act erratically. Sister Catherine tries to kick him out, but his delusions cause him to push her to the ground, run to the catwalk, and fall over the edge."
