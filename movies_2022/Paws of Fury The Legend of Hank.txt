Jackson, withMel Brooks,Aasif Mandvi,Djimon Hounsou, and Kylie Kuioka in supporting roles. Taking place in a world ofanthropomorphicanimals, the film tells the story of Hank, a dog who learns to become asamuraito save a cat village from a conniving landlord.
The project was first announced by producer Yair Landau in 2010 asBlazing Samuraiin response to the then-recent trend of westernizing Asian films. The development of the film continued between 2014 and 2016 with Mass Animation handling production andOpen Road Filmsacquiring the United States distribution rights before dropped out in 2017, due to the closure of Open Road Films. It was later re-announced in November 2019 afterAniventurejoined as the new producing studio with a planned 2021 release. Due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, much of the final animation was done remotely from the crew's homes as were some of the voice recordings.
Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hankwas scheduled to be released in 2017, but was delayed several times, mainly due to distributor changes and the COVID-19 pandemic. It eventually premiered inLos Angeleson July 10, 2022, and was released in the United States on July 15, byParamount Picturesunder theNickelodeon Moviesimprint, and in the United Kingdom on July 22, bySky Cinema. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $42 million worldwide.
In a land inspired byfeudal Japanand entirely inhabited by cats, Ika Chu, a conniving high ranking official of the land'sShogun, desires to expand his giant palace. However, it resides right next to the impoverished village of Kakamucho. Hoping to get rid of it, Ika Chu plans to force Kakamucho's residents to abandon their town by sending a gang of thugs led by his second-in-hand Ohga to trash the town. The townspeople demand that the Shogun appoint a new samurai to protect them after the previous one flees. Ika Chu, hoping to offend the townspeople, decides to appoint Hank, a dog prisoner about to be executed, as Kakamucho's samurai.
After an initial hostile reception, Hank relies on the assistance of Jimbo, acatnip-addled samurai who reluctantly agrees to train him, in order to overcome the townspeople's hostility. While training, Hank subdues Sumo, an immensely strong henchman that Ika Chu sent to drive out the townspeople quicker, with the help of Jimbo. The townspeople start to see Hank as a hero, but his newfound popularity ends up going to Hank's head and he neglects his training, which causes a fallout between him and Jimbo.
Ika Chu takes Hank to a private nightclub in order to distract him while secretly bribing people to respect Hank. At the same time, Ohga leads the bandits to trash Kakamucho. Hank returns to a devastated town. After a heated argument with Jimbo, he decides to go home. Halfway to the harbor, Hank finds anorigamifigure of himself in his belongings which reminds him of his samurai oath.
Jimbo attempts to storm Ika Chu's palace in hopes to free Sumo, who was captured by Ika Chu's henchmen. Hank returns in order to help him out. Upon hearing about Sumo's escape, Ika Chu recruits an army of thugs to get rid of Kakamucho for good. Hank returns to Kakamucho, and explains his plan to defeat Ika Chu's army.
The townspeople then build a perfect paper copy of the town and themselves as a diversion. When the raiders attack the fake town and its population of dummies, which have been booby-trapped with dynamite, Hank ignites the bombs and the townspeople attack the thugs. The Shogun arrives who questions the ruckus. He does remember Jimbo who states that nothing went wrong the day he injured his in-laws at his surprise party. Ohga accidentally exposes Ika Chu's plan to him, causing Ika Chu to flee. Hank then chases Ika Chu to his palace where he fights him on his giant jade toilet which overflows and threatens to flood the town. Hank warns the Kakamucho townspeople of the incoming flood and leads them in the digging of a channel to safely divert the water around the town.
With Kakamucho saved, the impressed Shogun decides to appoint Jimbo as the new samurai, but he gives the position to Hank. Hank feels that he is not entirely ready, so he ends up giving the position to Emiko, a kitten who also desires to be a samurai. Hank and Jimbo continue to train in their own time with their relationship mended.
In a post-credits scene, two guards look into the prison cell of Ika Chu who states that at least he will not have to partake in a sequel.

Clearly, all concerned considered it a pet project. They were right to do so."[28]Owen Gleibermanpraised Jackson and Gervais, but thought Cera's "sheepish" performance left the film "in search of a center", adding: "You get the feeling that the whole premise of this project was that the script, with itsBlazing Saddlesmystique, would somehow power it. But sorry, those fumes faded out across the decades."[29]The A.V. Club's Martin Tsai gave a highly critical review, calling it "morally reprehensible", with a "lazy, melting-pot approach to exploring Asian culture".[30]

Nickelodeon Movies Inc.[1]is an Americanfilm productioncompany based inLos Angeles, Californiaand owned byParamount Global. Originally founded in 1995, it serves as both the film production arm of the American children's networkNickelodeonand the family film distribution label ofParamount Pictures.

In 1993, Nickelodeon agreed to a two-year contract with20th Century Foxto make feature films. The joint venture would mostly produce new material, though a Nickelodeon executive did not rule out the possibility of making films based onThe Ren & Stimpy Show,RugratsandDoug.[2]None of the movies were produced due to the 1994 acquisition of Paramount Pictures by Nickelodeon's parent company,Viacom, and they would distribute the movies instead. With the creative differences withJohn Kricfalusi, the creator ofRen & Stimpyand an inability to market that property in a family-friendly manner instead of a "cynical and gross humor" scuttled the film.[3][4]However, Paramount and Viacom would go forward and start development onThe Rugrats Moviea year after the acquisition.
The Nickelodeon version of theDougfilm was not made due to the acquisition of the show's production studio,Jumbo Pictures, byThe Walt Disney Companyin 1996.

During his studies, Minkoff metChuck Jonesand credited him as an inspiration. He remembered, "I met Chuck during my first year at CalArts and he became a mentor to me ...

In early 1944, in his senior year in high school, Brooks was recruited to take theArmy General Classification Test, aStanford–Binet-typeIQ test.[23]He made high scores and was sent to theArmy Specialized Training Programat theVirginia Military Instituteto be taughtelectrical engineering, horse riding, andsaberfighting.[23][24][25]In 1944, Brooks was drafted into the Army.[24]Twelve weeks later, when he turned 18, he officially joined theUnited States Army[17]at theFort Dix,[23]New Jersey, induction center, and was sent to theField Artillery Replacement Training CenteratFort Sill, Oklahomaforbasic trainingand radio operator training.[23][26][27][25]Brooks was then sent back to Fort Dix for overseas assignment.[23]Brooks says he boardedSSSea Owlat theBrooklyn Navy Yardaround February 15, 1945.[23]A reporter for theUnited States Department of Defensewrites that Brooks arrived in France in November 1944, and later in Belgium, serving with the78th Infantry Divisionas aforward artillery observer.[24]In December 1944, a short while later, Brooks was transferred to the 1104thEngineer Combat Battalionas acombat engineer, participating in theBattle of the Bulge.[25][24][28][29]Of his experience there, Brooks noted:
Along the roadside, you'd see bodies wrapped up in mattress covers and stacked in a ditch, and those would be Americans, that could be me. I sang all the time ... I never wanted to think about it ... Death is the enemy of everyone, and even though you hate Nazis, death is more of an enemy than a German soldier.[30]
Stationed inSaarbrückenandBaumholder, the battalion was responsible for clearingbooby-trappedbuildings and defusing land mines as theAlliesadvanced into Nazi Germany.[31][32][25]Brooks was tasked with land mine location; defusing was done by a specialist.[23]Brooks has stated that when he heard Germans singing over loudspeakers, he responded by singing American-Jewish singerAl Jolson's hit "Toot, Toot, Tootsie (Goo' Bye!)" into abullhorn.[33][34][35]Brooks spent time in thestockadeafter taking an anti-Semitic heckler's helmet off and smashing him in the head with his mess kit.[36]His unit constructed the firstBailey bridgeover theRoer River,[23]later building bridges over theRhine river.[24]In April 1945, Brooks's unit conducted its last reconnaissance missions in theHarz mountains, Germany.[24]
With theend of the war in Europe, Brooks joined theSpecial Servicesas a comic touring Army bases and he was made actingcorporal, put in charge of entertainment atWiesbaden,[6][25]and performed at Fort Dix.[6]In June 1946, Brooks washonorably dischargedfrom the Army as acorporal.[25][24]
After the war, Brooks's mother had secured him a job as a clerk at theBrooklyn Navy Yard, but Brooks "got into a taxi and ordered the driver to take him to the Catskills",[37]where he started working in variousBorscht Beltresorts and nightclubs in theCatskill Mountainsas a drummer and pianist. When a regular comic at one of the clubs was too sick to perform, Brooks started working as a stand-up comic, telling jokes and doing movie-star impressions. He also began acting in summer stock in Red Bank, New Jersey, and did some radio work.[17]He eventually worked his way up to the comically aggressive job oftummleratGrossinger's, one of the Borscht Belt's most famous resorts.[17][38]
In the years after the war, Brooks's hero was comedian Sid Caesar. Back in New York, Brooks would slink[39]around trying to catch Caesar in between meetings to pitch him joke ideas. Eventually Caesar cracked and paid Brooks a little cash to throw him gags....At 24, Brooks got his break as a full-time writer.[40]
Brooks found more rewarding work behind the scenes, becoming a comedy writer for television. In 1949, his friendSid Caesarhired him to write jokes for the DuMont/NBC seriesThe Admiral Broadway Revue,[41]paying him, off-the-books, $50 a week. In 1950, Caesar created the innovative variety comedy seriesYour Show of Showsand hired Brooks as a writer along withCarl Reiner,Neil Simon,Danny Simon, and head writerMel Tolkin.[17]The writing staff proved widely influential.[42]Reiner, as creator ofThe Dick Van Dyke Show, basedMorey Amsterdam's character Buddy Sorell on Brooks.[43]Likewise, the filmMy Favorite Year(1982) is loosely based on Brooks's experiences as a writer on the show including an encounter with the actorErrol Flynn.[44]Neil Simon's playLaughter on the 23rd Floor(1993) is also loosely based on the production of the show, and the character Ira Stone is based on Brooks.[45][46]Your Show of Showsended in 1954 when performerImogene Cocaleft to host her own show.[47]
Caesar then createdCaesar's Hourwith most of the same cast and writers (including Brooks and addingWoody AllenandLarry Gelbart). It ran from 1954 until 1957.[48][49]Brooks toldThe New York Times, "When I was a fledgling comedy writer working for Sid Caesar onYour Show of Shows, our head writer was Mel Tolkin... I really looked up to him. (By the way, I was 5-foot-7 and he was six feet tall.) He was a bona fide intellectual, thoroughly steeped in the traditions of great Russian literature. One day he handed me a book. He said to me, 'Mel, you're an animal from Brooklyn, but I think you have the beginnings of something called a mind.' The book wasDead Soulsby the magnificent geniusNikolai Gogol. It was a revelation. I'd never read anything like it. It was hysterically funny and incredibly moving at the same time... It was a life-changing gift, and I still read it once a year to remind myself of what great comic writing can be."[50]
Brooks and co-writer Reiner had become close friends and began to casually improvise comedy routines when they were not working. In October 1959, for aRandom Housebook launch ofMoss Hart's autobiography,Act One, atMamma Leone's,Mel Tolkin(standing in for Carl Reiner) and Mel Brooks performed, and it was later recalled byKenneth Tynan.[51]Reiner played the straight-man interviewer and set Brooks up as anything from a Tibetan monk to an astronaut. As Reiner explained: "In the evening, we'd go to a party and I'd pick a character for him to play. I never told him what it was going to be."[17]On one of these occasions, Reiner's suggestion concerned a2000-year-old manwho had witnessed the crucifixion ofJesus Christ(who "came in the store but never bought anything"), had been married several hundred times and had "over forty-two thousand children, and not one comes to visit me". At first Brooks and Reiner only performed the routine for friends but, by the late 1950s, it gained a reputation in New York City.Kenneth Tynansaw thecomedy duoperform at a party in 1959 and wrote that Brooks "was the most original comic improvisor I had ever seen".[17]
In 1960, Brooks, without his family, moved from New York to Hollywood, returning in 1961.[52]He and Reiner began performing the "2000 Year Old Man" act onThe Steve Allen Show. Their performances led to the release of the comedy album2000 Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooksthat sold over a million copies in 1961.[17]They eventually expanded their routine with two more albums in 1961 and 1962, a revival in 1973, a 1975 animated TV special, and a reunion album in 1998. At one point, when Brooks had financial and career struggles, the record sales from the 2000 Year Old Man were his chief source of income.[6]Brooks adapted the 2000 Year Old Man character to create the 2500-Year-Old Brewmaster forBallantine Beerin the 1960s. Interviewed byDick Cavettin a series of ads, the Brewmaster (in a German accent, as opposed to the 2000 Year Old Man's Yiddish accent) said he was inside the original Trojan horse and "could've used a six-pack of fresh air".[53]
Brooks was involved in the creation of the Broadway musicalAll Americanwhich debuted onBroadwayin 1962. He wrote the play with lyrics byLee Adamsand music byCharles Strouse. It starredRay Bolgeras a southern science professor at a large university who uses the principles of engineering on the college's football team and the team begins to win games. It was directed byJoshua Logan, who script-doctored the second act and added a gay subtext to the plot. It ran for 80 performances and received twoTony Awardnominations. The animated short filmThe Critic(1963), a satire of arty, esoteric cinema, was conceived by Brooks and directed byErnest Pintoff. Brooks supplied running commentary as the baffled moviegoer trying to make sense of the obscure visuals. It won theAcademy Award for Animated Short Film.
With comedy writerBuck Henry, Brooks created a TV comedy show titledGet Smart,about a bumblingJames Bond–inspired spy. Brooks said, "I was sick of looking at all those nice sensible situation comedies. They were such distortions of life... I wanted to do a crazy, unrealcomic-stripkind of thing about something besides a family. No one had ever done a show about an idiot before. I decided to be the first."[54]StarringDon Adamsas Maxwell Smart, Agent 86, the series ran from 1965 until 1970, although Brooks had little involvement after the first season. It was highly rated for most of its production and won sevenEmmy Awards,[55]including Outstanding Comedy Series in 1968 and 1969.
During a press conference forAll American, a reporter asked, "What are you going to do next?" and Brooks replied, "Springtime for Hitler," perhaps riffing onSpringtime for Henry.[56]For several years, Brooks toyed with a bizarre and unconventional idea about a musical comedy ofAdolf Hitler.[57]He explored the idea as a novel and a play before finally writing a script.[17]He eventually found two producers to fund it,Joseph E. LevineandSidney Glazier, and made his first feature film,The Producers(1968).[58]
The Producerswas so brazen in its satire that major studios would not touch it, nor would many exhibitors. Brooks finally found an independent distributor who released it as an art film, a specialized attraction. At the41st Academy Awards, Brooks won the Academy Award forBest Original Screenplayfor the film over fellow writersStanley KubrickandJohn Cassavetes.[59]The Producersbecame a smash underground hit, first on the nationwidecollege circuit, then in revivals and on home video. It premiered to a limited audience in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on November 22, 1967, before achieving a wide release in 1968.Peter Sellerspersonally championed the film, paying out of pocket to take out full page ads inVarietyandThe New York Times.[60]Brooks, along with his collaboratorThomas Meehan, later adapted it into amusical, which was hugely successful on Broadway and received an unprecedented 12 Tony awards. In 2000,Roger EbertincludedThe Producersin his canon of Great Movies, and remembered being in an elevator with Brooks andAnne Bancroftshortly after the movie was released: "A woman got on the elevator, recognized him and said, 'I have to tell you, Mr. Brooks, that your movie is vulgar.' Brooks smiled benevolently. 'Lady', he said, 'it rose below vulgarity.'"[61]
With the moderate financial success of the filmThe Producers, Glazier financed Brooks's next film,The Twelve Chairs(1970). Loosely based onIlf and Petrov's 1928Russian novel of the same nameabout greedy materialism in post-revolutionary Russia, it starsRon Moody,Frank LangellaandDom DeLuiseas three men individually searching for a fortune in diamonds hidden in a set of 12 antique chairs. Brooks makes a cameo appearance as an alcoholic ex-serf who "yearns for the regular beatings of yesteryear". The film was shot in Yugoslavia with a budget of $1.5 million. It received poor reviews and was not financially successful.[17]
Brooks then wrote an adaptation ofOliver Goldsmith'sShe Stoops to Conquer, but was unable to sell the idea to any studio and believed that his career was over. In 1972, he met agentDavid Begelman, who helped him set up a deal withWarner Bros.to hire Brooks (as well asRichard Pryor,Andrew Bergman,Norman Steinberg, andAlan Uger) as a script doctor for an unproduced script calledTex-X. Eventually, Brooks was hired as director for what becameBlazing Saddles(1974), his third film.[17]Blazing SaddlesstarredCleavon Little,Gene Wilder,Harvey Korman,Slim Pickens,Madeline Kahn,Alex Karras, and Brooks himself, with cameos byDom DeLuiseandCount Basie. It had music by Brooks and John Morris, and a modest budget of $2.6 million. A satire on theWestern filmgenre, it references older films such asDestry Rides Again(1939),The Treasure of the Sierra Madre(1948),High Noon(1952) andOnce Upon a Time in the West(1968). In a surreal sequence towards the end, it references the extravagant musicals ofBusby Berkeley.
Despite mixed reviews,Blazing Saddleswas a success with younger audiences. It became the second-highest US grossing film of 1974, grossing $119.5 million in the United States and Canada. It was nominated for threeAcademy Awards:Best Actress in a Supporting Rolefor Madeline Kahn,Best Film Editing, andBest Music, Original Song. It won theWriters Guild of America AwardforBest Comedy Written Directly for the Screen; and in 2006 it was deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" by theLibrary of Congressand selected for preservation in theNational Film Registry. Brooks has said that the film "has to do with love more than anything else. I mean when that black guy rides into that Old Western town and even a little old lady says 'Up yours, nigger!', you know that his heart is broken. So it's really the story of that heart being mended."[17]Brooks described the film as "a Jewish western with a black hero".[62]
When Gene Wilder replacedGig Youngas the Waco Kid, he did so only when Brooks agreed that his next film would be a script[63]that Wilder had been working on: a spoof of theUniversalseries ofFrankensteinfilms from several decades earlier. After the filming ofBlazing Saddleswas completed, Wilder and Brooks began writing the script forYoung Frankensteinand shot it in the spring of 1974. It starred Wilder,Marty Feldman,Peter Boyle,Teri Garr,Madeline Kahn,Cloris LeachmanandKenneth Mars, withGene Hackmanin a cameo role. Brooks' voice can be heard three times: as the wolf howl when the characters are on their way to the castle; as the voice of Victor Frankenstein, when the characters discover the laboratory; and as the sound of a cat when Gene Wilder accidentally throws a dart out of the window in a scene with Kenneth Mars. ComposerJohn Morrisagain provided the score, andUniversal monstersspecial effects veteranKenneth Strickfadenworked on the film.
Young Frankensteinwas the third-highest-grossing film domestically of 1974, just behindBlazing Saddleswith a gross of $86 million. It also received two Academy Award nominations forAdapted ScreenplayandBest Sound. It received some of the best reviews of Brooks's career. Even notoriously hard-to-please criticPauline Kaelliked it, saying: "Brooks makes a leap up as a director because, although the comedy doesn't build, he carries the story through ... [He] even has a satisfying windup, which makes this just about the only comedy of recent years that doesn't collapse."[17]In 1975, at the height of his movie career, Brooks tried TV again withWhen Things Were Rotten, aRobin Hoodparody that lasted only 13 episodes. Nearly 20 years later, in response to the 1991 hit filmRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Brooks mounted another Robin Hood parody,Robin Hood: Men in Tights(1993). It resurrected several pieces of dialogue from his TV series, and from earlier Brooks films.
After his two hit films Brooks got a call fromRon Clarkwho had an audacious idea: the first feature-length silent comedy in four decades.[64]Silent Movie(1976) was written by Brooks and Clark, and starred Brooks in his first leading role, with Dom DeLuise, Marty Feldman,Sid Caesar,Bernadette Peters, and in cameo roles playing themselves:Paul Newman,Burt Reynolds,James Caan,Liza Minnelli,Anne Bancroft, and themimeMarcel Marceau, who uttered the film's only word of audible dialogue: "Non!" It is an homage to silent comediansCharlie ChaplinandBuster Keaton, among others. It was not as successful as Brooks's previous two films but did gross $36 million. Later that year, he was named fifth on theTop Ten Money Making Stars Poll.[17]Reviews were generally favorable;Roger Ebertpraised it as "not only funny, but fun. It's clear at almost every moment that the filmmakers had a ball making it." Regarding the film's inside jokes, Ebert wrote that "the thing about Brooks's inside jokes is that their outsides are funny, too."[65]
High Anxiety(1977), Brooks's parody ofFreudian psychoanalysis, as well as the films ofAlfred Hitchcock, was written by Brooks, Ron Clark,Rudy De Luca, andBarry Levinson, and was the first movie Brooks produced himself. Starring Brooks, Madeline Kahn,Cloris Leachman, Harvey Korman,Ron Carey,Howard Morris, andDick Van Patten, it satirizes such Hitchcock films asVertigo,Spellbound,Psycho,The Birds,North by Northwest,Dial M for MurderandSuspicion. Brooks plays Professor Richard H. (Harpo) Thorndyke, a Nobel Prize–winning psychologist who suffers from "high anxiety".[17]
By 1980,Gene SiskelandRoger Eberthad referred to Mel Brooks andWoody Allenas "the two most successful comedy directors in the world today ... America's two funniest filmmakers".[66]Released that year was the dramatic filmThe Elephant Mandirected byDavid Lynchand produced by Brooks. Knowing that anyone seeing a poster reading "Mel Brooks presentsThe Elephant Man" would expect a comedy, he set up the companyBrooksfilms. It has since produced a number of non-comedy films, includingFrances(1982),The Fly(1986), and84 Charing Cross Road(1987) starringAnthony Hopkinsand Anne Bancroft—as well as comedies, includingRichard Benjamin'sMy Favorite Year(1982), partially based on Mel Brooks's real life. Brooks sought to purchase the rights to84 Charing Cross Roadfor his wife, Anne Bancroft, for many years. He also produced the comedyFatso(1980) that Bancroft directed.
In 1981, Brooks joked that the only genres that he hadn't spoofed were historical epics and Biblical spectacles.[17]History of the World Part Iwas a tongue-in-cheek look at human culture from theDawn of Manto theFrench Revolution. Written, produced and directed by Brooks, with narration byOrson Welles, it was another modest financial hit, earning $31 million. It received mixed critical reviews. CriticPauline Kael, who for years had been critical of Brooks, said, "Either you get stuck thinking about the bad taste or you let yourself laugh at the obscenity in the humor as you doBuñuel's perverse dirty jokes."[17]
Brooks produced and starred in (but did not write or direct) a remake ofErnst Lubitsch's 1942 filmTo Be or Not to Be. His1983 versionwas directed byAlan Johnsonand starred Brooks, Anne Bancroft,Charles Durning,Tim Matheson,Jose FerrerandChristopher Lloyd. It generated international publicity by featuring a controversial song on its soundtrack—"To Be or Not to Be (The Hitler Rap)"—satirizing German society in the 1940s, with Brooks playing Hitler.
The second movie Brooks directed in the 1980s wasSpaceballs(1987), a parody of science fiction, mainlyStar Wars. It starredBill Pullman,John Candy,Rick Moranis,Daphne Zuniga, Dick Van Patten,Joan Rivers, Dom DeLuise, and Brooks.
In 1989, Brooks (with co-executive producerAlan Spencer) made another attempt at television success with the sitcomThe Nutt House, featuring Brooks regulars Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman. It was originally broadcast on NBC, but the network aired only five of the eleven produced episodes before canceling the series. During the next decade, Brooks directedLife Stinks(1991),Robin Hood: Men in Tights(1993), andDracula: Dead and Loving It(1995).Peoplemagazine wrote, "Anyone in a mood for a hearty laugh couldn't do better thanRobin Hood: Men in Tights, which gave fans a parody ofRobin Hood, especiallyRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves."[67]Like Brooks's other films, it is filled with one-liners and the occasional breaking ofthe fourth wall.Robin Hood: Men in Tightswas Brooks's second time exploring the life of Robin Hood (the first, as mentioned above, being his 1975 TV showWhen Things Were Rotten).Life Stinkswas a financial and critical failure, but is notable as the only film Brooks directed that is neither a parody nor a film about other films or theater. (The Twelve Chairswas a parody of the original novel.)
Brooks created themusical adaptationof his filmThe Producerson theBroadwayin 2001. The production starringNathan LaneandMatthew Broderickreceived critical acclaim and was a significant box office success.The New York Timestheatre criticBen Brantleypraised the production writing, "Mr. Brooks has taken what could have been overblown camp into a far warmer realm in which affection always outweighs irony."[68]The production broke theTony Awardrecord with 12 wins, a record previously held for 37 years byHello, Dolly!with 10 wins including theTony Award for Best Musical. It led to a 2005big-screen versionof the Broadway adaptation/remake with Lane, Broderick,Gary Beach, andRoger Bartreprising their stage roles, and new cast membersUma ThurmanandWill Ferrell.
In early April 2006, Brooks begancomposingthe score to a Broadwaymusical adaptation ofYoung Frankenstein, which he says is "perhaps the best movie [he] ever made". The world premiere was at Seattle's Paramount Theater, between August 7, 2007, and September 1, 2007, after which it opened on Broadway at the formerLyric Theater(then the Hilton Theatre), New York, on October 11, 2007. It earned mixed reviews from the critics. In the 2000s, Brooks worked on ananimated seriessequel toSpaceballscalledSpaceballs: The Animated Series, which premiered on September 21, 2008, onG4 TV.
Brooks has also supplied vocal roles for animation. He voiced Bigweld, the master inventor, in the animated filmRobots(2005), and in the later animated filmMr. Peabody & Sherman(2014) he had a cameo appearance asAlbert Einstein. He returned, to voice Dracula's father,Vlad, inHotel Transylvania 2(2015)[69]andHotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation(2018). Brooks joked about the concept of a musical adaptation ofBlazing Saddlesin the final number inYoung Frankenstein, in which the full company sings, "next year,Blazing Saddles!" In 2010, Brooks confirmed this, saying that the musical could be finished within a year; however, no creative team or plan has been announced.[70]
In 2021, at age 95, Brooks published a memoir titledAll About Me!.[71]On October 18, 2021, it was announced that Brooks would write and produceHistory of the World, Part II, a follow-up TV series onHuluto his1981 movie.[72]He received a nomination forPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performancefor his role as the narrator in the series.
Brooks is one of thefew peoplewho have received anOscar, anEmmy, aTony, and aGrammy.[73]He won his first Grammy forBest Spoken Comedy Albumin 1999 for his recording ofThe 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000withCarl Reiner. His two other Grammys came in 2002 for Best Musical Show Album for the cast album ofThe Producersand for Best Long Form Music Video for the DVDRecording the Producers: A Musical Romp with Mel Brooks. He won his first of four Emmy awards in 1967 for Outstanding Writing Achievement in Variety for aSid Caesarspecial, and won Emmys in 1997, 1998, and 1999 for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his role of Uncle Phil onMad About You. He won his Academy Award for Original Screenplay (Oscar) in 1968 forThe Producers.[74]He won his three Tony awards in 2001 for his work on the musicalThe Producers, for Best Musical, Best Original Musical Score, and Best Book of a Musical.
Brooks also won aHugo AwardandNebula AwardforYoung Frankenstein.[75]In a 2005 poll byChannel 4to findThe Comedian's Comedian, he was voted No. 50 of the top 50 comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.[76]TheAmerican Film Institute(AFI) lists three of Brooks's films on itsAFI's 100 Years...100 Laughslist:Blazing Saddles(#6),The Producers(#11), andYoung Frankenstein(#13).[77]
On December 5, 2009, Brooks was one of five recipients of the 2009Kennedy CenterHonors at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC.[78]He was inducted into theHollywood Walk of Fameon April 23, 2010, with amotion pictures starlocated at 6712Hollywood Boulevard.[79][80]American Mastersproduced a biography on Brooks which premiered May 20, 2013, onPBS.[81]The AFI presented Brooks with its highest tribute, theAFI Life Achievement Award, in June 2013.[82][83]In 2014 Brooks was honored in a handprint and footprint ceremony atTCL Chinese Theatre. His concrete handprints include a six-fingered left hand as he wore a prosthetic finger when making his prints.[84]On March 20, 2015, he received aBritish Film Institute Fellowshipfrom theBritish Film Institute.[85]
Brooks met Florence Baum,[86]a dancer inGentlemen Prefer Blondes, on Broadway.[87][88]They were married from 1953 until their divorce in 1962. They had three children.[89]After earning a salary of $5,000 a week onYour Show of ShowsandCaesar's Hour,[90]his salary dropped to $85 a week as a freelance writer. For five years he had fewgigs, and was living inGreenwich Villageon Perry Street in a fourth-floor walk-up.[56]In 1960, to escape his situation, Brooks moved in with a friend, in Los Angeles.[52]In 1961, after his return to New York, he found that Baum had begun suing him for legal separation.Marriage Is a Dirty Rotten Fraud[91]was an autobiographical script based on his marriage.[40][14]By 1966, Brooks was "living in a fairly old but comfortable New York town house".[53]
Brooks married actressAnne Bancroftin 1964, and they remained together for 41 years until her death in 2005.[92]They met at a rehearsal for thePerry ComoVariety Showin 1961, and were married three years later on August 5, 1964, at theManhattan Marriage Bureau.[92][93]Their son,Max Brooks, was born in 1972.[92][93]In 2010, Brooks credited Bancroft as "the guiding force" behind his involvement in developingThe ProducersandYoung Frankensteinfor the musical theater, saying of an early meeting with her: "From that day, until her death ... we were glued together."[94]He has remained single since she died, stating in 2023 that "Once you are married to Anne Bancroft, others don't seem to be appealing".[95]According toDavid DeLuiseonWizards of Waverly Pod, Brooks is his godfather. DeLuise's fatherDom DeLuisewas a frequent costar of Brooks in his earlier career.[96]
Brooks is a voracious reader; in a profile forThe New Yorker,Kenneth Tynandescribes "Brooks the secret connoisseur, worshiper of good writing, and expert on theRussian classics, with special reverence toGogol,Turgenev,Dostoevski, andTolstoy."[97]InThe Producers, Bialystock refers to Bloom as "Prince Myshkin", a character from Dostoevsky'sThe Idiot, and the name Leo Bloom is a reference to Leopold Bloom, hero ofJoyce'sUlysses.[98]
Regarding religion, Brooks stated, "I'm rather secular. I'm basically Jewish. But I think I'm Jewish not because of the Jewish religion at all. I think it's the relationship with the people and the pride I have. The tribe surviving so many misfortunes, and being so brave and contributing so much knowledge to the world and showing courage".[99]
Brooks has consistently expressed pride in his Jewish identity. In 2021, Brooks toldNPR'sTerry Gross: "I love being a Jew, I love Jewish humor..."[100]
On Jewish cinema, Brooks said, "They can be anything and anywhere ... if there's a tribal thing, like, the 'please God, protect us' feeling ... we don't know where and how it's gonna come out.Avatarwas a Jewish movie ... these people on the run, chasing—and being pursued".[101]
Brooks endorsedJoe Bidenin the2020 presidential electionin his first-ever public endorsement of a political candidate.[102][103]He endorsedKamala Harrisin the2024  presidential election.[104]

Linked page for 'Andrew Bergman' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bergman):
Andrew Bergman(born February 20, 1945) is an American screenwriter, film director, and novelist. His best-known films includeBlazing Saddles,The In-Laws,The FreshmanandStriptease.
Born to a Jewish family,[1]Bergman graduated fromBinghamton Universityin 1965 and earned aPhDin American history from theUniversity of Wisconsin–Madisonin 1970.
His dissertation, a study of Depression-era Hollywood films, was published in 1971 by NYU Press under the titleWe're in the Money: Depression America and Its Films. He also wroteJames Cagney: The Pictorial Treasury of Film Stars.[2]
Bergman broke into the film industry by writing the original screenplay (titledTex X) that served as the basis forMel Brooks's classicBlazing Saddles(1974), and was among the writers who adapted it into its final state. He was later the sole creator of the TV sitcom pilot adaptation called "Black Bart" starring Louis Gossett Jr. for CBS which aired only once on April 4, 1975. The production was only a contractual requirement by Warner Bros. in order to maintain movie rights to produce future sequels. Mel Brooks did not have any involvement.
He wrote a gangster filmRhapsody in Crimethat was never made. Warner Bros approached him to write a sequel toFreebie and the Beanwith Peter Falk and Alan Arkin. Instead, Bergman came up withThe In-Laws(1979).[3]

Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor Sr.(December 1, 1940 – December 10, 2005) was an American stand-up comedian and actor. Known for reaching a broad audience with his trenchant observations and storytelling style, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most important stand-up comedians of all time. Pryor won aPrimetime Emmy Awardand fiveGrammy Awards.[1]He received the firstKennedy CenterMark Twain Prize for American Humorin 1998. He won theWriters Guild of America Awardin 1974. He was listed at number one onComedy Central's list of all-time greatest stand-up comedians.[2]In 2017,Rolling Stoneranked him first on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.[3]
Pryor's body of work includes numerousconcert filmsand recordings. He won theGrammy Award for Best Comedy AlbumforThat Nigger's Crazy(1974),...Is It Something I Said?(1975),Bicentennial Nigger(1976),Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip(1982), andRichard Pryor: Here and Now(1983). He is also known forRichard Pryor: Live & Smokin'(1971),Wanted: Live in Concert(1978), andRichard Pryor: Live in Concert(1979). Pryor served as a co-writer for theMel Brookssatirical western comedy filmBlazing Saddles(1974).
As an actor, he starred mainly in comedies. He gained acclaim for his collaborations withGene Wilder, including the filmsSilver Streak(1976),Stir Crazy(1980),See No Evil, Hear No Evil(1989), andAnother You(1991). He also acted in films such asUptown Saturday Night(1974),Blue Collar(1978),The Wiz(1978),California Suite(1978),Superman III(1983),Harlem Nights(1989), andLost Highway(1997). He appeared as himself onSesame StreetandSaturday Night Livebefore hostingThe Richard Pryor Show(1977), andPryor's Place(1984).
Pryor was born on December 1, 1940, inPeoria, Illinois. He grew up in a brothel run by his grandmother, Marie Carter, where his alcoholic mother, Gertrude L. (née Thomas), was a prostitute.[4]His father, LeRoy "Buck Carter" Pryor (June 7, 1915 – September 27, 1968), was a former boxer,hustlerandpimp.[5]After Gertrude abandoned him when he was 10, Pryor was raised primarily by Marie,[6]a tall, violent woman who would beat him for any of his eccentricities. Pryor was one of four children raised in his grandmother's brothel. He wassexually abusedat age seven,[7]and expelled from school at the age of 14.[8]
Pryor served in theU.S. Armyfrom 1958 to 1960, but spent virtually the entire stint in an army prison. According to a 1999 profile article about Pryor inThe New Yorker, Pryor was incarcerated for an incident that occurred while he was stationed inWest Germany. Angered that a white soldier was overly amused at the racially charged scenes ofDouglas Sirk's filmImitation of Life, Pryor and several other black soldiers beat and stabbed him, although the soldier survived.[8]
He was a member of Henry Brown Lodge No. 22 in Peoria, where he became aPrince Hall Freemason.[9]
In 1963, Pryor moved to New York City and began performing regularly in clubs alongside performers such asBob DylanandWoody Allen. On one of his first nights, he opened for singer and pianistNina Simoneat New York'sVillage Gate. Simone recalls Pryor's bout ofperformance anxiety:
He shook like he hadmalaria, he was so nervous. I couldn't bear to watch him shiver, so I put my arms around him there in the dark and rocked him like a baby until he calmed down. The next night was the same, and the next, and I rocked him each time.[10]
Inspired byBill Cosby, Pryor began as amiddlebrowcomic, with material less controversial than what was to come. He began appearing regularly on televisionvariety showssuch asThe Ed Sullivan Show,The Merv Griffin Show, andThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. His popularity led to success as a comic inLas Vegas. The first five tracks on the 2005 compilation CDEvolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974), recorded in 1966 and 1967, capture Pryor in this period. In 1966, Pryor was a guest star on an episode ofThe Wild Wild West.
In September 1967, Pryor had what he described in his autobiographyPryor Convictions(1995) as an "epiphany". He walked onto the stage at theAladdin Hotelin Las Vegas (withDean Martinin the audience), looked at the sold-out crowd, exclaimed over the microphone, "What the fuck am I doing here!?", and walked off the stage. Afterward, Pryor began working profanity into his act, including the wordnigger. His first comedy recording, the 1968 debutRichard Pryoron theDove/Repriselabel, captures this particular period, tracking the evolution of Pryor's routine. His parents died—his mother in 1967 and his father in 1968.[11]
In 1969, Pryor moved toBerkeley, California, where he immersed himself in thecountercultureand met people likeHuey P. NewtonandIshmael Reed.[12]
In the 1970s, Pryor wrote for television shows such asSanford and Son,The Flip Wilson Show, and a 1973Lily Tomlinspecial, for which he shared anEmmy Award.[13]During this period, Pryor tried to break into mainstream television. He appeared in several films, includingLady Sings the Blues(1972),The Mack(1973),Uptown Saturday Night(1974),Silver Streak(1976),Car Wash(1976),The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings(1976),Which Way Is Up?(1977),Greased Lightning(1977),Blue Collar(1978), andThe Muppet Movie(1979).
Pryor signed with the comedy-oriented independent record labelLaff Recordsin 1970,[14]and in 1971 recorded his second album,Craps (After Hours). Two years later Pryor, still relatively unknown, appeared in the documentaryWattstax(1972), wherein he riffed on the tragic-comic absurdities ofrace relationsinWattsand the United States. Not long afterward, Pryor sought a deal with a larger label, and he signed withStax Recordsin 1973. When his third breakthrough albumThat Nigger's Crazy(1974) was released, Laff, which claimed ownership of Pryor's recording rights, almost succeeded in getting aninjunctionto prevent the album from being sold. Negotiations led to Pryor's release from his Laff contract. In return for this concession, Laff was enabled to release previously unissued material, recorded between 1968 and 1973, at will.That Nigger's Crazywas a commercial and critical success; it was eventually certified gold by theRIAA[15]and won theGrammy Award for Best Comedy Albumat the1975 Grammy Awards.
During the legal battle, Stax briefly closed its doors. At this time, Pryor returned toReprise/Warner Bros. Records, which re-releasedThat Nigger's Crazy, immediately after...Is It Something I Said?, his first album with his new label. LikeThat Nigger's Crazy, the album was a critical success; it was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA and won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording at the 1976 Grammy Awards.
Pryor's 1976 releaseBicentennial Niggercontinued his streak of success. It became his third consecutive gold album, and he collected his third consecutive Grammy for Best Comedy Recording for the album in 1977. With every successful album Pryor recorded for Warner (or later, his concert films and his 1980freebasingaccident), Laff published an album of older material to capitalize on Pryor's growing fame—a practice they continued until 1983. The covers of Laff albums tied in thematically with Pryor films, such asAre You Serious?forSilver Streak(1976),The Wizard of Comedyfor his appearance inThe Wiz(1978), andInsaneforStir Crazy(1980).[16]Pryor co-wroteBlazing Saddles(1974), directed byMel Brooksand starringGene Wilder. Pryor was to play the lead role of Bart, but Mel Brooks didn't want to share credit with the quickly-rising comic. Brooks has always maintained Warner Brothers' executives vetoed Pryor's casting, but no studio executive has ever corroborated this claim. It was only after Pryor's passing (in 2005), Brooks' began insisting the comic was "uninsurable" because of a "drug arrest;"[17]but to-date, no studio executive (employed at Warner Brothers during this era), has ever goneon the recordto corroborate Brooks' assertions—either the director's vigorously advocating or the studio's absolute rejection (for hiring Pryor to act inBlazing Saddles). According to directorMichael Shultz, "Richard wrote it and Mel Brooks chased him out,"  Shultz said at the time (during the film's theatrical exhibition). "Mel Brooks was trying to get total credit for the picture. . . . To be outmaneuvered and ripped off at that early stage in his career is something that's a little hard for him to get over. I'd feel the same way." Moreover, Brooks assured Pryor the role of Sheriff Bart was his, but after Pryor departed the director's writer's suite, he never heard from Brooks again. In early-1972, Pryor was reportedly dumbfounded when he had to first learn fromCleavon Littlethat Mel Brooks wasn't going to use him on-screen.[18]
In 1975, Pryor was a guest host on thefirst seasonofSaturday Night Live(SNL), making him the first black host. Pryor's longtime girlfriend, actress and talk-show host Kathrine McKee (sister ofLonette McKee), made a brief guest appearance with Pryor onSNL. One of the highlights of the night was the controversial"word association" skitwithChevy Chase.[19]He would later do his own variety show,The Richard Pryor Show, which premiered onNBCin 1977. The show was cancelled after only four episodes probably because television audiences did not respond well to his show's controversial subject matter, and Pryor was unwilling to alter his material for network censors. He later said, "They offered me ten episodes, but I said all I wanted to in four." During the short-lived series,he portrayed the first blackPresident of the United States, spoofed theStar WarsMos Eisleycantina, examinedgun violencein a non-comedy skit, lampooned racism on the sinkingTitanicand used costumes and visual distortion to appear nude.[20]In 1979, at the height of his success, Pryor visitedKenya. Upon returning to the United States from Africa, Pryor swore he would never use the word "nigger" in his stand-up comedy routine again.[21][22]
In 1980, Pryor became the first black actor to earn a million dollars for a single film when he was hired to star inStir Crazy.[23]On June 9, 1980, while on afreebasingbinge during the making of the film,[24]Pryor doused himself in rum and set himself on fire.[25]Pryor incorporated a description of the incident into his comedy showRichard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip(1982). He joked that the event was caused by dunking a cookie into a glass of low-fat andpasteurizedmilk, causing an explosion. At the end of the bit, he poked fun at people who told jokes about it by waving a lit match and saying, "What's that? Richard Pryor running down the street."
Before the freebasing incident, Pryor was about to start filming Mel Brooks'History of the World, Part I(1981), but was replaced at the last minute byGregory Hines.[26][27]Likewise, Pryor was scheduled for an appearance onThe Muppet Showat that time, which forced the producers to cast their British writer,Chris Langham, as the guest star for that episode instead.[28][29]After his "final performance", Pryor did not stay away from stand-up comedy for long. Within a year, he filmed and released a new concert film and accompanying album,Richard Pryor: Here and Now(1983), which he directed himself. He wrote and directed a fictionalized account of his life,Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling, which was inspired by the 1980 freebasing incident.[30]
In 1983 Pryor signed a five-year contract withColumbia Picturesfor $40 million and he started his own production company, Indigo Productions.[31][32]Softer, more formulaic films followed, includingSuperman III(1983), which earned Pryor $4 million,Brewster's Millions(1985),Moving(1988), andSee No Evil, Hear No Evil(1989). The only film project from this period that recalled his rough roots was Pryor's semiautobiographic debut as a writer-director,Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling, which was not a major success. Pryor was also originally considered for the role of Billy Ray Valentine onTrading Places(1983), beforeEddie Murphywon the part.[33][34][35]Despite his reputation for constantly using profanity on and off camera, Pryor briefly hosted a children's show onCBScalledPryor's Place(1984). LikeSesame Street(where Pryor appeared in a few oft-repeated segments),Pryor's Placefeatured a cast of puppets (animated bySid and Marty Krofft), hanging out and having fun in a friendly inner-city environment along with several children and characters portrayed by Pryor himself. Its theme song was performed byRay Parker Jr.[36]Pryor's Placefrequently dealt with more sobering issues thanSesame Street. It was cancelled shortly after its debut.[37]
Pryor co-hosted theAcademy Awardstwice - the49th Academy Awardsin 1977 withWarren Beatty,Ellen Burstyn, andJane Fondaand again at the55th Academy Awardsin 1983 alongsideLiza Minnelli,Dudley Moore, andWalter Matthau. He was also nominated for anPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Serieson the television seriesChicago Hope. Network censors had warned Pryor about his profanity for the Academy Awards, and after a slip early in the program, a five-second delay was instituted when returning from a commercial break. Pryor is one of only threeSaturday Night Livehosts to be subjected to a five-second delay (along withSam Kinisonin 1986 andAndrew Dice Clayin 1990).[38][39]
Pryor developed a reputation for being demanding and disrespectful on film sets, and for making selfish and difficult requests. In his autobiographyKiss Me Like a Stranger, co-star Gene Wilder says that Pryor was frequently late to the set during filming ofStir Crazy, and that he demanded, among other things, a helicopter to fly him to and from set because he was the star. Pryor was accused of using allegations of on-set racism to force the hand of film producers into giving him more money:
One day during our lunch hour in the last week of filming, thecraft serviceman handed out slices of watermelon to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs duringStir Crazy.[40]
Pryor appeared inHarlem Nights(1989), a comedy-drama crime film starring three generations of black comedians (Pryor, Eddie Murphy, andRedd Foxx).[41][42][43]
In his later years starting in the mid-1990s, Pryor used a power-operatedmobility scooterdue tomultiple sclerosis(MS).[44]He often said that MS stood for "More Shit".[45]He appears on the scooter in his last film appearance, a small role inDavid Lynch'sLost Highway(1997) playing an auto-repair garage manager named Arnie.[46]
Rhino Recordsremastered all of Pryor's Reprise and WB albums for inclusion in the box set... And It's Deep Too! The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings (1968–1992)(2000).[citation needed]
In December 1999, Pryor appeared in thecold openof an episode ofThe Norm Showentitled "Norm vs. The Boxer". He played Mr. Johnson, an elderly man in a wheelchair who has lost the rights to in-home nursing when he kept attacking the nurses before attacking Norm himself. This was his last television appearance.[47]
In 2002, Pryor and Jennifer Lee Pryor, his wife and manager, won legal rights to all the Laff material, which amounted to almost 40 hours of reel-to-reel analog tape. After going through the tapes and getting Richard's blessing, Jennifer Lee Pryor gave Rhino Records access to the tapes in 2004. These tapes, including the entireCraps (After Hours)album, form the basis of the February 1, 2005, double-CD releaseEvolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974).[48]
Pryor's influences includedCharlie Chaplin,Jackie Gleason,[49]Red Skelton,Abbott and Costello,Jerry Lewis,Dean Martin,Jack Benny,Bob Hope,[50]Woody Allen,[51][52]Dick Gregory,Bill Cosby,[53]Redd Foxx,[54]andLenny Bruce.[55]
Pryor met actressPam Grierthrough comedianFreddie Prinze. They began dating when they were both cast inGreased Lightning(1977).[56]Grier helped Pryor learn to read and tried to help him with his drug addiction.[57]Pryor married another woman while dating Grier.[25]
Pryor dated actressMargot Kidderduring the filming ofSome Kind of Hero(1982). Kidder stated that she "fell in love with Pryor in two seconds flat" after they first met.[58]
Pryor was married seven times to five women:[7][8][11]
Children
Pryor had seven children with six different women:[67][8][68][69]
Nine years after Pryor's death, in 2014, the biographical bookBecoming Richard Pryorby Scott Saul stated that Pryor "acknowledged hisbisexuality"[70][71]and, in 2018,Quincy Jonesand Pryor's widow Jennifer Lee stated that Pryor had a sexual relationship with actorMarlon Brando, and that Pryor was open with his friends about his bisexuality and the fact that he slept with men.[72][73]Pryor's daughter Rain later disputed the claim,[74]to which Lee stated that Rain was in denial about her father's bisexuality.[75]
Lee later told the Hollywood entertainment television seriesTMZ on TVthat, "it was the '70s! Drugs were still good...If you did enough cocaine, you'd fuck a radiator and send it flowers in the morning."[76][77]
In his autobiographyPryor Convictions, Pryor talked about having a two-week relationship with Mitrasha, atrans woman, which he called "two weeks of being gay".[78]
In his first special,Live & Smokin', Pryor discusses performing fellatio. He also said in the special, and in 1977 at a gay rights show at the Hollywood Bowl, "I have sucked a dick."[79]
Some sources (including Pryor himself) say that late in the evening of June 9, 1980, Pryor poured 151-proofrumall over himself and lit himself on fire.[80][81][25]Other sources (including the Los Angeles police) say that what burned him that night was an explosion that happened while he wasfreebasingcocaine.[24]While he was still burning, he ran down Parthenia Street from his Los Angeles home until he was subdued by police. He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for second- and third-degree burns covering more than half of his body.[82]Pryor spent six weeks in recovery at the Grossman Burn Center atSherman Oaks Hospitalin Los Angeles.[83]His daughterRainstated that the incident happened as a result of a bout of drug-inducedpsychosis.[84]
Pryor's widow Jennifer Lee recalled when he began freebasing cocaine: "After two weeks of watching him getting addicted to this stuff I moved out. It was clear the drug had moved in and it had become his lover and everything. I did not exist."[25]
In November 1977, after many years of heavy smoking and drinking, Pryor had a mild heart attack at age 36.[80]He recovered and resumed performing in January the following year. In 1986, he was diagnosed withmultiple sclerosis.[85]In 1990, Pryor had a second heart attack while in Australia.[65][86]He underwent tripleheart bypasssurgery in 1991.[87]
In late 2004, his sister said he had lost his voice as a result of his multiple sclerosis. However, on January 9, 2005, Pryor's wife, Jennifer Lee, rebutted this statement in a post on Pryor's official website, citing Richard as saying: "I'm sick of hearing this shit about me not talking ... not true ... I have good days, bad days ... but I still am a talkin' motherfucker!"[88]
On the morning of December 10, 2005, Pryor had a third and final heart attack at his house in Los Angeles. After his wife's failed attempts to resuscitate him, he was taken to a local Westside hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:58 a.m.PST. His widow Jennifer was quoted as saying, "At the end, there was a smile on his face."[32]
He wascremated, and his ashes were given to his family.[89][90]His ashes were scattered in the bay atHana, Hawaii, by his widow in 2019.[91]Forensic pathologistMichael Hunterbelieves Pryor's fatal heart attack was caused bycoronary artery diseasethat was at least partially brought about by years of tobacco smoking.[92]
Jerry Seinfeldcalled Pryor "thePicassoof our profession"[93]andBob Newhartheralded Pryor as "the seminal comedian of the last 50 years".[94]Dave Chappellesaid of Pryor, "You know those, like, evolution charts of man? He was the dude walking upright. Richard was the highest evolution of comedy."[95]This legacy can be attributed, in part, to the unusual degree of intimacy Pryor brought to bear on his comedy. AsBill Cosbyreportedly once said, "Richard Pryor drew the line between comedy and tragedy as thin as one could possibly paint it."[96]
In 1998, Pryor won the firstMark Twain Prize for American Humorfrom theJohn F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.[97][98]According to former Kennedy Center President Lawrence J. Wilker, Pryor was selected as the first recipient of the Prize because:[99]
as a stand-up comic, writer, and actor, he struck a chord, and a nerve, with America, forcing it to look at large social questions of race and the more tragicomic aspects of the human condition. Though uncompromising in his wit, Pryor, likeTwain, projects a generosity of spirit that unites us. They were both trenchant social critics who spoke the truth, however outrageous.
In 2004, Pryor was voted number one onComedy Central's list of the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time.[2]In a 2005 British poll to find "The Comedian's Comedian", Pryor was voted the 10th-greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.[100]
Pryor was posthumously awarded theGrammy Lifetime Achievement Awardin 2006.[101]

Eva died at age 74 oflung cancer.[14]Ricky was the youngest child; his siblings are: schoolteacher Larry (1945–2019), Marsha, a teacher forspecial needschildren (1948–), and painter–decorator Bob (1950–).[11][15]Prompted by Bob, Gervais began to question the existence of God from about age eight.[16]
Gervais has mentioned in interviews that, as an 11-year-old, he asked why his siblings were so much older than he was; his mother bluntly told him that he "was a mistake".[15]Gervais has spoken of his appreciation for his family's extreme sense of humour. He toldBBC Radio 4'sDesert Island Discsthat he and his brother Bob spent most of their mother's funeral "crying with laughter". They had been asked by thevicarto tell him something about their mother prior to the service, with Gervais saying, "My brother, just winding up the vicar, said, 'She was a keen racist.' And the vicar said, 'I can't say that!' So Bob went, 'Oh, OK then... she liked gardening.'"[11]
Gervais attended Whitley Park Infants and Junior Schools and received his secondary education atAshmead Comprehensive School. After agap year, which he spent working as a gardener at theUniversity of Reading, he attendedUniversity College London(UCL) in 1980.[17][18]He intended to study biology but changed to philosophy after two weeks, and was awarded a lower-second class honours degree in the subject fromUniversity College Londonin 1983.[19]During his time there, he metJane Fallon, with whom he has been in a relationship since 1982.[20]
For six months in 1983,[21]during his final year as a student at University College London, Gervais and his best friend Bill Macrae formed thenew wavepop duoSeona Dancing. They were signed byLondon Records, which released two of their singles—"More to Lose" and "Bitter Heart". The songs failed to make an impact on theUK Singles Chart.[22]Despite not being successful in the UK, Seona Dancing did manage to score a hit in thePhilippineswith "More to Lose".[23]Gervais also worked as the manager forSuedebefore they became successful in the 1990s.[24]
In 2013, Gervais performed a live tour asDavid Brentalong with his bandForegone Conclusion, Brent's fictional band inThe Office.[25]He and the band performed songs written under the Brent character, including "Equality Street" and "Free Love Freeway".[26]Gervais also produced a series of YouTube videos, 'Learn Guitar with David Brent', featuring acoustic guitar versions of nine songs.

After the first series ofThe Office, Gervais and Merchant returned to Xfm in November 2001 for a Saturday radio show, where they began working withKarl Pilkington, who produced the shows and later collaborated with them on their series ofpodcasts.[32]

Together called "The Podfather Trilogy", they debuted individually at Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas.[37]These three were known by Gervais and Merchant as "The Fourth Season". In October 2007 another free full-length podcast was released through iTunes, after being originally given out for free during a performance of Gervais'sFamestand-up tour in London. On 25 November 2007 Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington released another free podcast of just over one hour.

Gervais then came to much wider national attention with an obnoxious, cutting persona featured in a topical slot that replacedAli G's segments on the satirical Channel 4 comedy programmeThe 11 O'Clock Showin early 1999, in which his character used as many expletives as was possible and produced an inordinate number of politically incorrect statements. Among the other regular featured comedians on the show wasMackenzie Crook, later a co-star ofThe Office. Two years later, Gervais went on to present his comedy chat show for Channel 4 calledMeet Ricky Gervais, which was poorly received and cancelled after six episodes, and Gervais has since mocked it.[citation needed]
Throughout this time, Gervais also wrote for the BBC sketch showBruiserandTheJim TavareShow.[41]
The Officestarted whenStephen Merchanthad to make his short film while on a BBC production course. In August 1999 he made a docu-soap parody, set in an office, with help fromAsh Atallawho was shown a 7-minute video called 'The Seedy Boss'. Thus the character ofDavid Brentwas created. Merchant passed this tape on to the BBC's Head of EntertainmentPaul Jacksonat theEdinburgh Fringe, who then passed it on to Head of ComedyJon Plowman, who eventually commissioned a full-pilot script from Merchant and Gervais.[42]
The first six-episode series ofThe Officeaired in the UK in July and August 2001 to little fanfare or attention.[43]Word-of-mouth, repeats and DVDs helped spread the word, building up momentum and anticipation for the second series, also comprising six episodes.[44]Following the success ofThe Office'ssecond series, Gervais was named themost powerful person in TV comedybyRadio Times.[45]
In 2004,The Officewon theGolden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedyas well asBest Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedyfor Gervais, who said in a 2015 BBC interview that the award was the gateway to America for him.[46]

In 2021, on the show's 20th anniversary, he suggested the show would not have been produced in 2021 due tocancel culture: "I mean, now it would be cancelled. I'm looking forward to when they pick out one thing and try to cancel it. Someone said they might try to cancel it one day, and I say, 'Good let them cancel it—I've been paid!'"[49]

In 2007, Gervais won thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Seriesfor his portrayal of Andy Millman in the second series ofExtras.

British comedianKerry Godlimanplays Derek's best friend Hannah andDavid Earlplays Kev.[66]
Gervais said that the series is about "kindness [being] more important than anything else". He added: "It's about the forgotten—everyone's forgotten. It's all these arbitrary people who didn't know each other, and they're in there now because they're in the last years of their life. And it's about the people who help them, who themselves are losers and have their own problems. It's about a bunch of people with nothing, but making the most of it, and they're together." He chose to set the sitcom in a retirement home after he watchedSecret Millionaire—"It was always these people with huge problems who were helping other people. I thought about having Derek help old people because no one cares about old people in this country ... I think it's perfect for now."[67]

Gervais guest-starred in an episode ofThe Simpsonsentitled "Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife". He is the only British comic to write and star in aSimpsonsepisode. The episode was the highest-rated inSky One's history; it revolved around the angle that Gervais was the episode's sole writer (and the first guest star on the show to also receive a writing credit for the episode of his appearance). Gervais clarified the extent of his input in a joint interview (with Christopher Guest) forDazed and Confusedmagazine (January 2006): "No, all I did was put down a load of observations on an email and they made it look like aSimpsonsscript. I'm going to get the credit, but I think everyone in the industry knows it was a joint effort". Asked in a separate interview about how his idea for the episode (in which Homer swaps Marge on a game show) came about, Gervais replied: "I've always been fascinated with reality game shows but I think it was my girlfriend's idea. We watchCelebrity Big Brotherat the moment, we watchI'm a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here...we watch all those reality TV shows—The Officecame out of those docu-soaps".[99]Gervais, a longstandingSimpsonsfan, presented a segment to mark the show's 20th anniversary onBBC Two'sThe Culture Showon 16 June 2007.

Takei was born toJapanese-Americanparents, with whom he lived inTule Lake Segregation CenterduringWorld War II. He began pursuing acting in college, which led in 1965 to the role of Sulu, to which he returned periodically into the 1990s. Upon coming out as gay in 2005, he became a prominent proponent ofLGBT rightsand active in state and local politics. He has been a vocal advocate of the rights of immigrants, in part through his work on the 2012BroadwayshowAllegiance, about the internment experience.[3][4]
Takei spoke both English and Japanese growing up and remains fluent in both languages.[5][6]He has won several awards and accolades for his work on human rights andJapan–United States relations, including his work with theJapanese American National Museumin Los Angeles, California.

The family was later transferred to theTule Lake War Relocation Centerin California for internment.[14]
Takei had several relatives living in Japan duringWorld War II. Among them, he had an aunt and infant cousin who lived inHiroshimaand who were both killed during theatomic bombing that destroyed the city. In Takei's own words, "My aunt and baby cousin [were] found burnt in a ditch in Hiroshima."[15]At the end ofWorld War II, after leaving Tule internment camp, Takei's family was left without any bank accounts, home or family business; this left them unable to find any housing, so they lived onSkid Row, Los Angelesfor five years.[16]He attended Mount Vernon Junior High School and served as Boys Senior Board President atLos Angeles High School.[17]He was a member ofBoy ScoutTroop 379 of theKoyasan Buddhist Temple.[18][19]

He originated the role of George in the musicalFly Blackbird!, but when the show traveled from Los Angeles[24]toOff-Broadwaythe West Coast actors were forced to audition and the role went to William Sugihara instead.

Takei starred as a landscaper of Japanese descent in "The Encounter", a 1964 episode of theTwilight Zone.[25]CBS considered the episode's theme of US-Japanese hatred "too disturbing" to include when the series was syndicated.[26]"The Encounter" was not seen after its initial airing until it was released on video in 1992 as part of theTreasures of the Twilight Zonecollection.[25][26]

It was intended that Sulu's role be expanded in the second season, but Takei's role inThe Green Berets(1968) as Captain Nim, aSouth Vietnamese Armyofficer alongsideJohn Wayne's character, took him away fromStar Trekfilming and he only appeared in half the episodes of that season.Walter KoenigasPavel Chekovsubstituted for him in the other episodes. When Takei returned, the two men had to share a dressing room and a single episode script.[28]Takei admitted in an interview that he initially felt threatened by Koenig's presence, but later grew to be friends with him as the image of the officers sharing the ship's helm panel side-by-side became iconic.[28]

TheAssociated PresssaidAllegiancetries to tackle internment camps, discrimination and war, "but does so unsuccessfully in a bombastic and generic Broadway musical".Varietywrote, "In their sincere efforts to 'humanize' their complex historical material, the creatives have oversimplified and reduced it to generic themes."The Hollywood Reportersaid "the powerful sentiments involved are too often flattened by the pedestrian lyrics and unmemorable melodies of Jay Kuo's score".USA TodaycalledAllegiance"as corny as Kansas in August and as obvious asLady Gagaon a red carpet. But darned if it won't get a grip on your heartstrings."[43]

Takei said "It's not reallycoming out, which suggests opening a door and stepping through.

Takei stated, "As a former Boy Scout myself, it pains me deeply that the BSA still boots out gay Scouts when they turn 18. This web series will help educate and inform, as well as entertain. That gets a big thumbs up from me. Let's make this happen."[69]
In 2015, after the announcement of the U.S. Supreme Court same-sex marriage decision,Obergefell v. Hodges, Takei was critical ofClarence Thomas's dissent and called Thomas "a clown inblackface".[70]After defending his comments for over a week, Takei apologized for his wording.[70]

The following year he ran for a seat on theLos Angeles City Council, finishing second of five candidates in the special election and losing by 1,647 votes; the winner, David Cunningham Jr., received 42% of the votes cast and Takei received 33%. During the campaign, Takei's bid for the city council caused one local station to stop running the repeats of the originalStar Trekseries until after the election andKNBC-TV to substitute the premiere episode of theStar Trekanimated seriesscheduled by the network with another in which his character did not appear, in attempts to avoid violating theFCC'sequal-time rule.[81]The other candidates in the race complained that Takei's distinctive and powerful voice alone, even without his image on television every week, created an unfair advantage.[82]
Los Angeles mayorTom Bradleylater appointed Takei to the board of directors of theSouthern California Rapid Transit District, making him part of the team that initiated and planned theLos Angeles subwaysystem. Takei was called away from the set ofStar Trek: The Motion Picturein 1978 to cast the tie-breaking vote for the creation of the Los Angeles subway system. He served on the board from 1973 to 1984.[83]

However, he chose to withdraw after his opponent challenged the airing of episodes ofStar Trekon local television under theFederal Communications Commission'sFairness Doctrine"equal time" regulations,[84][85]saying also that "this is the wrong time to interrupt my career as an actor and author."[84]He also appeared as a sadistic Japanese POW camp commander in the World War II filmReturn from the River Kwai(1989).

Takei was praised for his response to McCance and garnered much media attention with the PSA.
In May 2011, in response to a Tennessee State Legislature bill that prohibited school teachers or students from using any language that alludes to the existence of homosexuality, Takei released another PSA in which he offered up his name, suggesting that people could just substitute that for 'gay'. For example, they could supportTakei marriageor watchTakei pride parades; or even use slurs such asThat's so Takei, or singDon we now our Takei apparelduringthe holiday season.
Takei marked the 70th anniversary of the internment of Americans of Japanese descent, including himself as a child, by asking his readers to contact the US Congress to block S. 1253, theNational Defense Authorization Act, that "would authorize a similar sweeping authority, granted to the President, to order the detention—without charge or trial—of any person even suspected of being associated with a 'terrorist organization'".[89]
On December 8, 2015, followingDonald Trump's call to ban all Muslims from traveling to the United States, Takei appeared onMSNBCto denounce him: "It's ironic that he made that comment on December 7,Pearl Harbor Day– the very event that put us in those internment camps", Takei said. "[A congressional commission] found that it was three things that brought that about. One was racial hysteria, second was war hysteria and third was failure of political leadership. Donald Trump is the perfect example of that failure. ... What Donald Trump is talking about is something that's going to make his logo 'America disgraced again'."[90]During thetransitionfollowingTrump's election,Carl Higbiecited the internment of Japanese Americans as a historical precedent for a register of Muslims.[91][92]Takei described Higbie's comments as "dangerous"[93]and went on to say onThe Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnellthat "[r]egistration of any group of people, and certainly registration of Muslims, is a prelude to internment."[94]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
