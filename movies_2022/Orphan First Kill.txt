In January 2007, Leena Klammer, a 31-year-old Estonian psychiatric patient withthe appearance of a 10-year-old, escapes the Saarne Institute by seducing and killing a guard, then hiding in the car of art therapist Anna. After killing Anna in her home, Leena looks up missing American girls and finds that she looks like Esther Albright, a girl from a rich family who went missing in 2003. Leena introduces herself as "Esther" to a Russian police officer and claims her parents are in the United States.
In Darien, Connecticut, artist Allen Albright and his wife Tricia are informed by Detective Donnan that their daughter has been found. Tricia travels to Moscow and brings "Esther" home. There, Leena becomes infatuated with Allen and tries to separate him from Tricia.
While Tricia and Allen are away, Donnan arrives at the house and acquires Leena's fingerprints. When Donnan finds that the fingerprints do not match Esther's, Leena, who has been tailing him, stabs him with a knife. Tricia arrives, having followed Leena, and shoots Donnan dead. Tricia reveals that the real Esther died in 2003 during an altercation with her older brother Gunnar, which Tricia covered up. Tricia only let Leena pose as Esther to placate Allen. Leena and Tricia dispose of Donnan's body in a cellar hatch which contains the real Esther's body. They frame his disappearance as a vacation trip by forging an email to the police station.
When Leena proves too difficult to control, Tricia and Gunnar plot to kill her. After two unsuccessful murder attempts from both sides, Leena tries to flee by stealing Tricia's car, but she is soon found by a police officer.
After Leena is brought back to the Albright house, Tricia and Gunnar try to kill her, but Leena fights back and flees. She ambushes Gunnar in the art room with acrossbowand stabs him to death with hisfencingsword. Tricia and Leena fight in the kitchen, fleeing to the roof after inadvertently setting the house on fire.
As Allen returns home, he finds Tricia and Leena clinging to the roof, calling for him. While Leena is claiming that Tricia attacked her, Tricia tries to reveal the truth about Leena. Allen helps Leena first, causing Tricia to fall to her death. When Allen checks Leena's face, her fake teeth start to fall out, revealing she is not Esther. Leena tries to justify herself and confesses her love for him, only for a shocked and disgusted Allen to call her a monster. An enraged Leena accidentally pushes him off the roof.
Leena cleans herself up and dresses up again as “Esther”. Later, "Esther" is moved to an orphanage and waits for a new family to adopt her.

In 2014, Indiana couple Kristine and Michael Barnett were charged withchild abandonmentof their then-nine-year-oldfoster childwithdwarfism,Natalia Grace, two years earlier by claiming her to secretly be an adult and by changing her legal age to 22. The case received widespread media attention in 2019 when the Barnetts confirmed they had been inspired to abandon Grace after watchingOrphan.[9]Fuhrman stated that she was contacted by a large number of people regarding its eerie similarities toOrphan. As this was going on, she stated that she contacted Johnson-McGoldrick regarding the potential for a follow-up film, to which he revealed that they had a prequel script written. The actress worked with the writer to further the development of the project, with the intent to serve as a producer with the potential to appear in a possiblecameo rolewith a new actress portraying the title character, before the duo eventually elected to have Fuhrman reprise the role herself.[10][11]

In September 2021, it was announcedParamount Pictureshad acquired U.S. distribution rights throughParamount Playersto the film, unlike the previous film, which was distributed byWarner Bros.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 70% of 149 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6/10. The website's consensus reads: "Leaning into its ludicrous premise,Orphan: First Killis a sequel that holds its own -- and for fans of campy horror, may even represent an improvement on the original."[19]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[20]
Matt Donato fromIGNgave 7 out of 10 and wrote: "Orphan: First Killdoubles down as a prequel about Esther but manages to feel so uniquely standalone thanks to some supreme storytelling swings."[21]Richard Whittaker fromThe Austin Chroniclegave it 3 out of 5 stars, writing: "What makesOrphan: First Killworthwhile is that it acknowledges the original before taking a hard left turn into overblown soapy madness. The modern gothic of the first film transforms here into a perfectly fitting explosion of operatic schlock."[22]Lena Wilson fromThe Wrapwrote: "First Killtakes the best part of its predecessor—its camp value—and dials things up to 11, delivering a movie that demands to be seen at rowdy theaters and sleepovers worldwide."[23]Alyse Wax fromCollidergave a B rating, writing: "First Kill is a smart, tight film that fits perfectly into what thefirstOrphanfilmset up over a decade ago."[24]Courtney Howard fromThe A.V. Clubgave a B+ rating and wrote: "Offering the winning combination of a subversive spin on a well-established villain,Orphan: First Killis a gnarly, wild and absolutely demented ride."[25]
Leslie Felperin fromThe Guardianwrote: "The most disappointing thing about the film is that it has none of the spark or originality of the first one and just parasitically drains its source material, incorporating details like the creepy black-light drawings and the borderline paedophilic subtext without adding anything substantial." Clarisse Loughrey fromThe Independentalso gave a mixed review, writing: "There's a surprising amount to enjoy here, with director William Brent Bell (behindThe Boyfranchise, with its equally ludicrous premise centered on a haunted doll), making the smart decision to turn the unintentional camp ofOrphaninto intentional camp, alongside adding a dose of satire about the corruptive pressures of the nuclear family." Chris Evangelista fromSlashFilmwrote: "David Coggeshall's script has more than a few tricks up its sleeve, including some jaw-dropping twists that I will confess I did not see coming. It makes sense—the first film had a jaw-dropping twist too, after all. The twist feels fresh and exciting here, and changes the entire film in a way that's wickedly enjoyable."
Maxance Vincent fromCultured Vultureswrote: "I'll even go out on a limb and say that I had more fun watchingOrphan: First Killthan I did the first one, and would highly recommend doing a double feature with both. They're some of the most fascinating horror films from a mainstream studio, and should hopefully reignite Hollywood's flame to make more horror movies that truly don't care about the audience's preconceived expectations and throw them off guard the minute they get comfortable. Now that's cinema, and you cannot convince me otherwise."[26]Mark Hanson fromSlant Magazinegave one out of four stars, writing: "William Brent Bell's film proves that not every horror concept has the potential to be franchised."
In August 2022, when asked about his approach to making the sequel, Bell stated that there would need to be a third film in order forOrphanto be considered a franchise.[11]Later, Fuhrman expressed interest in continuing to portray the character in additional films.[10]Bell later stated that should the prequel prove to be successful, a third film could be developed. The filmmaker expressed interest in exploring a darker third installment that would complete a full story of Leena Klammer/Esther, while stating that there could be multiple sequels:
...Isabelle [Fuhrman] is so passionate about the character – [she] can play this character forever… there's a lot to that character, and I think in the future stories, she would probably become a bit more cold-hearted again.[27]
Fuhrman confirmed that discussions for a third film, among the creatives and studio are ongoing, stating that there would not be another "13 years this time around" before a sequel is developed.[28]In December 2023, it was announced that a third film was officially in development. William Brent Bell will once again serve as director, while David Coggeshall will return as screenwriter. The filmmaker stated that Isabelle Fuhrman is also slated to reprise her starring role as the main character.[29]
In November 2024, Dark Castle announced that a third film had been green-lit byLionsgate, which would launch the project at theAmerican Film Market. Brent Bell and Coggeshall is set to return as director and screenwriter, while Isabelle Fuhrman reprises her role as Esther.[30]Fuhrman later expressed excitement, stating that the quality of the script is what convinced her to sign on to the project.[31]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
