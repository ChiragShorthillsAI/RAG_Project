In 1987, elderly Hattie Mae, visits Johnathan Dupree, theAttorney generalof Hopewell, Georgia, who is seeking re-election through his racist political ideologies. Hattie asks him to solve the 40 year old murder of her son, Horace John Boyd, known as Bayou, who was lynched in Hopewell County in 1947. She hands Johnathan a collection of letters and tells him all he needs to know he can find in them. He is about to throw them away when he notices the letters are addressed to a Leanne J. Harper.
Bayou comes from a family of musicians. His mother, Hattie Mae, is a talented blues singer and his father, Buster, a skilled guitarist. Bayou's older brother, and his father's favorite son, Willie Earl is a natural jazz trumpeter, while Bayou, although a gifted singer, is discouraged from displaying his talent by his abusive father who constantly picks on him and calls him weak and slow. One day while performing, Buster puts Bayou on the spot and says he has two boys, "one of them is just like me and one of them is not. Now, let's see which one it is." He calls Bayou over to play the trumpet, but to Bayou's embarrassment, he can't play a note. Buster then calls over Willie Earl who skillfully and to the delight of the crowd, effortlessly solos to the song, "If You See My Rooster". Later, Bayou is seen skipping stones down by the river, where he is overheard singing by Leanne Jean Harper. Leanne is an educated but outcast girl, whom the townsfolk call Bucket, because of the way her mother dropped her off and skipped town to go north. Bayou is instantly infatuated with Bucket, who demands that she be called by her name Leanne, which Bayou mispronounces, "Lil Ann".
Bayou decides to ask Leanne to the town social but discovers her grandfather is very mean and overprotective of her and he threatens to kill Bayou if he ever catches him on his land again. That night, Leanne writes Bayou a note and folds it into an airplane and flies it through Bayou's open bedroom window. Bayou sneaks out and chases Leanne down to the yew tree. Leanne discovers Bayou can't read and volunteers to teach him how to read. They have secret meetings at night, but they are unable to be together publicly due to the disapproval of her grandfather who also sexually abuses her. The two fall in love.
Buster and Hattie Mae get into a fight and Buster takes all of Hattie's money and abandons the family saying he is going to Chicago to make it big as a musician. Willie Earl resents being left behind and blames his father's running off on Bayou. Soon after, Willie Earl turns 19 and decides to run off to Chicago to find his father and join his band. Meanwhile, Leanne abruptly stops her nightly visits. When Bayou goes to investigate, he sees Leanne's grandfather raping her, but is too afraid to intervene. Bayou asks Leanne to marry him and run away from her grandfather to Hopewell. They become separated after Leanne's grandfather sends for her mother, Ethel. She forces her to move to Boston. Bayou writes to Leanne, but her mother intercepts the letter and instructs the mailman to return to sender all letters from Bayou's address. Bayou gets drafted into the army, but continues to write Leanne. While in the army, Hattie Mae and Citsy move to Hopewell County, Georgia to make a better life for themselves.
It's 1947 and Hattie Mae opens up a successfuljuke jointwhere she performs nightly and she also makes a living as a laundress during the day. Citsy works as the maid for the local sheriff, Sheriff Jackson. Bayou is injured while serving in the army and gets discharged and comes back home to work for his mother. One night, Willie Earl shows up in the juke joint with a German man named Ira, the two of them both showing signs of drug intoxication. Ira, Willie Earl's manager, is close to overdosing and dying, passes out, but is nursed back to health by Hattie Mae and Bayou. Willie Earl tells his mother that Ira promised to get him an audition in Chicago. Ira hears Bayou sing in his mother's juke joint and realizes he is more talented than Willie Earl and plans to have Bayou audition in Chicago too.
Bayou and Leanne encounter each other again after she moves to Hopewell with her new husband and mother from Boston. Leanne is married to politician John, the brother of Sheriff Jackson, and is forced by her mother to pass as white for financial stability. The two reconnect and rekindle their love in secret. When Leanne's mother catches them having sex in Leanne's car, she lies to Sheriff Jackson, claiming that Bayou had whistled at Leanne. Citsy overhears Ethel's lie and races to tell Bayou, who barely escapes with Willie Earl and Ira who were headed out of town for Willie Earl's audition at the Capitol Royale in Chicago. In Chicago, Willie Earl storms out of the club when the manager refuses to listen to him audition. Ira then tells Bayou to take the stage and sing. Bayou becomes an unexpected hit at the Capital Royale club.
Despite his success, Hattie Mae's juke joint is going under because the sheriff has threatened to arrest anyone who patronizes the spot. None of the whites in town will allow Hattie Mae to wash their clothes, so Hattie Mae is left tending a small garden just to get enough food. Bayou sends money, but the mail clerk opens all of Hattie's mail and steals the money before she can get it. Willie Earl's drug use catches up with him and he gets fired from the Capitol Royale Club. Enraged by the loss of his job, he blames Bayou for everything wrong in his life, his father's leaving, his failed music career, and his drug use. Bayou is unable to forget Leanne. Under the guise of returning for a one night show to help revive his mother's juke joint, Bayou makes his way back to Georgia. Willie Earl, jealous of his brother's success, tips off Sheriff Jackson that Bayou is back in town. Bayou sends word to Leanne, who now has a son, through Citsy that he is coming for her and this is her chance to run away to Chicago. Bayou is reunited with Leanne, but due to Willie Earl's tip off, a mob lynches Bayou to the distress of Leanne and Bayou's family.
Johnathan, who is Leanne's son, is stunned after reading the letters and concludes that he is really Bayou's son and Hattie Mae's grandson. Johnathan visits his mother and hands over the letters Bayou had intended to send to her, moving her to tears. He then goes outside and is left to reckon with the truth of his birth and his heritage as a fair–skinned black man.

Very Perry Productions, LLC,[2]doing business asTyler Perry Studios(TPS), is anAmerican film production studioinAtlanta, Georgiafounded by actor, filmmaker, and playwrightTyler Perryin 2006.
In 2019, Perry celebrated the grand opening of his newest Atlanta studio location, having purchased 330 acres (130 ha) of the formerFort McPhersoncomplex in 2015 to make it the new home of Tyler Perry Studios.[3]Tyler Perry Studios is one of the largest film production studios in the United States, and established Perry as the first African-American to outright own a major film production studio.[4]Through 34th Street Films, a production arm of Tyler Perry Studios, Perry guides the work of other filmmakers.[5]
In 2018, Perry sold his previous studio location opened in 2008 to anotherminority-ownedfilm production company.[6][7]The previous studio location occupied two formerDelta Air Linesaffiliated buildings in theGreenbriararea of southwest Atlanta, and included 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2) of sets and office space.[8]
Tyler Perry Studios is a notable resource for Atlanta's robust economy.[9][10]The company often advertises for film and crew positions at its southwest Atlanta location.[11]
Perry has full ownership of his films, andLions Gate Entertainmentused to serve as his distributor for all of his films starting fromDiary of a Mad Black WomantoA Madea Family Funeral. After signing his deal withParamount Global, Perry's films are now distributed byParamount PicturesandNetflixstarting withNobody's FoolandA Fall from Grace.[12]His first film,Diary of a Mad Black Woman, produced on a budget of $5.5 million, became an unexpected commercial success prompting widespread discussion among industry watchers about whether middle-class African-Americans were simply not being addressed by mainstreamHollywoodmovies. Its final gross box office receipts were $50.6 million, although it was critically panned scoring only 16 percent approval rating on the websiteRotten Tomatoes.[13]On its opening weekend, February 24, 2006, Perry's film version ofMadea's Family Reunionopened at No. 1 with $30.3 million. The film eventually grossed $65 million and, likeDiary, almost all of it in the United States. The film was jump-started by an hour-long appearance by Perry and his co-stars on the daily talk showThe Oprah Winfrey Show.[14]
His next project for Lionsgate,Daddy's Little Girls, starring British actorIdris ElbaandGabrielle Unionwas released in the United States on February 14, 2007. It grossed over $31 million.[15]Perry wrote, directed, produced and starred in his next film,Why Did I Get Married?, which was released on October 12, 2007. It opened as the top-grossing movie in its first weekend, earning $21.4 million at the box office. It is loosely based on the play which Perry wrote in 2004. Filming began March 5, 2007, inWhistler, British Columbia,Vancouver, then Atlanta, where Perry opened his own studio.Janet Jackson,Sharon Leal,Jill Scott, andTasha Smithappear in the film. Perry's 2008 film,Meet the Browns, which was released on March 21, opened at No. 2 with a $20,082,809 weekend gross.[16]The Family That Preysopened on September 12, 2008, and grossed over $35.1 million as of October.Madea Goes to Jailopened at No. 1 on February 20, 2009, grossing $41 million and becoming his largest opening to date. This was Perry's seventh film withLionsgate.
On May 1, 2012, a four-alarm fire engulfed portions of the studio complex, causing the partial collapse of one building.[17]Less than three months later, another fire broke out on the roof of another building on the morning of August 27, 2012. On November 20, 2019, it hosted the MSNBC and Washington Post2020 Democratic Party presidential debateon the Oprah Winfrey sound stage.[18]It also hostedMiss Universe 2019on December 8.
In October 2023, TPS signed a first look deal withNetflixto develop film and television projects.[19][20][21]
In June 2021, Tyler Perry andT.D. Jakesannounced they were purchasing over 130 acres in southwest Atlanta including a proposed expansion of Tyler Perry Studios for a public accessible entertainment district with theaters, retail shops, restaurants, and a Georgia film and TV museum.  Perry is expecting the entertainment district to be completed in 2025.[22][23]In February 2024, Perry announced his $800 million expansion project which included additional soundstages is temporarily on hold due to his concerns that rapid advances in video-relatedartificial intelligencecould reduce demand for traditional filmmaking. Perry wants the filmmaking industry to galvanize as one voice and lobby for legislation to regulate artificial intelligence in Hollywood.[24]
On December 6, 2024, Tyler Perry Studios president and general manager Steve Mensch died in a plane crash.[25]Thesingle-engine Vans RV-12IS planecrashed and ended up upside down on a road inHomosassa, Florida.[26]
Before moving to its first southwest Atlanta location in 2008, the studios used the former studio space at 99 Krog Street inInman Parkon theBeltLinein central Atlanta. Perry had purchased the land from Atlanta Stage Works in 2006 for a reported $7 million.[27]The studios were later converted into theKrog Street Market.
In 2019, Tyler Perry Studios officially moved into 330 acres (130 ha) of the formerFort McPhersoncomplex in southwest Atlanta.[28]The studio has 50,000 sq ft (4,600 m2) of the site dedicated to standing permanent sets, including a replica of a luxury hotel lobby, aWhite Housereplica, a 16,000-square-foot (1,500 m2) mansion, a mock cheap hotel, a trailer park set, and a real 1950s-style diner that was relocated from a town 100 miles (160 km) away. It has a residential neighborhood cul-de-sac with 12 homes, many of them with actual functioning interiors, furnished and decorated, not simply "facades." It also hosts 12 soundstages named after highly accomplished African-Americans in the entertainment industry.[3][29]

The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
