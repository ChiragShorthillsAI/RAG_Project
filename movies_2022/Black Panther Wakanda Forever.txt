A sequel is in development.
T'Challa, king ofWakanda, is suffering from a terminal illness which his sisterShuribelieves can be cured by the "heart-shaped herb". Shuri attempts to synthetically recreate the herb after it was burned byErik "Killmonger" Stevens,[a]but fails to do so before T'Challa dies.
A year later, Wakanda is under pressure from other nations to share theirvibranium, with some parties attempting to steal it by force. QueenRamondaimplores Shuri to continue her research on the herb, hoping to create a newBlack Pantherthat will defend Wakanda, but she refuses due to her belief that the Black Panther is a figure of the past. In the Atlantic Ocean, theCIAandU.S. Navy SEALsuse a vibranium detector to locate a potential vibranium deposit underwater. The expedition is killed by a group ofblue-skinned, water-breathing superhumansled byNamor, with the CIA believing Wakanda to be responsible. Namor confronts Ramonda and Shuri, easily bypassing Wakanda's advanced security. Blaming Wakanda for the vibranium race, he gives them an ultimatum: deliver him the scientist responsible for the vibranium detector, or he will attack Wakanda.
Shuri andOkoyelearn from CIA agentEverett K. Rossthat the scientist in question isMITstudentRiri Williamsand arrive at the university to confront her. The group is pursued by theFBIand then by Namor's warriors, who defeat Okoye before taking Shuri and Williams underwater to meet Namor. Angered by Okoye's failure to protect Shuri, Ramonda strips her of her title as general of theDora Milajeand seeks outNakia, who has been living inHaitisinceThe Blip.[b]Namor shows Shuri his vibranium-rich underwater kingdom ofTalokan, which he has protected for centuries from discovery by the world. Bitter at the surface world for enslaving theMaya, Namor proposes an alliance with Wakanda against the rest of the world but threatens to destroy Wakanda if they refuse. Nakia helps Shuri and Williams escape, killing a Talokanil guard in the process, and Namor retaliates with an attack against Wakanda, during which Ramonda drowns while saving Williams. Namor vows to return with his full army, and the citizens of Wakanda relocate to the Jabari mountains for their safety. Meanwhile, Ross is arrested by his ex-wife, CIA directorValentina Allegra de Fontaine, for secretly exchanging classified intelligence with the Wakandans.
After Ramonda's funeral, Shuri uses a remnant of the herb that gave Namor's people their superhuman abilities to reconstruct the heart-shaped herb. She ingests it, gaining superhuman abilities and meeting Killmonger in theAncestral Plane, who questions if she will seek revenge or be as honorable as T'Challa. Shuri dons a newBlack Panther suitand is accepted by the other Wakandan tribes as the Black Panther. DespiteM'Baku's urges for peace, Shuri is determined to exact vengeance on Namor for Ramonda's death and orders an immediate counterattack on Talokan. Preparing for battle, withAyoassuming the position of general of the Dora Milaje, Shuri bestows theMidnight Angelarmor upon Okoye, who in turn recruits Dora Milaje memberAnekato join her. Williams creates anIron Man-esquepowered exoskeletonto aid the Wakandans.
Using a seafaring vessel, the Wakandans lure Namor and his warriors to the surface with another vibranium detector as a battle ensues. Shuri traps Namor in a fighter aircraft, intending to dry him out and weaken him. The pair crash on a desert beach and fight. Shuri gains the upper hand but has a vision of Ramonda and implores Namor to yield, offering him a peaceful alliance. Namor accepts, and the battle ends. Namor's cousin,Namora, is upset at Namor's surrender, but he assures her that the new alliance will allow Talokan to become stronger. Williams returns to MIT, leaving her suit behind, while Okoye rescues Ross from captivity. Shuri plants more heart-shaped herbs to ensure the future of the Black Panther mantle. In Shuri's absence, M'Baku steps forward to challenge for the throne. Shuri visits Nakia in Haiti where she burns her funeral robe in accordance with Ramonda's wishes, allowing herself to finally grieve for T'Challa.
In amid-credits scene, Shuri learns that Nakia and T'Challa had a son named Toussaint, whom Nakia has been raising in secret. Toussaint reveals his Wakandan name is T'Challa.

With the release ofBlack Pantherin February 2018, producerKevin Feigesaid there were "many, many stories" to tell about thecharacter, and he wanted director and co-writerRyan Cooglerto return for any sequel;[48]Marvel Studioswanted to keep the creative team as intact as possible,[49]whileWalt Disney StudioschairmanAlan F. Horn, despite feeling it was too early to discuss a sequel, was also positive about the desire to have Coogler return as director.[50]Coogler wanted to see howChadwick Boseman'sT'Challa / Black Pantherwould grow as a king in futureBlack Pantherfilms, since his reign had only recently begun in theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU) in contrast to the comics, where he was king since childhood.[51]In March 2018, Feige said there was nothing specific to reveal about a sequel, but Marvel had ideas and a "pretty solid direction" on where they wanted to take a second film.[52]That month, Boseman's agent Michael Greene was in negotiations for the actor to return as T'Challa in two plannedBlack Panthersequels for a reported pay of $10 million and $20 million, respectively.[53]By October, Coogler had closed a deal to write and direct a sequel toBlack Panther. Despite both Marvel and Coogler having always intended to work together again after the first film's success, Coogler avoided rushing into a deal. Negotiations with Coogler were completed "under the radar" in the months following the first film's release. He was expected to begin writing the sequel in 2019, ahead of a planned filming start in late 2019 or early 2020.[49]
In November 2018,Letitia Wrightwas confirmed to be reprising her role of T'Challa's sisterShurifor the sequel.[6]WhenAngela Bassett, who playedRamondainBlack Panther, was asked if the main cast would return for the sequel, her husbandCourtney B. Vancesaid they would. He said this includedMichael B. JordanasN'Jadaka / Erik "Killmonger" Stevens, who was killed in the first film, and Bassett agreed.[54]Feige dismissed Vance's statement in June 2019 as "pure rumor", saying there were no set plans for the film as Coogler had just begun outlining it and had not yet shared his plans with Feige or co-producerNate Moore.[55]The next month,John Kaniexpressed interest in reprising his role as T'Challa's fatherT'Chakain the film,[56]andDanai Gurirastated that Coogler had confirmed she would be reprising her role ofOkoyein the sequel.[10]Feige confirmed the sequel's development at the 2019San Diego Comic-Con,[57]whileMartin Freemanconfirmed in August that he would reprise his role asEverett K. Rossin the sequel.[31]A release date of May 6, 2022, was announced atD23along with the placeholder titleBlack Panther II.[58]Feige said Coogler had completed a script treatment for the film that included a villain and new title.[59]At the end of 2019,Ruth E. Carterconfirmed that she would be returning from the first film as the costume designer for the sequel, and said that she was set to begin work on it in "the fall".[60]Feige, Boseman, and Coogler discussed adapting elements of Boseman's more "Gung ho" performance as an alternate universe variant of T'Challa in the episode "What If... T'Challa Became a Star-Lord?" from thefirst seasonof theDisney+animated seriesWhat If...?(2021) for the film.[61]
Chadwick Boseman was an immensely talented actor and an inspirational individual who affected all of our lives professionally and personally. His portrayal of T'Challa the Black Panther is iconic and transcends any iteration of the character in any other medium from Marvel's past. And it's for that reason that we will not recast the character.
On August 28, 2020, Boseman died fromcolon cancer. Coogler stated that he had been unaware of Boseman's illness, and had spent the last year "preparing, imagining and writing words for him to say [in the film] that we weren't destined to see".[63]Feige and other executives at Marvel Studios were also unaware of Boseman's illness. Boseman, who had become thinner from his illness in the weeks prior to his death, had been prepared to begin gaining the weight back in September 2020 ahead of filming the sequel in March 2021. According toThe Hollywood Reporter, industry observers felt Disney could recast the role, but that might generate a "fan outcry" and prompt comparisons between actors. Another suggestion was for Disney to shift their plans and have Shuri take on the mantle of theBlack Panther, which occurred in the comic books.[64]By the time of Boseman's death, Coogler was in the middle of writing the script and had already turned in a draft.[65][66]In mid-November, executive producerVictoria Alonsosaid adigital doubleof Boseman would not be created for the film, and added that Marvel was taking their time to work out what they were going to do next and how.[67]Later in the month,Lupita Nyong'o,Winston Duke, and Bassett were confirmed to be reprising their roles for the sequel asNakia,M'Baku, and Ramonda, respectively, whileTenoch Huertawas in talks for an antagonist role.[7]At that time, filming was expected to begin in June or July 2021 inAtlanta, Georgia.[7][68]
In December 2020, the film's release date was moved back to July 8, 2022. Feige also confirmed that the role of T'Challa would not be recast, and said the sequel would explore the world and characters of the first film as a way to honor the legacy that Boseman helped build.[62]He would later reaffirm that visual effects would not be used to include Boseman in the film,[69]and also said it "felt like it was much too soon to recast" noting how the world outside and within the MCU was still processing the loss of Boseman.[70]By the end of the month, Boseman's makeup designer Siân Richards was set to return for the sequel, while his personal costumer Craig Anthony said he would not commit to the film due to Boseman's death. Hair designer Deidra Dixon was unsure if she would return following Boseman's death, as well as the death of her sister.[53]Feige said in January 2021 that the primary focus of the sequel was always about further exploring the characters and "different subcultures" ofWakanda.[69]That same month, Jordan said he was willing to reprise his role as Killmonger as he felt returning to the MCU would "always be on the table in some capacity" due to his love for the character and for working with Coogler.[71]In February,Daniel Kaluuyasaid he was unsure if he would reprise his role ofW'Kabi;[72]he ultimately did not due to scheduling conflicts withJordan Peele'sUniversal PicturesfilmNope(2022).[73]The sequel, however, establishes that W'Kabi was banished from Wakanda following the events ofBlack Panther.[74]
In March 2021, Coogler said he was still writing the script, and described working on the film without Boseman as the hardest thing he had ever done in his career. He added that Boseman had held together the first film, and now as the director, he was the one trying to keep it going.[65][75]He was able to reuse many elements of his planned film before Boseman's death while incorporating and applying "the themes that the people who were hurting just as much as me could actually perform and execute and come out on the other side whole".[17]According to Coogler, the original version of the script would have explored T'Challa dealing with resuming life afterthe Blip"grieving the loss of time... after being gone for five years",[76]and involved T'Challa's relationship with his and Nakia's sonT'Challa II / Toussaint, who he never met because of the Blip. Coogler also said thatNamorandValentina Allegra de Fontainewere in the original script, with de Fontaine having a larger role compared to the final film.[77]Wright added that Shuri would have become Black Panther alongside T'Challa.[78]Freeman said he would soon meet with Coogler to discuss the project.[66]In April, Coogler wrote anop-edin which he said the film would still shoot in Georgia despite the state passing its controversialElection Integrity Act of 2021law. Though Coogler did not support the bill, he felt thatboycotting film production in the statewould have a negative effect on the people who otherwise would have been employed by the film. He instead planned to raise awareness of how to overturn the bill.[79]Nyong'o expressed excitement for Coogler's plans and how everyone involved was dedicated to continuing Boseman's legacy,[80]later saying that Coogler had reshaped his ideas for the film to respect Boseman, which she felt was "spiritually and emotionally correct" to do.[81]Moore described the film as "how you move forward while dealing with a tragic loss. All of the characters, both old and new, are dealing with how loss can affect your actions in ways that are emotional and surprising".[8]
The film continues exploringfeministthemes from the first film, with Nyong'o saying the film would tackle the "beliefs, passions, loves and arguments" of the women characters, creating "a robust drama". She also felt that Wakanda was a "world we are striving to get to".[82]The film introduces Namor to the MCU, while changing his homeworld from the comics,Atlantis, toTalokan,[17][20]a decision made by Coogler to avoid comparisons with previous adaptations of the legendaryAtlantisseen in works such asAtlantis: The Lost Empire(2001) andAquaman(2018).[83]Talokan—named afterTlālōcān, a realm described in severalAztec codicesas aparadiseruled by the deityTlālocand his consortChalchiuhtlicue—is a "lavish", hidden, underwaterMesoamericancivilization that was inspired by ancientMaya culture,[8][83]with the association between Atlantis and Mesoamerica coming from the bookAtlantis: The Antediluvian World(1882) byIgnatius L. Donnelly.[84]The creatives worked closely with Mayan historians and experts to portray Talokan in the film.[8]Coogler noted Talokan was similar to Wakanda in that it was also an advanced civilization "hiding in plain sight",[17]with Moore stating the two "often find themselves in conflict because they're not dissimilar. They are these nations that would prefer to be hidden and isolated, with monarchs who are incredibly powerful and have strong points of view about how the world should be".Hannah Beachlerreturned from the first film as production designer, noting she did a "deep dive" to portray this version of Atlantis in the film; she was visually inspired by the filmsJaws(1975) andClose Encounters of the Third Kind(1977), andJack Kirby's comic imagery.[8]Several cast members, as well as Coogler, learned to swim for the film.[85]The hand gesture that the Talokan people (Talokanil) use to greet each other throughout the film, in which their hands open and fold in a way that resembles the jaws of a sea creature, was suggested by Huerta along withMabel Cadenaand Alex Livinalli as it was not part of the script, and was inspired by similar gestures depicted in theCodex Zouche-Nuttalldocument.[86]Coogler had envisioned Namor as a potential antagonist for a futureBlack Pantherfilm while working on the first film, and requested Marvel Studios not allow the character to be used in any MCU projects before the second film.[87]
More than 2,000 outfits were designed by Carter for the film.[88]The process of creating Namor's costume began about a year before production on the film had started, with Coogler asking several artists to help design the character's outfit; most of them initially submitted drawings that were reminiscent of the costume by comic book artistJohn Romita Sr.that debuted inSub-Mariner#67 (November 1973),[89][90]but their ideas were rejected in favor of a design by then-Marvel Studios visual development artist Anthony Francisco, who was inspired by the character's original greenswim briefs-clad look.[91]Carter worked closely with Marvel's visual development team and art department to design Shuri's Black Panther costume, sketching out ideas based on the character's appearances in the comics.[88]Carter adorned Shuri's costume with a combination of gold and silver elements that she felt would highlight the character's femininity, wanting the costume's design to stay close to Shuri's "form, the silhouette of a woman, with a bust and hips and shoulders" while also trying to "delicately enhance the dynamic figure of the Panther suit".[92]Costume company Film Illusions developed the material Carter used to create theMidnight Angelscostumes.[88]Carter said Ramonda's outfit has a "strong presence of metal", featuring a collar that was3D printedand painted to look like metal.[92]For the Talokanil costumes, Carter sought advice from Mesoamerican historians and experts, as well asoceanographersandmarine biologists.[88]She incorporatedjadeand aquatic elements, and referenced sea creatures in their headdresses,[8]such asNamora's, which resembles the fins of alionfish, andAttuma's, which resembles the skull of ahammerhead shark.[88]Many of the costumes needed to be tested in water given the amount of underwater filming that occurred,[8]with Carter stating, "Clothes aren't meant to be worn underwater for eight hours and used again the next day. We had to rethink everything about what fibers could go in water and still look organic. We'd like to think clothes look likeballetall the time in water, but they just rise up".[92]
In May 2021, Marvel Studios revealed the film's title asBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever,[93]which Ethan Anderton of/Filmbelieved was a fitting tribute to Boseman since "Wakanda Forever" is thebattle cryof the Wakandans.[94]According to Moore, hundreds of different subtitles were considered for the secondBlack Pantherfilm, such asKingdom of the Deepin reference to Talokan, withWakanda Foreveroriginally intended to be used as the subtitle for a potential thirdBlack Pantherfilm before the creative team decided to use it for the second film, which Moore felt was the "right" decision, describing the project as a "story about legacy, it's a story about persistence, andWakanda Foreversays all of those things".[95]By the end of that month, Freeman said he had read the script and expressed excitement for it.[96]At the end of June, Edgar Luna, the business development manager ofWorcester, Massachusetts's Economic Development Office, said the technical department ofWakanda Foreverwas in the city the week of June 25 to scout and inspect filming locations, including at the Worcester Police Department headquarters.[97][98]
Production started atTrilith Studiosin Atlanta, Georgia, on June 29, 2021,[100]under theworking titleSummer Break.[101]Prior to Boseman's death, filming had been set to start in March 2021.[64]At the start of filming, Feige announced that "everyone" from the first film was expected to return.[100]Autumn Durald Arkapawserves as the cinematographer, after doing so on the Disney+ television seriesLoki(2021–2023), replacing the first film's cinematographerRachel Morrison.[102]A long time collaborator of Coogler's, Morrison planned to return forWakanda Foreverbut was unable to due to a scheduling conflict with her filmFlint Strong(2024) caused by theCOVID-19 pandemic.[103]Discussing the use ofanamorphic lensesas opposed to spherical lenses, Coogler explained that anamorphic lenses "warp the image a little bit", which fit with the film having "the fog of loss over it"; a "profound loss... can warp how you look at the world".[17]Arkapaw usedPanavisionT Series anamorphic lenses which were specifically modified by Panavision.[104]Wright, Gurira, Nyong'o, andFlorence Kasumbabonded together on set while dealing with their grief for Boseman's death, with Wright and Gurira particularly connecting through taking walks together. Gurira described feeling emotional while entering the throne set, as she remembered filming scenes with Boseman during the first film and said that Coogler helped her process her grief.[82]
Bassett said in July that the screenplay was still undergoing changes due to Boseman's death, and had gone through at least five incarnations. She also indicated that the first film's co-writerJoe Robert Colewas contributing to the sequel,[105]which Feige soon confirmed.[106]Michaela Coeljoined the cast in an undisclosed role.[107]In August,Isaach de Bankoléwas set to reprise his role as the Wakandan River Tribe elder,[35]andDominique Thornebegan filming scenes forWakanda ForeverasRiri Williamsbefore starring as that character in the Disney+ miniseriesIronheart(2025).[108]Thorne previously auditioned for the role of Shuri inBlack Panther.[109]Filming that month was expected to take place at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) and in Worcester,[98][110]with the production preparing to film a car chase in Worcester by August 18.[98][111]A chase scene was filmed in the Ernest A. Johnson Tunnel on August 23 and 24.[112]On August 25, Wright was temporarily hospitalized with what were believed to be minor injuries sustained in an accident while filming a stunt inBoston.[113]Wright went to her home in London for recovery in September while filming continued to shoot around her character.[114]Dorothy Steel, who portrayed the Wakandan Merchant Tribe elder in the first film, died on October 15; she was in the middle of reprising her role for the sequel when she died.[37][115]
In late October, the film's release was delayed to November 11, 2022.[116]The production moved to the Mary Ross Waterfront Park inBrunswick, Georgiaby October 22,[117][118]where filming occurred from October 28 to November 2.[118]Michael Torras, the manager of the Brunswick Landing Marina, said a 300-foot cruise ship would join the production in the following days, and most of the filming occurred on the water. Matthew Hill, Brunswick's downtown development authority director, said most of the scenes were shot at night.[119]By November 5, filming of the scenes that did not require Wright was completed,[114]before the production went on hiatus on November 19. This was to accommodate Wright's fractured shoulder and a concussion, which were more serious than initially determined, and was not expected to affect the film's release date.[114][99]The United States'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) implemented new rules on November 8 requiring non-U.S. citizens to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and provide proof of vaccination before traveling to the country.The Hollywood Reporternoted that this could present an issue for Wright's return to filming in Atlanta since she is not a U.S. citizen and was reportedly not vaccinated.[120]In mid-December,The Hollywood Reporterconfirmed that filming would resume in late January 2022 in Atlanta with Wright involved;[121]Feige, Moore, and executive producerLouis D'Espositoconfirmed upon the start of the hiatus that Wright was the film's new lead.[99]
Filming resumed by mid-January 2022, with a recovered Wright returning, and was expected to continue for four weeks.[122][123]Filming was originally scheduled to resume on January 10 but was delayed by a week after cast and crew members, including Nyong'o, tested positive for COVID-19. At that time,The Hollywood Reporterreported that Duke had negotiated a pay raise for his return because of his character's expanded role in the sequel.[123]The following month, Nyong'o revealed thatDanny Sapaniwould be reprising his role as the Wakandan Border Tribe elder in the film.[36]Thorne completed filming her scenes by March 13.[124]Additional photography began on March 18, inPuerto Rico, where filming officiallywrappedon March 24.[125][126]
In June 2022, Huerta confirmed that he was appearing in the film,[28]and he was officially announced to be playing Namor at the 2022San Diego Comic-Conthe next month,[127]when Coel, Cadena, and Livinalli were also revealed to be respectively playingAneka, Namora, and Attuma, and Kasumba was confirmed to be reprising her role asAyo.[14]Damian Priestsaid that he had been offered a role in the film, which was reported to have been Attuma, as well as Namor.[128]Reshoots occurred with the cast following their appearance at Comic-Con. Huerta said the reshoots were intended to add "little missing pieces" to the film.[129]In late July, it was reported thatKamaru Usmanhad been cast in the film for a role that was subsequently confirmed to be acameo appearanceas a naval officer,[43][44]whileRichard Schiffwas revealed to be cast in September,[130]playing theU.S. Secretary of Statein the film.[42]Lake Bell, who previously voiced alternate universe variants ofNatasha Romanoff / Black WidowinWhat If...?, was revealed to be appearing in the film in late October.[40]In early November,María Mercedes Coroyconfirmed that she had been cast as Namor's motherFenin the film.[39]By the middle of the month, Jordan andJulia Louis-Dreyfuswere revealed to be reprising their MCU roles as Killmonger and Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in the film.[34][32]Additionally,Robert John Burkewas revealed to have been cast in the film; both him and Bell were confirmed to be playing a pair ofCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) officials named Smitty and Graham, respectively.[40][41]
Archival footageof Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther from previousMCU filmsis used at the end ofWakanda Forever.[45]Unlike most MCU films that include bothmid-credits and post-credits scenes,Wakanda Foreverfeatures only one scene: it shows Shuri being introduced to her nephew T'Challa II / Toussaint, who was played by Divine Love Konadu-Sun.[131]Moore said the creative team did not consider including an additional scene after the credits in the film at any point during its production, as they "felt the ending was so kind of poetic" that they thought it would be "a little disingenuous tonally" to do so, with Moore calling the film "an emotional experience" that—similar toAvengers: Endgame(2019)—"didn't need astingerat the end".[132][133]Wright said only two other children auditioned for the role of T'Challa II besides Konadu-Sun.[134]Several characters were considered to take on the mantle of Black Panther in the film, including Nakia and M'Baku, before Shuri was chosen.[135]Aaron Toney, who served as fight coordinator onWakanda Forever, confirmed that Namor's ankle wings are capable of growing back after a scene in the film showed one of them being cut off by Shuri.[136]There had been discussions regarding the inclusion of a romance between Shuri and Namor in the film, but the idea was scrapped.[137]
Michael P. Shawverreturned as editor from the first film,[138]whileGeoffrey Baumannserved as the visual effects supervisor. The visual effects forWakanda Foreverwere provided byDigital Domain,Industrial Light & Magic,Wētā FX,Cinesite,Rise FX, SSVFX, andStorm Studios.[139]2,233 out of the film's 2,548 shots involved the use of visual effects, which were created by more than a dozen VFX vendors.[140]Perceptiondesigned the film's main-on-end title sequence, which depicts Shuri's funeral clothes being burned to reveal a Black Panther suit underneath. The sequence was filmed practically using a specialized fireproofPanavisioncamera, with Perception igniting controlled flames on cloth similar to the fabric worn by Shuri in the film.[141]Sound editorsSteve Boeddekerand Benny Burtt, who both worked on the film, used the sound ofrattlesnakesfor Namor's ankle wings, an idea Coogler suggested about two weeks before sound editing was completed.[142]In late November 2022, Wētā FX supervisor Chris White revealed that Marvel Studios created a 200-page Talokanbiblefor the film that contains details about the kingdom such as its history, battle strategies, tools built, architecture, influence, and other elements.[143][144]The next month, Shawver revealed that the film originally had a four-and-a-half-hour cut that included additional scenes featuring Talokan and the developing relationship between Shuri and Williams, as well as a subplot involving the two of themteaming upwith Namor to accomplish an unspecified task. Shawver attributed the reduced cut of the film to changes in its "pacing", and added that the removal of that material caused the film's narrative to be reworked, which was done during reshoots.[138]

Thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoesreported an approval rating of 84% with an average rating of 7.1/10, based on 450 reviews. The site's critics consensus reads: "A poignant tribute that satisfyingly moves the franchise forward,Black Panther: Wakanda Forevermarks an ambitious and emotionally rewarding triumph for the MCU".[207]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[208]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakreported audience members gave the film an overall positive score of 93%, with 85% saying that they would definitely recommend it.[209]
Kambole Campbell atEmpiregave the film 4 out of 5 stars, stating that the film "stands out from a somewhat formulaic era of Marvel movies: held together by its compelling sense of place, and by acting as a passionate eulogy for Chadwick Boseman", and feeling that it was "imaginative and... grounded, which makes the tilt to the usual CG-dominated spectacle a little jarring". Campbell lauded the performances of Wright, Duke, Bassett, and Coel, and described Huerta's character as "a highlight, an imaginative adaptation of the veteran comics character, one who here speaks truth with convincing venom".[210]Tom Jorgensen atIGNgave the film 7 out of 10, stating that it was "an effective, emotional farewell to T'Challa—a meditation on forging one's own future out of a painful past—but with a plot that has to introduce an entirely new nation and pave the way for a new wave of Marvel stories, it does struggle under the weight of all that expectation". Jorgensen lauded Bassett and Huerta's performances, but he felt that Talokan had not been "establish[ed]... quite as gracefully" and the film's third act had "push[ed] its luck too far... with a poorly conceived and logically baffling tactical choice".[211]
Owen GleibermanofVarietywrote: "The movie doesn't have the classic comic-book pow ofBlack Panther, and it's easily 20 minutes too long (we could probably have lived without the Talokan backstory). YetWakanda Foreverhas a slow-burn emotional suspense. Once the film starts to gather steam, it doesn't let up".[212]Similarly,Michael Phillipsof theChicago TribunefeltWakanda Forever"is not special like the first movie was. The quality of the storytelling and especially the action sequences grows less effective as the film proceeds". Nevertheless, he singled out that "every actor on screen here is marvelous, even when the script and effects-driven spectacle settles for the wrong kind of 'more'".[213]Peter TraversofABC Newscommended the performances from Bassett, Wright and Thorne, but wrote the film's runtime "feels loooong, with dragged out battle scenes, excessive computer effects and way too much franchise building".[214]TheBBC's Nicholas Barber said that the sequel struggled due to the loss of Boseman, but commended the visual effects and Bassett, Wright, and Lupita Nyong'o's acting.[215]
David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterfelt that "[e]ven if the length feels overextended, Coogler and his editors deserve credit for allowing breathing space between the action scenes for character and relationship development, with Ludwig Göransson's African-inflected score enhancing both those quieter moments and the big smackdowns. It's impossible forWakanda Foreverto match the breakthrough impact of its predecessor, but in terms of continuing the saga while paving the way for future installments, it's amply satisfying".[216]Ann HornadayofThe Washington Postwrote: "Wakanda Foreverwinds up feeling hopelessly stalled, covering up an inability to move on by resorting to repetitive, over-familiar action sequences, maudlin emotional beats and an uninvolving, occasionally incoherent story".[217]James BerardinelliofReelViewsgave the film two stars out of four, criticizing the film's runtime and worldbuilding subplots. He further wrote that the sequel is "not so much a bad movie as it is disappointing and frustrating. There are some strong moments both in terms of character development (primarily for Shuri, who has the deepest and most compelling arc) and action (the car chase is perfunctory but some of the battle scenes are well-executed), but not enough of them. There are no rousing moments designed to elicit a mass cheer from the audience".[218]
FrenchMinister of Armed ForcesSébastien Lecornutook issue with the portrayal of theFrench Armed Forcesin the film, calling it a "false and misleading representation". A scene in the film shows French mercenaries who were captured by Wakandans after they attacked an outpost inMalibeing brought before the United Nations in uniforms similar to those worn by French soldiers inOperation Barkhane. This was considered a "sensitive" storyline for France, given its soldiers withdrew from its involvement in theMali Warin 2022, and were replaced by Russia'sWagner Group.[219]
Black Panther: Wakanda Foreverwas nominated for fiveAcademy Awards(winning one),[220]aBritish Academy Film Award,[221]sixCritics' Choice Movie Awards(winning two),[222]twoGolden Globe Awards(winning one),[223]and twoScreen Actors Guild Awards,[224]among others.

In November 2022, Coogler and Feige were revealed to have discussed a potential thirdBlack Pantherfilm.[230]In January 2023, Wright believed a third film was being considered, noting that the cast and Coogler needed "a little bit of a break... to regroup" before starting work on a third film.[231]By November 2024, Coogler had had discussions withDenzel Washingtonabout casting him for a role in a third film.[232]The next month, Moore announced plans to exit his role at Marvel Studios in March 2025 to pursue producing outside the studio, though he would return to produceBlack Panther 3along with Marvel Studios.[233]

During what is known as Marvel's "Timely era",Captain Americawas licensed out toRepublic Picturesfora 1944 serial filmonly for the free advertising. Timely failed to provide any drawing of Captain America withhis shieldor any further background, and Republic created a whole new background for the character and portrayed the character using a gun.[11]From the late 1970s through the early 1990s,Marvel Comics GroupandMarvel Entertainment Group(MEG) sold options to studios to produce films based onMarvel Comics characters. One of Marvel's superheroes,Spider-Man, was optioned in the late 1970s, and rights reverted to Marvel without a film having been produced within the allocated time frame. From 1986 to 1996, most of Marvel's major characters were optioned, including theFantastic Four,X-Men,Daredevil, theHulk,Silver Surfer, andIron Man.[12]Marvel's first big-screen adaptation of one of its properties was the 1986 filmHoward the Duck,[13]which was abox-office bomb.[14]MEG was purchased byNew World Entertainmentin November 1986[15]and moved to produce films based on the Marvel characters.

Two other films were produced:Captain America(1990) released in the United Kingdom on screens and direct to video in the United States, andThe Fantastic Four(1994), not intended for release.[16]
After MEG acquiredToyBizin 1993,Avi Aradof ToyBiz was named president and chief executive officer (CEO) of both the Marvel Films division andNew World Family Filmworks, aNew World Entertainmentsubsidiary. New World was MEG's former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group.[17][18]Marvel ProductionsbecameNew World Animationby 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films, includingMarvel Films Animation.[17][19][20]Marvel Films Animation sharedTom Tataranowiczwith New World Animation as head of development and production.[21]New World Animation (The Incredible Hulk),Saban(X-Men: The Animated Series) and Marvel Films Animation (Spider-Man) each produced a Marvel series for television for the 1996–1997 season.[22][20][23]By the end of 1993, Arad and20th Century Foxstruck a deal to make a film based on theX-Men.[24]In August 1996, New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation were sold along with the rest of New World by the Andrews Group toNews Corporationand theFox Entertainment Group. As part of the deal, Marvel licensed the rights to Captain America, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer to be on theFox Kids Networkand produced by Saban. New World Animation continued producing a second season ofThe Incredible HulkforUPN.[22][25]
On August 7, 1996, Marvel Studios was created by Marvel. Filing with theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionto raise money to finance the new corporation, Marvel,Isaac Perlmutter's Zib, Inc. and Avi Arad sold ToyBiz stocks.[12][26]ToyBiz filed an offering of 7.5 million shares with a closing price of $20.125 at the time, making the offering worth approximately $150 million. ToyBiz sought to sell 1 million shares.[27]Jerry Calabrese, the president of Marvel Entertainment Group, and Avi Arad, head of Marvel Films and a director of ToyBiz, were assigned tandem control of Marvel Studios. Under Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to controlpre-productionby commissioning scripts, hiring directors, and casting characters, providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution. Arad said of the goal for control, "When you get into business with a big studio, they are developing a hundred or 500 projects; you get totally lost. That isn't working for us. We're just not going to do it anymore. Period."[12]Marvel Studios arranged a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox to cover markets in the United States and internationally.[28]
In December 1996, Marvel Entertainment Group underwent aChapter 11 bankruptcyreorganization plan, including Marvel Studios as part of its strategic investment.[29]By 1997, Marvel Studios was actively pursuing various film productions based on Marvel characters, including the eventual filmsX-Men(2000),Daredevil(2003),Elektra(2005), andFantastic Four(2005). Unproduced projects includedPrince Namor, based on the characterNamorand to be directed byPhilip Kaufman, andMort the Dead Teenager, based on the comic book of the same name and written by John Payson andMortcreatorLarry Hama.[30]Marvel's Captain America animated series with Saban Entertainment for Fox Kids Network was set to premiere in late 1998.

The resulting production library, which would also include television series, direct-to-video films, and internet projects, would be co-owned.[37]By 2001, the success of Marvel Entertainment'sUltimate Marvelimprint comics created leverage in Hollywood for Marvel Studios, pushing more properties into development.[39]
The next film licensed from Marvel Studios wasSpider-Man(2002) byColumbia Pictures, directed bySam Raimiand starringTobey MaguireasSpider-Man. The film was released on May 3, 2002, grossing $403,706,375 in the United States and Canada and $821,708,551 worldwide.[42]The early success ofSpider-Manled the film's studio to issue a seven-figure advance for a sequel. Arad spoke of the deal, "Movies make sequels. Therefore, it's a big economic luxury to know that a movie's going to get a second and third. This is a business of precedence."[43]According to aLehman Brothersanalysis, Marvel Studios made only $62 million for the first twoSpider-Manfilms.[44]Marvel was making more from half the consumer product licensing fees while making relatively little from the films, but it was enough for Marvel to regain its financial footing.[41]In October 2002, Marvel Studios announced deals for the Sub-Mariner andPrimewithUniversal Pictures.[45]
In contrast to the original storylines ofDC Comics'SupermanandBatmanfilms, Marvel films often emphasized more fidelity to its comics, applying set pieces, scenes, plots, and dialogue drawn from them.[36]In 2003,David Maiselapproached Arad about earning Marvel more for its films. Maisel, Arad, and Perlmutter met, leading to Maisel being hired as president andchief operating officer(COO). The studio's office was small onSanta Monica Boulevard, with around a dozen staff members.Kevin Feige, who later became the president of Marvel Studios, was then a junior executive generating script notes for the licensed studios.[41]In January 2003, Marvel, theSci-Fi Channel, andReveille Productionsagreed to develop two pilot films based onBrother VoodooandStrikeforce: Morituri.[46]In December 2003,Lionsgatepurchased Artisan Entertainment and they decided to let all of the character rights Artisan held, except Punisher, revert to Marvel.[47][48]: 279Marvel Studios partnered with Lionsgate in 2004 to produce eight animated films, calledMarvel Animated Features, for the direct-to-DVD market withLionsgate Home Entertainmenthandling distribution.[49][50]The line was a proof of concept for Maisel's later plan.[41]Eric Rollman was hired by Marvel as Executive Vice President of home entertainment & TV production for Marvel Studios to oversee the deal with Lionsgate.[51]
Maisel was hired in 2004 as president and chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self-finance its films.[40][41]Marvel entered into anon-recourse debtstructure withMerrill Lynchthat was collateralized by certainfilm rightsto a total of ten characters from Marvel's vast vault. Marvel received $525 million to make a maximum of ten films based on the company's properties over eight years, according to the parameters of the original deal. Those characters wereAnt-Man,the Avengers, Black Panther, Captain America,Cloak & Dagger,Doctor Strange,Hawkeye,Nick Fury,Power Pack, andShang-Chi.[52]Ambacinsured the films would succeed or they would pay the interest payment on the debt and get the film rights as collateral.[44]Initially, Marvel Studios was in talks with Universal Pictures as a possible distributor, because Universal owned the film rights to both the Hulk and Namor during that time.[53][54]Negotiations dragged on, so the studio began talks withParamount Pictures. In the second quarter of 2005, Merrill attempted to back out of full financing of each film, demanding that Marvel finance one-third of the budget. Marvel took back rights in five foreign territories from Paramount for pre-sell to meet that demand.[41]In September 2005, Marvel announced the Merrill Lynch financing deal with Paramount was on as marketer and distributor. Marvel Studios' parent company Marvel Enterprises, Inc. then changed its name toMarvel Entertainment, Inc.to reflect the change to self-production.[52]
The studio moved to a new location over aMercedes-Benzdealership inBeverly Hills, California. Maisel was also named vice-chairman of the studio, but reported to Marvel Entertainment CEOIsaac Perlmutter.[41]In November 2005,Michael Helfantjoined the studio as president and chief operating officer.[55]Also that month, Marvel gained the film rights to Iron Man fromNew Line Cinema. Marvel then revealed that it had regained the film rights to the Hulk from Universal in February 2006,[56]in exchange for letting Universal own the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulk(2008) and the right of first refusal to pick up the distribution rights to any future Marvel Studios-producedHulkfilms.[57]In April 2006, Thor was announced to be a Marvel Studios production,[58]while Lions Gate Entertainment subsequently dropped theBlack Widowfilm it had in development since 2004 and returned the rights to Marvel.[59]
Maisel and Arad fought over the rate of film releases and the strength of characters in the film lineup. Perlmutter supported Maisel and thus, in May 2006, Arad quit as studio chair and CEO.[40][60]In March 2007, Helfant was "forced out" of the studio while Maisel was named chairman and Kevin Feige was named president of production to replace Helfant asIron Man(2008) began filming.[61][62]In January 2008,Marvel Animationwas incorporated to direct Marvel's efforts in animation and home entertainment markets including then animation efforts with Lionsgate andNickelodeon.[51]In March, the company agreed to a five-picture basic cable distribution withFXfor the filmsIron ManandThe Incredible Hulk, with additional films to be named later.[63]Following the successful opening weekend ofIron Manin May 2008, Maisel had his contract extended through 2010 and Feige was promoted to president of Marvel Studios.[64]In November, Marvel Studios signed a lease withRaleigh Studiosto host its headquarters and production offices and film the next four films on the studios' slate, includingIron Man 2(2010) andThor(2011), at itsManhattan Beach Studios Media Campusfacilities.[65]By September 2008, Paramount added five additional Marvel films' foreign distribution to its domestic film distribution contract.[66]
In 2009, producer Stephen Broussard was tasked with forming a writers program for the studio. The writers were hired for a year to be on call to do emergency script polishes for films in production,[48]: 165as well as develop scripts based on some lesser-known properties, such as Black Panther,Cable, Iron Fist,Nighthawk, andVision.[48]: 165[67]Writers included: Edward Ricourt, who was encouraged to write a script forLuke Cageas it was of high interest to the studio;[48]: 165Nicole Perlman, who chose to write a script based on the2008 Guardians of the Galaxy team;[48]: 167Christopher Yost, who was asked to pitch a Black Panther film for his interview,[48]: 166and took interest in writing scripts about theThunderbolts,Power Pack, andBrian Braddock / Captain Britain;[48]: 173Joe Robert Cole, who initially pitched aWar Machinefilm before joining the writers program where he created scripts for theInhumans;[48]: 169andEric Pearson, who was asked to pitch aCloak and Daggerfilm and also worked to rewrite a Luke Cage script.[48]: 171After Broussard moved on to the production ofCaptain America: The First Avenger(2011), Marvel Studios hired Nate Moore to oversee the writers program, who at times was assisted by the also newly hired executive Jodi Hildebrand. Particular properties Feige was interested in having screenplays for were Black Panther, Iron Fist, and Blade.[48]: 167–168, 171The program was shut down in 2014 before being revived in 2016.[48]: 172In early 2009,Sonyreturned all Spider-Man television rights (including live-action) in exchange for an adjustment to the film rights.[68]
On August 31, 2009,the Walt Disney Companyannounced that it had reached a deal to acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion.[69]The deal was completed on December 31, with Marvel Entertainment becoming a subsidiary of Disney.[70]Both Marvel and Disney stated that the merger would not affect any pre-existing deals with other film studios for the time being,[71]although Disney said they would distribute future Marvel projects withits own studioonce the deals expired.[72]Maisel stepped down from the studio following the sale to Disney.[73]In April 2010, rumors circulated that Marvel was looking to create $20–40 million films based on properties such as Doctor Strange,Ka-Zar, Luke Cage,Dazzler, and Power Pack.[74]Feige responded by saying, while budgets are generally never discussed early in development, Marvel was considering films for all characters mentioned in the rumor, except Dazzler, whose rights were at Fox.[75]
In June 2010, Marvel Entertainment set up a television division within Marvel Studios calledMarvel Televisionto be headed up byJeph Loebas Executive Vice President,[76]under which Marvel Animation would be operated.[77]In October,Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesacquired the distribution rights forThe Avengers(2012) andIron Man 3(2013) from Paramount Pictures[78]with Paramount's logo and credit remaining on those films.[79]In August 2011, at Disney's behest, the studio dismissed most of its marketing department, including EVP of Worldwide Marketing Dana Precious, VP of Worldwide Marketing Jeffrey Stewart, and Manager of Worldwide Marketing Jodi Miller. Disney subsequently began marketing Marvel's films.[80]In April 2012, the Walt Disney Company China, Marvel Studios, andDMG Entertainmentannounced an agreement to co-produceIron Man 3in China. DMG partly financed, produced in China with Marvel, and handled co-production matters. DMG also distributed the film in China in tandem with Disney.[81]
In April 2013, Marvel Studios moved its executive production offices from the Manhattan Beach Studios Media Campus tothe Walt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California.[82]In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights toIron Man,Iron Man 2,Thor, andCaptain America: The First Avengerfrom Paramount.[83][84]In September 2014,TNTacquired the cable rights forAvengers: Age of Ultron(2015),Captain America: Civil War(2016), and three other films, to air on the network two years after their theatrical releases. The films had previously aired on FX since 2008.[85]
In August 2015, Marvel Studios was placed intoWalt Disney Studios, with Feige reporting directly to Walt Disney Studios chairmanAlan F. Horninstead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter. Marvel Television and subsidiary Marvel Animation were left under Marvel Entertainment and Perlmutter's control.[86][87]As of April 2017, Marvel Studios was housed on the second floor of theFrank G. Wells Buildingat the Disney studio lot.[1][2]Fast Companyranked Marvel Studios number eleven on its 2018 World's Most Innovative Companies list.[88]
In September 2018, it was reported that Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for the streaming serviceDisney+, to be centered on "second tier" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films. Characters being considered for series includedLokiandScarlet Witch, with the actors who portrayed the characters in the films expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes, with a "hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a "hands-on role" in each series' development.[89]In October 2019, Feige was given the title ofChief Creative Officer, Marvel, and would oversee the creative direction of Marvel Television andMarvel Family Entertainment, with both being returned to being under the Marvel Studios banner.[90]Two months later, Marvel Television was folded into Marvel Studios, with Marvel Studios overseeing development of all the Marvel Television series in production at the time of its closing.Karim Zreik, Marvel Television's senior vice president of current programming and production, would join Marvel Studios alongside his team to oversee the production of the Marvel Television series inherited by Marvel Studios.[91]
In May 2022, Marvel Studios signed a 20-year licensing deal with Stan Lee Universe to license the name and likeness of Lee for use in future films, television series, Disney theme parks and cruises, various "experiences", and merchandising. A digitally recreated Lee was not expected to make cameo appearances in future projects, rather the deal allows Marvel to use Lee's name, voice, likeness, signature, and existing images and archival material.[92]In June 2023, the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulkreverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.[93]
By October 2023, Marvel Studios was planning to hire dedicated executives to focus on its television efforts, as part of a larger plan tochange its approach to its television series.[94]Production and development executive Richie Palmer was serving as a television executive by January 2024.[95]In May 2024, Marvel Studios revealed that its live-action Disney+ series would be released under a new "Marvel Television" banner, separate from the previous company of the same name, starting withAgatha All Alonglater in 2024.[96]
In June 2021, ahead of Marvel Studios' first solely produced animated seriesWhat If...?, executive vice president of film productionVictoria Alonsonoted that the studio was creating an "animation branch and mini-studio" to focus on more animated content beyondWhat If...?.[97]Marvel Studios outsources the animation for its animated series to third-party animation studios, though executive Brad Winderbaum indicated Marvel would work with fellow Disney studiosPixarandWalt Disney Animation Studios"under the right circumstances".[98]In September 2021, Alonso was promoted to President of Physical, Post Production, VFX and Animation.[99]In November 2021, Marvel Studios announced the animated seriesX-Men '97(2024–present), arevivalofX-Men: The Animated Series(1992–1997) that is set in that series' continuity.[100]The animation branch of Marvel Studios and "mini-studio" is known as Marvel Studios Animation.[7]By April 2022, Marvel Studios had taken over production of the preschool animated seriesSpidey and His Amazing Friends, starting from its second season; the first season was produced under the Marvel Entertainment banner.[101]The "Marvel Animation" name and banner was used for the division's projects by May 2024.[96]
In March 2023, Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios by a group includingDisney Entertainmentco-chairmanAlan Bergmanand Disney's human resources and legal departments for serving as a producer on theAmazon StudiosfilmArgentina, 1985(2022); this was a breach of a 2018 agreement between Alonso and Disney which stated employees would not work for a competing studio.[102][103]Alonso reportedly did not seek permission to work on the film, and was asked by Disney to stop working on the film, as well as not to promote or publicize it, with the situation "deemed serious enough" that Disney requested a new agreement be signed. Despite this, Alonso continued to promote the film following its September 2022 premiere, and was consistently reminded of her agreement and breach of contract, ultimately leading to her firing.[102]Alonso's lawyers refuted this claim, stating Disney was aware of, and agreed to, Alonso's work onArgentina, 1985, and that she was instead "silenced[... and] was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible";[104]this incident was reported to be a disagreement with a Disney executive over the censoring ofgay pride elementsinAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania(2023) to release the film in Kuwait and comply withits restrictive anti-LGBTQ laws.[105][106]A Disney spokesperson reiterated the notion that she was fired due to "an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy" among other "key factors".[104]Disney and Alonso reached a multimillion-dollar compensation settlement in April.[107]
Also at the time of Alonso's firing, criticism from VFX workers was noted,[103]who had raised complaints of Marvel's "demanding post-production schedules". Alonso was described by some as a "kingmaker",[103][7]and "challenging to work with",[105]with Chris Lee atVulturereporting that Alonso was "singularly responsible for Marvel's toxic work environment" with VFX workers.[108][7]Alonso reportedly took days off to produceArgentina, 1985instead of her post-production commitments for the various MCU projects, which in turn resulted in the need to delay several projects in 2022 and 2023.[105]However, Alonso was also described as the "epitome of professional" and supportive on set, with Joanna Robinson ofThe Ringerdescribing the reports as a "gross mischaracterization" and the opposite of Alonso's work.[103][109]Following Alonso's firing, visual effects vendors for the various MCU projects were working with producer Jen Underdahl, the vice president of visual effects and stereo.[102][110]
In August 2023, a group of 52 on-set VFX workers at Marvel Studios filed a petition with theNational Labor Relations Boardfor an election to join theInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees(IATSE) labor union theVFX Union. This was the first time any workers in the visual effects industry had petitioned for union recognition. Lee believed if this group of workers were able to secure union recognition, it "would stand as proof of concept for the overall viability of an industry-wide unionization push", particularly at the post-production effect houses.[111]All of the workers who participated in the election vote that concluded in early September voted unanimously to form a union with IATSE, with the union then set to enter into collective bargaining negotiations with Marvel, beginning at an unspecified date.[112]
Marvel had licensed out the film rights to many of its characters to other studios in the 1990s, starting with theX-Men,[24]theFantastic Four,Spider-Man, andDaredevil, which were followed byCaptain America,Iron Man,Thor, theHulk,Ant-Manand theWasp,Black Widow,Luke Cage, thePunisher,Blade,Ghost Rider,Man-Thing,Black Panther,Deadpool, andPrime, among others.[45][113]
In February 2015, Marvel Studios andSony Pictures Entertainmentannounced that Spider-Man would appear in the MCU, with the character appearing inCaptain America: Civil War(2016) and Sony releasingSpider-Man: Homecoming, produced by Feige andAmy Pascal, in July 2017. As part of the deal, Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films.[114]In June 2015, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal did not allow Spider-Man to appear in any of theMCU television series, as it was "very specific... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed."[115]In September 2019, it was announced that Disney and Sony had reached a new agreement allowing for Spider-Man to appear in athird standalone film(produced by Marvel Studios and Feige) and a future Marvel Studios film.[116]Disney was reported to be co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of the film's profits in the new agreement, while retaining the merchandising rights to the character.[116][117]In November 2021, Pascal announced plans for a fourthSpider-Manfilm set in the MCU, in addition to long-term plans for a new trilogy of films with Marvel Studios, with said film entering active development the following month.[118][119]Sony's agreement specifies that production has to start on a film within three years and nine months of the previous one, and release within five years and nine months, otherwise the rights revert to Marvel.[48]: 295Sony has access to 856 characters within its agreement,[48]: 297includingKingpin, who is able to be used by both Sony and Marvel Studios.[120]
In March 2023,Citigroupfinancial analystJason Bazinet felt Disney may try to include the distribution rights to the Hulk and Namor in any potential sale of the streaming serviceHulutoComcast, the owner ofUniversal PicturesthroughNBCUniversal.[121]In June 2023, the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulkreverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.[93]

The "Marvel Studios Parliament", otherwise known as "The Parliament", is the creative decision-making committee at Marvel Studios and a "brain trust" of long-time executives who help to elevate each other's projects where possible.[150][151][152][94]The following executives are members of the Parliament:[153]
A number of other executives serve as lead producers on films and television series, working on each project from their inception through their release as managers alongside other executives,[152][162]as part of the Production and Development group. Some of these executives include:[153]
The Visual Development group is an in-house group of artists who work on a film from its start to provide a consistent look for the studio.[157][additional citation(s) needed]
In addition to Meinerding, the group includesAndy Park, Director of Visual Development and Production Illustrator[172][173]
Additionally,Sarah Halley Finnhas served as a frequent casting director for several MCU films and television series.[179]
Starting with the release ofSpider-Manin 2002, Marvel Studios introduced its "flipbook"production logo, created by Imaginary Forces.[191]This logo was accompanied by music from the film's score, sound effects or a song, to lead into the beginning of the film. This was the logo seen in front of all of the studio's films until 2013, when the logo was updated with the release ofThor: The Dark World, again created by Imaginary Forces. Feige stated that since Marvel was now its own entity within the Walt Disney Company, it "felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features" instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel's studio or distribution partners' logos. Feige added that they "didn't want to re-invent the wheel [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel."[192]Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002. They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, and ultimately chose 120 that were "universal and not specific to one character" and created a narrative "where each image spoke to the one before it and after."[191]The new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within theMarvel Cinematic UniversethroughCaptain America: Civil War. With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed byBrian Tyler, who wrote the scores toIron Man 3,Thor: The Dark World, andAvengers: Age of Ultron.[192]It was featured on the filmsThor: The Dark World,Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014), andGuardians of the Galaxy(2014).
In July 2016, another new logo and opening were introduced, featuring an updated fanfare, composed this time byMichael Giacchino, who first worked with Marvel Studios on the score toDoctor Strange(2016). The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.[193]It was first seen in front ofDoctor Strange.[194]The updated logo was created byPerception, which was first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update its logo. Feige specifically requested Perception "to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image, showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo." The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed "How to Build a Universe", which "was designed to pay tribute to [the filmmaking] process by touching on" how a film's origins are inspired by the comics, which then results in a script, followed by concept art, resulting in the final film. Perception looked to the initial "flipbook" logo for inspiration, and paid tribute to it in the new opening, as it opens identically to the flipbook logo. Next, the opening includes "various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays", with Perception picking "both iconic fan-favorites, as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe." To add in the concept art images, Perception looked "through a massive archive of concept art and "The Art Of..." books, to select the most iconic images for each beloved character. Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves, the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch. The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them." Finally, over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had been released at that time were included, with Perception arranging them in a way they called the "vault" "where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the "Marvel" logotype."[195]
A modified version of Perception's logo was introduced at the 2017D23Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU.[196]The logo debuted withAvengers: Infinity Waron April 26, 2018, and was used again inAnt-Man and the Wasp(2018). With the release ofCaptain Marvel, the current Perception logo was altered at Marvel Studios' behest in honor ofStan Lee; Lee died on November 12, 2018, just a few months before the release of the film.[197]The logo was altered, replacing the characters with Stan Lee's MCU cameos and other public appearances related to the MCU, accompanied by a black screen reading "Thank You Stan".[198]Similarly, the logo was retroactively modified for theDisney+version ofBlack Panther(2018) in honor ofChadwick Boseman, who died on August 28, 2020. The logo was altered, replacing the characters with images and footage ofT'Challaand Boseman. The logo premiered on November 29, 2020, which would have been Boseman's 44th birthday.[199][200]Additional modifications include having the characters who disappeared in the Blip removed forAvengers: Endgame; an additional Boseman tribute one forBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever(2022); and an all-Guardians of the Galaxy opening forGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3(2023). A shortened sequence opening was used for the Disney+ seriesSecret Invasion(2023).[201]"What If... Strange Supreme Intervened?" (2023), theWhat If...?season twofinale, replaced the live-action footage of the logo with animated images fromWhat If...?.[202]Captain America: Brave New World(2025) was the first Marvel Studios film to not feature the studio's logo animation sequence.[203]
Television specialsfrom Marvel Studios, which are marketed as "Marvel Studios Special Presentation", feature a special multicolored intro with bongo drum music, reminiscent of theCBS Special Presentationtheme featured before animated holiday specials of the 1980s and 1990s.[204][205]The intro was also designed by Perception,[206]with Giacchino (who directed and composed for the specialWerewolf by Night) once again creating the music.[205]Jamie Lovett atComicBook.comcalled the Marvel Studios Special Presentation intro "more colorful" and its fanfare "more playful" than the normal Marvel Studios intro.[207]
Marvel Knights was a production arm of Marvel Studios intended to produce some of Marvel's darker and lesser-known titles. The name originated from the "Marvel Knights" imprint ofMarvel Comics. The first film produced under the Marvel Knights banner wasPunisher: War Zone(2008), which served as arebootof thePunisherfranchise. This was followed byGhost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance(2011), which was the second and final title to be released under the Marvel Knights banner.[210]

Joe Robert Cole(born January 1, 1980) is an American filmmaker and actor. He is best known for hisEmmy Award-nominated andWriters Guild of America Award-winning work on the first season of thetrue crimeanthologytelevision seriesAmerican Crime Story, titledThe People v. O. J. Simpson, and for co-writing the filmBlack Pantherand its sequel,Wakanda Forever.
Cole, an only child, moved around a lot growing up, which he felt "prepared" him to be a writer, a desire he only discovered during college. He soon applied to theUniversity of California, Berkeley.[1]
During his tenure at the university, Cole entered the film business, working as a writer on the 2006 filmATL, although not receiving a credit.[1]In 2011, he released his first feature film as a director and writer,Amber Lake.
After writing a "Chinatown-style cop script", Cole was invited to a meeting withMarvel Studios, where he was told that they had plans of doing a movie about the characterWar Machine. He pitched a story and was chosen to write the film, but, according to him, "they decided, based on whatIron Man 3was going to be, they weren't going to doWar Machineanymore." Marvel subsequently invited him to join its writers program.[2]
In regards to the program, Cole said:
The way it works—and I'm only speaking for myself here—is they give you an office and a character. You read all the comics with that character, then you come up with a story you see for that character. You present it, get notes and if everything moves along, you're greenlit to write the script.[2]
In 2014, Cole wrote a script for a projected movie about theInhumans.[3]
In 2016, the television seriesAmerican Crime Storywas released. Cole served as co-producer of the first season,The People v. O. J. Simpson, and wrote two episodes, "The Race Card" (for which he was nominated for aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie or a Dramatic Special) and "A Jury in Jail".
While working onThe People v. O. J. Simpson, Cole was approached by Marvel Studios' producer Nate Moore, wanting to know if he was willing to write a film aboutBlack Panther. He immediately accepted. Cole was part of a competition, but was ultimately chosen to write the screenplay with directorRyan Coogler.[2]

Gurira performed in a production of theNtozake ShangeplayFor Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf, directed and choreographed byDale Ricardo Shields. “She was a very intelligent, strong and independent young lady,” said Shields. “She approached her studies, her classes, with a lot of focus, and you can see the same things in her performance in ‘Black Panther.’ ”[15]
Gurira said that she began writing plays in an effort to better utilize her strengths as an actress, and to tell stories that convey ideas about strong women with whom she identifies.[10]
"Born into this world as an African girl, I never understood the absence of voices and people who were similar to me, it never made sense to me that I couldn't see that representation. The very massive magnitude of content you get in television and film, and yet there was this almost absolute absence of the stories of women from the continent and of the continent. [...] I didn't accept any ideas as to why it wasn't there. It just needed to be there. It just has to happen, and I guess I'll have to do it."[16]

Bassett was born in New York City, to Betty Jane (née Gilbert), a social worker and civil servant,[4]the second wife of Daniel Benjamin Bassett, a preacher's son.[5][6][7]Bassett's middle name was given to her in honor of her aunt Evelyn.[6]Ten months after Bassett was born, her mother became pregnant and had a second child, Bassett's sister D'nette. Bassett said the pregnancy "only made things harder", leading her parents to send her to her father's sister, Golden, inWinston-Salem, North Carolina. While her aunt did not have any children of her own, she "loved children, and she was good with them."[8]
At the age of four, Bassett was picked up by her mother after her parents divorced; her mother took her and her sister toSt. Petersburg, Florida.[9]
Bassett did not see her father again for several years, until she attended her grandmother's funeral. There, Bassett met her father's daughter Jean, from his first marriage, who was twelve years old, and several years older than Bassett.[10]
After graduating from Jordan Park Elementary School, Bassett wasbusedto attend Disston Middle School for seventh grade. She began at that school in 1970, a year before the city of St. Petersburg formally established busing to integrate its public schools. After completing seventh grade, Bassett was bused to Azalea Middle School for eighth and ninth grades. Bassett's mother became more involved in her daughters' studies and told the two that they would go to college.[11]
In her younger years, Bassett was "in love" with theJackson 5, and dreamed of marrying a member of the family group. She said her choice would probably be "whoever had the cutest, roundest Afro at the time. In my imagination we would have children and live in a real house."[10]As her interest in entertainment developed, Angela and her sister would often put on shows, reading poems or performing popular music for their family.[12]
AtBoca Ciega High School, Bassett was a cheerleader and a member of theUpward Boundcollege prep program, the debate team, student government, drama club and choir. An "A" and "B" student for the most part, Bassett got her first "C" in physical education. She tried to convince her mother not to be disappointed by the grade. Bassett called the grade the "average," leading her mother to say she did not have "average kids." As Bassett described, she developed a "sense of pride"  and did not get another "C" until college.[13]During high school, Bassett became the first African American in that school to be admitted to theNational Honor Society. The Upward Bound program is an academic and cultural enrichment program for underprivileged students. Bassett says she and the other participants did not see themselves as underprivileged.[12]
Bassett studied atYale Universityand graduated with aBachelor of ArtsinAfrican American Studiesin 1980.[14]She studied acting at theYale School of Dramaand obtained aMaster of Fine Artsin 1983. Her paternal aunt had warned her not to "waste" her "Yale education on theater." She was the only member of Bassett's family to have gone to both college and graduate school.[13]
At Yale, Bassett met her future husbandCourtney B. Vance, a 1986 graduate of the drama school. Bassett was also classmates with actorCharles S. Dutton.[15]
After graduation, Bassett worked as a receptionist for a beauty salon and as a photo researcher to support herself while looking for acting work in the New York theater.

She appeared in twoAugust Wilsonplays at theYale Repertory Theatreunder the direction of her long-time instructorLloyd Richards; these wereMa Rainey's Black Bottom(1984), andJoe Turner's Come and Gone(1986).

Bassett earned industry attention and public recognition for her early performances in the filmsBoyz n the Hood(1991) andMalcolm X(1992). For her portrayal ofBetty Shabazzin the latter, she earned anNAACP Image Award. The movie received a mixed critical reception.  One negative review, for example, judged thatMalcolm Xfailed to "capture" the rage ofMalcolm X's autobiography.[18]During production, directorSpike Leeshowed Bassett a tape of the exact moment when Malcolm X was shot, since they would be filming the scene. Bassett called the recording "haunting," but noted that afterward she was "able to grab hold of the pain and re-create the scene." Bassett felt it was important for her to get the assassination scene correct, and wondered how Betty "found the strength to keep going, to raise her family, to educate, to sustain them."[19]Bassett worried that after her role as Betty Shabazz inMalcolm X, she would not find another role "as satisfying." At the time of the film's release, she expressed her worry that she would not have such a role again. "I think I have been incredibly blessed and it is probably just all downhill from here."[20]
Bassett also starred asKatherine JacksoninThe Jacksons: An American Dream, which premiered on ABC-TV in the same week as the theatrical release ofMalcolm X. After returning to Los Angeles following completion of her work forMalcolm X, Bassett got a call to audition for a movie aboutTina Turner, based on her memoirI, Tina.[21]Bassett won the lead role overHalle BerryandRobin Givens, but had only one month to prepare before filming began. She met with Tina Turner twice, who advised her on details of her interpretation, from wigs and outfits to dancing styles. Turner also did Bassett's make-up, leading Bassett to call her "supportive" and her "biggest fan."[17]In an interview with theOrlando Sentinel, Bassett described going to one of Turner's concerts and, after realizing that she knew some of Turner's dance moves, she cried and was "almost a river of tears."[22]Bassett's performance as Turner inWhat's Love Got to Do with It(1993) received strong reviews.[23][24]Marc Bernardin ofEntertainment Weeklywrote that Bassett "gave the performance of a lifetime" portraying Turner in the biopic.[25]Bassett won aGolden Globefor her portrayal, and was the first African American to win thisAward for Best Actress. She was nominated for anAcademy Awardas Best Actress, but lost toHolly HunterforThe Piano.  (Despite the acclaim, Bassett later said in a 2022 interview onToday with Hoda & Jenna, that after portraying Turner, she did not receive acting calls for about a year and a half.)
Bassett starred in three movies in 1995, which received varying reviews:Vampire in Brooklyn,Strange Days, andWaiting to Exhale. (For the latter she worked with authorTerry McMillan, who had written the book of the same title that was adapted for film).

Bassett had previously worked with Craven on television shows.[26]Bassett's character inWaiting to Exhale, Bernadine Harris, was betrayed by her husband. In revenge she set fire to his entire wardrobe and vehicle, then sold what was left for one dollar. Bassett described the scene and her character in this film to theOrlando Sentinel: She said, "The thing is that my character is thinking about how her husband has left her. I have a cigarette in one hand, and I'm drinking. Basically, the four of us are sitting there talking about men and having some fun."[22]
In 1997, Bassett starred as the President's advisor inContact.[27]Stephen Holden ofThe New York Timesopined that Bassett was "largely wasted as a Presidential assistant."[28]In 1998, Bassett starred inHow Stella Got Her Groove Back, once again collaborating with McMillan.

She was praised for her  performance byVariety[29]and theWashington Post.[30]Stephen Holden ofThe New York Timessaid Bassett's character was "the best thing in the movie" and wrote the actress "portrays this high-strung superwoman with such intensity that she makes her almost believable."[31]In 1999, Bassett starred inMusic of the Heart, once again collaborating with horror directorWes Craven.[32][33]Matthew Eng wrote of her "terrifically specific chemistry" withMeryl Streep.[34]

She appeared in the 2001 filmThe Score. Her character was in a relationship withRobert De Niro's. She read the film's script and became interested.

When asked if the film was easier to act in than the more intense roles she had in the past, Bassett said, "This was much easier. This was a walk in the park. It was pretty easy compared to some of the roles I've done that call for so much emotion or physicality." At the time of the film's release, she described both Bernie Mac andLaurence Fishburne, whom she had worked with in the past, her "favorites" and said the pair were both "highly professional and extraordinarily talented."[48]The only film she appeared in during the following year wasMr. and Mrs. Smithin an uncredited voice role.[49]In the 2006 filmAkeelah and the Bee, Bassett portrayed Tanya Anderson, the mother of the film's lead, Akeelah, played byKeke Palmer.

Her role was seen as an "extended cameo" by Brian Lowry ofVariety.[52]
Bassett provided her voice for the 2007 filmMeet the Robinsons.[53]When asked about her motives in taking on the role, Bassett said, "For one, it was a character I had never played before, which is always important to me, to keep me sharp. But it was also the desire to be part of a well-written movie that has something really positive to say about families and about all the different ways there can be to make a family."[54]
She appeared in the 2008 filmGospel Hill.[55][56]Stephen Holden ofThe New York Timeswrote that Bassett's "fiery self-possession brings a spark of passion to her stick-figure character".[57]She next appeared inOf Boys and Men, portraying Rieta Cole, the matriarch of a Chicago family who is killed in an accident in the beginning of the film; she appears in flashbacks for the remainder of the film.

Bassett is widely regarded as one of the finest actresses of her generation.[126]Bassett has portrayed real-life African-American women who are usually strong and intelligent. Bassett said in 2001 that she liked those roles and added: "That's the image that I like to put out there, and those are the parts I'm attracted to. But not iron-fist kind of strong, just self-assured. I'm nice too."[39]She has turned down roles which she viewed as demeaning to her image. "This is a career about images. It's celluloid; they last for ever. I'm a black woman from America. My people were slaves in America, and even though we're free on paper and in law, I'm not going to allow you to enslave me on film, in celluloid, for all to see. And to cross the water, to countries where people will never meet people who look like me. So it becomes a bigger thing than me just becoming a movie star, and me just being on TV. So if you're going to show every black woman as 400lb or every black woman as the prostitute on the street ... But I have always maintained that [the roles] I cannot do because of the way I'm made up, or because of the way I think, I don't begrudge that there is someone else who has no issues with that."[127]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
