Puss in Boots: The Last Wishis a 2022 American animatedadventurecomedy filmproduced byDreamWorks Animationand distributed byUniversal Pictures. The sequel to the spin-off filmPuss in Boots(2011) and the sixth installment of theShrekfilm series, the film was directed byJoel Crawford, co-directed by Januel Mercado, and written by Paul Fisher,Tommy Swerdlow, andTom Wheeler. Based onthe characterintroduced inShrek 2(2004) and inspired by thefairy taleof the same name, the voice cast includesAntonio BanderasandSalma Hayekreprising their respective roles as thetitular characterandKitty Softpaws, with new additions to the cast includingHarvey Guillén,Florence Pugh,Olivia Colman,Ray Winstone,Samson Kayo,John Mulaney, andWagner Moura. The story follows Puss in Boots, who teams up with Kitty Softpaws and Perrito to find the Last Wish of the fallen Wishing Star to restore eight of hisnine lives. They race against other fairy tale characters seeking the same treasure, while a sinister wolf hunts Puss himself.
Plans for a sequel toPuss in Bootsbegan in November 2012 but languished indevelopment helluntil it was revived in November 2018, withIlluminationfounder and CEOChris Meledandriconfirmed as an executive producer. It was announced in February 2019 that the film would be helmed byBob Persichetti, head of story of the first film and co-director ofSony Pictures Animation'sSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018). However, Crawford signed on and replaced Persichetti as director in March 2021, along with Mercado. The story draws inspiration fromSpaghetti Westernfilms, withThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly(1966) cited as a particular influence. The film's style is inspired bySpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. With new technology, the team was able to give the film a painterly style to resemble a fairy-tale story, diverging from the visual style of previous installments in theShrekfranchise.
Following delays due to a restructuring at DreamWorks,Puss in Boots: The Last Wishpremiered atLincoln CenterinNew York Cityon November 25, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 21. It received acclaim from critics, with praise for its animation, story, humor, themes, and vocal performances. The film was also a box office success, grossing over $485 million worldwide on a production budget of $90–110 million and becoming thetenth-highest-grossing film of 2022. At the95th Academy Awardsit was nominated forBest Animated Feature, as well as receiving nominations at theGolden Globes,Critics' Choice Awards, andBritish Academy Film Awards.
Many years after his adventures with Shrek,Puss in Bootssubdues a giant while hosting a party in the town of Del Mar, but is subsequently crushed by a church bell. After Puss recovers, the town doctor advises Puss to retire because he has already lost eight of his nine lives. Puss initially refuses but relents when he is wounded and disarmed while dueling a wolf at the local pub. Traumatized by the event, Puss follows the doctor's directions to the house of Mama Luna, an elderly cat lady, and buries his clothes. Months later, Puss meets an optimistic Chihuahua disguised as a cat, whom he calls Perrito.  Crime familyGoldilocks and the Three Bearssoon arrive at Luna's home, intending to hire Puss to help them steal a map displaying the location of the Wishing Star. They leave after finding his apparent grave, and Puss decides to find the Star to wish for another nine lives.
Perrito follows Puss to the factory lair of the corrupt pastry chef and magical artifact collector"Big" Jack Horner, who intends to use the Star to control all of the world's magic. While stealing the map from Horner, Puss encounters his resentful ex-fiancéeKitty Softpaws, who intends to take the map for herself. Goldi, the Bears, and Horner discover and chase the trio, and Puss briefly sees the wolf in the distance. They all end up in the Dark Forest, apocket dimensionthat manifests illusions of travelers' memories. During the subsequent clash, Puss suffers a panic attack and flees after the wolf reappears, allowing Goldi to take the map from Kitty.
After Perrito finds Puss and calms him down, Puss confesses his fears and remorse for abandoning Kitty before their wedding. She overhears Puss and tells him that she did not attend the wedding either, believing he loved himself too much to love her. Reinvigorated, Puss and Kitty retrieve the map while Goldi and the Bears are distracted by a manifestation of their woodland cottage. While escaping from Goldi and the Bears, Puss becomes trapped in a crystalline cave, where reflections of his past lives ridicule him for changing his outlook. The wolf arrives and reveals himself asDeath, who is outraged by Puss' failure to value any of his lives and intends to take his final life personally. Horrified, Puss runs out of the cave towards the Star, leaving Kitty and Perrito behind.
During an argument with Baby Bear, Goldi reveals she intends to wish for a human family. Though this hurts the Bears' feelings, they still agree to help her. Puss arrives at the Star and begins to make his wish, but Kitty arrives, berates him for his selfishness, and reveals she would have wished for someone she could trust. Goldi, the Bears, and Horner arrive, and a fight ensues for the map. Goldi briefly obtains it but abandons it to save Baby Bear, while Kitty traps Horner inside his magical bottomless bag.
Death arrives and challenges Puss to a duel. Having learned the value of life from his time with his companions, Puss forgoes wishing for more lives and accepts, temporarily disarming Death. Puss declares that, while he can never truly defeat Death, he will never stop fighting for his last life. Realizing Puss is no longer arrogant, Death begrudgingly spares him and leaves, though he and Puss acknowledge that they will eventually meet again.
Horner escapes the bag by eating a magic snack that transforms him into a giant. Perrito distracts him, allowing Puss, Kitty, and Goldi to destroy the map, which causes the Wishing Star to consume Horner and explode. Goldi affirms to the Bears that they are her true family, and they decide to take over Horner's business. Puss rekindles his romance with Kitty; with Perrito in tow, they steal a ship andhead to the Kingdom of Far Far Awayto visit some old friends.

In November 2012, executive producerGuillermo del Toroshared directorChris Miller's intentions to take the titular character on an adventure to a "very exotic locale". He also said a couple of drafts for the screenplay were completed.[12]In April 2014, voice actorAntonio Banderassaid work on the sequel had begun.[6]On June 12, 2014, the movie was titledPuss in Boots 2: Nine Lives & 40 Thieves.[13]In March 2015, Banderas said the script was under restructuring. He also hinted at the possibility ofShrekappearing in the film.[14]
By November 2018,Illuminationfounder and CEOChris Meledandrihad been brought on board as an executive producer of bothShrek 5(2026) andPuss in Boots 2.[15][16]In February 2019, it was reported thatBob Persichettiwas set to direct the film while Latifa Ouaou, producer of the first film, would oversee the development of the sequel with Meledandri; Persichetti and Ouaou previously worked on the first film as head of story and producer, respectively.[17]On August 19, 2020, DreamWorks trademarkedPuss in Boots: The Last Wishas the new title of the sequel, which was approved in December.[18]In March 2021,Joel Crawfordreplaced Persichetti as director, having previously helmed DreamWorks'The Croods: A New Age(2020), with producer Mark Swift, editor James Ryan, and screenwriter Paul Fisher returning as collaborators along with Januel Mercado serving as the film's co-director.[7][19]Along withSalma Hayek(now credited as Salma Hayek Pinault) reprising her voice role, new cast members were announced in March 2022, includingHarvey Guillén,Florence Pugh,Olivia Colman,Ray Winstone,Samson Kayo,John Mulaney,Wagner Moura,Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and Anthony Mendez.[7]
While wanting the film to retain the adult humor from previous entries, Crawford also wanted the film to have a darker tone, with Puss' mortality and fear of death being the film's main focus,[20]wanting to use the concept of Puss being in his last life to tell a story about how to enjoy life.[21][22]Swift felt theShrekfranchise being over 20 years old by the time the project entered production allowed the film to explore darker themes than its predecessors.[20]He drew inspiration from fairytales by theBrothers Grimmand how they were "cautionary tales that took you somewhere dark to make you appreciate the light".[23]This also influenced the decision to depict Death as a wolf, as wolves in Brothers Grimm's stories were depicted as "the personification of fear".[23]Other influences for the film includeSpaghetti Westernsfilms, due to how those films managed to balance between different tones.[23]The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly(1966) was cited as a particular influence on the film's plot.[20]
Crawford said he wanted the film's comedy to be "edgy" in the vein ofShrek(2001), aiming to honor what audiences loved from previous entries, although still wanting to do something different with the franchise instead of retreading familiar ground.[21][24]He also was interested in including more characters from the franchise, but not at the expense of the film's story.[21]He also felt that "one foot ofPuss in Bootsis dipped in theShrekfairy tale world, but another one is in the spaghetti western world", and aiming to balance both aspects influenced certain decisions for the film.[24]
For the film's opening sequence, the producers didn't want to simply re-introduce the character to general audiences, but also to "[introduce] the world to where the character is now" by establishing him as a celebrity, with the writers drawing inspiration fromMick Jagger.[20]Crawford wanted Puss to start the film as a "larger than life"-type of figure who comes to embrace his vulnerability.[25]Swift described the story as being about Puss "[having] to figure out who am I without all the things that people value in me?".[20]The idea of featuring a scene of Puss having apanic attackwas conceived after the team deemed Puss expressing his vulnerabilities verbally as "insincere", whereas a panic attack was seen as a "natural point" for the character that would force Puss to "let down the facade of being a fearless hero". For the scene, Crawford and storyboard artist Taylor Meacham drew from their personal experiences.[25]
As with DreamWorks' previous filmThe Bad Guys(2022), the film's design was inspired bySony Pictures Animation'sSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018), to make the film look more like storybook illustrations, from an idea suggested by production designer Nate Wragg.[26][27][28]In February 2019,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Versedirector Persichetti was set to directPuss in Boots: The Last Wish,[17]before he was replaced by Crawford in March 2021.[19]Using new technology, the team at DreamWorks focused more on a painterly style design, to make the film look like a fairy-tale world, different than what it was inShrekfrom their defunct studioPacific Data Images.[29][20]
The film's subject matter and thematic merit have been lauded, receiving critical praise and discourse. It depictsDeathas a living antagonist, chasing Puss for his final life. Puss does not defeat Death by combat, however, but instead by learning toaccept the inevitability of death, while making sure to live life to the fullest and learning to let the people he loves have a part in his life. This metaphor has received critical evaluation and appraisal for its poignancy.[30][31]
Heitor Pereiracomposed the film's score, replacingHenry Jackmanfrom the first film.[32]Additionally, three original songs were made for the film byKarol G, Daniel Oviedo, Heitor Pereira, Paul Fisher,Dan Navarro, andGaby Moreno. Karol G performs "La Vida es Una", co-written by herself and Daniel Oviedo and released on December 8, 2022[33]while Heitor Pereira co-wrote two songs titled "Fearless Hero", performed by Antonio Banderas and co-written by Dan Navarro and Paul Fisher, and "Por Que Te Vas", co-written with and performed by Gaby Moreno.[34]The soundtrack was released on December 16, 2022, byBack Lot Music, in addition to cover ofthe Doors' "This Is the End" performed by Dan Navarro.[35]Music fromShrek 2was used in the film byHarry Gregson-Williamsfrom the tracks "Obliged to Help" and "The End / Happily Ever After".

It was originally scheduled to be released on November 2, 2018,[13]and later on December 21, 2018,[37]before it was removed from the release schedule altogether in January 2015 due to corporate restructuring and DreamWorks Animation's new policy to release two films a year.[38][39]Upon the project's resurrection, it was given a release date of September 23, 2022, in March 2021,[19]but in April 2022, the release date was moved to its current December 21 date, taking over the release ofIllumination'sThe Super Mario Bros. Movie.[40]A one-day public screening occurred on November 26, 2022, in select theaters.[41][42]
The first thirty minutes of the film were shown at theAnnecy International Animation Film Festivalon June 14, 2022. Critics noted the darker tone of the movie when compared to its predecessor and director Joel Crawford agreed with them, mentioning that Puss' "fear of death is the engine that drives the movie".[43][20]
The film also debuted a new animated logo opening for DreamWorks Animation, showcasing characters fromThe Bad Guys,How to Train Your Dragon,Kung Fu Panda,The Boss Baby,Trolls, andShrekwith a remastered rendition of the 2010 fanfare composed byHarry Gregson-Williamsmixed with several notes from the 2019 fanfare composed byJohn Powell, produced by Suzanne Buirgy fromAbominableand Kendall Cronkhite fromTrollsserved as the production designer.[44]

It is not only one of the best animated films of the year, but it's one of DreamWorks' best and one that will strike a chord with moviegoers of all ages. It's equal parts exciting and hilarious as well as earnest, it never feels like it is talking down to anyone. WithThe Bad Guysand nowPuss in Boots: The Last Wish, it is more than safe to say that DreamWorks is back and (maybe) better than ever."[76]
Peter Debruge ofVarietygave the film a positive review, saying the film was "DWA's best film since theHow to Train Your Dragontrilogy."[77]Maxance Vincent ofLoud and Cleargave the film four out of five stars, saying: "Puss in Boots: The Last Wishis finally giving me hope that theShrekfranchise may not be dead yet. The film opens with one of the most thrilling action set pieces I've seen in an animated film all year (and probably the most thrilling one, since I won't watch another animated film before the end of the year), impeccably scored by Heitor Perreira as our titular character (Antonio Banderas) sings 'Who is our favorite fearless hero?' as he battles a giant. I was locked into the movie, and there was no going back."[78]Emma Stefansky ofIndieWirealso gave a positive review, enjoying the fact that the film "has no qualms about testing the expectations of its young audience while delivering a freewheeling tale about appreciating the nine lives we already have."[79]Frank ScheckofThe Hollywood Reportergave the film a positive review, finding the film "darker in tone but still extremely funny", even though it "falters when resorting to the frenetic action sequences seemingly designed for tykes' short attention spans." He also praised Banderas's and the supporting cast's voice work, claiming that "Too often, animated films feature supremely overpaid and overqualified voice casts whom children, and most adults, couldn't care less about. Banderas, on the other hand, is worth every penny."[11]William Bibbiani ofTheWrapgave the film a mixed review, summarizing that "there are comic moments that land, and action set pieces that pop, but the overwhelming sensation here is a meditation on the inevitability of death."[80]
In December 2024,Colliderranked the film at number 3 on its list of the "10 Best Fantasy Movies of the 2020s," with Robert Lee III writing "Easily one of the most acclaimed and exceptional movies to come from DreamWorks Animation in years,Puss in Boots: The Last Wishrevitalized the long-since dormantShrekfranchise as if it had never left."[81]

Rita Kemply ofThe Washington Postdescribed Banderas' performance as "warm" and described the film as a "glossy delight."[8]The recognition Banderas gained for his role increased years later, when he starred in Almodóvar's controversialTie Me Up!

Banderas then broke through to mainstream American audiences in the 1993Jonathan DemmefilmPhiladelphiaas the life partner of lawyerTom HanksandDenzel Washington.  Also in 1993, he acted in theBille August-directedThe House of the Spirits,an adaptation of theIsabel Allendenovel of the same name.

He portrayed Gregorio Cortez, a retired OSS agent, alongsideCarla Gugino, who played his wife, Ingrid Cortez.Roger Ebertpraised the first film, describing it as "giddy with the joy of its invention. It's an exuberant, colorful extravaganza, wall-to-wall with wildly original sets and visual gimmicks, and smart enough to escape the kids film category and play in the mainstream."[25]He also starred inMichael Cristofer'sOriginal SinalongsideAngelina Joliethe same year.

Everything in the telepic, though, is designed to make Villa a likable force, which pushes and pulls Banderas in a number of directions, only some of which play well. Eventually, 'Villa' exposes a dark side in the man, and Banderas forsakes crafting the image of a hero to allow the man’s ambiguity to shine."[33]Banderas was nominated for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movieand theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Filmfor his performance.[34]

Banderas once described himself as anagnosticin an interview withPeoplemagazine in 2006: "I have to recognize that I am agnostic. I don’t believe in any kind of fundamentalism. I prefer to take life in a different way, with a sense of humor. I try to teach my kids to be open. Whatever they believe is fine with me."[70]He does describe himself close toCatholicspirituality, especially toHoly Week, which he considers a "metaphor for life".[71]He is an officer (mayordomo de trono) of a religious brotherhood in his hometown ofMálagaand travels during Holy Week to take part in theprocessions.[72]Banderas developed his relationship with Catholicism back in 1994 after a spiritual search.[73][74]
"There was a moment in my life in which I separated a bit from the Church. I was searching for a spiritual connection in other places, until in 1994, after my brother had a surgery we were very afraid of, in which we could lose him, I realized I should have not searched for so much, that I had had always that connection with the trascendental in front of my face. It also happened in a way which followed our own traditions, which we shouldn't look for inthe Buddha, as these characters were right there. In my own neighborhood was that way to connect myself to the trascendental through thePassion of the Christ, until concluding inResurrection."
In 2021, he described his religious beliefs and vision of the Holy Week toEl País:[75]
"I live comfortably in the mystery, I'm very doubting, I don't know if agnostic is exactly the word. But I think yes, there is something, although we don't know what is it. TheBig Bang, yes, and before the Big Bang, what? Holy Week has many colors, it's a very strange poliedrum. It is related to faith, popular religion and Andalusian idiosyncrasy. It's just the RomanIdes of March: winter dies and spring is born. The Andalusian version is so colourful and merry because everybody knows the guy will resurrect on Sunday. And there is a happy ending."
Banderas marriedAna Leza[es]in 1987 and divorced her in 1996. He met and began a relationship with American actressMelanie Griffithin 1995 while shootingTwo Much.[6][76]They married on May 14, 1996, in London.

Following that incident, he underwent heart surgery to insert three stents into his arteries.[85]In aFresh Airinterview in September 2019, he recalled it as being life-changing. He said, "It just gave me a perspective of who I was, and it just made the important things [go to] the surface. When I say this, people may just think that I'm crazy, but it's one of the best things that ever happened in my life."[86]
He has invested some of his film earnings inAndalusianproducts, which he promotes in Spain and the US. He owns 50% of a winery inVillalba de Duero, Burgos, Spain, called Anta Banderas, which produces red and rosé wines.[87]

Raymond Andrew Winstone(/ˈwɪnstən/; born 19 February 1957)[2]is an English television, stage, and film actor with a career spanning five decades. Having worked with many prominent directors, includingMartin ScorseseandSteven Spielberg, Winstone is perhaps best known for his "hard man" roles, usually delivered in his distinctive London accent. The first of these wasThat Summer!(1979), for which he received a nomination for theBAFTA Award for Best Newcomer. He rose to prominence starring asWill Scarletin the seriesRobin of Sherwoodfrom 1984 to 1986.
Winstone received aBAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Rolenomination for his performance inNil by Mouth(1997). He also starred in the British independent filmsScum(1979),Quadrophenia(1979),The War Zone(1999),Last Orders(2001), andSex & Drugs & Rock & Roll(2010). Winstone's other notable films includeSexy Beast(2000),Ripley's Game(2002),Cold Mountain(2003),King Arthur(2004),The Departed(2006),Beowulf(2007),Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull(2008),Hugo(2011),Snow White and the Huntsman(2012),Black Widow(2021), andDamsel(2024).
Winstone was born on 19 February 1957 inHackney Hospital, London.[2]He first lived in Caistor Park Road,StratfordE15,[3]and attended Portway infants and junior school. He moved toEnfieldwhen he was seven.[2]His mother, Margaret (née Richardson; 1932–1985) had a job emptyingfruit machines, and his father, Raymond J. Winstone (1933–2015), ran a fruit-and-vegetable business.[4][2]
Winstone has recounted how, as a child, he used to play with his friends on bomb sites (empty plots of land with rubble fromSecond World Warbombs).[3]He joinedBrimsdown Primary Schooland in 1968, enrolled toEdmonton County School,[5]which had changed from agrammar schoolto acomprehensiveupon his arrival.[5]He also attendedCorona Theatre School.[2]He did not take to school, eventually leaving with a singleCSE(grade 2) in drama.[6]
He recounted an early encounter with a notorious gangster:
"I was still a baby the dayRonnie Kraycame round to see Dad, but I've been told this story so many times I can see it unfolding in my mind. Everyone was on their best behaviour, but then Ronnie picked me up, and by all accounts I pissed all over him. He had a new mac on, which had probably cost a few bob, and I absolutely covered it. The room fell silent, then Ronnie cracked up, so everyone knew it was safe to join in."[3]
Winstone had an early affinity for acting; his father would take him to the cinema every Wednesday afternoon. Later, he viewedAlbert FinneyinSaturday Night and Sunday Morning, and said: "I thought, 'I could be that geezer'." His other major influences includedJohn Wayne,James Cagney, andEdward G. Robinson. After borrowing extra tuition money from a friend's mother, a drama teacher, Winstone took to the stage, appearing as aCockneynewspaper seller in a production ofEmil and the Detectives.
Winstone was also aboxer.[7]Known to his friends as Winnie, he was called Little Sugs at home (his father already being known as Sugar, afterSugar Ray Robinson). At the age of 12, Winstone joined theRepton Amateur Boxing Club.[2]Over the next 10 years, he won 80 out of 88 bouts.[7]He was London schoolboy champion atwelterweighton three occasions,[7]and fought twice for England.[7]The experience gave him a perspective on his later career: "If you can get in a ring with 2,000 people watching and be smacked around by another guy, then walking onstage isn't hard."[7]
Deciding to pursue drama, Winstone enrolled at theCorona Stage AcademyinHammersmith, when he was aged "about 17".[6][8][3]At£900 a term, it was expensive considering the average wage was then about £36 a week.
Winstone was not popular with the establishment at his secondary school, who considered him a bad influence. When he discovered that he was the only pupil not invited to the Christmas party, he decided to take revenge for this slight. Hammering some pins through a piece of wood, he placed it under the wheel of his headmistress's car and blew out the tyre, for which he was expelled.[6]As a joke, he went up to theBBC, where his schoolmates were involved in an audition, and got one of his own by flirting with the secretary.[2]The audition was for one of the most notorious plays in history –Alan Clarke'sScum– and, because Clarke liked Winstone's cocky, aggressive boxer's walk,[2]he got the part, though it had been written for aGlaswegian.[6]
The play, written byRoy Mintonand directed by Clarke, was a brutal depiction of a young offender's institution. Winstone was cast in the leading role of Carlin, a young offender who struggles against both his captors and his fellow cons to become the "Daddy" of the institution. Hard hitting and often violent (particularly during the infamous "billiards" scene in which Carlin uses two billiard balls stuffed in a sock to beat one of his fellow inmates over the head), the play was judged unsuitable for broadcast by the BBC, and was not shown until 1991. The banned television play was entirely refilmed in 1979 for cinematic release with many of the original actors playing the same roles, including Winstone. In a commentary for theScumDVD, Winstone cites Clarke as a major influence on his career and laments the director's death in 1990 from cancer.[9]
While Winstone has portrayed many characters who share the "hard man" nature of his performance inScum, he has also explored a variety of other roles, including comedy (Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence) and as the romantic lead (Fanny and Elvis). His favourite role wasHenry VIIIin the2003 TV serial of the same name, remarking at the time: "It's really flattering for me to be asked to play a king. I mean, I'm a kid out ofPlaistow, and I'm playing one of the most famous kings of England. It's fantastic!"[10]
In 1975, Winstone landed his first professional role inWhat a Crazy Worldat theTheatre Royal,Stratfordin London.[11]One of his first TV appearances came in the 1976 "Loving Arms" episode of the popular police seriesThe Sweeney,[12]where he was credited as "Raymond Winstone" (as he was inWhat a Crazy World[11]) and played a minor part as an unnamed young thug. After a short run in the TV seriesFox(1980), and a role inLadies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains(1982),[12]alongsideDiane LaneandLaura Dern. He starred in the opening episode of the third season ofBergerac(1983), asWill ScarletinRobin of Sherwood.[6]He again teamed up withJason Conneryin a film which also featuredAmanda DonohoeandMaria Whittaker, inTank Malling(1984).[12]

During this period, he was increasingly drawn to the theatre, playing inHinkemannin 1988,Some Voicesin 1994, andDealer's ChoiceandPale Horsethe following year. Ray also added his London accent to a dance track in 1982 by Marsha Raven called "I Like Plastic".
Winstone was asked to appear inMr Thomas,[6]a play written by his friend and fellow LondonerKathy Burke. The reviews were good, and led to Winstone being cast, alongside Burke, inGary Oldman's dramaNil By Mouth(1997).[12]He was widely lauded for his performance as an alcoholicwife-batterer, receiving aBAFTAnomination (17 years after his Best Newcomer award forThat Summer).[12]He continued to play "tough guy" roles inFaceandThe War Zone– the latter especially controversial, as he played a man who rapes his own daughter – but that obvious toughness also allowed him to play loved-up nice-guys in romantic comediesFanny and ElvisandThere's Only One Jimmy Grimble. InLast Christmas, he played a dead man, now a trainee angel, who returns from heaven to help his young son cope with his bereavement which was written byTony Grounds. In 1995, he played the sinister and mysterious Thane in the comedy drama seriesThe Ghostbusters of East Finchley. The series was also written by Grounds, with whom Winstone worked again onBirths, Marriages & DeathsandOur Boy, the latter winning him theRoyal Television SocietyBest Actor Award. They worked together again in 2006 onAll in the Gamewhere Winstone portrayed afootballmanager.

Wagner Maniçoba de Moura(Portuguese pronunciation:[ˈvaɡneʁmɐ̃niˈsɔbɐdʒiˈmowɾɐ]; born 27 June 1976) is a Brazilian actor, voice-actor and filmmaker. Among his accolades, he has aGolden Globenomination for playingPablo EscobarinNarcosand anAnnie Awardnomination for his voice-acting performance inPuss in Boots: The Last Wish.
He has starred in multiple feature films inBrazilandHollywood, including box office hits likeElite Squad,which won theGolden Bearat the58th Berlin Internacional Film Festival.Elite Squadoverseas success boosted Moura’s international recognition. In 2013 he debuts in Hollywood with the science fiction feature filmElysium, oppositeMatt DamonandJodie Foster.[1][2]In 2015, he went on to star in the seriesNarcos, playing drug traffickerPablo Escobar, a role for which he was nominated for several awards, including theGolden Globe. Later, Moura returned as director for two episodes ofNarcos: Mexico.
Besides being a well-established and acclaimed actor in Brazil, Moura has achieved international success as a part of the movement that seeks positive representation forSouth Americansin Hollywood.[3]In 2021, he made his debut as a movie director and screenwriter withMarighella, a biopic aboutCarlos Marighella, which hit cinemas after a well-received debut at theBerlin Film Festivalin 2019. The movie won several awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay for Moura in different ceremonies.
Moura was born inSalvadorand raised inRodelas, 540 kilometres (340 mi) from the capital. José Moura, his father, was in the military, so the family, still consisting of his mother, Alderiva, and his younger sister Lediane — who works as a pediatrician — became used to moving around. His relationship with acting started thanks to a schoolmate who had a passion for the arts. His colleague did theater, and Moura wanted to follow the same steps to try to find a class where he would fit in.[4]
He became best friends with Emmy nominee actorLázaro Ramosduring their teenage years inBahia. Ramos reported that his friend was a great supporter of his career since youth.[5]
Moura took acting classes in his teens, and started working in professional theater in 1996. Later, he graduated in journalism at theFederal University of Bahia. He had a small PR company that worked for other local actors and theater companies but the business soon went bankrupt. In the early 2000s, he was a reporter for an interview program onTV Bahia– an affiliate ofRede Globo– and covered high society parties talking to businessmen and celebrities.[6]
During this time Moura continued going to auditions because he aspired to become an actor. He found some success with the playA Máquina. Receiving critical and public acclaim, the show left Bahia and went on the road to Pernambuco, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro where it continued to succeed. The hit boosted the careers of Moura and his colleagues, now-successful Brazilian actorsLázaro RamosandVladimir Brichta.
In cinema, he started with the shortsPop Killer, by Victor Mascarenhas, andRádio Gogó, by José Araripe Jr. His first feature wasWoman on Top, by the Venezuelan directorFina Torres, in which he had a small participation with Ramos, whom he helped with the tests in English, since Ramos did not speak the language.
With the resumption of Brazilian cinema opening up to new faces, he got roles in several productions with important names, such asBehind the Sun, byWalter Salles;The Three Marias, byAluizio Abranches;God Is Brazilian, byCacá Diegues;Nina, byHeitor Dhalia;The Man of the Year, by José Henrique Fonseca;The Middle of the World, by Vicente Amorim. In Recife, during the filming ofGod Is Brazilian, Moura was reading the bookCarandiru StationbyDrauzio Varellawhen he found out about the auditions for the filmCarandiru. Because he was busy with the recordings and unable to appear in the face-to-face auditions in another state, he asked the person in charge of the making of to help him record a tape that would be sent to the production. The material was very dark, and it was only possible to hear the actor reading excerpts from the book. Some time laterHéctor Babencowould call him for a meeting in São Paulo, curious to meet the owner of the voice. The actor ended up joining the cast as the prisoner, dealer and drug addict Zico.[7][8]
He debuted on television after famous Brazilian actor and Mouras's costar inGod Is Brazilian,Antônio Fagundesinvited him for a small role in the popular seriesCarga PesadaonRede Globo. Then came the seriesSexo Frágil, which entered the network's Friday night schedule after its success as a sketch on the TV showFantástico.
The playDilúvio em Tempos de Secawas shown in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and ended its season at the Curitiba Theater Festival atTeatro Guaírafor an audience of more than four thousand people in the two days it was presented. With the end of the work, the actor would turn to television and cinema.
He debuted in telenovelas atA Lua Me DissebyMiguel Falabella, starring heartthrob Gustavo, a contrast to the other characters he had played before.[9]He then amended the telenovela with the limited seriesJK, the biography of the Brazil's former presidentJuscelino Kubitschek, playing the title character in his youth.[10]
In 2007, he was scheduled to play businessman Olavo Novaes, villain of the telenovelaParaíso Tropical, wrote by prestigious Brazilian screenwritersGilberto Bragaand Ricardo Linhares.[11]Braga initially thought about havingSelton Melloon the role, who turned it down due to scheduling conflicts, and director Dennis Carvalho, who had worked with Moura onJK, nominated him for the role. Olavo and his lover, prostitute Bebel, played byCamila Pitanga, became the biggest highlights of the show.[12]It was the duo of actors' idea to intensify the affection relationship between two characters, as it seemed interesting for the plot.[13]The result was a popular appeal for the villains to become officially a couple and have more screen time together, which happened. Both Moura and Pitanga were acclaimed and highly awarded for their roles.
At the same time, the filmElite Squad, in which he played the role of police officer Captain Nascimento, began to have wide repercussions. The film initially would have the aspiring Mathias as the protagonist of the film, but during editing it was realized that showing Nascimento's point of view would set the tone and energy that the production was looking for. From there, the synopsis was changed, the production was reassembled and Moura had to hastily record the narration. The film broke all box office records, won awards in Brazil and Europe, including theBerlin'sGolden Bear, and generated controversy and debates about piracy, police harassment and urban violence.[14]
With both works, he became one of the most popular actors in his country, immensely recognized by the public and critics as one of the great names of his generation of actors and chosen byVogue Brazilas "Man of the Year" in 2007.[15]
In 2008, after the end of the telenovela, he returned to the theater after years without stepping on stage, with the playHamletbyWilliam Shakespeare- which in the words of the actor, was an old dream for being his favorite play since adolescence - in the role of protagonist and producer. The theatrical process was recorded by his wife, Sandra, and became a documentary.Hamletwas also a success with the public and acclaimed by the specialized press.[16]
He was in three more short films:Desejo,Ópera do MallandroandBlackout, awarded at theFestival de Gramado; in the filmsÓ Paí, Ó,Saneamento Básico,A MáquinaandRomance. In addition, he resumed the band he formed in 1992 with friends, Sua Mãe, performed on some TV programs and released a CD.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
