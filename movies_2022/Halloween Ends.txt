Halloween Endsis a 2022 Americanslasher filmdirected byDavid Gordon Green, and co-written by Green,Danny McBride, Paul Brad Logan, and Chris Bernier. It is the sequel toHalloween Kills(2021), the thirteenth installment in theHalloweenfranchise, and the final film in the trilogy of sequels that started with the2018 film, which directly follows the1978 film. The film starsJamie Lee Curtis,Andi Matichak,Rohan Campbell,Will Patton,Kyle Richards, andJames Jude Courtney. The plot follows the outcast Corey Cunningham who falls in love withLaurie Strode's granddaughter while a series of events, including crossing paths withMichael Myers, drives him to become a serial killer.
Before the release ofHalloweenin 2018, McBride confirmed that he and Green had intended to pitch two films that would be shotback-to-back, but decided against it, waiting to see the reaction to the first film. Following the success of the first film, in July 2019 the film's title was announced along withHalloween Kills. Green intended to give each film in the trilogy its own unique theme,Halloween Endsbeing a "love story";John Carpenterdescribed the film as a "departure" from its predecessors in the trilogy. After being delayed due to the ongoingCOVID-19 pandemic, principal photography took place inGeorgiabetween January and March 2022, with re-shoots taking place in mid-2022.
Halloween Endspremiered atBeyond Festin Los Angeles on October 11, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 14, 2022, byUniversal Pictures; the film also started streaming simultaneously on paid tiers ofPeacock. It received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized its focus on the new character[5]and generally deemed it a disappointing conclusion to the trilogy.[6]The film grossed $105 million against a $33 million production budget, making it the lowest-grossing of the trilogy of films by Green but the third highest grossing film in the franchise.[7]Despite the mixed reception, the film ranked #2 onThe Hollywood Reporter's list of "The Best Slasher Movies of the Decade".[8]
OnHalloweennight in 2019, 21-year-old Corey Cunningham babysits a young boy named Jeremy Allen, who pulls a prank on him by locking him inside the attic. Just as Jeremy's parents come home, Corey kicks the door open and accidentally knocks Jeremy over a staircase railing to his death. Corey is arrested foraggravatedmanslaughterbut is cleared by the judge. Nonetheless, the citizens of Haddonfield make Corey a pariah.
Three years later, the town of Haddonfield,Illinois, is still reeling from the aftermath ofMichael Myers's latest killing spree in 2018,[a]while Michael has vanished.Laurie Strodeis writing a memoir and living with her granddaughter Allyson. Meanwhile, Corey is working at his stepfather's salvage yard. On his way home one day, he is accosted by high school bullies and injures himself in the process. An observing Laurie brings him to the doctor's office where Allyson works. Allyson and Corey develop a relationship and later attend a Halloween party, where Corey is confronted by Mrs. Allen. Corey leaves the party and runs into the bullies who throw him off a bridge. Unconscious, he is dragged into the sewers and later choked by Michael who eventually lets him go. As he crawls out, Corey is threatened by a homeless man. In a struggle, Corey stabs the man to death and flees.
At a dinner date, Allyson’s ex-boyfriend harasses her, leading to Corey later luring him into the sewer to be killed by Michael. Allyson is passed over for a promotion at work, in favor of a nurse who is having an affair with the doctor. Later that night, Corey kills the doctor at his home while Michael kills the nurse. An unknowing Allyson plans to leave Haddonfield with an insistent Corey because of the past trauma, while Laurie realizes Corey is infected by Michael's evil; their different mindsets causes their relationship to fracture. Laurie finds Corey sleeping in the spot where Jeremy died, and offers to help him on the condition that he distance himself from Allyson. Corey retorts by blaming her for the events that have occurred in Haddonfield and says if he cannot have Allyson, no one will.
Corey returns to the sewers where he successfully fights Michael for his mask and embarks on a rampage, murdering the bullies after luring them to the salvage yard, one of whom accidentally kills Corey's stepfather. He goes on to kill his mother, a DJ at a local radio station, who had taunted him earlier, and presumably the radio station's assistant. At the Strode house, Laurie fakes a suicide attempt to lure Corey to her, whom she shoots down the stairs. Corey then stabs himself in the neck to frame Laurie for his death in front of the arriving Allyson, who leaves in distress. Michael suddenly arrives, retrieves his mask, and kills Corey. A fight ensues in Laurie's kitchen, and Laurie manages to pin Michael to the kitchen table and slit his throat. After a struggle, Allyson, convinced of the truth behind Corey's death after receiving a call from Deputy Frank Hawkins, returns to help Laurie subdue and finally kill Michael by slicing his wrist.
Laurie and Allyson take Michael's body to the salvage yard by police escort, attracting the residents of Haddonfield, who follow them in a procession, and dispose of it in anindustrial shredder. In the ensuing days, Allyson and Laurie reconcile, and Allyson leaves Haddonfield while Laurie finishes her memoir and rediscovers her romance with Hawkins.

"I knew I wanted to be very romantic, and I knew I wanted to put my heart on my sleeve and make a movie about bad boys and motorcycles and leather jackets and that kind of thing."
In June 2018,Danny McBrideconfirmed that he andDavid Gordon Greenhad originally intended topitchtwoHalloweenfilms that would be shot back-to-back, and then decided against it, waiting to see the reaction to their firstHalloweenfilm (2018).[14]In September, producerJason Blumsaid that "we will do a sequel if the movie performs".[15]A month later, after the new filmHalloween's opening weekend, McBride confirmed that early development on a sequel had begun.[16]Green, McBride and Jeff Fradley had planned out a two-film story arc, but opted for a trilogy after realizing they had more material than originally thought.[17]As soon asHalloweenwas released in theaters, McBride and Green started devising the story for two sequels alongside other writers such asScott Teems, Chris Bernier and Paul Brad Logan for each individual sequel, with both sequels being written simultaneously by different writing teams, with Green and McBride mainly writing them and then bringing other writers to "curate" their "crazy" brains and give focus to the story.[18]In July 2019,Bloody Disgustingreported that a third film was also in development, with Green returning as director. The site also claimed that the studio was considering releasing both films in October 2020.[19]
In July 2019, Universal Pictures revealed the titles and release dates of the two sequels, withHalloween Kills(2021) andHalloween Endsset to be released in 2020 and 2021, respectively.[20]Green was officially announced to direct both films and co-write the scripts with McBride, Teems was confirmed as a co-writer forHalloween Kills, while Logan and Bernier were announced as co-writers ofHalloween Ends.[21]Blum, Malek Akkad andBill Blockwere slated to produce the film whileJohn Carpenter, Curtis, Green and McBride were attached as executive producers once again.[22]The writing team, consisting of Green, McBride, Bernier and Logan, started workshopping ideas before production ofHalloween Killscommenced, completing a first draft in 2019. The final script was completed in 2021 pending Carpenter's approval.[23]Due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, Universal delayed the release dates of bothKillsandEndsby a year.[24][25]
Green set out to make each sequel different. For the second film, he wanted anaction filmand for the finale alove story.[13]Green intended to further explore what can make a person turn into apsychopaththrough Corey Cunningham's character;[26]Green conceived Corey in order to explore and get a perspective of howMichael MyersandLaurie Strodeaffected the town of Haddonfield, with Corey devised as someone traumatized like Strode that encounters an evil stalker like Myers that ends up "infecting" him into turning evil and let spread his unchecked negative inner entities instead of "wrapping them around their heads, be their own heroes and thus get a chance to fight them".[27]Benefitting from acharacter arcclosely similar to that ofKeith Gordon's Arnie Cunningham from Carpenter'sChristine(1983), Corey was overall created to mimic how neglected community members can unexpectedly turn to evil. The role was also inspired by real-life perpetrators ofschool shootings;[26][28]Corey's inclusion allowed Green to orchestrate very different "kills" to those Myers committed in the previous two films, as Corey wants to emulate Myers' violent acts but is somewhat "messy" with his kills, not killing people "well" like Myers does.[27]McBride liked Green's idea of focusing on Corey and considered his pitch a "smart take" because it would enable them to avoid a repetitive plot and explore something different as long as they tied that to the core themes of theHalloweenfranchise.[29]Carpenter gave Green and McBride his approval for Corey when he was informed he would be one of the film's protagonists, congratulating them for not rehashing the same plotline in every film, which Carpenter himself struggled to do when writingHalloween II(1981).[26]
In October 2021, Green revealed thatHalloween Endswill take place four years after the events ofHalloween Killsand would incorporate elements of the pandemic into the story.[30][31]In an interview, Logan extinguished internet rumors that the film was supposed to take place on the same night of the previous installments.[32]Curtis claimed the film will be "shocking" and will "make people very angry".[33]Akkad statedEndswill be more "contained" thanKills, while Green called it an intimatecoming-of-age story, much like Carpenter'sChristine.[34][35]Other cited influences on the film wereWillard(1971),Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker(1981),My Bodyguard(1980),Blood Rage,Bad Taste(both 1987) andFallen Angels(1995); the latter two specifically inspiring the motorcycle bonding scene between Allyson Nelson and Corey Cunningham withWong Kar-wai's "coolness" and the celebratoryMy Bodyguardmoment. Most of the films were generally movies Green wasn't allowed to see as a child back in the 1980s, hence why he went to a friend's house to watch them in aVHSformat.[36][26][28][27]
According to Green, several different endings were considered for the film; Green ultimately chose a more "satisfactory, optimistic, hopeful" conclusion afterKills's "bleak" ending, compensating for the traumatic events that Laurie Strode lived through in the film and its predecessors.[18]The first planned, darker ending had Laurie Strode committingsuicideat the end of the film, but according to Green, the "moment in which Laurie put a gun to her mouth" was the one where he, Brad Logan, Bernier and McBride had to make the decision and starting coming up with differentChoose Your Own Adventure-type alternatives. Another darker ending the writers considered had Corey Cunningham not only surviving the film's events and getting away with his murders, but also convincing Allyson to join him and the two running off to "hit the road" in aNatural Born Killers(1994)-style ending. Other versions had Corey realizing the error of his ways and "stepping back" after having had a taste of committing murder or Corey becoming Michael Myers' successor in case the filmmakers wished to keep making moreHalloweenfilms after Green's departure from the series.[37]From all the endings they tested and scenes they removed for the film's finale, McBride felt that the one ultimately used was the most anticipated.[29]
In July 2019, along with the announcements of two sequels to 2018'sHalloween, it was announced thatJamie Lee Curtiswould reprise her role as Laurie Strode in bothHalloween KillsandHalloween Ends.[21]Curtis was paid $3.5 million for her involvement.[38]Judy GreerandAndi Matichakwere confirmed to reprise their roles as Karen and Allyson Nelson that same month, though, Greer was not included inEndsas her character Karen was killed during the climax ofKills.[39]In December 2021, it was revealed thatKyle Richardswould be reprising her role for the film. Initially, the character was not expected to return for the film, but following the positive reception to Richards's performance, the script was rewritten to give her an expanded role.[40]The following month,Michael O'Learyjoined the cast.[11]
Upon being cast around 2018 or 2019, aside from being unaware he had been auditioning for aHalloweenfilm,Rohan Campbellwas initially unaware of his character's significance to the story, expecting him to die early on due to his role as a babysitter in the film's opening. To help shape his performance, Campbell was asked by Green to watch horror films about outcasts.[28]Upon meeting with Campbell, Green "fell in love" with what they could do to Corey and it partly led him to change the original ending he envisioned for the character to not leave his fate open-ended.[37]Campbell was one of the hundreds of actors who auditioned for Corey Cunningham, but Green and hisassistant directorchose him due to having a neutral "tough but sensitive" face, a neutral "handsomeness" and a look of having "life and emotion" plus his physicality, which later led Green to convince himself that Campbell could accurately portray Corey as a motorcycle rider instead of just acting like he knew due to his experiences, partially embodying the 1980s leather jacketbad boy.[27]Green worked to keep the actor out of the press leading up to the film's release.[28]According to Campbell, both Green and Curtis warned him about potential backlash regarding the introduction of his character.[41]
A casting call took place in late January and February 2022 in numerous Southeast Georgia towns.[42][43]In an interview withCollider, Green hinted that co-writer Danny McBride had requested acameo appearancein the film, potentially as a character who fights Myers.[44]In June 2022,Nick Castleannounced that he would make a cameo appearance unrelated to the role of Michael Myers.[45][46]Following the release of the teaser trailer in July 2022,Omar Dorsey,Will Patton, andJames Jude Courtneywere revealed to reprise their roles from the previous films.[47]Green cited Courtney's "extraordinary work" in the previous films as the reason for his decision to have him portray Michael Myers for the entirety of the film.[10]
It was originally planned to filmHalloween KillsandHalloween Endsback-to-back, but did not occur due to the "intense schedule".[48]In March 2020, Blum confirmed filming would take place during the summer.[49]Filming was quietly delayed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic. Production was expected to take place in 2021 inWilmington, North Carolina.[50]In August 2021, Courtney confirmed that filming would begin on January 10, 2022.[51]However, filming officially began on January 19, 2022, inSavannah, Georgiaunder the working titleCave Dweller.[52][53]Michael Simmonds once again served as director of photography.[54]Curtis began filming her scenes on January 25 and wrapped on February 22.[55][56][57]Campbell insisted on filming himself the scene in which Corey kills one of his bullies instead of requiring astuntman's assistance.[28]Green allowed his actors toimproviseto infuse humor within the film's tone.[26]The last showdown between the franchise's main characters was assembled and reassembled throughout filming, having been written "spectacularly" since the film's first draft, forcing the stunt team to try new things occasionally and creating severalcontinuity errorsin the process due to returning with new additions to the filming set multiple times.[18]Additional scenes were shot inSylvania, Georgia.[58]Filming concluded on March 9, 2022.[59][60]
In June 2022, two weeks ofre-shootstook place in Savannah.[61]However, these re-shoots only lasted four days and were completed that same month.[62][63]As with most of his films since his very first assembly, Green test screenedEndsto see if it engaged audiences or not. After several test screenings, the original final confrontation between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers as well as the ending sequence were discarded, and re-shoots for new scenes took place, four months ahead of the film's premiere. The climatic procession sequence, when Michael Myers' corpse is paraded to all surviving Haddonfielders and disposed of inside anindustrial shredder, was a late addition to the film that was shot around August 2022 after Green and his crew concluded that they wished for "something more grand" for the film's ending. It was decided that the film's conclusion should be more "modest" and "intimate" with some story points as opposed to a brawl like the "super noisy and aggressive" ending ofKills, with Green wishing to return the series to its "simple dramatic roots".[18]
In June 2022, Blum confirmed that the film hadtest screenedinternally the month prior and that it would be the lastHalloweenfilm from Blumhouse.[64]The following month, Carpenter described the film as a "departure" from the previous entries in Green's trilogy.[65]In August, Castle had finishedADRfor Michael Myers.[66]By the end of the month, Green stated that the film was still being tweaked despite the film beingpicture locked.[67]According to cinematographer Michael Simmonds, a practical version of the opening titles sequence, showingjack-o'-lanternsemerging from within each other, was initially created by production designer Richard Wright, but later replaced by a digital version.[68]The film's opening features blue titles in reference toHalloween III: Season of the Witch(1982), the original second sequel to the 1978 film.[26]
The score forHalloween Endswas composed byJohn Carpenter, his sonCody Carpenter, andDaniel Davies,[69]who had previously collaborated on the first two films in the series. The official soundtrack was released digitally on October 14, 2022, bySacred Bones Records,[70]with a limitedvinylrelease set for January 20, 2023.[71]In anticipation of the film's premiere, two tracks were released in September 2022, "The Junk Yard" and "The Procession".[72][73]Recorded entirely at Carpenter and Davies's home studios,[74]the score incorporates themes from the original 1978 film and features original music from electronic music groupBoy Harsher.[70]
Halloween Endspremiered atGrauman's Chinese Theater, Los Angeles, as part ofBeyond Feston October 11, 2022. The premiere coincided with actressJamie Lee Curtis's induction ceremony at theHollywood Walk of Famein front of the theater the following day.[75]The film was released theatrically in the United States byUniversal Pictureson October 14, 2022,[25][76]playing in 3,901 theaters for a total theatrical run of approximately 3.8 weeks.[4]In addition, the film started streaming simultaneously on paid tiers ofPeacockfor 60 days.[77]It was initially set to be theatrically released on October 15, 2021, but it was delayed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[78][25]
Halloween Endswas released digitally on November 15, 2022, and was released onBlu-rayandDVDon December 27, 2022.[79]
According toSamba TV, the film was viewed by 920,000 households in its first week of streaming on the platform, down fromHalloween Kills's 1.7 million households.[80]The film received enough views in the week of October 10–16, 2022, however, to rank number eight overall and the top film for that week'sNielsen streaming rankings, making it the first program onPeacockto rank in the weekly Nielsen top 10.[81][contradictory]
Halloween Endsgrossed $64.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $41.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $105.4 million.[3][4]It was the lowest-grossing out of the trilogy ofHalloweenfilms directed by David Gordon Green, with approximately 6,085,457 tickets sold during its initial theatrical run compared to the 2018 film's 17,395,416 andKills'9,046,426.[80]
In the United States and Canada,Halloween Endswas projected to gross $50–60 million from 3,901 theaters in its opening weekend.[82]The film made $20.4 million on its first day, including $5.4 million from Thursday night previews, up 9% fromKills's $4.9 million the year prior.[83][failed verification]It went on to debut with $40.1 million, topping the box office but finishing below projections, blamed in part on the film's simultaneous release to streaming platform Peacock; Universal reported it was the most watched film or series ever on the platform over a two-day period.[84]The studio also reported that the film was most popular among audiences aged 18 to 34, with only 26% being 35 and older.[85]The film dropped by 80% in its second weekend, finishing fourth with $8 million.[86]The 88% drop from the film's first Friday to second was a "near-record" decrease and was credited to its day-and-date streaming release[87]and poor reception by critics and audiences.[88]
Onreview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 40% based on 266 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "Halloween Ends-- for now, anyway -- with a frequently befuddling installment that's stabbed, slashed, and beaten by a series of frustrating missed opportunities."[89]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[90]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest of Green's trilogy, while those surveyed byPostTrakgave it a 64% overall positive score, with an average 2.5 out of five stars.[84]
Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, writing that the "so-called finale of the Michael Myers saga is just stabbing, metaphors, stabbing, soap opera, stabbing, marching band bullies, stabbing and more stabbing".[91]Writing forVariety,Owen Gleibermansaid the film is "neither scary nor fun" and called it "the most joylessly metaphorical and convoluted entry" of the franchise to date.[92]Ben Travis ofEmpiregave a negative review, calling the film "lost up in its own abyss" and "an unsatisfying closing chapter" and criticizing Green's direction as "[struggling] to synthesise the serious stuff with the demands of a popcorn shocker".[93]
Multiple critics praised the opening sequence,[94][95][96]withUSA Today's Brian Truitt calling it "an unnerving, unexpected scene that revels in a sense of parental dread right from the get-go",[97]andThe Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney describing it as "an intriguing detour".[98]Writing forTexas Monthly, Sean O'Neal saidHalloween Endsis the most unique film out of Green's trilogy because it is the one that most resembles hisindependent films.[96]O'Neal wrote, "Strange as it may sound,Halloween Endscontains echoes of Green’s name-making debutGeorge Washington, another small-town tragedy that similarly spun out from the accidental death of a child. And its meditations on the inescapability of violence and the sins of abusive fathers give it a spiritual connection toJoe. The way Corey's bad reputation clouds his romance with Allyson, set up by a match-making Laurie, even recallsAll the Real Girlsin the film’s slow-burning opening stretch, during which Green seems content just to linger in his prairie gothic tale of grief and sublimated rage".[96]
K. Austin Collins ofRolling Stonegave a positive review in which he similarly deemedHalloween Endsthe best out of Green'sHalloweentrilogy, noting its "interestingly complex tangle of emotions and fears" and comparing it to Green's previous "capably observed" independent films.[99]The New York Timesreviewed the film as being "a movie that's less frantic and more intimate than its predecessor, one that unfolds with a mourning finality".[100]Time Outalso reviewed the film more positively than they didKills, giving it a 3-star review and calling it a "pleasant surprise".[101]While also considering it an improvement over its predecessor, Todd Gilchrist ofThe A.V. Clubcriticized the lack of focus on the series' main antagonist and ultimately labeled it "not particularly good" and an "unsatisfying close".[102]Kyle SmithofThe Wall Street Journalfound Curtis's performance "a pleasure to watch" and called the film "largely gripping".[103]Toronto Star's Peter Howell gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, describing it as "clever" and "likely to go down well with fans of the franchise" but noted that true finality is likely impossible for this series.[104]
In his review forThe Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called it "a sloppy movie whose principal new inspiration feels bogus", although "horror fans might enjoy homages to other films from the Carpenter canon".[98]Giving 1.5 out of 4 stars, Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comfound the film to be "poorly executed", rushed, and "barely a'Halloween'movie" due to the story's focus on newly introduced characters, and considered Rohan Campbell's performance especially lacking.[105]He concluded, "What's more likely true is that Green and his team had a truly ambitious film idea about the nature of evil and how violent loners can be created by fearful societies... but they also had to make a'Halloween'movie. It's the two concepts pushing and pulling against each other that tear this movie apart."[105]Conversely, Mike Stoklasa and Jay Bauman from the YouTube film review channelRed Letter Media, who both pannedHalloween Kills, praisedHalloween Endsfor its subversive storytelling and themes of evil affecting the characters of Haddonfield; Bauman went on to predict thatHalloween Endswould eventually gain a cult following in the same vein asHalloween III: Season of the Witch.[106]
Despite the mixed reception, the film ranked #2 onThe Hollywood Reporter's list of "The Best Slasher Movies of the Decade".[107]
John Carpenter explained that possible future installments were dependent on the commercial success ofEnds, although he acknowledged that Green was adamant inEndsbeing their story's ending.[110]In an interview withThe New York Times, Jamie Lee Curtis commented that the four films, commencing with the 1978Halloweenand concluding withHalloween Ends, were self-contained, although there was still the possibility of a new narrative being adapted into future films.[111]Green stated that he was confident on parting with Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie Strode with the film, though he acknowledged the possibility of eventually some filmmakers creating a "new Laurie" with someplot twistto continue the franchise's mythology.[18]Curtis had previously confirmed in an essay forPeoplethatHalloween Endsmarked her last appearance in the franchise;[112]Jude Courtney likewise affirmed toScreen Rantthat, alongside Curtis, he feels "done" with the franchise due to both his age and career trajectory, having feltHalloweenandKillsasplayoffsandEndsas aSuper Bowlwin so he decided to retire as the character triumphantly.[113]Jason Blum reiterated that, while it would not necessarily be the final film in the franchise, it will be the lastHalloweenmovie underBlumhouse Productions, with theintellectual propertyrights reverting to producer Malek Akkad following the release ofEnds.[114]

Miramax, LLC, formerly known asMiramax Films, is an American independentfilmandtelevision productionanddistributioncompany owned bybeIN Media GroupandParamount Global. Based inLos Angeles,California, it was founded on December 19, 1979, by brothersBobandHarvey Weinstein.
It was a leading producer and distributor of independent films until it was acquried byThe Walt Disney Companyon June 30, 1993. In 2010, Disney sold it toFilmyard Holdings, a joint venture ofColony NorthStar,Tutor-Saliba CorporationandQatar Investment Authority.[1][2]In March 2016, the company was sold to thebeIN Media Group, which later sold a 49% stake toParamount Global(previously known as ViacomCBS) on April 3, 2020.
Miramax was founded as Miramax Films by the Weinstein brothers, Bob and Harvey along with executive Corky Burger inBuffalo, New York, in 1979, and was named by combining the first names of their parents, Miriam and Max.[3]It was created to distributeindependent filmsdeemed commercially unfeasible by themajor studios.
The company's first major success came when the Weinsteins teamed up with British producerMartin Lewisand acquired the U.S. rights to two concert films Lewis had produced ofbenefit showsforhuman rightsorganizationAmnesty International. The Weinsteins worked with Lewis to distill the two films into one film for the American marketplace. The resulting film, the American version ofThe Secret Policeman's Other Ball, was a successful release for Miramax in the summer of 1982. This release presaged amodus operandithat the company would undertake later in the 1980s of acquiring films from international filmmakers and reworking them to suit American sensibilities and audiences. In its early years, Miramax Films had to focus primarily as a catalyst for music and decided to do a licensing agreement withThorn EMI Videoto release several of Miramax's early films.[4]
Among the company's other breakthrough films as distributors in the late 1980s and early 1990s werePulp Fiction,Scandal,Sex, Lies, and Videotape,Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!,The Crying Game,andClerks. The company also made films such asFlirting with Disaster,Heavenly Creatures, andShakespeare in Love.
Miramax Films acquired and/or produced many other films that did well financially. The company became one of the leaders of the independent film boom of the 1990s. Miramax Films produced or distributed seven films with box office grosses totaling more than $100 million; its highest grossing title,Chicago, earned more than $300 million worldwide.[5]
The company was also successful in securingAcademy Awardnominations for its releases, many of which resulted inOscarwins.
On June 30, 1993,The Walt Disney Companypurchased Miramax Films for $60 million and assumed all of the company's debt, which was more than $40 million. The acquisition gave Disney entry to the independent film market.[6]Harvey and Bob Weinstein continued to operate Miramax Films until they left the company on September 30, 2005. During their tenure, the Weinstein brothers ran Miramax Films independently of other Disney subsidiaries and, as a result, had more autonomy than the other Disney-owned companies. Disney, however, had the final say on what Miramax Films could release (for example, Disney had banned Miramax Films from releasingKids,DogmaandFahrenheit 9/11).[7]Disney'sBuena Vista Home Entertainmentdivision released Miramax output on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray Disc under the nameMiramax Home Entertainmentin some countries, including the United States; elsewhere, the overall distribution of Miramax Films' output was passed to the regional licensees of Miramax International, a distribution arm of Miramax Films that was fully autonomous from Disney's own distribution operations.
With a more stable budget, Miramax Films began moving beyond acquisitions and distribution and into film production. Until September 30, 2005, the company also operated the labelDimension Films, which was solely founded by Bob to specialize in teen, horror, and other genre films,[8]and created theScreamandScary Moviefilm franchises. Harvey funded larger projects from up-and-coming directors, includingRobert Rodriguez,Gus Van Sant, andQuentin Tarantino. Some of the films earned Oscars.[8]At times the studio tried to release a film almost weekly.[9]
In 1997, Miramax Films joinedPeter Jacksonas a primary financial backer in attempting to get theLord of the Ringsfilms produced. Disney disliked the cost of a two-parter, requesting that it be produced as a single film. Jackson andSaul Zaentzrejected Disney's request and looked for another studio or financier. Thus, Miramax Films sold the rights forThe Lord of the RingsandThe HobbittoNew Line Cinemain August 1998 for about $12 million, which ledThe Lord of the Ringsto be produced as a trilogy. Miramax Films retained a 5% stake in the films' gross and then gave 2.5% to the Weinsteins.[10]
Through Miramax Films, Harvey foundedTalkmagazine withTina Brownin 1998 (it shut down in 2002), albeit without the approval of then-Disney chiefMichael Eisner, which upset Eisner. Also that year, 30 former employees filed suit over unpaid overtime wages.[8]
By 2003, Miramax Films was less operative in the independent film market and became more of a mini-major as the company only acquired 3 films while producingCold Mountainfor $80 million. The Weinsteins claimed the company was profitable, but Walt Disney Company presidentRobert Igerindicated in June 2004 that they were not properly accounting for "account standard overhead, distribution fees, bonuses that we pay Harvey and Bob. Nor are they applying current accounting rules."[8]
After extensive negotiations and much media and industry speculation, on March 30, 2005, Disney and the Weinsteins announced that they would not renew their contractual relationship when their existing agreements expired at the end of September 2005. The primary source of dispute was over distribution ofFahrenheit 9/11by Michael Moore.[11]Disney's film studio consortium,Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, assumed control of Miramax Films, which was projected to have a smaller annual production budget. The Weinsteins started a new film production company calledThe Weinstein Company(TWC) and took theDimension Filmslabel with them. The Miramax Films name remained with the film studio owned by Disney. Production at Miramax Films was taken over byDaniel Battsek,[11]who had been head ofBuena Vista Internationalin theUK. Battsek refocused Miramax Films to produce films of high quality but low budget.Maple Picturesheld the rights to distribute Miramax films in Canada from 2008 up until August 10, 2011, when Maple Pictures was acquired byAlliance Films.[12]At the time, the company was criticized for delaying or withholding release of Asian films to which it acquired the U.S. distribution rights.[13]Previously, in 2003, the company was criticized for trying to bar retailers from legally exporting authentic DVDs of the films.[14]
On October 3, 2009, Disney announced that the staff of Miramax Films was to be reduced by 70%, and the number of releases would be reduced by half to just three films per year. The label's marketing, distribution, and administrative functions, which had operated independently, would be folded into the parent studio in Burbank. The move became effective in January 2010.[15]On October 30, 2009, Disney announced the resignation of Daniel Battsek as President of Miramax Films, effective when the transition from the studio in New York toBurbankwas completed.[16]The company merged its operations with The Walt Disney Studios on January 28, 2010, shutting down Miramax Films' separate New York and Los Angeles offices.[11][17]
Though Disney Studio ChairmanDick Cookwas a staunch supporter of Miramax Films, the brand was less of a priority for CEOBob Iger, whose strategy was to focus on Disney's branded mass entertainment that could be exploited across Disney's theme parks, television, and consumer products. Following Disney's $4 billion acquisition ofMarvel Entertainmentin 2009, Cook was succeeded byRich Ross.[18]As a result, Miramax Films was relegated to the status of distribution label within the Walt Disney Company.[19]The company confirmed that it was looking into selling the Miramax label on February 9, 2010, with Bob Iger explaining "We determined that continuing to invest in new Miramax movies wasn't necessarily a core strategy of ours".[20]
On December 3, 2010, Disney closed the sale of Miramax for US$663 million toFilmyard Holdings, an investment group and joint venture ofColony NorthStar,Tutor-Saliba Corporation, andQatar Investment Authority. The sale included 700 film titles, books, development projects, and the "Miramax" name.Mike Lang, the formerNews Corporationbusiness development executive who was selected as the CEO of Miramax,[21]indicated that the company would focus on their existing library, though they would continue making original content.[22][23]
After the sale was closed, some films already developed at Miramax, includingThe TempestandGnomeo & Juliet, were eventually released by Disney under itsTouchstone Picturesbanner, and theatrical distribution ofDon't Be Afraid of the Dark[24]andThe Debt[25]were shifted toFilmDistrictandFocus Featuresrespectively.
On December 16, 2013, Miramax entered into a deal with Harvey and Bob Weinstein'sThe Weinstein Companyto develop and distribute select derivative works of films from the former studio. Sequels, television series, or stage productions of titles such asRoundersandShakespeare in Lovewere among the projects said to be part of this agreement.[26][27][28]
On July 17, 2015, Qatar and Colony NorthStar put Miramax up for sale for an offer of $1 billion.[29][30][31]Harvey and Bob Weinstein had reportedly regained interest in reacquiring the studio via TWC in September.[32][33][34][35][36][37]On March 2, 2016, Miramax was sold tobeIN Media Group, a spinoff ofAl Jazeera Media Network(which formerly owned its namesakebeIN Sports).[38][39][40]
On a July 21, 2016, interview, Harvey Weinstein stated that he was still interested in combining TWC's film library with Miramax's, after the acquisition of the latter by beIN.[41]
After Miramax's founder Harvey Weinsteinwas accused of sexual assaultin October 2017, Miramax became one of 60 parties bidding on The Weinstein Company on January 16, 2018.[42]On April 27, Miramax and Lantern Capital emerged as the strongest contenders to acquire TWC's assets. Ultimately, it wasLanternthat acquired TWC's library.[43]
On June 7, 2019, beIN began the process of selling approximately 50% of Miramax in an effort to offer it for growth.[44]Lionsgate(which distributed Miramax's titles on home video),Spyglass Media Group(owners of the Weinstein Company library, inherited via their deal with Lantern) andViacom(Paramount's parent company whore-mergedwithCBS Corporationon December 4, 2019, to form ViacomCBS) were seen as the leading contenders to acquire a stake in the company.[45]By August 19, 2019, Lionsgate and Viacom were the only contenders, as Spyglass Media Group dropped out of contention.[46]On September 11, 2019, it was announced Lionsgate had dropped their bid, making Viacom the only bidder for the stake in Miramax.[47]On November 8, 2019, Viacom exited the negotiations to acquire them.[48]After merging with CBS Corporation to become ViacomCBS, the combined firm resumed talks with Miramax.[49]
On December 20, 2019, ViacomCBS (now known asParamount Global) announced it would acquire a 49% stake in Miramax for at least $375 million, withParamount Picturesgaining exclusive worldwide distribution rights to its film and television library. Paramount Pictures and Miramax will also co-produce new content based on titles from the library.[50]The deal officially closed on April 3, 2020.[51]
On June 24, 2020, Miramax and ViacomCBS announced their first co-production,The Turkish Detective, a television series based on theCetin Ikmennovels byBarbara Nadel.[52]
On October 2, 2023, it was announced that CEO Bill Block would be leaving the company that week following the end of his contract with them, starting his own production company, BlockFilm, later that month.[53][54]In January 2024,Jonathan Glickmanwas reported to be in talks to join Miramax as CEO, with his company Panoramic Media expected to be acquired by Miramax if talks were successful.[55]On April 2, 2024, Glickman was officially named Miramax's new CEO effective immediately. As part of the deal, Miramax also acquired certain film and TV projects from Glickman's company Panoramic Media.[56]

He also played Der Kindestod in theBuffy the Vampire Slayerepisode "Killed by Death".
Courtney was born on January 31, 1957,[1]inGarfield Heights, Ohio, and raised inColumbia, South Carolina, as the eldest of seven brothers.[2]From an early age, Courtney was determined to become an actor and made short films from fifth grade through college. He majored injournalismat theUniversity of South Carolinain 1981 and subsequently moved to California to pursue acting.[3]
He started working atUniversal Studios Hollywoodas a tour guide before he was cast asConanin the park'sConan the Barbarianlive show. Courtney applied hismartial artsskills to the role, which demanded high falls and sword fights; he sustained multiple injuries during performances.[4]At Universal Studios, Courtney met actorBrian Thompsonand stunt coordinator Alex Daniels, who helped him to branch out as astunt performer.[5]He also pursued acting studies at theRoyal Academy of Dramatic Artand was coached byStella Adler.[5][6]
Courtney made his film acting debut in 1989 inThe Freeway Maniacand continued acting through 2002. In 1997, he gained wider recognition in the role Der Kindestod in theBuffy the Vampire Slayerepisode "Killed by Death".[7][8][9]
Courtney playedMichael MyersinDavid Gordon Green's horror filmHalloween, the 2018 sequel toJohn Carpenter's1978 film of the same name.[5][10][11]Green asked the film's stunt coordinator Ron Hutchinson whether he knew an experienced stunt actor that was "6-feet-3, 200 pounds, and in his 60s," upon which Hutchinson recommended Courtney.[12]Green explained to Courtney his vision for Myers's mannerisms, an amalgamation of the performance ofNick Castle, who originally played the character in 1978, and the addition of a feline style of movement, which Courtney tailored his portrayal to by observing the movement of his pet cat.[5]He used Carpenter and Castle's work on the original film to inform how the forty years that transpired between the events of the films would affect the character.[4][13][14][15]
The December 2017 announcement of Castle's participation in the film was widely reported as his retaking the role of Myers,[16]with Courtney only doing additional work as the character. However, in a 2018 interview, Courtney stated that Castle's screentime only amounted to a single cameo and that every scene under the mask was done by himself, including the scene which he shares with Castle, leading to the question of why Castle's return had been misrepresented by the production.[17]
Courtney returned to the role for the film's 2021 sequel,Halloween Kills,[18]with Nick Castle once again sharing the acting credit, although Castle's only scene in the film was excluded from the final cut.[19]Courtney stated that his stunt work for the film, especially for scenes including fire, was among the most challenging of his career.[20]He portrayed the character for a third and last time in 2022'sHalloween Ends,[21][22]thus earning him the accolade of being the actor to portray Myers the most times.[23]ForHalloween Ends, director David Gordon Green made the decision to have Courtney physically portray the character for the entirety of the film for the first time, citing his "extraordinary work" in the previous films.[24]
Honoring his portrayal of Michael Myers in 2018'sHalloween, October 19, the film's United States opening day, was officially proclaimed James Jude Courtney Day inWarren County, Kentucky.[25]Courtney was nominated forBest Actorat the2019 Fangoria Chainsaw Awardsalongside Castle for his work inHalloween.[26][27]For his performance inHalloween Kills, Courtney was nominated forBest Villainat the2022 MTV Movie & TV Awards.[28]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
