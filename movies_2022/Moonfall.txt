Moonfallis a 2022science fictiondisaster filmco-written, directed, and produced byRoland Emmerich. It starsHalle Berry,Patrick Wilson,John Bradley,Michael Peña,Charlie Plummer,Kelly Yu,Carolina Bartczak, andDonald Sutherland. It follows two former astronauts alongside a conspiracy theorist who discover the hidden truth about the Moon when it suddenly leaves its orbit. Shot inMontrealon a $138–146 million budget, it is one of the most expensive independently produced films ever made.
The film was theatrically released in North America and the UK on February 4, 2022, byLionsgateandEntertainment Film Distributorsrespectively. It grossed $67.3 million worldwide, making back less than half of the film’s budget before marketing and distribution costs, and received negative reviews from critics.
In 2011, astronauts Brian Harper, Jocinda "Jo" Fowler, and newcomer Alan Marcus are on aSpace Shuttlemission to repair a satellite. A mysterious swarm of alien technology attacks the orbiter, killing Alan and knocking Jo unconscious before tunneling into the surface of theMoon. Brian, the only witness to the swarm, returns the crippled shuttle to Earth, but his story is dismissed and he is fired fromNASA.
10 years later,conspiracy theoristK.C. Houseman, who believes that the Moon is an artificialmegastructure, secretly uses a research telescope. He discovers that the Moon's orbit is veering closer to Earth, and tries to share his findings with the disgraced Brian. NASA also discovers the anomaly, but K.C. goes public on social media, leading to a global panic. Jo is now NASA's deputy director, launching a spacecraft on anSLS Block 1rocket to investigate the abnormality. The same swarm attacks, killing all three lunar astronauts after they drop a probe into a miles-deep artificial shaft that has opened up on the Moon's surface.
As the lunar orbit deteriorates, the Moon falls closer and closer to the Earth, causing seismic and gravitational disturbances. Jo meets former NASA official Holdenfield, who reveals that Brian was discredited because of a NASA coverup dating back toApollo 11. During the first Moon landing, a two-minute radio blackout was meant to conceal evidence of pulsating lights on thesurface.Apollo 12revealed that the Moon ishollow, and a militaryEMPdevice created to kill the swarm was abandoned for budgetary reasons.
With help from her ex-husband General Doug Davidson,Air Force Chief of Staff, Jo requisitions the EMP and rescues retiredSpace ShuttleEndeavourfroma museumto serve the new mission: to correct the Moon's orbit and destroy the swarm. Brian, K.C., and Jo launch with the EMP, using the Moon's gravity, narrowly escaping to orbit as atsunamidestroysVandenberg Air Force Base.
They reach the interior of the Moon, revealed to be aDyson spherepowered by awhite dwarfat its center. The Dyson sphere'sAIoperating system explains to Brian that billions of years ago, the technologically advanced ancestors of modern humans created the AI swarm to serve them, but upon becoming self aware, it went rogue and they were eradicated by it.  They built the Moon as aninterstellar arkto create the Earth and then seed life on it, but the AI swarm discovered it and began siphoning energy from its power source, destabilizing its orbit.
Meanwhile, Brian's son Sonny, Jo's son Jimmy, and Jimmy's caretaker Michelle try to reach Doug's military bunker in theColoradomountains, finding Brian's ex-wife and Sonny's mother Brenda, her husband Tom, and their family. Escaping disasters caused by the Moon's proximity and fighting off other survivors, the group finds safety in a mountain tunnel. As the Moon strips away the local atmosphere, Tom's youngest daughter runs out of oxygen. The injured Tom gives her his own supply before suffocating to death. Thepresidentorders a nuclear strike on the approaching Moon, but Doug refuses to comply, with debris collapsing the bunker shortly thereafter, apparently killing Doug.
As the swarm attacks all electronic objects containingorganic lifeinside, K.C. lures the swarm away from their spacecraft with theirlunar module, sacrificing himself to detonate the EMP. Jo and Brian return to Earth, reuniting with their families, and the Moon's power is restored, returning to its regular orbit, but now shed of its rocky exterior. Reconstructing K.C.'sconsciousness, the Moon's operating system appears to K.C. as his cat, Fuzz Aldrin, and his mother, remarking that they must now "get started".
Additionally, Zayn Maloney portrays Jocinda's and Doug's 10-year old son Jimmy, while Ava Weiss and Hazel Nugent portray Brenda's and Tom's 9-year old and 12-year old daughters, Nikki Lopez and Lauren Lopez, respectively.

The long list of Sutherland's roles and accomplishments shows a man who understood emotion well. But it's this marriage of suspicion and empathy, human feeling and the fear of humanity gone wrong, that secured his place in acting history and made him an uncommon kind of star. He didn't disappear into a role, not exactly; he was too distinctive for that. More often, the role disappeared into him, and the result was something unforgettable".
Helen Mirrennamed Sutherland as "one of the smartest actors I ever worked with. He had a wonderful enquiring brain and a great knowledge of a wide variety of subjects. He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity, and with seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became."[156]David Oyelowo, who worked with Sutherland on what became his final performance inLawmen: Bass Reeves,stated that "Given the iconic status he rightly achieved, having a front row seat to Donald Sutherland's last onscreen performance was both a privilege and clear evidence to me of his deep passion for the craft of acting. The glint in his eye was that of an inquisitive, hungry artist still on the hunt for the truth. Seeing that glint, up close, in the eyes of a legend was something to behold."[157]Jane Fonda, who worked with Sutherland on the 1971 filmKlute, wrote: "Donald was a brilliant actor and a complex man who shared quite a few adventures with me, such as theFTA Show, an anti-Vietnam war tour that performed for 60,000 active duty soldiers, sailors, and marines in Hawaii, Okinawa, the Philippines, and Japan in 1971. I am heartbroken."[158]
Sutherland'sBBCobituary says that the "late Donald Sutherland cast a literal and figurative shadow over his industry for almost 50 years".[159]The Guardian'sPeter Bradshawwrote that "Sutherland was an utterly unique actor and irreplaceable star" and "was an aristocrat of screen actors".[160]Variety'sOwen Gleibermanwrote that "in 1970, Donald Sutherland ... was the coolest movie star on the planet. The moment I saw him in "MASH," I knew he was the person I wanted to be, the same way that I wanted to beMick JaggerorSteve McQueen".[161]Canadian Prime MinisterJustin Trudeaustated, "He was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft, and truly a great Canadian artist and he will be deeply missed."[162]
Over his career he receivednumerous accoladesincluding aPrimetime Emmy Award, aGolden Globe Award, and anAcademy Honorary Award.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
