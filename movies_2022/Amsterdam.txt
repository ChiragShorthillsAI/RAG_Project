Amsterdamis a 2022mysterycomedy thrillerfilm produced, written, and directed byDavid O. Russell. It starsChristian Bale(who also produced),Margot Robbie, andJohn David Washington, alongside anensemble supporting cast. Based on theBusiness Plot, a 1933political conspiracyin the US, it follows three friends—a doctor, a nurse, and a lawyer—who reunite and seek to uncover the act following the mysterious murder of a retired U.S. general.
Filmed in Los Angeles from January to March 2021, it is Russell's first film sinceJoy(2015).Amsterdampremiered at theAlice Tully Hallon September 18, 2022, and was released theatrically in the United States on October 7 by20th Century Studios. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized Russell's screenplay and direction, as well as the lack of chemistry between Robbie and Washington. It was also abox-office bomb,[5]with estimated losses for the studio of over $100 million.
In 1918, a man named Burt Berendsen is sent by his estranged wife's parents to fight inWorld War I. While stationed inFrance, Burt befriends African-American soldier Harold Woodman. After sustaining injuries in battle, Burt and Harold are nursed back to health by nurse Valerie Bandenberg.
After the end of the war, the three live together inAmsterdam. Burt returns toNew York Cityto be with his wife. Harold begins a romantic relationship with Valerie. Valerie, however, eventually abandons Harold, who also returns to New York.
Fifteen years later, Burt has opened his medical practice treating veterans of the war. Harold is now a lawyer, and they have not heard from Valerie since they left Amsterdam. Harold asks Burt to perform an autopsy on Bill Meekins (a senator who served as the commander of their regiment during the war) at the behest of Meekins's daughter Elizabeth, who believes that he was murdered during his recent trip to Europe. Aided by medical examiner Irma St. Clair, Burt performs the autopsy, which reveals poison in Meekins's stomach. Burt and Harold meet with Elizabeth to talk about the autopsy results, but she is soon killed when ahitmanpushes her into traffic. The hitman frames Burt and Harold for her death, and they flee as the police arrive.
Burt and Harold try to find out who told Elizabeth to hire them. This leads them to wealthy textile heir Tom Voze, his patronizing wife Libby, and Tom's sister Valerie (whose real surname is Voze). Valerie had persuaded Elizabeth to hire them, knowing that they were trustworthy. Valerie is under constant supervision by Tom and Libby, who claim that she suffers from a nerve disease and epilepsy. They were actually poisoning Valerie to keep her compliant. Burt and Harold talk with Tom, who suggests that they talk to General Gil Dillenbeck, a notable veteran who is friends with Meekins, to learn who accompanied Meekins on the trip (and might have poisoned him or be able to lead them to the person who did).
While Burt attempts to contact the general, Irma visits him at his medical practice. She says that she was attacked and her wrist broken while trying to bring him the autopsy report, and the attacker took the paper from her. After resetting her wrist, Burt kisses Irma. Meanwhile, Harold and Valerie notice that the hitman, Tarim Milfax, has been watching the house. They follow him to aforced sterilizationclinicowned by an organization known as the "Committee of the Five". After a fight with Milfax, Harold and Valerie reunite with Burt. Valerie takes them to theWaldorf Astoria New York. There, they meet Paul Canterbury and Henry Norcross, Valerie's benefactors from Amsterdam. They are secretly spies in the intelligence community. The Committee of the Five is acabalin the US with ties to Germany and plans to overthrow the American government. Dillenbeck can help foil their plot.
The trio meets with Dillenbeck, who is offered a large sum of money from a man on behalf of an unnamed benefactor to deliver a speech advocating for veterans to forcibly remove U.S. PresidentFranklin D. Rooseveltand install Dillenbeck as a puppetdictatorinstead. Dillenbeck agrees to help the trio foil the plot and to speak at a veterans reunion gala that Burt and Harold are hosting to draw out whoever is behind the plot.
At the gala, Dillenbeck reads his speech instead of the one he was paid to read. Milfax tries to shoot him, but Harold, Valerie, and Burt stop him in time. Milfax is arrested and the Committee of the Five is revealed to be four industry leaders, including Tom. They intended to turn the United States into afascist country.
Tom and the other leaders are arrested by the police, but do not stay in jail long, and expose Dillenbeck in the press following their release. Dillenbeck testifies about the incident toCongress. Harold and Valerie leave the country since they cannot be together in the United States. Burt wishes them farewell, planning to reopen his medical practice and pursue a relationship with Irma.
In January 2020,New Regencyannounced the development on an untitled film written and directed byDavid O. Russelland starringChristian Bale, with filming expected to begin that April.[6]In February,Margot RobbieandMichael B. Jordanwere announced to star,[7][14]but the latter dropped out before production began due to scheduling conflicts.Jennifer Lawrencewas reportedly considered for Robbie's role, whileJamie Foxxwas considered for Jordan's. In October,John David Washingtonwas cast as Jordan's replacement.[8]The rest of the ensemble cast was revealed between January and June 2021.[9][12]Much of the cast worked for scale, and Bale took less than his typical $5 million fee while Malek earned a six-figure salary.[15]
Filming was originally set to begin in March 2020 inBostonon a $50 million budget, but was delayed because of theCOVID-19 pandemic.[8]Filming was moved toLos Angeles, Californiaafter the cast did not want to travel to Boston amid the pandemic.Principal photographytook place over 49 days between January and March 2021.[9][16]The move from Boston to Los Angeles and COVID-precautions caused the film's final budget to balloon to $80 million.[15]Crew members included cinematographerEmmanuel Lubezki(his first feature film since 2017),[17]editorJay Cassidy, and score composerHildur Guðnadóttir.[18]In April 2022, atCinemaCon, the film's title was revealed to beAmsterdam.[19]In August, it was revealed that Guðnadóttir had exited as composer, withDaniel Pembertonnow replacing her.[20]According to Robbie, on the last day of filming, they kept production going after their filming permit ended, so the police had to call "wrap" on the film.[21][22]
The conspiracy underlying the plot of the film is loosely based on theBusiness Plot, a conspiracy to oust PresidentFranklin D. Rooseveltin 1933. De Niro's character, Gil Dillenbeck, is based on GeneralSmedley Butler, who testified before the McCormack–Dickstein committee in 1934 regarding the conspiracy.[23]Most other details of the conspiracy depicted in the film, including the Committee of Five, its connections toNazism, and the names of most of the individuals involved, are fictionalized.[24]The rally that occurs at the end of the film may have been inspired by the 2017 documentary filmA Night at the Garden, which depicts a1939 Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden.[23]
Although the main trio of characters inAmsterdamare fictional, the film accurately depicts aspects of the369th Infantry Regiment, which fought in France inWorld War Iand consisted of African Americans serving under mostly white officers. The film also has the 1932Bonus Marchas a major background event, and Dillenbeck's speech at the event is based on a similar speech delivered by Butler.[24]
The film was previewed at the 2022CinemaConon April 27, 2022.[19][25]The trailer was released on July 6, 2022, set toTen Years After's 1971 song "I'd Love to Change the World."[26]An edited version of the trailer was shown in theaters, revealing the film's release date as October 7. Character posters were released on September 12, 2022.[27]Disney and Regency spent an estimated $70 million on global promotion.[15]
Amsterdampremiered atAlice Tully Hallin New York City on September 18, 2022, and was released in the United States on October 7, 2022, by20th Century Studios.[28]It was originally scheduled for November 4, 2022 release,[29]but was moved up to October 7 to avoid the release ofBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever, another film being released byWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.[1]It was also screened inIMAX; a special screening, preceded by a Live Q&A broadcast, took place in IMAX theaters nationwide on September 27, 2022.[30]

In the United States and Canada,Amsterdamwas released alongsideLyle, Lyle, Crocodile, and was initially projected to gross around $10 million from 3,005 theaters in its opening weekend, with some estimates reaching $15 million.[2]After making $2.6 million on its first day, including $550,000 from Thursday night previews, expectations were lowered to $7 million.[32]The film went on to debut to $6.5 million, finishing in third.[33]Deadline Hollywoodblamed the poor performance on the critical response, 134-minute runtime deterring audiences, and Disney being unsure how to market the film due to its quirky style and convoluted plot.[34]The film made $2.2 million in its second weekend, dropping 55% and finishing in fifth.[35]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 31% of 261 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Amsterdamhas a bunch of big stars and a very busy plot, all of which amounts to painfully less than the sum of its dazzling parts."[36]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[37]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave the film a 72% overall positive score.[34]
In a positive review, Pete Hammond ofDeadline Hollywoodlauded the "complex" screenplay, "uniquely conceived" characters, cinematography, costume, production, and score.[38]Giving the film four out of five stars, James Mottram ofSouth China Morning PostdescribedAmsterdamas "aHal Ashby-style caper full of fireworks with contemporary political overtones".[39]Scott Mendelson ofForbesdescribed it as an "all-star delight" with "strong production values" and a "terrific ensemble cast delivering some top-shelf work."[40]Chris Knight, writing forNational Post, admired the film's "rattling" pace, "lovely" screenplay and supporting cast.[41]Brian Truitt ofUSA Today,Ryan Swen ofSlate, and Oliver Jones ofThe New York Observergave the film three out of four stars. Calling it a thoroughly entertaining, "whimsicalwhodunit" and "quirky, big-hearted trip", Truitt's praise was focused on the cast, especially the "crowd-pleasing" chemistry between Bale, Robbie and Washington.[42]Swen complimented the film's sentiment and "detail-rich" narrative.[43]Jones wrote that the film is "quite odd and discombobulating, but if you allow its turned up and persistent energy to sweep over you, and soak in the joy and righteous anger that animates its generous spirit, the end result is decidedly moving, and—at some points—even enthralling."[44]
Several critics foundAmsterdamoverambitious and tonally inconsistent.Peter BradshawofThe Guardianrated the film three out of five stars and complimented its humor, but felt the story was "exhaustingly wacky".[45]/Film's Jeff Ewing stated thatAmsterdam"has a number of charming scenes, a stunningly top-tier cast, and flawless cinematography", but cited "wildly fluctuating tones" and "plot contrivances" as its shortcomings.[46]Rating it a B−,The A.V. Club's Jordan Hoffman found the cast to be "energetic, entertaining, and enjoyable", but called the film "an overly ambitious politicalpotboiler".[47]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote thatAmsterdamis "a lot of movies inelegantly squidged into one—a zanyscrewball comedy, acrime thriller, an earnest salute to pacts of love and friendship, anantifascisthistory lesson with fictional flourishes." He praised the lead performances, cinematography, production and costume design, but felt its material suits alimited seriesmore than a film.[48]Paste's Aurora Amidon praised the "vibrant, no-frills cinematography", "whip-tight" editing and the cast's "incredible" performances, despite the "bewildering" story.[49]Reviewing forScreen International, Tim Grierson called the film an "overstuffed murder mystery" with a "convoluted" story, but cheered some aspects—the plot's "unpredictability" and the "indulgent cheekiness" of the film.[50]Varietycritic Peter Debruge dubbed it a "beautifully shot" yet "overstuffed socialsatire" with intelligent ideas poorly executed.[51]Ian Freer ofEmpirestated thatAmsterdam"fails to amount to more than the sum of its occasionally impressive parts."[52]Leah Greenblatt, writing forEntertainment Weekly,ratedAmsterdama C+ and described it as an "oddshaggy-dogmystery" with a "hectic" story, but called the production and costume design "impeccable."[53]
Some reviews were very critical. Rating the film two out of five stars,Robbie CollinofThe Daily Telegraphfound the dialogue unimpressive and wrote that Russell's screenplay "makes heavy weather" of the story.[54]Describing the plot as a "wanton disarray",IndieWire's David Ehrlich rated the film a C−, owing to its "negligible" entertainment value.[55]Barry Hertz ofThe Globe and Mailwrote, "Amsterdamso badly wants to be a light romp with heavy-duty meaning that it cannot help but be flattened by a sagging self-exhaustion."[56]Mark Kennedy of theAssociated Pressstated that the film "reaches for something contemporary to say aboutrace relations, concentration of wealth, veterans and fascism but ends up with a plodding,manneristnoise."[57]Giving the film an F rating, Chase Hutchinson ofCollidercriticized its "egregious" editing, "banal" dialogue, "muddled" tone, and overall "lack of vision."[58]

After inquiring about the hormones she used to increase breast size, Russell slipped his hands under her shirt and felt both breasts.
Russell confirmed that the incident happened, but told police that Peloquin was "acting very provocative toward him" and invited him to feel her breasts. He also admitted to being "curious about the breast enhancement." This incident was also directly mentioned in the 2014Sony Pictures hack.[104]
Over the years, Russell has been combative and abusive towards actors in his films, includingGeorge Clooney,Lily Tomlin, andAmy Adams.[105]His reputation extends off-set, as Russell physically assaultedChristopher Nolanin 2003 at a party in Hollywood, where he put Nolan in a headlock.[106][107]
During filming, news spread of Russell andGeorge Clooneynearly having a fistfight on the set ofThree Kings. In a 2000 interview, Clooney described his confrontation with Russell after tensions on the set had been steadily increasing. According to Clooney, Russell was demeaning the crew verbally and physically. Clooney felt this was out of line and told Russell, "David, it's a big day. But you can't shove, push or humiliate people who aren't allowed to defend themselves." After that, the confrontation escalated when, according to Sharon Waxman in her book,Rebels on the Backlot, Russell actually head-butted Clooney[108]and Clooney grabbed Russell by the throat. Clooney said Russell eventually apologized and filming continued, but Clooney described the incident as "truly, without exception, the worst experience of my life." When asked if he would work with Russell again, Clooney responded, "Life's too short."[109]
In early 2012, Clooney indicated that he and Russell had mended their relationship, saying "We made a really, really great film, and we had a really rough time together, but it's a case of both of us getting older. I really do appreciate the work he continues to do, and I think he appreciates what I'm trying to do."[110]However, in August 2024 Clooney stated that he wouldn't work with someone like Russell again.[111]
Russell had conflicts withLily Tomlinduring the filming ofI Heart Huckabees, and in March 2007, two videos were leaked ontoYouTubeportraying on-set arguments between Russell and Tomlin, in which among other things he called her sexist names.[112][113][114]
Russell’s behavior was first reported in a 2004The New York Timesarticle[28]bySharon Waxmanin which she describes him calling Tomlin "the crudest word imaginable, in front of the actors and crew." Additionally Waxman describes Russell storming off the set and back on again, continually shouting, which is corroborated by the leaked videos. On the set, actors were sometimes driven to their wits' ends after hours of takes. Afterward, Tomlin remarked that she and Russell are "fine", saying, "I'd rather have someone human and available and raw and open. Don't give me someone cold, or cut off, or someone who considers themselves dignified."
In a 2011 interview with Movieline, Tomlin was asked about the incident and she replied:
It happens sometimes—but David is a very mercurial person, and that's part of why he's so brilliant. He almost reflects the movie. I did two movies with him, andI Heart Huckabeeswas so crazy, so all over the place, I think he kind of embodies intuitively whatever he's trying to make happen. It was just crazy, crazy stuff. We were always doing something, and then we'd get manic and crazy and I just flipped out on him. Then he flipped out on me. And you know, stuff goes on. But it's nothing. It's like family. If you have a big fight in your family, usually it's treated that way on the set. We don't want to misbehave; believe me, it's embarrassing. It's humiliating, you know? Because you just lose it. You act like a crazy person. [Laughs] But I adore David. I adore him as a talent. A lot of my friends said, "Well, you won't work with him again." I said, "Of course I would! I adore him, I love him. He's brilliant."[115]
During the2012 Gotham Awards, hostMike BirbigliaroastedRussell by reading a transcript of Russell's argument with Lily Tomlin.[116][117][118]The event, specifically the joke and what transpired around it, later formed a large part of Birbiglia's show,Thank God for Jokes.[119][120][121]
According toSalon, in theSony Pictures Entertainment hack, it was revealed that Russell madeAmy Adams' life "a living hell" during the production ofAmerican Hustle, andChristian Baleat one point intervened.Salonreported that, in an email to Sony chief Michael Lynton, journalistJonathan Altersaid: "He grabbed one guy by the collar, cursed out people repeatedly in front of others and so abused Amy Adams that Christian Bale got in his face and told him to stop acting like an asshole."
Adams confirmed the story in a 2016British GQinterview stating, "He was hard on me, that's for sure. It was a lot ... I was really just devastated on set". She also added she wouldn't want to work with the director again.[122]Adams also explained, "Jennifer [Lawrence] doesn't take any of it on. She's Teflon. And I am not Teflon. But I also don't like to see other people treated badly. It's not OK with me."[123]
Over the course of his career he has received numerous accolades including twoBritish Academy Film Awards, aGolden Globe Award, and fourIndependent Spirit Awardsas well as nominations for fiveAcademy Awardsand twoDirectors Guild of America Awards.

Moritz, "The studio said, 'If you can get Timothy Olyphant to play that role we will greenlight the movie.'" Olyphant declined the role, which went toVin Diesel. The film went on to be a massive success withnine sequelsto date.[77]Olyphant later discussed passing on a lot of roles earlier in his career. In 2011, when asked byThe Hollywood Reporterwhat was the most absurd project he had ever been pitched, he replied, "I've passed on absurd projects and they have become enormous, enormous hits spawning numerous sequels, and I'm not in them."[78]In 2018, he reflected on passing on the role of Toretto inThe Fast and the Furious, thinking it would be "stupid" and would bomb at the box office.[79]
Olyphant also had supporting roles in the musical comedyRock Star,[40]the crime dramaAuggie Rose,[80][81]and the romantic comedyHead Over Heels(all 2001). He starred in the short filmDoppelganger(2001)[82]and appeared in an episode of theSci-Fi Channelhorror seriesNight Visions(2002).[83]
The independent dramaCoastlinesmade its debut at the 2002SXSW Festival, but failed to find a distributor until 2006.[84][85]Olyphant starred oppositeJosh Brolinas an ex-con who returns to his Florida hometown to collect a $200,000 debt. Kevin Crust of theLos Angeles Timeswrote that he "possesses the kind of thousand-yard stare that suggests something deeper going on,"[86]while Owen Gleiberman ofEntertainment Weeklyremarked that "Olyphant, in the sort of role thatPaul Newmanused to swagger through, has a star's easy command."[87]However, Todd McCarthy ofVarietyfelt his performance "sort of floats along".[88]
Olyphant's most high-profile role of 2003 was in the Vin Diesel-starring action filmA Man Apart. Desson Howe of theWashington Postremarked that Olyphant "gets a kudo or two for [having] the good sense to realize he's playing one of the movie's many one-dimensional characters, so he might as well have insane fun".[89]Similarly, Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chroniclenoted that "the most lively character in "A Man Apart" turns out [to be] a middling drug dealer played to the hilt by Timothy Olyphant."[90]He appeared in thefilm adaptationofStephen King's horror novelDreamcatcheras one of four friends attacked by parasitic aliens.[91][92][93]The film was poorly reviewed, with David Rooney ofVarietyremarking: "OnlyLeeand Olyphant come close to hitting the right note of tongue-in-cheek humor that might have made all this palatable. Unfortunately, they're the first to go."[94]Also in 2003, he appeared in the independent ensemble dramaThe Safety of Objects.[70][95][96]
Olyphant received widespread praise for his 2004 performance as a porn film producer in the comedyThe Girl Next Door.[97][98][99]He was initially reluctant to audition for the part, feeling it was too similar to some of his previous roles but, "as my manager dutifully reminded me, not many people saw those movies."[75]Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chronicledescribed the character of Kelly as "a leering, magnetic, frightening, glad-handing, easily-amused, hyper-sensitive, utterly deceitful, maddeningly likable wild man. When Olyphant is on screen, there's the feeling that things might go anywhere."[100]A.O. Scott ofThe New York Timesremarked that the part was played with "a throwaway inventiveness"[101]while Kenneth Turan of theLos Angeles Timesfelt it was played "with wonderful comic zest".[102]David Edelstein ofSlateenjoyed his "spaced-out volatility. Olyphant's Kelly is a brilliant synthesis of poses."[103]Joe Leydon ofVarietysaid he "strikes an impressively deft balance of hearty amiability and understated menace in his scene-stealing turn".[104]
In a 2015 interview, Olyphant reflected on the early stages of his film career, and not getting the leading roles that would have possibly led to major fame: "I got great opportunities right off the bat. And at the same time I either passed or failed to get things that would have made things ridiculously quick. I passed on enormous opportunities only to end up playing the supporting role in the next film. And then I'd think to myself, "What the fuck am I doing? Why did I do that?" But sometimes I feel like I got away with some things, because I've been able to work for a long time and I haven't had to deal with any kind of fame issues."[105]
Olyphant came to the attention of a wider audience when he was cast as SheriffSeth Bullockin HBO's acclaimed westernDeadwood, which aired for three seasons from 2004 to 2006.[75]While he had previously been typecast "as a talkative,Jack Nicholson–styled, funny bad boy," in the words ofVulture'sMatt Zoller Seitz,[106][107]Deadwoodgave him the opportunity to play a righteous, brooding lawman.[108][109][110][111]The show's creator,David Milch, said of the casting choice: "Bullock's uprightness is an alternative to going medieval on people. You can see that same fire and that possibility in Tim, even at his most genial ... I'm not sure which poet talked about 'thoughts too deep for words,' but he brings that idea alive ... Tim is a guy that doesn't let himself be known easily."[64][112][113]
While Bullock was initially introduced asDeadwood's protagonist, Emily VanDerWerff ofThe A.V. Clubnoted that the character ofAl Swearengencame to "dominate the show ... This is not to slight Timothy Olyphant. He's a fine actor, and his portrayal of Bullock is frequently very, very good. Bullock is still unquestionably one of the most important characters on the show but the character of a Wild West lawman, no matter how revisionist it was in its portrayal of that lawman as someone who seemed barely in control at all times, just ended up not having as much to do in a blatantly revisionist Western about how chaos gives way to civilization."[114]Matt Feeney ofSlatedescribed Bullock as "laconic, feral, hot-tempered and a little vain", and said the character was "not so much played as embodied by Olyphant".[115]Alan Sepinwall ofHitFixfound his performance "fierce and commanding"[116]while Jeremy Egner ofThe New York Timessaid that he showed "a capacity for explosive, nuanced performance barely suggested by earlier roles".[64]The cast were nominated for the 2006Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.[53]
Years later, Olyphant remarked thatDeadwood"almost has done more for me since we wrapped than while it was on. I continue to draw from it, to steal from it. I'm much better at my job now because of the things I learned while doing it. David Milch is one of the greatest writers, storytellers, directors, creative forces I've ever been around."[117]He has been somewhat critical of his own performance: "Frankly, the show is much better than my performance ...Ianwas like a little kid, playing with the props and playing with the language and he never lost the sense of fun of it all. I wasn't operating at that same level."[118][119]
Also in 2006, he made a guest appearance in an episode of theNBCcomedyMy Name Is Earl.[120]In 2007, Olyphant starred in the romantic comedyCatch and Release. He knew co-starJennifer Garnerfrom their days as struggling actors in New York, and was excited for the opportunity to play a romantic lead.[7][53][121]Lael Loewenstein ofVarietyfelt "Olyphant clearly has a bright future"[122]while Desson Thomson of theWashington Postdescribed him as "the strongest performer here" but that he was "entirely misplaced, an estimable actor caught in a thankless, frilly role".[123]Scott Tobias ofThe A.V. Clubremarked: "Olyphant's trademark volatility makes him a livelier romantic lead than the usual stuffed shirt."[124]Similarly, Stephanie Zacharek ofSalonfound him "effective here precisely because he seems a little sharp and dangerous. He's not your typical cuddly romantic lead."[125]
Olyphant's first post-Deadwoodroles were the action moviesLive Free or Die HardandHitman(both 2007). (Coastlineswas first screened during the Sundance Film Festival in 2002[126]whileCatch and Releasewas filmed in 2005.[127]) He had bought a house in the weeks beforeDeadwood's cancellation[128][129]and he later admitted his job choices during this period were for "purely financial reasons".[21]InLive Free or Die Hard, he played a villainous cybersecurity expert.[53][110][130]Both he andBruce Willishave said his role was underwritten in the script, and he enjoyed working with Willis to develop the character.[131][132][133]Peter Travers ofRolling Stonedeclared him "a master at smiling menace",[134]while Mick LaSalle ofThe San Francisco Chroniclefound him "perfectly ice cold".[135]However,Manohla DargisofThe New York Timesremarked: "Mr. Olyphant has many charms, but annihilating menace is not one of them."[136]He next starred inHitman, a video game adaptation, as the assassinAgent 47.[7][137][138]He was hired to replace Vin Diesel six weeks before filming began[139][140]and reluctantly agreed to shave his head.[132][141]The film was commercially successful, grossing over $100 million,[142]but received negative reviews. Todd McCarthy ofVarietydescribed Olyphant as "an actor capable of portraying subtle ambiguities and thought, which suggests he ought to branch out to play something other than baddies".[143]Nick Schager ofSlant Magazinewas disappointed to see the actor "reduced to glowering and posing with pistols"[144]while Manohla Dargis ofThe New York Timesfelt he was "strangely, at times ridiculously, miscast".[145]In 2008, he had a supporting role as alieutenant colonelin theIraq WardramaStop-Loss,[53][146]played a pompous newscaster in the little-seen comedyMeet Bill,[147]voiced the character Cowboy in the video gameTurok[148]and made a guest appearance on the first season of the ABC sitcomSamantha Who?withChristina Applegate.[149][150]
Olyphant had a new outlook when choosing his 2009 projects, influenced by his experience withHitman: "It motivated me to take a little more responsibility with what I was doing ... I was very fond of the director and a lot of the people that worked on the film but there was definitely a part of me that was like, "What am I doing here?'"[64][151][152]He starred as a morphine addict in the little-seen independent heist comedyHigh Life,[153][154][155]with Derek Elley ofVarietypraising his "terrific" performance.[156][157]He had a starring role in the thrillerA Perfect Getawayas a possible serial killer of fellow holidaymakers in Hawaii. Manohla Dargis ofThe New York Timesenjoyed "the regrettably underemployed" actor's performance,[158]Ty Burr of theBoston Globefound him "delightfully confident"[159]while Lisa Schwarzbaum ofEntertainment Weeklynoted he "has a heckuva good time telegraphing macho mania".[160]He was nominated for theToronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor.[161]He returned to the stage for one night to appear inStanding on Ceremony: The Gay Marriage Plays, benefiting theHuman Rights Campaign.[162][163]Also in 2009, he appeared in 11 episodes of theFXlegal thrillerDamages, as a morally ambiguous love interest forRose Byrne's character.[164][165]Byrne later said he was her favoriteDamagesguest star,[166][167]while FX presidentJohn Landgrafsent him the pilot script for another FX project,Lawman(later renamedJustified).[113][117]In 2010, he starred as the town sheriff in the horror filmThe Crazies.[151][168]Peter Bradshaw ofThe Guardianwas impressed by the "saturnine screen presence of Timothy Olyphant – that formidable actor who deserves a lead role to match his potential."[169]The Hollywood Reporter's Michael Rechtshaffen found him "convincing"[170]while Claudia Puig ofUSA Todayenjoyed the "smart, stoic and sympathetic" performance.[171]He also appeared in the independent comedyElektra Luxx(2010).[172][173]
Olyphant starred in FX's modern-day western series,Justified, as Deputy U.S. MarshalRaylan Givens, who is reassigned to his native Eastern Kentucky following a "Justified," but questionable, quick-draw shooting of a criminal in Miami. There, he encounters many outlaw figures from his childhood, including his father and Boyd Crowder, with whom he dug coal as a teenager.[174]Olyphant was initially drawn to "the ease and the charm and the sort of old-fashionedness" of the character[152]but has said he does not consider him a "good guy".[64][174][175][176]The character of Raylan Givens was created by novelistElmore Leonard, appearing in his short story "Fire in the Hole" (2001) and the novelsPronto(1993) andRiding the Rap(1995). Leonard was an executive producer ofJustifiedand befriended Olyphant;[177][178][179]his final novel,Raylan(2012), was inspired by the television show.[180]
Raylan Givens has been described by many television critics as the "defining role" of Olyphant's career.[64][181][182]Brian Lowry ofVarietysaid it was "an unabashed star turn": "There are surely worse ways to be pigeonholed than playing tough, laconic lawmen, and Timothy Olyphant is carving himself a formidable niche in those confines ... It's an enormously appealing performance."[183]Tim Goodman of theSan Francisco Chroniclepraised "an incredibly riveting performance": "Olyphant's steely gaze, Zen interior and matinee looks called to mind a younger Clint Eastwood."[184]Daniel Fienberg ofHitFixdescribed him as "a tremendously compelling actor. It's not that he thrives only on minimalism, but he gets a lot out of a little. His performance is about potential energy, or potential violence. And Olyphant does "intense and coiled" to perfection."[185]Matthew Gilbert ofThe Boston Globesaid: "It's hard to imagine any other actor in the part, as Olyphant milks Raylan's smooth, laconic cowboy style for as much wry humor as he can. He is riveting without a lot of noise — both his body language and his conversation are pared down, and yet his presence is always resonant."[186]Although Olyphant was nominated for aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Seriesin 2011,[187]he and the show were often perceived to have been "snubbed" by Emmy voters.[188][189][190][191]Matt Zoller Seitz ofVulturesuggested this was because it was "the kind of performance that almost nobody recognizes as 'acting.' It's an old-fashioned movie hero performance in which much of the emotional action is internal and articulated with great subtlety."[192]Similarly, Robert Bianco ofUSA Todaycommented that his "masterfully complete immersion in the role seems to have masked the talent expended playing it".[193]
Olyphant also served as a co-executive producer onJustified, working withGraham Yostand the writing team on some of the show's storylines and coming to the set on his days off to work with guest stars.[64][152][194][113]He has described producing as "the greatest thing about this job".[175]Yost has said of his producer credit: "Often on shows that really doesn't mean much. On this show it actually doesn't reflect the depth of his involvement, which would be an even bigger credit. Tim is the biggest reminder for everyone that we're in the Elmore Leonard world. And that it needs to be funny and dark and twisted, and it needs to speak with all of those voices at the same time."[64]Justifiedwas awarded aPeabody Awardin 2011.[195]
Olyphant made occasional guest appearances on comedy television shows duringJustified's six-season run. He played a paper salesman in two episodes of the NBC comedyThe Office(2010), afterMindy Kaling, a writer, producer and actress on the show, pushed for him to make a guest appearance.[196][197][198]In 2012, he played a character billed as White Sushi Chef in an episode of the FX sitcomThe League(2012)[199]and voiced a character in an episode of the FX animated seriesArcher.[200][201]In 2013, he appeared as a love interest on theFoxcomedyThe Mindy Project. The guest appearance came about after he told Kaling that he wanted to appear on the show[202][203]and he later said he would have been happy to play his middle-aged skateboarder character for "years".[33][204][205]
Olyphant also worked on numerous films in between seasons ofJustified. He voiced the Spirit of the West in the animated filmRango(2011).[206][207]The character was a parody ofClint Eastwood'sMan with No Name[208]and Olyphant was cast after directorGore Verbinskioverheard him speaking on television: "I just sort of doubled back and looked through the door and was like, "That's our guy" ... Timothy has such a great quality to his voice."[209][210][211]Olyphant appeared as a mentor toAlex Pettyfer's character in the science-fiction thrillerI Am Number Four(2011).[206]Justin Chang ofVarietysaid he "brings some of his usual edge"[212]but Betsy Sharkey of theLos Angeles Timesfelt he was "an untapped resource".[213]Also in 2011, he voiced a character called Sergeant First Class "Grinch" in the video game,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. In 2013, he appeared asJeff Garlin's father in the independent comedyDealin' with Idiots[214][215]and took part in a one-offLACMA Live Readof the black comedyRaising Arizona(1987); he playedNicolas Cage's character whileAmy PoehlerplayedHolly Hunter's character.[216][217]In 2014, Olyphant starred withTina Feyin the ensemble comedy-dramaThis Is Where I Leave You. Their characters were teenage sweethearts until an accident left him with a mild brain injury. The film received mixed reviews,[218]with David Edelstein ofVulturecommenting: "Over the course of his career, Olyphant has given life to head-slappingly bad material, and he does it again by simply underplaying."[219]
Olyphant had a recurring guest role as a fictionalized version of himself in the Fox comedyThe Grinder(2015–2016). His performance received positive critical notices,[220][221][222][223]withUSA Today's Robert Bianco declaring it an "Emmy-deserving performance".[224]The role won him theCritics' Choice Television Award for Best Guest Performer in a Comedy Series.[225]
In early 2016, Olyphant starred in the world premiere ofKenneth Lonergan's comedyHold On to Me Darlingat the off-BroadwayAtlantic Theater Company. His character, Strings McCrane, is a self-absorbed country singer and actor who returns home toTennesseefollowing his mother's death.[226][227]Ben Brantley of theNew York Timesfound him "entertainingly irritating" in a performance that "avoids the obvious route of histrionic posing"; "The startling, bona fide sorrow that Mr. Olyphant brings to [the final scene] truly illuminates everything that has come before."[228]Frank Rizzo ofVarietyfelt his performance was "a stunner, striking just the right notes of guilelessness, obliviousness and narcissism to make Strings one of the most appealing messes in a long time".[229]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterfelt the role "seems tailor-made for his laid-back swagger and sly humor ... Olyphant's natural charm ensures that Strings' unapologetic self-absorption remains more human than monstrous."[230]He also played Henry, ex-husband of Sandy (Jennifer Aniston), in the universally-panned ensembleromantic comedyMother's Day(2016);[231]he  appeared inOliver Stone'sSnowden(2016) as aCIA agentwho befriendswhistleblowerEdward Snowdenjust prior to Snowden's fleeing to Russia, after publicly leaking classified US government information.[232]

Netflix renewed the series for a second season in March 2017[233][234]and for a third, ultimately final season in May 2018.[235]Dark Was the Night, an independent drama in which he starred withMarisa Tomei, was filmed in 2015 and premiered at the 2018Galway Film Fleadh.[236]

He is also a keen tennis player,[254][255]and has participated in many pro-celebrity tournaments.[256][257][258]He is a fan of theLos Angeles Clippers[253]and theLos Angeles Dodgers, and he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at a Dodgers game in 2013.[259]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
