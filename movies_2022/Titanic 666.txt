Titanic 666(also known asTitanic RisesandTitanic 3[1]) is a 2022 Americansupernatural horrorfilm directed byNick Lyonand produced byThe Asylum. It is a sequel toTitanic II(2010) and starsJamie BamberandKeesha Sharp. It was released onTubion the United States on April 15, 2022, on the 110th anniversary of thesinking of theTitanic. The film received generally unfavorable reviews, and users on social media noted the film's similarity toTitanic(1997) andStudio 666(2022).[2]
One hundred and ten years after the sinking of the original, the secondreplicaTitanic,Titanic III, begins its maiden voyage to the original wreck site when strange things begin to occur after the ship's arrival. The passengers start turning into ghosts, and as a result, the ship sinks.
Waldemar Dalenogare Netoevaluated it with a score of 1/10 and said that "whoever sees it, does not believe it:The Asylummanaged to overcome itself (...) I already knew it was a bad movie, the trailer is already a disgrace (...) the bad taste when dealing with a tragedy (on the anniversary of the sinking of theTitanic) (...) It's not a horror movie, as much as the title may lead you to this idea, here you actually have a big joke at the cost of extremely poor graphical effects and a completely lost cast."[1]
In his review inPaste, Matt Donato rated it 4/10 saying that "whileNetflixharbors Oscar aspirations for its originals, Tubi appears content being the streaming equivalent ofSYFYafter midnight. (...) I’ve seen worse films this year thanTitanic 666, but also too many better examples (...) Against all odds,Titanic 666is too dramatic and straight-faced for its own good."[3]
On Crooked Marquee,[4]Josh Bell rated it a "C−" saying that "is a slow, dull haunted-ship story that takes far too long to get to its meager terrors. Lydia Hearst finds the right campy tone as a descendant of one of the originalTitanicvictims who summons their spirits to curse this shameless exploitation of their memories, and AnnaLynne McCord is fun to watch as a narcissistic influencer who exits the movie too early. But the ghosts themselves are tame, poorly rendered apparitions, and the valiant, self-sacrificing captain (Keesha Sharp) makes for a weak protagonist as the voyage predictably devolves into chaos."[5]

The Asylumis an American independent film production and distribution company based inBurbank, California, known for producing low-budget,direct-to-videofilms, in particularmockbusters, which capitalize on the popularity of major studio films with similar titles and premises. The Asylum's business model revolves around producing as many low-budget films as quickly as possible, which earn around $150,000 to $250,000 in profit. Since the company produces dozens of films every year, this model generates millions of dollars, and the company claims to have never lost money on a film. The Asylum spends around 4-6 months making a film, and since the company is not affiliated with any industryguildsother thanSAG-AFTRA, this means their employees will sometimes work up to 22 hours a day.
Initially founded as a distribution company for low-budget drama films, The Asylum switched to in-house productions in the mid-2000s due to competition from larger studios likeLionsgate Films. In 2005, The Asylum released the filmH. G. Wells' War of the Worldsthe day beforeSteven SpielbergfilmWar of the Worlds.Blockbusterordered 100,000 copies, which inspired The Asylum to focus on mockbusters. This led to a partnership with the television channelSyfy, and with the rise ofvideo on demand(VOD) services in the early 2010s, partnerships withPluto TVandTubi. The Asylum's greatest success came in 2013 with the filmSharknado, which is about awaterspoutthat lifts sharks out of the ocean and drops them overLos Angeles. The over-the-top premise wentviral, and led to the creation of theSharknadofranchise. In response to the popularity ofSharknado, Syfy commissioned The Asylum to produce azombietelevision series calledZ Nation, which ran for five seasons.
The Asylum was founded in 1997 by David Latt, David Rimawi, and Sherri Strain.[1]Rimawi and Strain had been fired byVillage Roadshow Pictures, and Latt was working for aneducation softwarecompany called Chimera Multimedia.[1]Latt and Rimawi had previously worked together on the 1992 filmSorority House Party, and together with Strain, launched The Asylum as a film distribution company.[1][2]The Asylum's first release wasBellyfruitin 1999, acomedy dramaabout a teen pregnancy.[3]The company's initial goal was to distribute low-budget drama films likeBellyfruittovideo rental chainslikeBlockbusterandHollywood Video, but their approach changed in the early 2000s, as video rental chains were more interested indirect-to-videohorror films.[4]The Asylum struggled to break into the distribution market, as larger companies likeLionsgate Filmswould routinely offer filmmakers more money.[4]This led to a change in their business model in 2002, with a focus on in-house productions.[1]Their goal was to produce one film per month, starting with the 2002crime thrillerKing of the Ants.[1]Strain left the company in 2002, and was replaced by formerScreen Actors GuildemployeePaul Bales.[3]
According toFilm International, The Asylum's first hit film wasVampires vs. Zombiesin 2004.[3]Although the film was marketed as an adaptation of the 1872 novellaCarmilla,Vampires vs. Zombies'sposter bore a striking resemblance toFreddy vs. Jason'sposter, which came out the year before.[3]Film Internationalwriter Wheeler Winston Dixon describedVampires vs. Zombiesas The Asylum's firstmockbuster, a film that closely resembles another film with a similar title and premise in order to capitalize on its popularity.[3]Around the same time, Latt began working on an adaptation of the 1898 novelThe War of the Worlds, but learned thatSteven Spielbergwas also working on a film adaptation of the novel.[2]Latt was prepared to end production until Blockbuster ordered 100,000 copies of the film, roughly seven to eight times the normal order for Asylum films.[4][5]Latt's film, titledH. G. Wells' War of the Worlds, was released on June 28, 2005, one day beforeSpielberg's film.[3]
Emboldened by the success ofH. G. Wells' War of the Worlds, The Asylum started producing low-budget films to capitalize on the popularity of similar major studio films.[1]The Asylum marketed their films as "tie-ins", although journalists and critics often referred to them as rip-offs or mockbusters.[2][5]Among the company's early releases within this business model wereKing of the Lost World(based onKing Kong),Snakes on a Train(based onSnakes on a Plane),The Da Vinci Treasure(based onThe Da Vinci Code), andTransmorphers(based onTransformers).[4][5]In 2008, The Asylum increased their meager production budget, and partnered withSyfyfor a television release ofThe Day the Earth Stopped, based onThe Day the Earth Stood Still.[3]20th Century Foxfiled acease and desistletter against The Asylum for the similarities betweenThe Day the Earth StoppedandThe Day the Earth Stood Still, although nothing came of the letter.[1][6]Film titles are usually not protected underUnited States trademark law, which allows The Asylum to produce films with similar titles so long as they can argue that they did not try to deceive consumers.[6][7]
With the rise ofvideo on demand(VOD) services in the early 2010s, The Asylum focused on digital distribution.[4]Since VOD services would often categorize their films in alphabetical order, The Asylum added numbers or typographical symbols to the beginning of their film titles in order to been seen first, such as#1 Cheerleader Campand2-Headed Shark Attack.[4]The Asylum also released the filmHold Your Breath(stylized as#HoldYourBreath) in 10AMC Theatres, as VOD services prioritized films with theatrical releases.[4][8]Pluto TVbecame the studio's largest source of revenue, with an entire channel dedicated to Asylum films.[1]Another VOD service,Tubi, commissioned The Asylum to produce 12 original films after the surprise popularity of the filmTitanic II.[1]Rimawi estimated that by 2012, 70 percent of the studio's films were original ideas.[4]
The Asylum's biggest success came in 2013 with the filmSharknado, which is about awaterspoutthat lifts sharks out of the ocean and drops them overLos Angeles.[1]The over-the-top premise wentviral, with over 387,000 mentions on social media.[9]Todayco-hosts held a dramatic reading of some of the film's lines, and the mayor of Los AngelesEric Garcettijoked about it onTwitter.[9]Sharknadospawned five sequels, and when combined with merchandising and licensing sales, nearly quadrupled The Asylum's revenue from three years earlier.[8]According to Bales, "Up until that point, even with the notoriety that we had, if you'd speak to anyone and be like, 'Hey, I'm a filmmaker, have you seen anything I've made?' the answer would be, 'No,' but withSharknadowe became known."[1]Latt added, "We still talk about how to exploit it in every production meeting."[1]
In response to the popularity ofSharknado, Syfy commissioned The Asylum to produce azombietelevision series calledZ Nation, the studio's first foray into episodic content.[1]Loosely based on The Asylum filmRise of the Zombies,Z Nationrevolves around a group of survivors who escort a man who is immune to the zombie virus to the last knownCenters for Disease Controlresearch lab.[1][10]Journalists often comparedZ NationtoThe Walking Dead, especially given The Asylum's penchant for mockbusters.[11][12]Z Nationran for five seasons on Syfy, and was followed by the spinoff seriesBlack SummeronNetflix.[1][10]Bales felt that the production costs forZ Nationwere too high, and decided that The Asylum's next potential television series, titledCrisis Earth, would be written as three separate low-budget films that can then be cut into six individual episodes.[1]The script forCrisis Earthwent up for sale at the 2022American Film Market.[1]
The Asylum's business model revolves around producing as many low-budget films as quickly as possible.[4]Their films usually have a budget of $250,000 to $500,000, and earn $150,000 to $250,000 in profit.[2][4]Since The Asylum produces dozens of films every year, this model generates millions of dollars.[4]From October 2011 to October 2012, The Asylum's revenue totaled $12,000,000 for a 15 percentprofit margin.[4]This model is so successful, that Rimawi claims that they have never lost money on a film.[7]Rimawi stated, "One of the reasons we've remained in business for 25 years is that we make a movie for exactly less than we think we can earn from it ... People say all the time, 'Why don't you make a $20 million original production?' And our answer is because we'd like to stay in business."[1]
The Asylum spends around 4-6 months making a film.[4][13]It starts with The Asylum soliciting 100-wordpitchesfrom freelance screenwriters based on a story concept that the studio's distribution affiliates want.[3][14]As journalist Amanda Hess explained, "If a Japanese DVD company wants a submarine, and Blockbuster needs a monster, the Asylum will make a sailors-meet-sea creature movie, then tweak the concept further to sell to all its potential platforms."[14]The studio then chooses the best pitch, and the chosen screenwriter produces a draft within 10 days.[14]Asylum films are almost always serious in tone despite the far-fetched plots.[5][14]The first script forSharknadofeatured a lot of self-aware humor, but screenwriterThunder Levinsaid that The Asylum wanted every comedic line removed and left a strongly worded note that reiterated thatSharknadowas not a comedy film.[15]
If The Asylum is making a mockbuster, they will target larger films that are based on works or characters in thepublic domain, such asSherlock HolmesorThor.[13][16]Despite the similar titles, the scripts for Asylum mockbuster films often have little to nothing to do with the larger film they are based on.[2]Rolf Potts ofThe New York Timesnoted that although the title of The Asylum filmTransmorpherswas a clear imitation ofTransformers,Transmorphersonly occasionally features shape-shifting robots and devotes more time to a lesbian subplot.[5]Latt said this is because the studio's writers only have a brief outline of what the larger film is going to be about from promotional material.[2]
The Asylum is not affiliated with any industrytrade unionsother than theSAG-AFTRA.[3]This means their employees will sometimes work up to 22 hours a day.[17]Whereas most major studios shoot one page from the script a day, The Asylum shoots around 10 to 12 pages a day.[2][17]Due to the demanding work schedule, The Asylum often hires filmmakers with several years of experience.[2]Around $150,000 of a film's budget is allocated to hiring lesser known actors that would appeal to specific audiences.[2]For example, Rimawi notes that formerBaywatchactors likeDavid Chokachiare popular among European audiences.[2]In an interview withGrantland, Latt stated, "We know not to go afterJohnny Depp. But we'll go after Johnny Depp's cousin. That's fair game."[16]Rimawi further added, "I'm guessing that many of our main actors do this because they have bills to pay, and they want to be in and out as inconspicuously as possible. But the repeat guys have made their peace with what they're doing."[2]
Post-production is handled at The Asylum's headquarters inBurbank, California, which includes its own editing bays and visual effects studios.[2]The visual effects for their films are often poorly rendered, and a constant source of ridicule from critics.[2][16]Tom Breihan ofGrantlandjokingly wrote, "From the looks of things, [The Asylum] also goes after the cousins of thePirates of the Caribbeanspecial-effects team ... At their best, Asylum's in-house effects team can manage something slightly more lifelike than what you'd see on the averageHercules: The Legendary Journeysepisode."[16]The Asylum employs 15 visual effects artists, and they are often working on six films at once.[2]
Marketing campaigns often hype up the absurdity of the film's premise and the studio's overall business model.[14]In 2012, Asylum films would open with the text, "15 years. 100 films. You're Welcome".[16]In a similar vein, the tagline forSharknadowas "Enough Said".[14]Latt described The Asylum's marketing strategy as "a parody of the studio system".[14]Whenever The Asylum makes a mockbuster, they tie the release of their film to coincide with the release of the larger film it's based on.[16]Bales argues that this is not an attempt to deceive consumers, but instead gives consumers more options to watch.[16]The Asylum is upfront about some of their duplicitous marketing strategies.[14]In a 2010 blog post, The Asylum urged fans to add the studio's film to their Netflix queues in order to increase the perception of public demand.[14]The blog post said, "This isn't about trying to get you to watch our movie. This is about gaming the system. This is about taking a stand. Against math."[14]
The Asylum has garnered a discordant and at times controversial reputation within the film industry.[16][18]Nearly all of their films have been panned by critics, and their mockbusters are often belittled as shamelesscash grabs.[3][19]Breihan wrote, "It takes a certain punk-rock panache for a company to unapologetically position itself as a parasite on the movie business."[16]Film producerBrian Grazercompared The Asylum to "pollution in Hollywood, in that you've just got to live with it".[1]Despite their reputation, Bales argues that The Asylum's popularity is multifaceted, and not the result of deceitful marketing tactics.[2][20]To this extent, some journalists have postulated that consumer interest in Asylum films come from a desire to watch campy films, in particular those that fall under the "so bad it's good" label.[19][20]
Some journalists have defended The Asylum.[3][20][21]Greg Hudson ofSharpbelieves that The Asylum's cynical business model is merely a microcosm of the American film industry. Hudson wrote, "Sure, The Asylum makes knock-offs, but so does Hollywood. So does fashion. If culture is a constant exchange of ideas, commerce is the booze that lubricates that discussion. Consider The Asylum a drunken digression."[20]Amy Nicholson ofBoxofficesaid that The Asylum caters to its audience by leaning into the absurdity of their film plots.[16]She usedSnakes on a Planeas an example of a large studio film that disappointed viewers with a predictable ending, whereas The Asylum mockbusterSnakes on a Trainends with a giant snake eating the train.[16]According to Nichsolson, "That's what people who see that kind of movie want to see, and studios don't have the guts to do it."[16]
David Roth ofSlateargues that The Asylum's mockbusters succeed in satirizing the larger films they are based on.[21]Roth used The Asylum filmSir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmesas an example, as he felt that its usage of dinosaurs and dragons as antagonists was intended to mock the action sequences and animal jokes in theGuy RitchiefilmSherlock Holmes.[21]Roth wrote, "The more puffed-up and self-serious and dumb Hollywood blockbusters become, the more they demand to see their goofiness mirrored by cheap, unpretentious, equally dumb knockoffs."[21]
According to The Asylum's website, the studio has released more than 500 films, including 300 original films.[22]Their catalog encompasses virtually every majorgenre, although the studio primarily focuses ondisaster films,horror films, andscience fiction films.[3]Rimawi stated, "The only thing we haven't done is straightdrama. In other words, good films."[2]Among their more notable releases include:

Jamie St John Bamber Griffith[citation needed]was born inHammersmith,London, England, to Ralph and Elizabeth Griffith. His father is from the United States and his mother is fromNorthern Ireland.[1][citation needed]At the time Bamber was born, his father was a management consultant.[2]Bamber has five brothers and one sister, actressAnastasia Griffith.[3]
Bamber was educated atSt Paul's Schoolin London, and graduated with afirstinmodern languages(Italian and French) fromSt John's College, Cambridge, before attending and graduating from theLondon Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. He is fluent in both Italian and French, having spent part of his childhood inParis.[4][better source needed]
Bamber appeared in the 1994 student filmShifting Sands.[5]
Beginning in 2003, Bamber starred asLee 'Apollo' Adamain the re-imaginedBattlestar Galacticathat started as a miniseries and served as abackdoor pilotfor the2004 television serieson the US Sci Fi Channel (nowSyfy). The show received critical acclaim and received aPeabody Award[6]plus a number of nominations in its four-season run; Bamber was nominated for aSaturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on TelevisionforBattlestar Galacticain 2004.[citation needed]
In the role of Lee Adama, Bamber speaks with an American accent which is frequently cited for its accuracy;[7][8]he credits being exposed to his father's American accent from childhood.  He also darkened his hair, in an effort to more closely resembleEdward James Olmos, who plays his character's father. Reciprocally, Olmos worecontact lenseswith blue irises to match Bamber's eyes.[9]
Bamber wrote the foreword for Titan Books'Battlestar Galactica: The Official Companion Season Threeby David Bassom. Of the show's dramatic resonance, he said:
... that's what good drama lets us do. It allows us to see and to feel things we otherwise would not. And great drama allows us to do that on every level: the psychological, the personal and the political. I am proud to say that in the pared down world of Battlestar Galactica there is no plot, no character and no relationship that does not breathe the oxygen of all three levels at once.[10]
Bamber is also well known for his role as DS Matt Devlin, the younger partner of veteran detective DS Ronnie Brooks (Bradley Walsh) onLaw & Order: UKfor the show's first five series, from 2009 to 2011.[11][12]

Bamber guest starred in the second season premiere ofJoss Whedon'sDollhousewhere his character is wed to Echo (played byEliza Dushku) during one of her missions; he also reunited with his Battlestar Galactica co-starTahmoh Penikettin the episode.[14]In the BBC'sOutcasts, Bamber portrayed a hot-tempered expeditionary leader amongst colonists of a distant planet in the late 21st century; though he had been offered a larger part in the series, he elected to take the supporting role in part because he was wary of following upBattlestar Galacticawith another sci-fi series that bore a few similarities.[15]Other TV series in which he has made guest appearances includeCSI: Miami,NCIS,House,Cold Case,Ghost Whisperer,The Last Detective,Body of Proof,Perception,Rizzoli & Isles, and the HBO miniseriesBand of Brothers.
He played the role of detective Caolán Longstreet in17th Precinct,[16]a pilot byGalacticacreatorRonald D. Mooredescribed as a police drama which takes place in a world governed by magic.
