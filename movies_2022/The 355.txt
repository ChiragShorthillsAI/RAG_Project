At a location 150 miles (240 km) south ofBogotá, Colombia, a drug lord presents criminal mastermind Elijah Clarke with a special decryption program drive that can access any digital system on Earth. Clarke double-crosses and kills him just as the authorities raid the mansion. Amid the chaos, ColombianDNIagent Luis Rojas obtains the device.CIAoperative Mason "Mace" Brown is assigned to purchase the drive from Rojas. She heads to Paris with longtime partner Nick Fowler, who is in love with her. The deal goes south when German undercoverBNDagent Marie Schmidt swipes the bag holding the money. Mace chases Marie, who escapes via the subway while Nick is confronted in an alley by Clarke.
AtCIA headquarters, Mace learns that Nick was found dead in the alley. Her superior, Larry Marks, gives her his blessing to retrieve the drive by any means. Mace travels to London to recruit a longtime friend, retired BritishMI6operative Khadijah Adiyeme. Rojas arranges to hand the drive over to Graciela Rivera, a DNI psychologist with no field experience. Marie is pushed to go after the drive by her boss, Jonas Muller, who brings up how Marie's father was a senior BND agent whom she personally turned after discovering that he was a Russian mole.
Mace and Khadijah track Luis and Graciela to a market only for the DNI agent overseeing the handoff to turn on them and kill Luis; before dying, he gives Graciela a phone only she can open that tracks the drive. Both Mace and Marie chase the thief, who escapes. Marie takes Graciela to a safe house with Mace and Khadijah arriving. Khadijah points out they all want the drive and are better off working together. The four track the thief toMorocco, apprehending him and taking out rival mercenaries before handing the drive over to Marks. While celebrating over drinks, news breaks of planes crashing, and cities hit by massive power outages—indicating the drive is in terrorists' hands. They return to the safe house to find Marks dead. After escaping from a CIA assault squad, the women realize they have been framed for Marks' death and the theft of the device.
Under interrogation, the thief reveals that the recent incidents are all part of a "demonstration" for prospective buyers at an illegal black-market auction inShanghai. The group infiltrates the auction where Mace is shocked to discover that not only is Nick alive, but is secretly Clarke's mole in the CIA. The group fails to prevent him from obtaining the device, but a mysterious Chinese woman helps them escape the auction. She identifies herself as Lin Mi Sheng of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and explains that the drive was used as bait to allow her agency to identify the criminals in attendance. She also tells Mace that Marks had been on Clarke's payroll, and that she took the device from Nick during their escape.
Clarke punishes Nick for bringing him a worthless decoy device but gives him a second chance. Nick then captures the group, revealing that he has Muller, Khadijah's boyfriend Ahmed, and Graciela's family as hostages. Nick executes Lin's elderly father in front of the group and has Muller and Ahmed executed on camera. To spare Graciela’s family, Lin surrenders the drive and is abducted by Nick who needs her to authenticate the device.
The other women quickly overcome their grief when they realize that Lin is transmitting her location through a camera in her glasses. Arming themselves, they rescue Lin, shoot Nick, and destroy the drive before getting arrested by local police.
Two months later, Nick, now promoted to a senior rank in the CIA for killing Clarke, returns home to find Mace and the group waiting for him after escaping from custody. Nick passes out from a drug in his drink, having been told he will pay for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in a foreign prison. The women go their separate ways, but suspect they will somehow reunite to fight the corruption of their various agencies.

The concept was built upon and in May 2018, it was announced that Kinberg would direct the film with Chastain producing, in addition to her starring alongsideMarion Cotillard,Penélope Cruz,Fan Bingbing, andLupita Nyong'o.

It was originally scheduled to be released on January 15, 2021, but was pushed back a year from January 15, 2021, to January 14, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[26]before moving up by a week from January 14, to January 7.[27]The film was released through video-on-demand on January 28, 2022.[28]The film began streaming onPeacockon February 22, 2022.

The film's marketing across YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter made around 120 million impressions online beforeThe 355opened in theaters. RelishMix said reactions to its promotional content were "mixed-negative as fans feel like they're being served a bit of a cliché cookie-cutter action package in the spirit ofCharlie's Angelsor 'James Bond's daughters' with a diverse mix of kick-ass supercharged women. Fans of Jessica Chastain, Lupita Nyong'o and Penelopé Cruz are super supportively cheering for success, but amidst the COVID resurge, moviegoers are tapping their finger for Peacock or another streaming service drop date."[2]
The 355grossed $14.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $13.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $27.8 million.[3][4]
In the U.S. and Canada,The 355was projected to gross $2–7 million from 3,145 theaters in its opening weekend.VarietyandBoxoffice Proboth said the film would underperform at the box office, in part due to its 45-day theatrical timeframe, the ongoing success ofSpider-Man: No Way Home, and the rising spread of theOmicron variant.[1][31]
The film earned $1.72 million on its first day, including an estimated $350,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $4.6 million, finishing third at the box office behind holdoversSpider-Man: No Way HomeandSing 2.[32]The film went on to earn $2.3 million in its second weekend,[33]$1.6 million in its third,[34]$1.3 million in its fourth,[35]and $698,275 in its fifth.[36]The 355dropped out of the box office top ten in its sixth weekend, finishing 23rd with $99,615.[37]

The 355garnered negative reviews from critics.[7][38]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 24% of 226 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "It has a stellar cast and it's conceptually progressive, butThe 355squanders it all on a forgettable story, unremarkably told."[39]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 40 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[40]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakreported 76% of audience members gave it a positive score.[2]
Robbie CollinofThe Daily Telegraphdescribed the film as "standard spies-gone-rogue fare repackaged in girl-power wrapping" and "despite the strong cast, this is the film equivalent of a corn-syrup based fizzy drink being passed off as chic in taller, slimmer cans".[41]Mark Olson of theLos Angeles Timespraised the performances of the cast and the "attempt to acknowledge that these women have, need to have, lives outside their jobs, even with an occupation like international intelligence" but concluded the film "feels familiar and a bit tired. Simply having women star in a sluggish iteration of an airport dad-novel espionage-action story is not inspiring on its own."[42]
Kevin MaherofThe Timescriticized it as "lazy" and "box ticking".[43]Empire'sHelen O'Harasaid "Jessica Chastain and director Simon Kinberg team up here to give the world a charismatic, female-centric team of super-spies to balance all those male-led spy thrillers. You just wish the story had been as innovative as the casting, and the twists less screamingly obvious to even those without secret-agent training."[44]Benjamin Lee inThe Guardiandescribed the plot and action sequences as "generic" and concluded "simply replacing male action heroes with women and then standing back waiting for applause isn't quite enough".[45]Clarissa Loughrey inThe IndependentcomparedThe 355negatively to other female-led action thrillersAtomic BlondeandWonder Womanand argued that despite the film's premise of reversing stereotypical portrayals of women in spy movies, it's "a mark of progress only in how wholly unremarkable it feels".[46]David Rooney writing forThe Hollywood Reportersummarized the film as "not without suspense", praising the score and editing, but found the characters underdeveloped and opined "the impulse to put kickass women in charge for a change is commendable, but the journeyman result suggests the pitfalls of starting with the packaging instead of the storytelling inspiration."[38]Christy LemireofRogerEbert.comgave the film a score of one out of four stars, criticizing the action sequences, plot and writing. She furthermore added the film "squanders" the main actresses and described the dialogue as "inane".[47]
In a more positive review, Leah Greenblatt ofEntertainment Weeklysaid the film was "starry, silly escapism with pop-feministflare and a passport".[48]Variety'sOwen Gleibermanwrote, "As action storytelling,The 355is generic, over-the-top, and 20 minutes too long, kind of like a Netflix movie. But it's the well-made version of that corporate brew."[49]Kate Erbland ofIndieWirewrote "'The 355might not be the boundary-busting breakthrough it was sold as, it's something better: a solid spy flick that adds something new to the genre without totally upending it. That's refreshing in its own way."[50]

Her grandfather, Fan Jie, was a general in the naval air force, and her grandmother gave her the Chinese characterbing, or “ice,” to honor the family’s ties to the sea.[10]Fan grew up watching her father, Fan Tao, a pop singer, perform at regional competitions. Her mother, Zhang Chuanmei, was a dancer and an actress. Both were party committee members and served as cadres in the cultural division of the local port authority.[11][12]Fan has a younger brotherFan Chengcheng, who was a member of boy groupNine PercentandNEXT.[13]
In 1995, during her second year at high school, Fan was involved a car accident and spent three months recuperating in a hospital, where she watched the Taiwanese dramaThe Empress of the Dynasty,starringAngela PanasWu Zetian. The drama gave Fan the dream of becoming an actress.[11]Unable to advance to her senior year due to the accident while unwilling to repeat the second year, Fan applied to a performance school,Shanghai Xie Jin-Hengtong School of Arts.[14][15]
Fan debuted in the television seriesPowerful Woman(1997),where she met actressLeanne Liu, who recommended her for the television seriesMy Fair Princess(1998–1999). The two seasons of costume drama, which had initially slated her for one of the major roles as Zi Wei but then assigned her for a supporting role as Zi Wei's handmaiden Jin Suo, became a runaway success and brought her recognition across the Chinese-speaking world.[16]After wrapping up with the shooting of the first season ofMy Fair Princessin 1997,at the age of 16, Fan signed with Chiung Yao, the Taiwanese writier and showrunner ofMy Fair Princess,for 7 years. They broke up in 1999 due to contractual disputes. Fan and her mother filed for termination with the agency, which countersued Fan for unilaterally terminating the contract and demanded a compensation fee ofCN¥1 million. Through court mediation, Fan settled the contract termination with the agency by payingCN¥200,000 in compensation.[17][18]In the same year, she signed a three-year contract with Jia Yun, a Chinese entrepreneur who became her confidant and was later wanted for "illegally absorbing public deposits" in 2007. Jia turned himself in in 2015.[19][20]
From 2001 to 2007, Fan signed withHuayi Brothers. In 2002, Fan established Huairou Fanbingbing Film & Television Art Training School and a production and publicity company, both in the charge of her mother. In 2003, Fan starred inCell Phone, which became China'shighest-grossing filmof the year and earned her theHundred Flowers Award for Best Actress. Fan signed an eight-year contract with Chiung Yao's company, which producedMy Fair Princess. However, as the company had yet to establish any branches in mainland China, many mainland Chinese television advertising firms had to make calls to Taiwan for negotiations, resulting in a waste of time and effort. When Fan and her mother tried to contract, Chiung Yao's company asked forCN¥1 million in compensation; eventually the court ordered Fan to pay CN¥200,000 because the contract was illegal due to her age.[17]
Fan appeared inThe Lion Roars(2002),The Twins Effect II(2004),A Chinese Tall Story(2005), andA Battle of Wits(2006).[21]She received a nomination for Best Actress at the 12thGolden Bauhinia Awardsfor her role in the Chinese-South-Korean-Japanese epic filmA Battle of Wits.[22]In 2006,Forbes Chinaawarded her the Star of the Year.[23]

Since 2018, Fan's career has been derailed by a tax evasion scandal. On May 10, 2018,Feng Xiaogangposted on Weibo a concept poster forCell Phone 2, a sequel to Fan's breakout filmCell Phone(2003). On May 27, former CCTV hostCui Yongyuan, who had a feud with the original film due to its alleged insinuations about his real life, posted on Weibo photos of a contract showing that Fan was paid CN¥10 million. On May 28, Cui further alleged that another actor had signed two contracts for a four-day film shoot—one for CN¥10 million and the other for CN¥50 million—pocketing a total of CN¥60 million. Due to the smaller contract's amount matching Fan's revealed contract from the previous day, many incorrectly believed Cui referred to the same person with two days' revelations and was thus accusing Fan of tax evading through the dual contracts. On May 29, Fan's studio denied the accusation of tax evasion.[70][71]On June 3, China's tax authorities announced that they would investigate Fan's suspected case of tax evasion in light of Cui's posts.[72][73]Cui offered his help to the investigation, but clarified that the CN¥60 million contract did not involve Fan. He also apologized to Fan for subjecting her to the investigation, stating that his targets were Feng Xiaogang andLiu Zhenyun, the director and the writer ofCell Phone.[74]
Questions, concerns, and rumors about Fan's whereabouts grew when she was not seen after a last public appearance on 1 July 2018, and a lack of activity on social media after 23 July.[5][75]According to a later deleted Weibo post by Qiu Ziming, a former journalist forThe Economic Observer, Fan was arrested while consulting a fortune-teller named Shen Aixu, who is known by the epithet “Little Immortal,” atDeji Plazain Nanjing. The session, reportedly arranged by Wu Tiejun, the plaza’s owner, with Fan paying Shen CN¥2 million, was raided by the police, who detained Fan, Shen, and Wu on the spot. To maintain secrecy, they covered Fan’s head, escorted her from the elevator to the parking garage, and transported her to Beijing by police car. When Fan requested to use the restroom during the transfer, officers cleared the area to prevent exposure.[76]In 2021, theWeChatofficial account “Defenders,” a society of defense lawyers, disclosed that Shen, the “Little Immortal” arrested alongside Fan, had been sentenced to 12 years in prison.[77]
In the first week of July 2018, Fan canceled a meeting with a production company, informing them that she had been placed under house arrest.[78]In August, Fan's manager Jersey Chong refuted that Fan had been arrested.[79]On October 3,Xinhua News Agencyannounced that Fan was ordered to pay about CN¥883 million in taxes and penalties for her tax evasion, while her long-time manager, Mu Xiaoguang (original name Mou Enguang), had been "subjected to compulsory measures by public security authorities" for destroying accounting records and obstructing the investigation. On the same day, Fan broke her months-long silence with an apology statement on social media.[80][75]Meanwhile, Taiwan’sMainland Affairs Councilprotested that the Chinese government had not informed the Taiwanese government of the arrest of Mu, a Taiwanese citizen, as required under the Cross-Strait Joint Crime-Fighting and Judicial Mutual Assistance Agreement.[81]Mu remained out of public view until March 2023, when he attended the funeral of his uncle, veteran actor Yun-Peng Shang, in Taipei.[82]Although rumors have suggested that Mu served four years in prison to protect Fan by taking the blame, Chinese authorities have never disclosed whether he was sentenced following his arrest.
Fan's case triggered a tax audit crackdown and reforms in China's entertainment industry. In December 2018, a group of cultural and film industry representatives anonymously issued an open letter to PremierLi Keqiang, questioning the retroactive and punitive taxation methods of theState Taxation Administration.[83]According to Xinhua News Agency, from October 2018 to the end of the year, taxpayers in the entertainment industry "conducted self-inspections," and CN¥11.747 billion in taxes were declared.[84]
Since the tax scandal, Fan has been effectively blacklisted in mainland China, where her films and television works are prohibited from being released, such as the crime filmThe Perfect Blue,directed byCao Baoping, and the historical dramaThe Legend of Ba Qing(akaWin the World).[85]Fan made attempts at a comeback in China with varying degrees of success, with her publicity usually censored orshadowbannedon the Chinese internet. On April 22, 2019, she attended theiQIYINinth Anniversary Gala in Beijing,[86]with photos posted on herInstagramthe next day. This was her first public event after the tax scandal; however, by the time she arrived, the media session had already ended. Her closed-door session included only industry VIPs, with no journalists present. Fan was in attendance at the Shanghai Beauty Summit on 12 July[87]and the 12th China Cosmetic Summit on 22 July.[88]On 27 September, Fan posted on Weibo photos of her attending a promotional event forHongqi E-HS9. However, she was conspicuously missing from the list of celebrity guests in the car company's publicity. She later deleted the post about Hongqi. On November 17, Fan presented an award at the "2020EllemenFilm Hero Awards Ceremony" for the animated filmLegend of Deification.
In the two years following her tax scandal until the end of 2020, Fan filed over 200 infringement lawsuits in China, the majority of which she won. Some defendants, after losing their cases, appealed for a second trial, claiming that as a scandal-hit public figure, her image no longer held commercial value. However, these appeals were also unsuccessful.[89]
In April 2021, following Chinese actressZheng Shuang’s tax scandal, a Weibo user posted in defense of Fan: “I hope the authorities will release the full list of those who contributed to the 11.7 billion yuan in back taxes after Fan Bingbing’s case. Don’t single someone out and crush them completely—publish the entire list and rectify the issue systemically. Stop using the salary cap policy as a smokescreen to fool the audience. I believe exorbitant pay is a systemic issue, and solving it would be truly commendable.” Fan liked the post in Weibo but later unliked it and posted: “This world has never been fair. When you feel something is unfair, you need to accept it as normal. When you feel something is fair, you should consider yourself lucky.”[90]
Unlike many other convicted celebrities in China, after the tax scandal, Fan was allowed to maintain a social media presence, which she parlayed into a successful career running her personal brand, Fan Beauty. Founded not long before her tax scandal, Fan Beauty'sGMVsurpassed 300 million RMB in 2021, 850 million RMB in 2022, and 1.1 billion RMB in 2023.[91][92]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
