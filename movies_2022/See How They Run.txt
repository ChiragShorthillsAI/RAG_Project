See How They Runis a 2022comedymystery filmdirected byTom George, written byMark Chappelland produced byDamian Jonesand Gina Carter. The film starsSam Rockwell,Saoirse Ronan,Adrien Brody,Ruth Wilson,Reece Shearsmith,Harris Dickinson, andDavid Oyelowo.
See How They Runwas theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 9 September 2022 and in North America on 16 September 2022, bySearchlight Pictures. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed $22 million worldwide. It was nominated forOutstanding British Filmat the76th British Academy Film Awards, among other accolades.
In 1953 London,Agatha Christie's playThe Mousetrapcelebrates its 100th performance, and sleazy American director Leo Köpernick has been hired by producerJohn Woolfto direct a film adaptation. After his drunken behaviour towards the female leadSheila Simleads to a fistfight with her husband and co-starRichard Attenborough, Köpernick is killed backstage by an unseen assailant.
Inspector George Stoppard investigates the murder, shadowed by the inexperienced Constable Stalker. Everyone at the theatre is declared a suspect and a potential victim, including the play's producer Petula Spencer and Woolf's wifeEdana Romney. Stoppard attempts to close the theatre until the murder is solved, but theMetropolitan Police Commissioner,Harold Scott, intervenes, assigning Stalker to assist in the investigation.
Stoppard and Stalker search Köpernick's room at theSavoy Hotel, finding his address book of women's details. The hotel manager recalls Köpernick's violent argument with screenwriter Mervyn Cocker-Norris, who admits to arguing with Köpernick over the director's vision for an action-packed ending forThe Mousetrapfilm. Mervyn, who lives with his hot-headed "nephew" Gio, remembers a "plain woman" arriving at the hotel with Köpernick's son.
Stoppard and Stalker question Woolf who was blackmailed by Köpernick after he discovered Woolf's affair with his assistant, Ann. Dennis, an usher at the theatre, offers an unhelpful description of a suspicious figure; Attenborough and Sim are questioned as well. Spencer explains that she optionedThe Mousetrap's film rights to Woolf, but he would be contractually unable to produce the adaptation until the show had closed.
At a pub, Stoppard bonds with Stalker and reveals that his unfaithful wife left him after having a child with another man. Driving a drunken Stoppard home, Stalker finds news articles and a picture of his ex-wife, fitting Mervyn's description of a "homely woman with glasses". Combined with Dennis's description, this leads Stalker to suspect Stoppard may be the killer, and she searches for his ex-wife in Köpernick's address book.
Stoppard and Stalker attend a performance ofThe Mousetrap, during which Mervyn, Woolf, Dennis, Gio, and Stoppard leave the auditorium; Stalker soon follows after watching Stoppard retrieve his gloves. In the foyer, Mervyn is strangled to death by a gloved figure. Stalker spots Stoppard kneeling over the body and gives chase, knocking him unconscious with a snow shovel.
Stoppard awakens in a cell, and Stalker and Scott accuse him of carrying out the murders. Stalker has summoned Joyce, the mother of Köpernick's son, but she is not Stoppard's ex-wife, exonerating him. Stalker escorts Joyce and her son home, and Joyce mentions overhearing a man with a "village idiot" accent. Reading through Mervyn's research onThe Mousetrap, Stoppard realises the identity of the killer and races to the suspect's apartment, where Stalker has already burst inside and found the necessary evidence: the killer is Dennis.
Attenborough, Sim, Woolf, Ann, Spencer, and her elderly mother arrive at the home of Agatha Christie inWallingford, Berkshire, having received invitations to dinner. The butler Fellowes is perplexed by their arrival, but Christie's husband,Max Mallowan, allows them inside. The group is held at gunpoint by Dennis, whom Spencer's mother recognises as Dennis Corrigan, an abused child whosebrother's deathinspired the plot ofThe Mousetrap. Dennis explains that he killed Köpernick and Mervyn in an attempt to stop the play and its adaptation, disgusted by the exploitation of his brother's tragedy for entertainment.
Having forged the invitations to lure everyone together, Dennis has captured Edana, mistaking her for Christie. Christie enters with tea, including a poisoned cup for Dennis which Fellowes inadvertently drinks instead. An armed Stoppard arrives and a shootout ensues; Sim distracts Dennis with amolotov cocktail, and Stalker nearly takes a bullet to save Stoppard, matching Köpernick's story pitch, before Agatha dispatches Dennis with a shovel. It is revealed that the bullet did, in fact, hit Stoppard, though the shot was not fatal. Sometime later, Stalker passes her sergeant's exams and a recovering Stoppard receives theKing's Police and Fire Services Medal, and they attend another performance ofThe Mousetraptogether. At the very end of the film, Stoppard turns to the camera and asks the audience to keep the identity of the killer a secret, as happens at the end of the actual playThe Mousetrap.
The film was announced in November 2020 as an untitled mystery film fromSearchlight Pictures, with Tom George on board to direct from a screenplay byMark Chappell.[1]George and Chappell worked together on later drafts of the script. The decision to make a film based around a thwarted film production ofThe Mousetrapcame after producerDamian Joneswas told the rights to the story were unavailable due to a stipulation in Agatha Christie's original contract, which became a plot point in the film.[2]
Filming was largely conducted in London'sWest Endduring the UK'sthird COVID-19 lockdown, which allowed the production to use locations that would have otherwise been unavailable, including the Savoy Hotel,The Old Vic, theDominion TheatreandSt Martin's Theatre.[3]George filmed a number of scenes with asplit screeneffect, inspired by the "split points of view" of a mystery story.[4]Filming wrapped by April 2021.[5]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 75% of 198 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "See How They Runmay not do itself many favors by asking for Christie comparisons, but this is still one fun whodunit."[15]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 60 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[16]
Teo Bugbee ofThe New York Timespraised the film calling it "a plummy affair, a proper figgy pudding baked out of once-stale Scotland Yard tropes."[17]Nell Minow ofRogerEbert.comgave the film two and a half stars saying "all the stylishness and enthusiasm cannot disguise the fact that the mystery itself never comes close to those concocted by Dame Agatha."[18]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
