As the quartet explore the venue, Ankur warns Rachel about his fear of thebhoota, having heard that they possess any person who defiles their resting place. However, Rachel, Chris, and Kaleb trick Ankur into believing that they are being possessed. An unimpressed Ankur storms off and declares that he hopes the bhoota kills them. The three remaining members produce inflatable sex dolls filled withgelatinand stomp on them to re-enact the stampede that killed B.C.
Suddenly, Kaleb is snatched into the darkness and his bloody, pulverised remains fall from above. Rachel and Chris attempt to escape until the zombified bhoota of B.C. appear and seize their camera. B.C. film themselves as they dismember and decapitate Ankur, Rachel, and Chris.

The effort pays off as Lily is invited by the Beta Sigma Eta sisters to a nearby graveyard where, as part of the hazing ritual, she is dared to spend the night buried inside a coffin.
The sisters' leader Annie explains that it is meant to re-create anurban legendwhere another freshman,Giltine, was dared to commit the same deed to enter the sorority twenty years earlier. Giltine was forgotten by her classmates for a week and was rumored to have crawled into the underworld when the empty coffin was unearthed.
Lily enters the coffin with a box—whose content she is told will provide reassurance if her resolve falters—and a camera to film her ordeal; she opens the box to discover it contains several spiders. Terrified, Lily demands to be let out, but the sisters laugh at her torment. A sudden rainstorm commences just as a police car arrives to investigate the noises. The sisters flee and agree to exhume Lily in the morning. The officers make an investigation but leave, unable to hear Lily's muffled cries for help.
As the storm continues, the coffin is partially flooded by rainwater. When the water stops rising, Giltine's ghoulish spirit punches through the lid of the coffin and attacks Lily.

During anobstacle course, Donna—whose wish is to help her poverty-stricken family leave their run-down neighborhood—suffers a seriousopen fractureto her leg and loses after the host does not stop the game so her injury can be properly tended to.
Sometime later, afterOzzy's Dungeonwas cancelled, the show's former host awakens, stripped and locked in a dog cage, in the basement of Donna's domineering mother Debra, who is gradually revealed to have groomed her daughter to win the show at all costs. With the help of her browbeaten husband Marcus, their son Brandon, and Donna—who was left crippled after the incident, her leg becominggangrenous—, Debra has the host filmed while he is forced through several torturous versions of the challenges from the show, threatening to douse him with acid if he refuses to comply.
When the host fails to complete the final challenge, Debra attempts to inject him with a syringe full of acid, but the host offers to bring the family to Ozzy and have their wish granted. The group then drives to the empty studio whereOzzy's Dungeonwas filmed and the host leads the family inside through the rear entrance. The door is opened by the host's former assistant and it leads to a cave. Inside, the family discovers Ozzy on an altar, being worshipped by the assistant and people dressed in the attire of the show's contestants. As Donna is brought before Ozzy to tell him her wish, Ozzy undergoesmetamorphosis, with his outer body splitting open to reveal a vaguely humanoid, spindly creature.
Granting Donna's wish, Ozzy proceeds to fire anenergy beamout of his eye to melt the faces of the host and Donna's family, killing them all, while Donna smiles at the camera as the footage ends.
Once more with the soldiers getskissing sexually, but the grey businessman watches and reacts so disgusting, but instead the interruption comes back that he reveals to be non-college student Dylan, Brady's old brother. Brady, who has apparently been using Dylan's camera without permission; and then he abruptly snatches it back with obviously much more important things to triggering sequences.
Young teenager Brady filmsstop motionvideos of toy soldiers—the animations depicted in-between the film's segments—with his older brother Dylan's camera. While Brady records his latest video, Dylan takes the camera, which he uses to film himself practicingpick-up lineswith his friends Kurt, Mark, and Boner. The quartet exclude Brady from their activities, thinking him to be a hopeless loser, and go out to pull pranks on the neighborhood residents and perform tricks at the local skatepark.
After concealing the camera to get secretup-skirt photos, the quartet become fixated on Sandra, an attractive blonde woman who has moved into the house across the street and whose yard is decorated with several stonebusts. Brady later meets and befriends Sandra, who invites him into her house while he attempts to roller-skate, much to Dylan's shock and jealousy. The quartet compliment Brady for his newfound relationship with Sandra and beg him for information. Brady explains that Sandra invited him to help set up a newwebcamand is enlisted to install aspywareon her computer and hack into her webcam in hopes ofseeing her nude.
Brady reluctantly agrees and goes to Sandra's house that night. He installs the spyware despite being wracked with guilt for betraying her trust. As Brady leaves the room, the quartet watch Sandra through the webcam while she undresses. They became horrified when Sandra rips off her scalp to uncover a hair made of snakes—revealing that she is actually agorgon. She also notices what the quartet is doing and leaps from her window to their house.
Medusa breaks into Dylan's room and kills Kurt, Mark, and Boner while Dylan flees. Brady attempts to reason with Medusa but she does not accepts his apology and turns him into stone, then proceeds to petrify Dylan as well. Now Medusa is fully transformed, she slowly approaches the camera, stuck in Dylan's stony hand, as the footage ends.
OnNew Year's Eve, videographer best friends Nate and Troy are hired by a coven of witches to film them performing a ritual where a woman named Kirsten volunteers to be offered as a vessel to a powerful demon known as Ukabon. Despite agreeing, Nate is skeptical of them and thinks that the ritual may be a prank. The witches tell the duo that they will not actually summon Ukabon until the stroke of midnight on the new millennium, when the veil between Earth andHellis at its thinnest.
As the ritual begins, Ferkus—an uninvited demon who has disrupted the witches' rituals before—makes its presence known. The witches attempt to cast it out, but Ferkus grabs Nate and Troy and drags them underneath the witches' altar. As the camera glimpses Ferkus retreating, Troy learns that he and Nate have been sent to Hell. The duo encounter bloodthirsty demons, hazardous traps, and mutilated bodies spread throughout the cavernous landscape. They also cross paths with Mabel, a damned soul who speaks inarchaic termsand explains that they are irresistible to hungry demons due to their mortality.
Mabel decides to help the duo escape by leading them to Ukabon, whom she hates, in exchange for both writing her name in the witches' spell book. Since Ukabon is the only conduit through which the duo can return to Earth, they have only minutes to find him before they are stuck in Hell for eternity. While trekking, Nate, Troy, and Mabel encounter more demons and eventually enter a cave where they find Ukabon, surrounded by a cult of masked demons, preparing to enter Kristen's body. The cultists attack the trio, but they manage to kill them.
As midnight rapidly approaches, the duo shout at Mabel to come with them to Earth, but she is fatally stabbed by Ukabon and reminds them to write her name in the book before dying. The duo jump inside Ukabon's cavernous stomach just as the witches' ritual commences. The duo successfully return to Earth, albeit with Nate possessing Kirsten's body; furious that their ritual has failed, the witches kill both Nate and Kirsten and argue about what went wrong. Troy attempts to flee, but is fatally wounded with ascythe. He uses his blood to write Mabel's name in the book, then succumbs to his injuries as the footage ends.
The tape returns to the previous segment; Dylan's and Brady's stone corpses are shown before the camera's battery goes black and dies in hours.
In the credits, the witches can be heard performing their long-ritual again, this time calling Mabel's name, ahinting towards the sequelthat she will also return to Earth before the interlude shortly begins in second and he's crushed by an army tank earlier after the soldier searches about fails to notice at the another one.
In September 2021, producer Josh Goldbloom stated that a sequel would only be possible ifV/H/S/94proved successful with streaming audiences.[4]Soon after its release via Shudder,V/H/S/94broke viewership records for the streaming company, which prompted a rush to produce a sequel in time for the following year.[5]
The film was believed to be titledV/H/S/85following a deleted social media post by actorFreddy Rodriguezin April 2022.[6][7]The streaming serviceShudderwas to handle distribution, as it did with the previous installment.[8]However, official confirmation of the film, titledV/H/S/99, came in July 2022 fromBloody Disgusting, who co-produced the film alongsideStudio71,Radio Silence Productions, and Cinepocalypse Productions.[9]The film was described to take place in the "finalpunk rockanalogdays ofVHS".[10]Flying Lotus,Johannes Roberts, Vanessa and Joseph Winter, Maggie Levin, and Tyler MacIntyre were announced as directors, with Goldbloom,Brad Miska,David Bruckner,Chad Villella,Matt Bettinelli-Olpin,Tyler Gillett, and James Harris serving as producers.[11]The apparentV/H/S/85was instead another entry in the franchise, which was officially announced on October 8, 2022. David Bruckner, Scott Derrickson, Gigi Saul Guerrero, Natasha Kermani, and Mike P. Nelson were announced as directors, with a 2023 release window by Shudder.[12]
Goldbloom revealed that the first pitch to Shudder by the producers was a film set duringChristmas, tentatively titledV/H/Xmas,as well as a film set during medieval times. Shudder ultimately rejected these pitches in favor ofV/H/S/99.[13]
V/H/S/99premiered on September 16, 2022 in the Midnight Madness category of the2022 Toronto International Film Festival.[14]Its US debut was at the2022 Fantastic Feston September 25, 2022.[15]The film also screened at the 2022Sitges Film Festivalin Barcelona on October 12, 2022, and at the 2022Brooklyn Horror Film Festivalon October 14, 2022.[16][17]The film was released onShudderon October 20, 2022.[18]

Craig Engler, GM of Shudder said “By every metricV/H/S/99has been a wild success, with subscribers watching in record numbers and debating with each other on social media about which segment of the anthology was their favorite. We are thrilled that the revival of the series continues to be embraced by our audience, and already looking forward to next year’sV/H/S/85.”[21]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 76% of 54 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6/10. The website's consensus reads: "Like most anthologies,V/H/S/99has its ups and downs -- but more often than not, this collection of shorts continues the franchise's recent creative rebound."[22]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 58 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[23]
Matt Donato ofIGNpraised the film as "the biggest gamble in theV/H/Sfranchise yet," commending the use of practical effects and the depiction of common phobias, such as thefear of spidersor being buried alive, to generate anxiety and terror.[24]He concluded by stating that "V/H/S/99capitalizes on frenzied found-footage fun, howls with blitzkrieg chaos, and keeps exploding like a firecracker bundle that loves to watch you wince," and rating it 7/10.[24]
Writing forDread Central, Emily Gagne stated that the film "may be the simplest and most streamlinedV/H/Ssequel yet." She praised the production design and the nostalgia factor that is incorporated into the film, affirming that "[V/H/S/99]has the potential to become a slumber party touchstone," and rating it 3/5 stars.[25]In a review for That Shelf, critic Victor Stiff praised the film, stating that "[V/H/S/99is] one of the rare horror anthologies with solid movies across the board. All five shorts give audiences something meaty to feast on."[26]
In a mixed review forVariety, critic Dennis Harvey wrote that "[t]he best episodes are merely good enough, and the worst just tiresome."[27]Harvey praised the "amusing stop-motion animations of toy soldiers" that serve as the film's interludes between segments, but concluded thatV/H/S/99"provides a watchable but underwhelming franchise clock-punch with no memorable highpoints."[27]
A sequel was officially announced on October 8, 2022 at aNew York Comic Condiscussion panel promotingV/H/S/99. Much like its predecessor, the film was released as a Shudder Original, with directorsDavid Bruckner,Scott Derrickson,Gigi Saul Guerrero,Natasha Kermani, and Mike P.

Each of the La EPs features remixes and unreleased tracks from his Los Angeles Album. The third in that series (titled L.A. EP 3 X 3), marked a new atmospheric style in his sound. The same year, Flying Lotus also remixed "Reckoner" fromIn Rainbows,an album byRadiohead.[25]
His third studio album,Cosmogramma, was released in the UK on May 3, 2010, and in the US on May 4, 2010.[26]In January 2011,Cosmogrammawon in the Dance/Electronica Album category in the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards.[27]The multi-award-winningCosmogrammawas a hard-hittingafrofuturisticshrine to soul, hip-hop, jazz and IDM but, with more emphasis on a lyrical message than ever before. The album was accompanied by live instrumentation (Thundercaton bass,Miguel Atwood-Fergusonon strings, Rebekah Raff on harp) and live vocalists (Thom Yorke,Laura Darlington) – all picked to help communicate the spiritual musical lineage of Ellison's family (Ravi Coltrane, himself, played tenor sax). Stephen Bruner, aka Thundercat, who is featured extensively on Cosmogramma, would later become a large part of future albums by Flying Lotus.

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
