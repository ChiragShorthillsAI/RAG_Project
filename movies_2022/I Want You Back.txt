InAtlanta, thirty-somethings Peter and Emma are each dumped by their respective romantic partners: Peter's girlfriend Anne feels stifled by the complacency of their six-year relationship, and Emma's boyfriend Noah is discouraged by her lack of responsibility.
Peter and Emma are both heartbroken, but after a chance meeting they become friends and try to help one another navigate their breakups. She confides in him that she considered Noah her "airplane safety mask person": the person she loved so much that she'd put on hisemergency airplane oxygen maskbefore her own, which Peter dismisses as a silly thing to ever do.
One desperate night, Emma and Peter devise a strategy to win back their exes by breaking up their new relationships: Emma will seduce Anne's new boyfriend Logan, and Peter plans to befriend Noah to convince him to breakup with his new girlfriend Ginny. Peter gets Noah to be hispersonal trainer, while Emma volunteers for Logan'smiddle schoolproduction ofLittle Shop of Horrors.
Peter and Emma also grow closer; he reveals his dream of opening his ownnursing homeand she admits her lack of ambition is linked to her father'sterminal illness. Peter and Noah bond, while Emma successfully impresses Logan by pretending to share his love of theatre, stunning him with a passionate performance of "Suddenly, Seymour". She also helps a troubled student, Trevor, by providing him with guidance for navigating his father'sextramarital affair.
After visiting anightclubtogether, Peter convinces Noah to go home and takeMDMAwith three girls, only to learn the girls areminors. After fleeing, Noah tells Peter he is going to propose to Ginny, to Peter's dismay. Peter breaks into Ginny and Noah's to plant fake evidence of Noah's infidelity but can't do it, and instead witnesses Noah's heartfelt proposal.
Meanwhile, Emma manages to talk an eager Logan and a hesitant Anne into attempting athreesome, but Anne ultimately expresses her discomfort and leaves, having decided she wants to get back with Peter. Reconvening, Peter tells Emma of Noah's engagement and, because he is resuming his relationship with Anne, remorsefully cuts contact with her, who is left heartbroken.
Unbeknownst to either of them, Peter and Emma are both invited to Noah's wedding inSavannahand they bring Anne and Logan as their dates. As Peter and Emma awkwardly touch base, she reveals that she has moved out and is studying to become aschool counselor.
An embarrassing encounter ensues between all, and Peter realizes Anne never believed in him, while Emma did, leading him to confess his love for her in front of everyone. Emma reveals they conspired to break up each other's new partners, but says she does not reciprocate feelings for Peter (although her tears say otherwise). Anne and Logan break up with Peter and Emma, while Ginny demands they leave the wedding and Noah punches Peter.
The following morning, both Peter and Emma get closure with Anne and Noah. Peter and Emma are on the same flight home, when heavyturbulencecauses the oxygen masks to fall, and he rushes out of his seat to help her put her mask on first before his. As the turbulence subsides, Emma and Peter's eyes connect and they smile at one another.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
