The Black Phoneis a 2021 Americansupernatural horror film[3]directed byScott Derrickson, and written by Derrickson andC. Robert Cargill. It starsMason Thamesas Finney, a teenage boy abducted by a serial child killer known colloquially as The Grabber (Ethan Hawke). When Finney encounters a mystical blackrotary phonein captivity, he uses it to plot his escape by communicating with the ghosts of The Grabber's slain victims.Madeleine McGraw,Jeremy Davies, andJames Ransonealso feature in the principal cast. Derrickson and Cargill producedThe Black Phonein association withBlumhouse ProductionsCEOJason Blum.Universal Picturesoversaw the film's commercial distribution, and funding was sourced through a Universal–Blumhouse co-production pact and tax subsidies from the North Carolina state government.
The idea ofThe Black Phonearose from Derrickson and Cargill's adaptation ofJoe Hill'sshort story of the same name. Derrickson struggled to produce additional ideas that supplemented the short story, shifting his attention to other filmmaking endeavors. The film remained dormant until he resigned fromDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness(2022) over creative differences. Derrickson used his childhood experiences in suburban Denver, Colorado, to developThe Black Phonestory.Principal photographybegan in February 2021 on a $16–18 million budget, and wrapped the following month. Shooting took place on sets and on location inWilmington, North Carolina.Mark Korvencomposed the film's score, which drew on modern and vintagesynthesizersounds.
The Black Phonepremiered atFantastic Feston September 25, 2021, and opened in US theaters after several delays on June 24, 2022. It was an unexpected hit at the box office and finished its theatrical run grossing $161.4 million globally. The film received generally positive reviews from the critics, who praised its performances but were divided on its concept. The success ofThe Black Phonespawned the in-canon short film "Dreamkill", also directed by Derrickson and written by him and Cargill, released in 2023 as part of theanthology filmV/H/S/85. A sequel,The Black Phone 2, is scheduled for release on October 17, 2025.
In 1978, a local serialchild abductorand murderer known only as "The Grabber" prowls the streets of a suburb inNorth Denver, Colorado. Meanwhile, Finney Blake and his younger sister Gwen live in the area with their abusive, alcoholic father Terrence, whose wife died by suicide after having a series of disturbingpsychicdreams. Finney is frequently tormented and harassed at school, but his friend and classmate Robin fends off the bullies.
Having inherited her mother's ability, Gwen dreams about the Grabber's abduction of Bruce, a boy Finney knew fromLittle League. Two police detectives, Wright and Miller, interview Gwen at school, believing she may know the Grabber. When Terrence learns about the questioning, he gives Gwen a beating. Soon afterward, the Grabber abducts first Robin and then Finney.
Finney awakens in a soundproofed basement with a disconnected blackrotary dialtelephone on one wall. It begins to ring on its own at times; Finney hears only static when he first answers it, but then hears Bruce's voice telling him about a floor tile he can remove to dig an escape tunnel. Finney starts to dig, but the house's foundations are sunk too deeply for him to go beneath them.
The Grabber brings Finney a meal and leaves the basement door unlocked. As Finney is about to sneak out, he gets a call from Billy, another past victim. Billy warns Finney that the Grabber is waiting at the top of the basement stairs to punish him if he tries to leave, as part of a cruel game. At Billy's suggestion, Finney uses a hidden length of cable to climb up to the basement window; however, his weight pulls out the grate covering the pane, leaving him with no way to reach it again.
As Gwen confides to Terrence about her dreams of Finney's abduction, Wright and Miller question an eccentric man named Max who is staying in the area with his brother and has shown great interest in the Grabber's crimes. It is revealed that Finney is being held in Max's basement and that the Grabber is his brother.
Finney receives a call from Griffin, a third victim, who gives him the combination to the lock securing the house's front door and tells him that the Grabber has fallen asleep. He sneaks out and unlocks the door, but the Grabber quickly recaptures Finney after his dog Samson barks to wake him. A fourth victim, a juvenile delinquent named Vance, calls to tell Finney he can break through a wall and into a freezer in the adjacent room. Finney does so but finds the freezer door locked. As Finney despairs over his fate, he receives one last call from Robin, who urges him to stand up for himself and fight back by packing the phone receiver with dirt to use as a bludgeon.
After seeing the Grabber's house in a vision, Gwen calls Wright and Miller to give them the address. The police rush to the house and find the bodies of the Grabber's victims buried in the basement. Meanwhile, Max realizes Finney is being held in the basement and rushes to free him, but the Grabber kills him with an axe and attacks Finney, having decided to end his game. Finney uses the byproducts from his previous escape attempts to trap the Grabber in a pit he has dug, beats him with the receiver, and breaks his neck with the phone cord as his past victims taunt him.
Throwing a steak from the freezer to Samson as a distraction, Finney leaves the house, which turns out to be across the street from the one the police have raided. Gwen sees Finney walk out and rushes to embrace him. Terrence tearfully begs Finney and Gwen to forgive his earlier treatment of them. Sometime later, now viewed as a hero at school, a newly confident Finney sits next to his crush in class and says she can call him Finn.
The Black Phoneemerged from filmmakersScott DerricksonandC. Robert Cargill's adaptation ofJoe Hill'sshort story of the same name, published in the horror anthology20th Century Ghosts(2005). Derrickson came across20th Century Ghostsshortly after its initial US release.[4]The director was eager to conceive a film faithful to "The Black Phone", which fascinated him in its framing of a conventional serial killer story, but struggled to produce ideas of his own devising.[4][5]He shelved the project to focus on his professional relationship with Cargill, forged fromSinister(2012), and his contractual obligations toMarvel Studiosas director ofDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness(2022).[6]Cargill briefly pitched for a replacement director in the interim, stopping once Derrickson convinced him to wait until he was available to commit.[6]Their collaboration resumed after Derrickson resigned fromDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madnessover disputes about the film's artistic direction.[6][7]
To bolsterThe Black Phone'sstory, Derrickson used his upbringing in suburbanDenver, Colorado, as a major source of inspiration.[8]He gleaned from people in his everyday life to shape the characters, their circumstances, and the film's depiction of suburbia, including a child whose mother was raped, murdered, and disposed of in a lake wrapped in phone wire.[8][9]The director described the area he grew up in as aworking classneighborhood with "a lot of violence—everybody got whipped by their parents, there was fighting on the way to school, on the way home from school, at school."[9]Derrickson raised the idea of a semi-autobiographical horror story as he was processing traumatic childhood experiences in therapy.[10]He also investigatedThe 400 Blows(1959) andThe Devil's Backbone(2001) for their depiction of resilience and kinship among children.[9]
Agents scouted hundreds of child actors forThe Black Phone'sstarring roles.[10]They ultimately hiredMason ThamesandMadeleine McGrawas the first significant casting choices,[11][12]from auditions conducted onZoomas a result of the ongoingCOVID-19 pandemic.[5][13]McGraw was considered among four actresses, and when a prior commitment toDisney's television seriesSecrets of Sulphur Springsforced her to pull out, the producers postponed filming ofThe Black Phoneby several months to accommodate her schedule.[5][14]Casting for Finney was not as immediate of an undertaking. It took months for the filmmakers to survey the actors—first through talent agencies in New York and Los Angeles, then an open call—before they were shown Thames'sdemo reels.[14]Even though Thames lacked acting experience,The Black Phonebeing his film debut, he reportedly stood apart from others in his ability to emote and take direction.[14]Due to the amount of violence and profanity in the script, Derrickson carefully broached the subject to Thames, McGraw, and their parents in preparation for scenes.[4][15]
By early 2021, the starring cast featuredJeremy Davies,Ethan Hawke, andJames Ransone, the latter two in their second film with Derrickson afterSinister.[16][17][18]The director and Cargill did not envision one particular actor as The Grabber in their original character treatments, but sent Hawke the script because they had a rapport.[6]Hawke was disinclined to play villainous parts as he feared beingtypecast.[6]YetThe Black Phonestory resonated with the actor, and the idea of The Grabber being concealed by a mask further enticed him.[6][19]Hawke's experience on the set ofSinisterwas another influence shaping his decision.[20]He developed his performance by honing expression in his voice and body.[19]Derrickson did not have many discussions with Hawke regarding The Grabber's portrayal because he felt showing him the mask would best yield their desired interpretation.[20]
Principal photographybegan on February 9, 2021 inWilmington, North Carolina, under the pseudonymStatic.[21][22]A private residence used for interior and exterior shots was the shoot's initial location.[23]The production base was confined mostly toEUE/Screen Gems's local film studio, from sets portraying The Grabber's basement, and adjacent neighborhoods.[24]Estimates to realize the shoot ran between $16–18 million,[25][26]the budget partially funded by a $4.7 milliontransferable tax crediton in-state costs from the North Carolina government.[23]Elsewhere regionally, shooting occurred inNew Hanover,Brunswick, andColumbuscounties.[27]Filming forThe Black Phoneended on March 27, 2021.[28]
Brett Jutkiewicz wasThe Black Phone'sdirector of photography. Jutkiewicz had just finished filmingScream(2022) when he received the script from his agent. Derrickson approached him in mid-December 2020 to discuss ideas raised from Jutkiewicz's reading ofThe Black Phonescript. They also bonded from discussing Jutkiewicz's work in the satirical horror filmReady or Not(2019), which had impressed Derrickson. After an interviewing period, the producers formally contracted Jutkiewicz that January.[29]Derrickson's instruction was to implement a look evoking the 1970s period in which the film is set. The production used source material, such as New York-set 1970s movies, not so much to glean textural ideas as to establish the appropriate tone for the setting and storytelling.[29]This, according to Jutkiewicz, meant experimenting withcolor gradingtechniques to produce a high contrast, muted, but not desaturated, visual palette.[29]To achieve this image quality, and to reduce the picture's range ofhues, filmmakers mixed colors using specializedlookup tables(LUT).[29]The choice of LUTs was contingent on the brightness of sets; for example, Jutkiewicz employed a darker LUT to preserve the image palette of dimly-lit basement scenes.[29]
The camera crew shot much ofThe Black PhoneinSuper 8 format, an established practice of Derrickson's repertoire, usingBolexcameras.[20][29]They prepared by testing the utility of footage inKodak's color negative film stock—theVision3 500T 5219/7219, Vision3 50D 7203, and Vision3 250D 5207/7207. Lighting determined the film stock deployed for the shooting.[29]Jutkiewicz said that he at first struggled working in Super 8 format as he had to reacquaint with old filmmaking methods.[29]
VFX Legion was responsible forThe Black Phone'svisual effects, in their second project with Derrickson.[30]Development of the visual effects began in pre-production, under the supervision of VFX Legion co-founders James David Hattin and Nate Smalley. Their work for the film comprised 200 shots ofmatteanddigital compositingeffects, such asgreen screening, set extensions, superimposedpractical stunt effects, camera transitions,computer-generated imagery(CGI), and rig removal.[30]Maya,Nuke,Houdini, andRedshiftwere among the software used to handle rendering and animation tasks. VFX Legion was also present on set to critique the shoot and rectify problems with the filmmaking.[30]
One of the special effect team's most complex assignments was rendering the stunt of a Grabber victim's violent retreat to the spiritual realm. VFX Legion supervisor Ken Johnson managed the scene's filming on set. VFX Legion then developed adigital modelof the actor from a 3D scan animated withretopologizedgraphics and textures, allowing them to employragdoll physicsfor fluid movement. This was a labor intensive process because the filmmakers wanted the movement of the digital model to project a loss of control, and the stunt's combined animation to be slow enough to show that the victim was being forced into a void.[30]Another challenging sequence saw VFX Legion modify in-hometracking shotswith CGI, which entailed altering theframe rateof footage to maintain a continuously steady speed.[30]
Designing The Grabber's masks became a core goal, in part becauseBlumhouse Productionsplanned to showcase them in ads for the film.[31]While the script detailed a prototype of two worn leather masks painted with a smiling and a frowning devil, this concept evolved when Derrickson proposed the addition of a mouthless mask. They convey despair, joy, andnihilityin exaggerated form, reminiscent oftragic comic masks of ancient Greek theatre.[32]Derrickson and Blumhouse producer Ryan Turek solicited five visual effects companies for the mask-making, including Callosum Studios, a Pittsburgh-based studio founded by prosthetic makeup artists Jason Baker andTom Savini.[31][32][33]Of the illustrations submitted, Callosum's most closely resembled the vision of the producers. Savini and Baker were engaged to handle the creation of up to 30 masks forgags, stunts, specific scenes, and pandemic mitigation, in a process that lasted a month. The approval of sketches took about two weeks, followed by the construction of pieces in about a day or two.[32]The filmmakers drew on diverse material for reference, among them ceramic masks, circus masks, antique dolls,William Hickey'sConey Island Barker, the horror filmMr. Sardonicus(1961), and the exaggerated grin ofConrad Veidt's Gwynplaine in thesilentfilmThe Man Who Laughs(1928).[31][32]
Derrickson imagined the mouthless mask after Hawke was hired, since he wanted the actor's face to be partially displayed in some ofThe Black Phone.[20]He developed the design further by envisioning scenarios that examined The Grabber's motivations, his choice of masks in interactions with Finney, et cetera.[32]The fully realized concept surfaced from Savini's original sketches, at which point the filmmakers began contemplating age, consistency, and the application of each mask.[20]They constructed the pieces frommoldingsof procuredlife masksof Hawke's face, a task complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Callosum conducted the face casting sessions in Hawke's home office in New York because the actor was not comfortable traveling. They then sculpted masks from their Pittsburgh studio before returning to New York for test fittings.[32]The finished pieces were created from afiberglass-resinmixture paneled withfeltand foam padding. As well, the filmmakers constructed replicas for stunts out of lightweight rubber andlatex.[32]
The Black Phonecame to composerMark Korven's attention once his agent and Blumhouse had correspondence. Derrickson outlined the film'spastichemusical approach in early conversations, calling for a score drawing on modern and vintagesynthesizer-heavy sounds.[34]Korven's objective was to tie together the music and subtext, chiefly themes of fear, confinement, and the perils of thehuman condition, to highlight The Grabber.[34][35]He developed The Grabber's character motifs with abrasive strings accompaniments and friction noise produced from rubbingmalletson rough surfaces.[34]The other characters were of minor focus except for "lighter, more feminine" tones for Gwen-centric scenes and a strings arrangement that accompanied the film's resolution.[34][35]
The Black Phonepremiered atFantastic Feston September 25, 2021.[36]The film screened at theAero TheatreinSanta Monicafor the 9th Beyond Fest that October and, in the next year, headlinedNew Orleans'Overlook Film Festivalas the event's closing title.[37][38]It finished its festival itinerary at the2022 Tribeca Festival, part of the fest's late-night lineup.[39]Universal PicturesreleasedThe Black Phonein US theaters on June 24, 2022,[40]after delaying the film twice from its scheduled early 2022 release.[41][42]The studio's marketing campaign promoted the viewing experience rather than the film's actors or story elements.[43]They began the promotional cycle in August 2021 with atrade showexhibit atCinemaCon, where the first teaser trailer debuted.[44][45]The official trailer was released in October 2021.[46]Derrickson unveiled the theatrical release poster in conjunction withThe Black Phone'sFantastic Fest premiere, sporting the tagline, "Never talk to strangers."[47]
Universal releasedThe Black Phoneondigital formatson July 14, 2022,Blu-rayandDVDon August 16, and4K Ultra HD Blu-rayon October 3, 2023.[48][49][50]Physical copies contain deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes analyses about production, cinematography and The Grabber, and a short film titledShadowprowler.[51]It was the third-best selling DVD and Blu-ray release in its first week of US sales, selling 34,985 copies and earning $855,633.[52]The Black Phoneis also available to authenticated subscribers ofNBCUniversal's streaming servicePeacock.[53]
The Black Phonewas considered a box office success, as studios anticipated meager profits for theaters screening lower-budget films, closed as a consequence ofCOVID-19 pandemic control measures.[54]The film finished its theatrical run grossing $90.1million in the United States and Canada (55.8% of its earnings) and $71.3million internationally (44.2%), for a global total of $161.4million.[55]Of this figure, $67.8million was estimated to have been yielded by Blumhouse and Universal innet profit, factoring in advertising, production, interest, administrative overhead,residuals, and miscellaneous costs.[56]
After securing $3 million from advanced screenings, the film received a wide release across 3,150 theaters in the United States.[57]It opened as the fourth-highest grossing movie of the week with $23.3 million, moderately exceeding the pre-release estimates of $15–20 million.[57][58]About $1.7 million of this figure came from Los Angeles-area cinemas alone. New York, Dallas, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, San Francisco, Phoenix, Philadelphia, and Washington also represented much of the film's biggest takings.[59]Exit polling conducted during opening night revealed the average opinion moviegoers gave the film was positive, ranging from a B+ onCinemaScoreto an 86% score onPostTrak.[59]Audiences skewed younger, and the main reasons given to see the film were the trailer, the Blumhouse connection, and Hawke.[59]The following weekend saw the theater count peak to 3,156 despite box office figures dropping by 48%, andThe Black Phonefinished the third week as the number six film with $7.66 million.[60][61]In the fourth weekend, the film slipped further to the number seven position with a gross of $5.3 million, its theater count narrowing to 2,271.[62]The Black Phoneremained one of the top ten highest-grossing films for seven consecutive weeks.[63]By August 2022, the film's domestic gross topped $85.8 million.[64]
The Black Phonedebuted overseas grossing $13.4 million from 45 countries, for a total sum of $35.8 million.[58]Mexico comprised the largest portion of earnings with $3.4 million, reportedly one of the country's all time biggest-opening grosses for a horror film, followed by the United Kingdom ($1.7 million), the Middle East ($1.4 million, including $700,000 from Saudi Arabia), France ($800,000), and Spain ($600,000).[65]Second week earnings dropped by just 28% to $8.3 million, thanks to the film's continued global rollout and sustained momentum in Mexico, Europe, and Saudi Arabia.[66]Expansion into Australia ($1.54 million), Brazil ($1.3 million), and several overseas markets buoyedThe Black Phone'sperformance in the week of July 24, grossing $6.9 million.[67]By September 11, the film's offshore gross exceeded $69.7 million.[68]
The Black Phoneopened to mostly favorable reviews.[69]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 81% of 268 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.0/10. The website's consensus reads: "The Black Phonemight have been even more frightening, but it remains an entertaining, well-acted adaptation of scarily good source material."[70]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[71]
A commonly discussed aspect in the media was the scriptwriting. They were inclined to compareThe Black Phoneto Hill's short story based on tone and style, with critics saying the film script augmented ideas faithful to the source material.[a]Another point of notice was the script's treatment of a traditional serial killer story in the approach and period setting,[75][77]whichChicago Sun-Timesstated made for "one of the better cinematic nightmares in recent years".[78]On the other hand, the media differed over the handling of ideas, often singling out the film's supernatural elements for further scrutiny, with one review fromVarietyclaiming its emphasis undermined tension-building in the story.[79]Others were unanimous in their opinion thatThe Black Phone'sdepicted concept fell short of their expectation.[b]Plodding characterization and pacing was ascribed to mistakes in the writing,[84]although theLos Angeles Timessingled out intense basement-set conversational scenes with Finney as the film's most compelling moments.[85]The harshest reviews accusedThe Black Phoneof being repetitive, tasteless, and "tortuously overwritten".[86][87][84]
Hill pitched Derrickson follow-up ideas examiningThe Black Phonecharacters as early as June 2022.[94]Derrickson discussed the possibility of a sequel further while embarking on the press tour forThe Black Phone.[95]The film's success lead to immediate negotiations that August, and by October 2023, Universal commissionedThe Black Phone 2with a scheduled release date of June 27, 2025.[96][97]Derrickson and Cargill will resume their screenwriting duties, while Hawke, Thames, McGraw, Davies and Mora are expected to reprise their roles.[1]In May 2024, Universal postponedThe Black Phone 2'stheatrical release by four months, to October 17, 2025, after commissioning several new Blumhouse films for the calendar year.[98]
The Black Phonecanon was expanded further in the anthology short film "Dreamkill" forV/H/S/85, released onShudderon October 6, 2023. "Dreamkill" occurs seven years after the events ofThe Black Phone, and explores the life of Gwen's cousin Gunther (Dashiell Derrickson).[99][100]

Christopher Robert Cargill(born September 8, 1975) is an American screenwriter, novelist, podcast host, and former film critic known under the pseudonyms Massawyrm (onAin't It Cool News) and Carlyle (onSpill.com). Cargill currently resides inAustin, Texas, with his wife.[1]He is known for writing the filmsSinister(2012),Sinister 2(2015),Doctor Strange(2016), andThe Black Phone(2021). He is a frequent writing collaborator ofScott Derrickson.
Cargill was raised in a military family, growing up on army bases around the United States. He held several jobs prior to writing, including video store clerk and travel agent.[citation needed]
Cargill wrote his first article in 2000, when he volunteered to write a review of the movieCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonfor a website called "Guerilla Films."  His article managed to get the highest amount of traffic of over 50,000 hits, "a HUGE deal" at the time, which secured him the job to write more reviews.[citation needed]
While working for Guerilla Films, Cargill began spending time with Ain't It Cool News' Eric Vespe (AKA 'Quint' on the site), which landed him a job on Ain't It Cool's "Indie Indie Column," a previously abandoned post.[2]He began writing for Ain't It Cool News under the name Massawyrm in May 2001.[3]His first review for the blog was of Jon Favreau's movie, Made.[3]During his work as a blogging critic, Cargill met various directors, which occasionally led to small roles in independent productions.[4]In 2011, he toldJordan Gass-Pooréwith Slackerwood that it was getting "tougher and tougher" to write movie reviews because of his relationships with people in the movie industry.[3]"I've always had a strict code about writing about films made by people I'm friends with," said Cargill. "It's harder to write objectively about film without people feeling that you're being biased."[3]Besides his work for Ain't It Cool News and his involvement with Spill.com, he also did freelance work forFilm.com[5]andHollywood.com(the site that owned Spill.com).[1]
I considered every film another day of classes and writing a review a home work assignment and it was graded by everyone who wrote nasty comments on the internet.
Having wanted to be a fiction writer from a young age, Cargill considered every film he reviewed and its feedback as a learning experience. According to an interview withThe Austin Chroniclehe compared it to "a strenuous, endless crash course—maybe even a master class—in what does and doesn't work in a story."[4][6]
On the 26th of February 2013, Cargill released his first novel,Dreams and Shadows, anurban fantasystory of folklore and mythology, which also follows three modern characters from childhood to adulthood.[7]Subsequent novels includedSea of RustandDay Zero.
The idea for his first film came to fruition when he met up with a fan and friendScott Derricksonat a bar in Las Vegas where he pitched his idea forSinister. Derrickson, showing great interest in this concept, contacted producerJason Blumwho particularly liked the simplicity of the concept and understood the urge to make it as fast as possible before it could be made by anyone else. Shooting of the movie started in September 2011, 6 months after[2]and was first screened atSouth by Southwest. In an interview with Film.com, Cargill stated that his days as a film critic were over for the time being due to his success and dedication to his new-found career path. "I may pop in every once in a while and write up reviews, but ever since I was a child, I've wanted to be a fiction writer, and now I have the chance to do it in both formats that I am in love with."[2]Sinister was released to positive reviews with many praising the snuff film segments, directing, cinematography, atmosphere, and acting. It was a box office success grossing over $87 million on a $3 million budget. Both Cargill and Derrickson returned as writers forSinister 2(2015), which was directed byCiaran Foy.[8]Unlike its predecessor, the sequel was critically panned. Many criticisms were aimed at the overuse of jump scares, horror cliches, story, and heavy amounts of excessive violence and gore. Cargill and Derrickson were working on a movie adaptation of theDeus Exvideo games.[9][10]They both left the project afterKevin Feigehired them to work on a film adaptation ofDoctor Strangein 2014, which would become the 14th film in theMarvel Cinematic Universe.[11][12]
Cargill, along with Derrickson andJon Spaihts, worked on the script for Marvel'sDoctor Strange(2016).[13]The film received positive reviews from critics and audiences, With praise being aimed towards the acting, special effects, and musical score. It grossed over $677 million worldwide. Cargill and Derrickson were set to return forDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madnessbut left due to "creative differences".[14]Sam Raimiwas hired to helm the project after they left.[15]More recently, the writing duo of Derrickson and Cargill signed a deal with Blumhouse Television.[16]
Cargill, under the pseudonym of Kit Lesser, wrote a biopic about FBI agent William Hagmaier (played byElijah Wood) and his relationship with serial killerTed Bundy.[17]"There have been a lot of movies and a lot of media made about Ted Bundy, and one of the things that bugged me a lot was that it's all kind of selling the myth of Ted Bundy and kind of glorifying him in a way," Cargill told Jordan Gass-Poore, the host of the horror-comedy podcast, Pod of Madness. "And the deeper you dig into the story you realize there's nothing to mystify here, there's nothing amazing about him." The film was released in 2021 asNo Man of God.
Derrickson's departure from directingDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madnessled him toThe Black Phone, a project he and Cargill had already planned on making. It is an adaptation ofJoe Hill'sshort story of the same name. The film premiered atFantastic Feston September 25, 2021, and was theatrically released byUniversal Pictureson June 24, 2022. It has grossed $157.2 million and received generally positive reviews from critics for its performances and faithfulness to the source material. It received praise from Joe Hill. In October 2023, the sequel was officially announced by Universal Pictures with a scheduled release date of June 27, 2025.[18]The following month, it was reported that Hawke, Thames, McGraw, Davies and Mora would reprise their roles in the sequel. Derrickson and Cargill also returned to write the script.[19]
Cargill and Derrickson will also team up to write the script forThe Outer Limits, a movie based on the influential 1960s television showof the same name.  The film, produced by MGM, will be adapted from a single episode of the classic show, "Demon with a Glass Hand."[20]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
