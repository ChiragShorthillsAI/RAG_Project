During theCalifornia Gold Rush, a beautiful young woman called Angel works as a prostitute in the fictional town of Pair-a-Dice. Despite being the object of desire for the local men, she survives through hatred and self-loathing. Meanwhile, a visiting farmer named Michael Hosea prays forGodto send him a wife. Later that day, he sees Angel walking through town and falls inlove at first sight. Angel is frequently abused by the brothel’s bodyguard MacGowen and her employer Duchess and is not given any breaks.
Flashbacks reveal that Angel's real name is Sarah and that she knows only abuse from men. As a child, she overhears her father, Alex Stafford, saying that she should never have been born. Sarah learns that her father is married and her mother, Mae, is hismistress. Alex eventually cuts off support for Mae, forcing her to sell her possessions and jewelry for money. The jeweler, John, persuaded her to sleep with him, and without any choice, Mae resorts to prostitution and work to support herself and Sarah. Mae eventually becomes sick and dies. Distraught, Sarah rejects her mother's faith. Afterward, John takes Sarah to a man named Duke, apimpwho renames her "Angel" and forces her into prostitution, and has his bodyguard kill John. One night, when Angel is a teenager, one of her customers is her father, and she knowingly has sex with him to punish him for how he treated her mother. He doesn’t recognize her, but when he finds out the next morning, he commitssuicide. This prompts Sally, a fellow prostitute, to help Angel escape from Duke, leading to Sally’s death at Duke’s command. Angel arrives in California with hopes of beginning a new life but is robbed by two women and now penniless, once again becomes a prostitute at abrothelthere.
In the present day, when Michael enters Angel's room and tells her he wants to marry her, she is thrown off-guard but remains aloof toward him. The frequent visits from Michael, however, stir something within Angel and she demands for Duchess to give her her money so that Angel may leave the brothel to live a life on her own terms. The exchange becomes heated, leading to MacGowen nearly beating her to death. Michael rushes to the brothel and sees the damage done to Angel and pays off Angel’s debt and proposes to her again. Having endured what she had gone through last night, she agrees to marry Michael and leaves with him. He nurses her back to health at his home, despite her continued aloofness toward him. Michael continues to surprise her as he claims to love her as his wife, and refuses to have sex with her. Afraid to trust him, she runs away at her first opportunity, but Michael finds her and convinces her to come home.
As the two begin their life on the farm, Angel develops feelings for Michael but runs away again when she realizes that he wants children, as she believes herself to be sterile due to Duke forcing her to get an abortion without her consent when she had previously worked for him. She gets a ride with Michael's brother-in-law, Paul, who resents her because of her past and demands that she pay him for the ride by having sex with him. Back in Pair-A-Dice, Angel reluctantly returns to the brothel to get the gold she is owed, from Duchess. She finds from a town local that the brothel had been burned down by Macgowan with the Duchess, Lucky and Mei Ling inside, leading to MacGowen being hunted down by an angry mob and killed. With no money and no place to live, she reluctantly goes back to prostitution with one of the town's bar owners. When Michael arrives to rescue her from her employers, she is relieved to return home with him. He forgives her, and their relationship begins to blossom based on honesty and affection.
As Angel falls in love with Michael, she becomes convinced that he will be happier married to someone else who can have children, leading her to leave him once more. Having learned to cook while with Michael, she is able to get a job at a cafe in the city rather than returning to prostitution. But the same day she starts working there, the hotel is burnt down. The following morning, Angel encounters Duke, who has relocated to California and reveals he was the one who ordered the hotel to be burnt down after hearing she was working there through his men. He makes her return to prostitution by threatening the life of her employer and she agrees to do so in order to spare her boss’s life. But seeing how Duke has continued to harbor young girls into his work, just like her, Angel confronts her boss only to be silenced with a death threat. He places her on a stage in his new establishment for his patrons to view. There, in a moment of desperation, she regains the faith she lost after her mother's death and tells the audience about Duke's sexual trafficking of young girls. Duke denies the allegations and attempts to murder Angel, but an African American man, implied to be an old friend of Michael's or a customer of Duke’s, subdues him and had Angel help the captive girls escape into the audience, resulting in Duke beinglynchedby an outraged mob after seeing the truth and hanged. Afterward, Angel starts a successful mission to help rehabilitate other young prostitutes.
Three years later, Paul finally comes to find her running a school for young women and tells her that Michael still loves her, Paul marrying another woman and tearfully apologizes for his mistreatment, which she has long forgiven him for. Angel returns home to Michael, offering her love and revealing her real name. They reunite in a tender embrace and Michael gives Angel his mother’s ring. Years later, Michael and Angel are fishing with their son, soon to be expecting another child.

In turn, he pointed out Pure Flix's decision of deliberately choosing not to screenUnplannedfor critics to avoid negative reviews.[52]After its release, some criticizedUnplannedfor 'dangerous' inaccuracies.[53]
Despite Pure Flix films generally being well-received by its evangelical Christian viewership, the company has also attracted criticism from several Christian commentators. Film critic Alissa Wilkinson, who wrote forChristianity Todayand teaches at the ChristianKing's Collegein New York City, criticized Pure Flix films for being intellectually unstimulating and reinforcing their audience's prejudices "instead of exercising and challenging the imagination of their audience in ways that would make their audience better Christians".[54]She also criticized the studio's successfulGod's Not Deadtrilogy for being "far more interested in bolstering a certain sort of persecution complex than in encouraging its audience toward Christlike behavior".[55]Justin Chang, another film critic who identifies as Christian, likewise criticized Pure Flix's brand of faith-based films for what he perceived as their "self-victimizing" depiction of the evangelical Christian community.[56]Kayla Bartsch, writing forNational Review, argued that Pure Flix's films "work to confirm the hypothesis that American Christianity must be artless and unrefined", making a case for more nuanced and stimulating religious films.[57]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
