The Hyperionsis a 2022 American superhero action-comedy film written and directed by Jon McDonald and starringCary Elwes,Penelope Mitchell,Elaine Tan, andAlphonso McAuley.
In 1960, Professor Ruckus Mandulbaum invents a device known as Titan Badge, which offers humans superpowers by altering the wearer’s DNA. He gave three Badges to three down-on-their-luck children, creating America's most famous family of superheroes, which included telepath Vista, super-strong Ansel, and teleporter Maya.
But over the years, as egos bruised and resentments developed, the professor replaced the team with newer members. In 1979, Vista and Ansel want their powers restored and they’ll stop at almost nothing to get them back. Their plan: stage a heist of their Titan Badges from The Hyperion Museum.
But the robbery runs into trouble when they realize that access to the badges requires Professor Mandulbaum’sbiometric scan. So Vista and Ansel instead take the museum staff and visitors hostage, forcing a confrontation with their former father figure, the police, and, ultimately, against asupervillain, Ares, who threatens to destroy them all.
In December 2018, it was announced that Elwes was cast in the film.[1]
In June 2021, it was announced thatSaban Filmsacquired North American distribution rights to the film.[2]In February 2022, it was announced thatThe Daily Wireacquired the domestic rights to the film from Saban Films.[3]The Daily Wire released the film onYouTubeon March 10, 2022.[4][5]
Richard Propes ofThe Independent Criticgave the film 3.5 stars and called it a "retro-styled superhero flick with a campily beating heart" and "an imperfect yet sublimely inspired" film "that weaves together past and present, family and fantasy all into a motion picture that made me smile from beginning to end."[6]
Alan Ng ofFilm Threatrated the film a 7.5 out of 10 and wrote that "the story of a family of Superheroes is excellent." He continued, "Add Professor Mandulbaum as a father, who should never be a father, and the exploration of power granted and taken away absolutely works."  But he noted that the film's "overall energy" was "low," which he thought was a "a creative choice" by the director.  "In the end," Ng wrote, "The Hyperionsis good, not great… worse, as it has the potential to be great."[7]
Matthew Pejkovic ofMatt's Movie Reviewsgave the film 3 stars and called it "a surprisingly tender exploration of family and abandonment that embraces the quirky campiness of its 1970s kitsch setting" with "[d]ry, absurdist humour that is reminiscent of the films of Wes Anderson and Jared Hess." He wrote that "[a]lthough its style is retro, its themes remain poignantly relevant." However, he noted that some of the performances were lacking.[8]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
