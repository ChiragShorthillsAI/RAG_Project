Suddenly a fierce storm sets in but she sees tracks in the snow of someone wearing only sneakers. She comes across a strange-acting, incoherent man she calls "John" and the two begin a dangerous trek down the mountain to safety, facing many obstacles along the way and almost drowning at one point. During this time, Pam has various "flashbacks" regarding her two young daughters who died in a gas leak accident. After almost freezing to death, the two manage to make it to safety only to have "John" drive off suddenly without so much as a thank you. Pam tries to find out his real name and at the end, the two have an emotional meeting at a coffee shop where she mentions that her two little girls died from a gas leak and he mentions a loved one that had frozen to death on the mountain the previous year.

Bleecker Streetis an east–west street inLower Manhattan,New York City. It is most famous today as aGreenwich Villagenightclub district. The street connects a neighborhood popular today for music venues andcomedyas well as an importantcenterofLGBT historyandcultureandbohemian tradition. The street is named after the family name ofAnthony Lispenard Bleecker, a banker, the father ofAnthony Bleecker, a 19th-century writer, through whose family farm the street once ran.
Bleecker Street connectsAbingdon Square(the intersection ofEighth AvenueandHudson Street) in theWest Village, to theBoweryin theEast VillageandNoHo.
Bleecker Street was named by and after theBleecker familybecause the street ran through the family's farm.[1]In 1808,Anthony Lispenard Bleeckerand his wife deeded to the city a major portion of the land on which Bleecker Street sits.[2]
Originally Bleecker Street extended from Bowery to Broadway, along the north side of the Bleecker farm, later as far west asSixth Avenue. In 1829 it was joined with Herring Street, extending Bleecker Street north-northwest to Abingdon Square.
LeRoy Place is the former name of a block of Bleecker Street between Mercer and Greene Streets. This was where the first palatial "winged residences" were built. The effect was accomplished by making the central houses taller and closer to the street, while the other houses on the side were set back. The central buildings also had bigger, raised entrances and lantern-like roof projections. The houses were built by Isaac A. Pearson, on both sides of Bleecker Street. To set his project apart from the rest of the area, Pearson convinced the city to rename this block of the street after the prominent international trader Jacob LeRoy.[3][4][5][6]
Bleecker Street is served by the4, ​6,<6>​,B, ​D, ​F,<F>, and ​Mtrains atBleecker Street/Broadway–Lafayette Streetstation. The1and ​2trains serve theChristopher Street–Sheridan Squarestation one block north of Bleecker Street.
No bus route runs on Bleecker Street. The following routes intersect with it:
Traffic on the street is one-way, going southeast. In early December 2007, abicycle lanewas marked on the street.
In addition, there are severalFederal architecture-style row houses at 7 to 13 and 21 to 25 Bleecker Street on easternmost block of Bleecker Street, inNoHobetween Lafayette Street and the Bowery.[12]21 and 29 Bleecker Street were also once the home of theNational Florence Crittenton Mission, providing a home for "fallen women". 21 Bleecker Street's entrance now bears the lettering "Florence Night Mission", described byThe New York Timesin 1883 as "a row of houses of the lowest character".[13][14]TheNational Florence Crittenton Missionwas an organization established in 1883 byCharles N. Crittenton. It attempted to reform prostitutes and unwed pregnant women through the creation of establishments where they were to live and learn skills.
The building at 58 Bleecker Street (formerly 64 Bleecker Street) was built in 1823 forJames Roosevelt, great-grandfather of presidentFranklin Delano Roosevelt. It was there thatElizabeth Blackwell, America's first female physician, established a clinic with her sister Emily.[15]
Across the street from the former home of theNational Florence Crittenton Missionis both the headquarters ofPlanned Parenthood, and the Catholic Sheen Center, immediately adjacent to it. Bleecker Street now features theMargaret SangerSquare, at the intersection withMott Street. Bleecker Street was the original home of Sanger's Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau, operated from another building from 1930 to 1973. The street features in the 2020drama filmNever Rarely Sometimes Always, written and directed byEliza Hittman.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
