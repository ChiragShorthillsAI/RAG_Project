Death on the Nilewas first released in several international markets on February 9, 2022, and in the United Kingdom and the United States on February 11, 2022, following several delays due to theCOVID-19 pandemic. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $137.3 million. A sequel, titledA Haunting in Venice, an adaptation ofHallowe'en Party, was released on September 15, 2023, with Branagh once again directing and starring as Poirot.
The film opens in Belgium at theYser Bridgeon October 31, 1914, in the front lines ofWorld War I.Hercule Poirot's captain has been given a mission that is certain death for all his men. Poirot advises his captain to follow a strategy that will accomplish the mission safely. It succeeds, but when his captain steps on a mine, Poirot is caught in the explosion. Poirot's fiancée, Katherine, visits him in the hospital and reassures him that she still loves him despite his injuries.
In 1937, at a London club, Poirot watches blues singer Salome Otterbourne perform. He notices Jacqueline "Jackie" de Bellefort introducing her fiancé, Simon Doyle, to her childhood friend, heiress Linnet Ridgeway. After meeting Simon, Linnet agrees to hire him as her land agent.
Six weeks later, in Egypt, Poirot encounters his friend, Bouc, with his mother, Euphemia, and the trio attend the wedding of Linnet and Simon. Others join their honeymoon trip: Linnet's maid, Louise Bourget; Salome and her niece/manager Rosalie, Linnet's schoolfriend; Linnet's godmother Marie Van Schuyler with her nurse, Mrs. Bowers; Linnet's financial manager and cousin Andrew Katchadourian; and Dr. Linus Windlesham, Linnet's former fiancé. Jackie has also stalked the couple to Egypt and continues to follow the couple around.
To escape Jackie, the group boards thecruise shipS.S.Karnak.Linnet asks Poirot for protection from Jackie and confesses that she distrusts her guests. Bouc reveals he is dating Rosalie, despite his mother's disapproval, and teases Poirot about Poirot's attraction to Salome.
The party disembarks from theKarnakto visit the Abu Simbel Temples. After a boulder falls off a column and nearly crushes Linnet and Simon, the guests return to theKarnakto discover Jackie has boarded. When Linnet goes to sleep, Simon confronts Jackie, who shoots him in the leg. When she attempts to shoot herself, Rosalie and Bouc intervene, taking her to Mrs. Bowers. Windlesham treats Simon.
The following morning, Louise discovers Linnet has been shot in the head and her valuable necklace has been stolen. Poirot, assisted by Bouc, interrogates the guests, each of whom bears a grudge against Linnet or would benefit from her death. The area around the boat is dredged and the murder weapon is found, wrapped in Van Schuyler's scarf. Poirot also reveals that Euphemia hired him to investigate Rosalie. When Rosalie storms off, she discovers Louise's body with money and her throat slit. Poirot suspects Louise blackmailed Linnet's killer.
Poirot and Simon interrogate Bouc. He found Linnet dead and stole her necklace to gain financial freedom from his mother, but panicked and put it in Euphemia's belongings. Bouc witnessed Louise's murder, but before he can reveal the killer, he is shot through the throat and dies. Poirot chases the killer, but only finds the discarded gun.
Locking the surviving guests in the boat's saloon, Poirot reveals that Simon killed Linnet, with Jackie as the mastermind. They are still lovers and arranged Simon's romance with Linnet to inherit her wealth. Simon drugged Poirot's champagne, and Jackie shot ablankat Simon, who faked his injury with paint stolen from Euphemia. While Jackie distracted Bouc and Rosalie, Simon killed Linnet, returned to the saloon, and shot his own leg, muffled by the scarf. Jackie killed Louise with Windlesham's scalpel and Bouc with Andrew's gun.
As a final clue, Poirot reveals that the handkerchief used in the fake shooting, recovered along with the gun, had faded to pink instead of brown, proving the stains were not blood. Faced with Poirot's irrefutable proof, Jackie embraces Simon and shoots him through the back, killing them both with one shot. As the passengers disembark, Poirot is unable to voice his feelings to Salome.
Six months later, a clean-shaven Poirot visits Salome's club to watch her rehearse.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 61% of 290 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Old-fashioned to a fault, the solidly entertainingDeath on the Nileis enlivened by its all-star cast and director-star Kenneth Branagh's obvious affection for the material."[67]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 52 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[68]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, the same as its predecessor, while those atPostTrakgave it a 77% positive score, with 57% saying they would definitely recommend it.[41]
David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "For some of us who look back with affection onJohn Guillermin's lush1978 screen version, there's a nagging feeling throughout that Branagh, while hitting the marks of storytelling and design, has drained some of the fun out of it."[69]Owen GleibermanofVarietycalled the film "a moderately diverting dessert that carries you right along. It never transcends the feeling that you're seeing a relic injected with life serum, but that, in a way, is part of its minor-league charm."[70]Edward Porter ofThe Timesgave the film three out of five stars, saying that its "gaudy style — combined with the melodrama of the script's modified take on Christie's plot — remains diverting even if some of the supposedly Egyptian backdrops look phoney."[71]Sandra HallofThe Sydney Morning Heraldgave the film four out of five stars, writing: "While the gamble Branagh takes in disinterring Poirot's long-neglected sensitive side may be regarded as sacrilege by some, I think it works. Poirot has a yearning heart."[72]
Wendy Ide ofThe Observergave the film two out of five stars, writing: "The camera whirls giddily, dizzy from the sparkle and spectacle, but not quite able to conceal the fact that this is an empty bauble of a movie."[73]David Fear ofRolling Stonewrote that the film "has its joys and flaws apart from that Armie factor, but it's almost like trying to assess whether the appetizer course could have been slightly undercooked while an elephant stampedes over the whole dinner table."[74]Joe MorgensternofThe Wall Street Journalwrote that the film "has pizazz and period style in the same way today's big-brand toothpastes have flavor – artificial ingredients give them a taste that's discernible, but too generic to name."[75]
In a December 2017 interview with theAssociated Press, Branagh discussed developing the adaptation ofDeath on the Nilewith the possibility of more films to follow, potentially creating a new "cinematic universe" of Christie films:[84]
"I think there are possibilities, aren't there? With 66 books and short stories and plays, she — and she often brings people together in her own books actually, so innately — she enjoyed that," he says. "You feel as though there is a world — just like withDickens, there's a complete world that she's created — certain kinds of characters who live in her world — that I think has real possibilities."[84]
Branagh stated that discussions for additional films were ongoing in February 2022, hoping the film series becomes a franchise including other Christie characters, includingJane Marple.[85]By March 2022,20th Century StudiosPresident Steve Asbell confirmed a third installment was in development. Branagh returned as director and star, whileMichael Greenonce again served as screenwriter.[86][87]Production forA Haunting in Venicebegan November 2022,[88]and the film was released September 15, 2023.

Beyond acting, Gadot and her husband have co-founded a film production company, launched a food brand, and invested in Israeli startups.  She is widely celebrated in Israel as a national icon and ambassador. However, her strong support for the Israeli military has sparked both praise and criticism.
Gal Gadot was born on 30 April 1985[2]inPetah Tikva,[note 1]where she initially lived.[9]She was born to Jewish parents ofAshkenazidescent;[7]her mother's roots areCzechandPolish, while  her father's areAustrian,Russian, andGerman.[10]Her parents, Michael, an engineer, and Irit, a physical education teacher,[11][12]hebraized their surnamefrom "Greenstein" to "Gadot" before her birth.[13]In Hebrew, her first name means "wave," and her surname translates to "riverbanks."[6]She has a younger sister, Dana.[14]
Her father is a sixth-generationSabra,[15]and one of his ancestors was the firstchemistatShaare Zedek Hospitalin Jerusalem,[16]while her mother is a first-generation Sabra and the daughter ofHolocaust survivors.[14][5]Her maternal grandfather,[5]Abraham Weiss,[17]was born as Adolf Weiss,[18]in the village ofMunkács,[19]Czechoslovakiain 1928. At 13, whenNazi Germany invaded, his father died in the army. He, his mother, and his brother were sent toAuschwitz, where the latter two perished in thegas chamber. He was the sole survivor of his family. Her maternal grandmother, however, managed to escape Europe beforeWorld War II.[20][15][17]Abraham immigrated alone toJaffa, where he built a family and "a successful business". He later served in theGolani Brigade, and in his later years, he joinedIsrael Defense Forces(IDF) expeditions to share his firsthandHolocaust testimony.[21]
Gadot grew up in the Givat Tal neighborhood ofRosh HaAyin,[8][22][23][15]in what she described as a "very Jewish, Israeli family environment".[14]At 11, she visitedHolocaust memorial sitesin Poland to learn about Auschwitz andMajdanek. Reflecting on the experience, she recalled: "I, an entitled child, felt the suffering theMuselmannexperienced back then."[23]Encouraged by her mother to be active from a young age, Gadot took up swimming at four and later played tennis.[15]She joined the local volleyball and basketball teams,[24]soccer-teamcheerleader,[19]and trained in ballet, hip-hop, and jazz for 12 years, at one point considering a career as a choreographer.[14]
As a child, she struggled with a weak voice and attendedspeech therapy, where she learned properbreathing techniques.[25]At 12, she was invited to enter theGirl of the Year[he](Hebrew:נערת השנה‎) competition but declined, saying, "Ugh, modeling? I'm much smarter and deeper. I won't make a living from posing for the camera." However, reflecting on that decision later, she acknowledged, "when I grew up, I realized that it's a job and that it's also fun—you make great money, meet fascinating people, and visit interesting places."[24]
Although Gadot’s native language isHebrew, she started taking English lessons inthird gradeand became fluent when she decided she wanted to watchSeinfeldandFriends.[26]She later attended Begin High School, where she majored in biology.[23]After graduating, she had a few months before beginning her mandatory two-year service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). During this time, she received modeling offers but instead chose to work atBurger King, saying, "I was like, posing for money? Ugh, it’s not for me." Meanwhile, her mother and a friend submitted an application on her behalf for the Miss Israel pageant.[15]Before enlisting, she also worked as acaregiverfor eight-month-old twins.[23]
"It wasn't my love for fashion or glamour that led me there. My enlistment [in the army] had been postponed by six months, and all my friends were already in uniform. My mother suggested I try out, so I went through the selection process, met wonderful girls, and thought, 'Why not? It will be fun, and I'll get one last trip abroad before the army.' I figured it would make for a good story to tell my future grandchildren."
In 2004, the 54thMiss Israelbeauty pageant took place at theHaifaCongress Center,[27]where an 18-year-old Gal Gadot participated with little expectation of winning. However, the 5'10" Gadot,[23]was crowned Miss Israel bySivan Klein, andYona Yahav,[28]and received aCitroën C3supermini car.[29]Following her win, Gadot represented Israel in theMiss Universe 2004pageant in Ecuador but admitted she intentionally "rebelled" to avoid winning, arriving late to events and refusing to wear an evening gown.[30]Before parting ways with the crown, Gadot emphasized the importance of serving in the Israeli army, saying, "Serving in the army is an integral part of the lives of the youth here [Israel]. Beyond my contribution, I believe that this period will contribute greatly to me as well."[31]In 2005, a week after passing on the crown,[32]Gadot, at 20,[33]was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces. After excelling in a three-month boot camp,[34]she served as a combat trainer, teaching soldiers gymnastics andcalisthenics.[35]Reporting daily at 5 a.m., she led soldiers through a form of boot camp.[15]Gadot became so passionate about the techniques she learned that she eventually trainedsergeantsand high-rankingcommanders.[36]Gadot also practicedKrav Maga,[37]gaining proficiency in handling weapons and preparing for combat.[36]She completed hermandatory two-year service, of which only 20 days were in uniform.[38]Reflecting on her military experience in a 2016 interview withFashion, Gadot said, “It was demanding because you give up your freedom for two years, but there is something special in giving back to your community.”[36]
In 2007, while serving, 21-year-old Gadot appeared inMaxim's "Women of the Israel Defense Forces" photo shoot,[39]which was later featured on the cover of theNew York Post.[40]The shoot was part of a campaign byIsrael's consulatein New York,Maxim, and theMinistry of Tourismto promote Israel, attract young American men, and reshape its public image.[39]The campaign faced criticism, particularly fromKnessetmembers, over the portrayal of female soldiers in bikinis.[41]Reflecting on the experience in 2013, Gadot stated, "I’m a model, not a doctor. My job is to take pictures in a bathing suit.

The Jewish organizationJewish Voice for Peacecriticized Gadot andGuy Nativfor screening the film, calling it a "propaganda," claiming the film overlooked the situation in Palestine and served those promoting war and genocide.[208]
In May 2024, Gadot advocated forEden Golan, Israel'sEurovision representative, publicly encouraging her followers to vote for Golan. As a result, Gadot lost one million Instagram followers.

When I look back 15 years, when I was starting out, being Israeli was something that people admired and were excited about—Israeli women, their strength, and all that. I’m not saying it’s no longer the case, but now it’s complicated. The conversation has changed. It’s different. And I find myself, time and again, having to engage in very complex and often uncomfortable discussions with people who have opinions about what’s happening, trying to give them the full picture of what’s really going on.
In January 2025, Gadot participated inNoa Tishby’s "#BringOnTheLight" campaign, celebrating Jewish resilience and joy duringHanukkah. The campaign featured other celebrities who lit the menorah on different nights.[213]Late that month, she faced backlash after attending the 2025 Golden Globes without wearing a yellow ribbon pin, a symbol of support forhostages held by Hamas. Reports then circulated claiming she was forbidden from wearing the pin. In response, Gadot clarified that she was never told not to wear it. Instead, Gadot wore a yellow ring and posted on social media to raise awareness for the hostages' plight.[214]She faced backlash over this, including from Ofira Asayag, who called Gadot a "hypocrite."[215]
In February 2025, Gadot spoke about the hostages and the Israel-Gaza war, stating on her Harper's Bazaar Spain interview that her wish is for a "diplomatic agreement that allows all parties at the table to live a good and prosperous life."[216]
She reinforced her anti-war stance, saying that "I know it sounds cliché, but just as they are teaching us to hate, by increasing antisemitism, we can also teach them to love. I want to believe that love is the force that moves the world. War is a defeat for everyone. Hate is horrible. It is toxic for the outside world and for the hater."[217]
In March 2020, Gadot and a number of other celebrities, including herWonder Woman 1984co-starKristen Wiig, performedan online versionof the song "Imagine" byJohn Lennon, intended to raise morale during theCOVID-19 pandemic.[218]The video received backlash with critics dismissing it as an ineffective response to the pandemic; Jon Caramanica ofThe New York Timescalled it "an empty and profoundly awkward gesture".[219][220][221][222][223]Gadot later acknowledged the video did not garner the positive reaction that had been intended, but was unapologetic in explaining the thinking behind it.[83]In a 2022 interview withInStylemagazine, Gadot admitted that the video was done in "poor taste", but still maintained that it had "pure intentions".[224]
Gadot is an avid martial arts enthusiast. She possessesblack beltsin bothkarateandKrav Maga.[37][225][226]In 2006, Gadot was briefly linked to Israeli swimmerEithan Urbach. The two met, "exchanged glances, and shared a brief connection," remaining close for at least two months before parting ways.[227]That same year, Gadot met her future husband, Jaron "Yaron" Varsano,[note 2]a real estate developer fromAmsterdamwho grew up in a Jewish family in theNetherlands,[231][232]in 2006 while she was still serving in the Israeli Army. The couple connected at a "chakra/yoga retreat type of party" in theIsraeli desert.[233]
In 2008, during a weekend off from filmingFast & Furious 4, the couple went toNapa Valley,[24]where Varsano (33) proposed to Gadot (23).[234]Later that year, on September 28,[235]they married at the David Intercontinental Hotel in Israel.[236]They reside in theNeve Tzedekneighborhood of Tel Aviv,[6]and have four daughters, Alma born November 5, 2011,[237]Maya born March 20, 2017, Daniella born June 29, 2021,[238][58][239]and Ori born March 6, 2024.[240]The couple owned aboutique hotelinTel Aviv,Israel, which she helped run,[241]that was eventually sold to Russian oligarch and politicianRoman Abramovichin 2015 for $26 million.[242]
Gadot revealed in a 2023 interview withL'Officielthat she struggles withimposter syndrome, despite her success in Hollywood, saying "I feel so lucky and happy that I'm doing what I really love, but I also always think to myself: 'I hope they'll like it.' There's never a moment when I'm sure they will."[243]She shared advice she once received from directorFrancis Ford Coppola: "He said to me, 'You know what? I'm always full of doubts too and I'm sure people won't like my work. So I just follow my heart and stay humble".[243]
In February 2024, during her eighth month of pregnancy, Gadot was diagnosed withcerebral venous thrombosis, a rare type ofstrokethat accounts for less than 3% of all strokes.[244]She was rushed to the hospital, where she underwent emergency surgery within hours. Her fourth daughter, Ori, was born during the procedure. In December 2024 Gadot stated that she had fully recovered and  chose to share her experience to raise awareness about the condition.[245]
A year after her daughter's birth, Gadot opened up to Harper's Bazaar about her experience with the condition, stating that "Having such anear-death experiencehas made me feel more grateful and present in my own life, I try to remind myself daily to slow down and do things at my own pace."[246]

She described feeling comforted and embraced by theJewish community, stating that, though far from Israel, she felt at home in Los Angeles. For a brief moment, she said, the chaos of the outside world felt more bearable. She concluded with the phrase "Am Yisrael Chai."[16]
Gadot has expressed admiration forPenélope Cruz, particularly for her courage, individuality, and confidence in embracing her identity. She appreciates how Cruz "stands up for herself and has something to say—she has her own spice, which I love. She is very courageous and also has an accent, but she just goes with it."[36]She also recognizesYafa Yarkonias her "Israeli culturalhero", referring to her as "the singer of wars".[23]Additionally, when asked whichhistorical eventshe would like to witness, Gadot shared that she would have chosen the rally after whichYitzhak Rabinwas assassinated, as it symbolized "the extreme rejection of democracy".[23]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
