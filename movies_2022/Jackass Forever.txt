Jackass Foreveris a compilation of stunts, skits and pranks intercut with on-set talking heads with its cast. The film begins with a tribute tokaijucinema, in what appears to be a city being overrun by a giant green monster. In reality, it isChris Pontius' penis painted green over a small set of a city, intercut with the cast members running through a life-size set of the same city. The intro ends with the "monster" bitten by asnapping turtleandJohnny Knoxville's intro, "Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville! Welcome toJackass!"
Stunts and pranks with the main cast include Knoxville facing a bull resulting in dangerous consequences;Dave Englandunsuspectingly getting pig semen dumped on him during a fake interview about the movie;Steve-Ohaving his penis used as a beehive;Ehren McGheheybeing subjected to painful tests with anathletic cup; Pontius' penis being used as the paddle forpaddle ball; a vulture eating pieces of meat offWee Man's body; andPreston Lacy's testicles being used as a miniature punching bag.

The final stunt, the Vomitron, features Zach, Dave, Eric, Poopies, Steve-O and Jasper drinking milk while strapped to a high-speed carousel. As they start vomiting, Knoxville and the rest of the cast initiate an attack involving paintball guns, a tennis machine and multiple explosions.

A significant portion of the film's crew appears onscreen:
In 2018,Johnny Knoxvillesaid that he was open to making a fourthJackassfilm that may feature some new cast members, "just to bring in some fresh blood into it".[14]He said that he had continued to write ideas for stunts and that "a ton" have been set aside for the project, should it receive thegreen-light. In July 2019, former cast memberChris Raabsaid that he had interviewed theJackasscrew on hisBathroom Breakpodcastand noted that everyone was still open to a fourth film should Knoxville,Jeff Tremaine, andSpike Jonzeagree.[14]In late 2019, Knoxville met with Tremaine and released a 200-page document of concepts for a fourthJackassfilm. They agreed to film for two days with the entire cast to determine "if it still feels right" to makeJackass 4. "Honestly, after just five minutes of filming, we were ready to commit to making a movie", Tremaine said.[15]In September 2020,Steve-Ohad said he was surprised the film "even came to fruition".[16]
In May 2021, Knoxville stated the film would be his final contribution to theJackassfranchise. "You can only take so many chances before something irreversible happens," Knoxville said. "I feel like I've been extremely lucky to take the chances I've taken and still be walking around."[17]During his July 12, 2021 appearance onJimmy Kimmel Live!, Knoxville revealed the film's title and showed the first official photos.[18]
In January 2021,Bam Margeraclaimed thatParamount Picturesregarded him as a liability, owing to his behavior leading up to and during production. He indicated that Tremaine had fought with the studio to keep Margera in the film, but Margera was uncertain that Paramount was going to allow him to partake in filming.[19]On February 11, Margera posted several videos to hisInstagramaccount, in which he admitted to breaking his sobriety and claimed that he had been officially fired from the filming ofJackass 4.[10]Throughout the video, Margera could be seen crying, vomiting, and alluding to having looked up "how to tie a noose" before his move toOceanside, California. Margera alleged that Paramount had been forcing him to take antidepressants, submit to random urine tests, and to check in to two rehabilitation facilities using his own money. He also expressed disdain for Tremaine, Knoxville, and Jonze before asking his fans to boycott the film. He then solicited his followers to send him money in order to film his own movie to compete withJackass Forever.The videos were removed from Margera's Instagram account soon after being posted.[10][20]On May 25, 2021, Tremaine filed a temporaryrestraining orderagainst Margera due to Margera's harassment of Tremaine and Knoxville via Instagram.[21]Tremaine was granted an additional three-year restraining order, extended to Tremaine's wife and children, after Margera allegedly sent his family death threats.[22]On August 9, 2021, Margera officially filed alawsuitagainst Knoxville, Jonze, and Tremaine, as well as against Paramount Pictures,MTV, Dickhouse Entertainment, and Gorilla Flicks, alleging that he was wrongfully fired from the film's production.[23]Margera also said that the film makes use of contributions he made before his firing and is seeking an injunction on the October release of the film as a result.[24]On January 12, 2022, Knoxville said that one scene Margera filmed will remain, despite the lawsuit.[12]Both parties came to terms on a settlement after Margera asked to dismiss the lawsuit on April 14, 2022. The details of the settlement remain private.[25]
On May 25, Knoxville confirmed six new cast members:Jasper DolphinofOdd Future, and one of the stars ofLoiter Squad; Jasper's ex-convict father Compston "Dark Shark" Wilson, who made recurring guest appearances throughout the film; Eric Manaka, who had a role in Knoxville's filmAction Point; stand-up comedian Rachel Wolfson;[26]Zach HolmesfromToo Stupid to Die; and surfer Sean "Poopies" McInerney[27]who had previously appeared in theJackass Shark Weekspecial.[28][29][30]The project was initially presented as a possible anniversary special, and the new cast were later told it would be a movie.[26][31][32]

He also hosted theAdult SwimshowMostly 4 Millennials,after starting off fronting the Toronto bandBlack Jello.
Beckles recognized the appeal of poor programming in 1994 when he began releasing VHS mashups ofspray-on hairinfomercials, squirrel cooking shows, and public access freaks performing like no one’s watching.[3]These compilations led to the creation of TV Carnage, a bootleg home-video series in which Beckles distills all the strangest clips from late-night infomercials, local-access programs and found videos, into hour-long DVDs.[4]
While Beckles had been editing togetherTex Averycartoons withThe Stoogessongs to entertain his friends while in high school, theTV Carnageformat didn't evolve into its current form until 1996. While bedridden and doped up on painkillers, Beckles began to assemble mashups with themes.[4]In these mashups, Beckles treats well-known and unknown footage alike, sewing the scenes and moments together to create an absurd alternate entertainment universe.[5]
A self-described, "slutty distributor of heavenly crap", Beckles calls the creation ofTV Carnagehis "way of screaming at the world".[6]Though the compilations' original format was VHS, Beckles soon began producing DVDs. The format allowed for a wider audience and soonTV Carnagebegan to gain a cult following.[7]Michael Cerahas claimed, "TV Carnageis some of the most brilliant stuff out there right now."[8]

Sherman was born and raised inGreat Neck,[11]Long Island, New York, in aJewishfamily.[12][13]She toldVariety, "I grew up liking, you know, crazy cartoons, and I loveJoan RiversandThe NannyandGarbage Pail KidsandRen & Stimpyand stuff like that."[11]She told another interviewer, "I hadRaggedy Anndolls. Thinking about it now, Raggedy Ann has heavily influenced the way I dress. I had a bunch ofLamb Chopdolls, too. I'm a huge Lamb Chop freak becauseShari Lewiswas a Jewish comedian, and I have a giant Lamb Chop tattoo on my leg."[14]
She attendedGreat Neck South High School, where she was on the improv team andran track,[15]graduating in 2011; then attendedNorthwestern Universityand graduated in 2015[16]with a degree in theater.[7][17][18]
Sherman developed an interest in stand-up comedy after she did not make theimprovteam at Northwestern. After graduating, she decided to stay inChicago, befriending comedians likeMegan Stalter, and had a monthly show calledHelltrap Nightmarealong with Luke Taylor, David Brown, Wyatt Fair, and Scott Egleston.[19][20]Sherman began performing under her stage name "Sarah Squirm", which was inspired by a high school nickname. She was also getting booked as a comedian alongsidenoise musiciansas she had friends that ran a record label.[20]
In 2018, she made her television debut in anAdult Swiminfomercialtitled "Flayaway."[3][20]In 2019, Sherman opened for fellow comedianEric Andréon hisLegalize Everythingtour.[13]She was also a writer forThe Eric Andre Show,Three Busy Debras, andMagic for Humans.[21]
Sherman was asked to audition for the long-runningNBCsketch-comedy showSaturday Night Liveafter doing a stand-up set at theJust for Laughsfestival. She had previously been asked to perform some showcases forSNLproducers and attempted some character-based work which, according to her, "fucking sucked."[20]She initially auditioned forSNLin 2016, as part of a showcase at theiO Theaterin Chicago that also featuredAlex Moffat, who would be hired as part of the cast that year.[22]In 2021, she auditioned again.James Austin Johnsonwas directly ahead of her in line, and she expressed her nervousness, but "I went into the audition with good vibes because of James and, LOL, we both got it." In the interview, she added, "I did standup. I didn't have any impressions or characters. It was disgusting, I'm talking about genitals."[23]She was subsequently cast as a featured player for its47th season, alongside fellow newcomers Johnson andAristotle Athari.[8][9]Before being hired bySNL, she had had trouble finding employment because hergross-outvideos turned hiring managers off.[24]Sherman found a limited audience in her first season because ofCOVID-19restrictions, and the end of her second season was cut short by the2023 Writers Guild of America strike.[14]In 2023, Sherman was promoted to a repertory player.[10]
AtSNL, Sherman frequently collaborates with writer/film producer Dan Bulla, who joined in 2019 forSeason 45,[11][25]and with whom she shares an office.[26]Among their sketches together are "Jewish Elvis," "My Best Friend's House," and "Shrimp Tower."[25][14]The latter, starring hostJosh Brolin, earned aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Production Design for a Variety or Reality Series.[27]Of their Christmas sketch "Pongo," featuring a "wonderfully creepy" synthetic pet, Bleeding Cool writes, "With all due respect to co-writer Bulla, this sketch had Sarah Sherman's brand of humor all over it – and it was brilliant."[28]About a black-and-white pre-taped video suggestive ofThe Hunchback of Notre Dame, Sherman toldStyle Weekly, "I was so lucky to have immediately linked up with amazing writers who totally got it. You know, like Dan Bulla, who I write with a lot. We did this sketch called 'The Anomalous Man,' where I play this mythical creature beast withDua Lipa, it was kind of anElephant Manparody. When we were writing it, Bulla was like, 'Oh and by the way, you need to have a hunchback with an eyeball on it."[29]Asked about her favorite experience with any performer, Sherman refers to her twisted, goryScooby-Doosketch inSeason 49: "This past finale,Jake Gyllenhaalwas the co-host. He's such a good actor and just willing to go there and be aggressive and crazy and chaotic and high energy... The first time he hosted, we did that sketch where I playChuckyand I appreciated anyone willing to go there."[29]Also that year, Sherman posted on Instagram "Severed Head Count: 3." The Late Nighter website added them up in the article "Sarah Sherman's 'Severed Head' Makes ThirdSNLAppearance." The first time is in the parody documentary sketch "UNTOLD: Battle of the Sexes" in a critical tennis game. "That beheading came at the hand of hostJason Momoa, who knocked off her head with a (literal) breakneck serve." The second time is in the Scooby-Doo sketch, in which Sherman (playingVelma) is clotheslined by a piano wire. The third was "My Best Friend's House," in which Sherman appears as a plastic-wrapped severed head stored in the refrigerator by her best friend's dad, who turns out to be a savage serial killer.[30]
Sherman's segments onWeekend Updateare popular among the cast and viewers, as she tormentsColin Jost, who is willing to be the butt of the joke. Sherman has said that Jost urged her to create segments for them, and she says, "I took his kindness and used it to just bully him. And it worked great, but it only worked because he's having fun."[29]Her first foray, "Sarah Sherman Roasts Colin Jost," was listed byMashableat #6 in their ten favorite sketches of 2021, concluding, "She nails it."[31]Among her characters: television journalistNancy Grace;[32]the widow ofPeanut the Squirrel;[33]an alarming meditation guru in aMorgan le Fay-type wig, Genesis Fry, who reveals Jost's darkest secrets; J.J. Gordon, Jost's Hollywood agent, who suggests humiliating film projects for him, such as aJurassic Park-themedporn filmor abiopicentitledJost the Two of Us: My Summer withEpstein; and CJ Rossitano, who is revealed to be very likely Jost's son. (CJ: "Me and my mom live right over on 47th and Fifth." Jost: "That's funny, that's where my former housekeeper lived." CJ: "What a coincidence, Colin! My mom's a former housekeeper."Harry Chapin's father-son song "Cat's in the Cradle" rises in the background.)[34]In another segment as herself, "Sarah Sherman Roasts Colin Jost Again," Sherman begins to explain how to remain cozy in the winter, then embarrasses Jost by segueing into pubic hair, the cost of living in New York (she lives in Jost's doghouse and pays rent), and his potentially gay relationship withMichael Che, each time turning the topic into an extended insult to Jost. In "Sarah Sherman Roasts Colin Jost," she asks him why there are no Jews in the cast. When he replies that thereareJews on the show, including her, she turns to the camera and yells, "In other news, local wet blanket Colin Jost is keeping track of the amount of Jews atSNL. He's making a list and he's checking it twice."[15][35]
Sherman has been praised by critics for adapting her unusual and surreal comedy style toSNLwithout losing its impact. Luka Katic ofColliderwrote, "Sherman certainly isn't the first unconventional comedian to be featured onSNL(i.e.Tim Robinson,Kyle Mooney, etc.). However, what makes her remarkable is her success in spite of that fact. Where actors like Robinson often felt they had to tone down their material forSNL, Sherman finds inventive alternative ways to channel her deranged sensibilities into the show."[36]Jesse Hassenger ofVulturelisted Sherman's "Meatballs" sketch from theOscar Isaac/Charli XCXepisode as one of the best of the season, writing, "In a crowded season, it was especially refreshing to come upon a sketch that feels like such a clear expression of its star's sensibilities."[37]Style Weeklywrote, "With her loud clown wear and freakish, squirrel-next-door-vibe, Sarah Sherman is hands down the funniest, most unpredictable cast member."[29]WatchMojolisted their "Top 10 Grossest but Hilarious Sarah Squirm Skits onSNL": Bug Assembly; Nickelodeon Show; Spring Flowers; Chucky; Glamgina; Roller Coaster Accident; A Christmas Carol; Eyes; Mail-in Testing Service; and Meatballs.[38]
Sherman has introduced new materials to the costumes and props departments. Sherman enjoys wearing weird outfits, raiding the show's 50 years' worth of costumes and devising new ones. "I playedRFK Jr.'s brain worm, and the costume department made me a couture worm [outfit]," she told an interviewer.[39]Looking back at earlier sketches in whichDan AykroydandJay Mohrfaked vomiting, she developed "an advanced vomit rig that's handsfree, kind of likeBluetoothstyle," as she describes it.[11]She once asked Louie Zakarian, the show's multiple-Emmy-Award-winning special-effects makeup chief, to devise a fake seagull that could be impaled in her torso while moving its legs.[40]In 2022, for her sketch "Eyes," Sarah delivered her performance wearinggoogly eyes (or wiggle eyes)which, her character explains, were "supposed to be refrigerated" but were left in the character's pockets. Zakarian adapted them so that they would allow Sherman "to see through the big eyes, readcue cards, and match it all to [her] skin." He "drilled one big hole in the back and a smaller one in the pupil part;" yet her body heat fogged up the surfaces. Zakarian said that, during the COVID pandemic, he'd discovered a fixing liquid good for certain surfaces, so he used it on the googly eyes. The fogging problem was discovered during thedress rehearsal, so he had only a few minutes to solve it.[41]During an interview in which the two were experimenting with makeup effects, Zakarian said, "There are certain actors that you could put whatever you want on them and they don't transform. She just transforms." Sherman agreed: "I have kind of a 'no' face. I don't have crazy-distinct features."[15]The Guardianlisted "Eyes" as one of "the 10 best sketches from the48th season".[42]Since the people who write a skit also produce it, they also figure out set design and props, according toVariety. Dan Bulla says, "You talk to every department and a lot of people are like, 'Well, what should the wardrobe be?' Sarah never doesn't have an answer for those questions. She can cut to it from the germ of an idea. She can visualize every aspect of it. She's on the phone with the people who build the puppets." Bulla says Sherman talks about visual effects and color palettes: "It's that granular for her, and all of her ideas start like that."[40]
Sherman was credited as a screenwriter for the reality comedy film sequelJackass Forever(2022).[43]She co-starred in theAdam Sandlercomedy filmYou Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah(2023)[44]and was cast as a character indownloadable contentfor the video gameHigh on Life(2022).[45]She voice acted as "Coriander Cadaverish" in the animated filmNimona(2023)[46]and in a cameo for season 2 ofSeverance(2025).
Since October 2023, Sherman has hosted theNTS RadioshowFreakradio Emergency Hotline.[47]Among the artists she has played on the program areMacula Dog,Doug Lussenhop,Johnny Pemberton,Clownvis Presley,Negativland, andThe Residents.[48]On September 5, 2024, Sherman began her guest starring role as dialect coach Robin Finch—for Lois Cerillo, played byRena Sofer—in the daytime soap operaGeneral Hospital.[49]In 2024, she debuted as a host for theMaxgame showHuman vs Hamster.[50]
Sherman has said her comedic influences include television shows such asSeinfeld,The Nanny,The Golden Girls,Pee-wee's Playhouse, andThe Ren & Stimpy Show.[2][13]She told an interviewer, "I'm obsessed withJerry Lewis... I look like Jerry!"[14]She has citedNorm Macdonaldas an influence on herSNLwork: "He was a little troublemaker. I relate to him because he was never not himself."[24]She has also said, "I am obsessed with Norm MacDonald... can you imagine being on a show with Norm MacDonald, someone who's so fearless every week, saying the craziest shit on TV and getting in trouble for it?"[23]
When she started performing stand-up comedy, she took influences from comedians such asTodd Barry,Maria Bamford, andKristen Schaal.[51]InSNLhistory, she lovesDana Carvey's iconic sketch "Massive Head Wound Harry" (Season 17), in which Carvey wore a bloody, mangled head prosthetic which is tugged and chewed by a dog.[40][52]
When an interviewer asked why so many of herSNLsketches feature eyeballs, she credited her grandmother: "It's an exposed organ on your head, and it's not that deep. I also have a pathological neurosis about eyeballs because growing up, my grandma had one of her eyeballs removed and I was morbidly obsessed... I have herprosthetic eye. ... She would play these practical jokes on me with it when I was 8 years old. I would wake up and come down into the kitchen for breakfast, and she would turn around with no dentures or lens in. So she just had a white orb in her face and do a jump scare on me. And that was obviously very formative!"[14]Asked whether filmmakerDavid Cronenbergis an influence, she answered, "Yeah, one billion percent."[14]
Sherman supportedBernie Sandersin the2020 United States presidential election.[13]She is a member of theDemocratic Socialists of America.[53]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
