It starsDaniel Radcliffeas Yankovic, along withEvan Rachel Wood,Rainn Wilson,Toby HussandJulianne Nicholsonin supporting roles.
A fake trailer for a satirical biographical film was produced by Appel forFunny or Diein 2010. Yankovic would screen the trailer at his concerts, which made fans question when a full-length film would be made and led Yankovic and Appel to develop the film's concept together.Weird: The Al Yankovic Storywas filmed on a budget of around $8 million over eighteen days between February and March 2022. It premiered at the2022 Toronto International Film Festivalon September 8, and was released onThe Roku Channelon November 4, 2022. The film received positive reviews from critics, who largely praised its screenplay, humor, and cast performances (particularly Radcliffe).
At the75th Primetime Emmy Awards, Yankovic and Appel's script was nominated forOutstanding Writing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movieand Radcliffe's performance was nominated forOutstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie. The film won thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie.
YoungAlfred "Al" Yankovicbecomes interested in parodying songs despite his father's disapproval. Al's mother secretly purchases an accordion for him, but his father destroys it when Al is caught at an illicitpolkaparty, thus straining Al's relationship with his parents.
Years later, an older Al is living with his roommatesSteve,Jim, andBermuda, and is constantly rejected in band auditions as an accordion player. While listening to "My Sharona" on the radio and fixing a bologna sandwich, Al is inspired to write "My Bologna". He sends the song to a local radio DJ, who puts it on the air immediately; he then goes toScotti Brothers Records, where the brothers mock him, but are willing to reconsider if Al gains more experience.
Al performs "I Love Rocky Road" for the first time at a biker bar, his roommates stepping in to fill out his band and make the performance a success. Al catches the interest ofDr. Demento, who offers to be his manager while suggesting he go by the stage name "Weird Al". At a party hosted by Dr. Demento, the doctor's rivalWolfman Jackdares Al to prove himself by parodyingQueen's "Another One Bites the Dust" with bassistJohn Deaconpresent. Al comes up with "Another One Rides the Bus", impressing the celebrities in attendance. Al lands his record contract, andhis debut albumgoesmulti-platinum, with the original artists experiencing a "Yankovic bump" in record sales and Al being feted byOprah Winfrey.
Al calls home to find his father is still dismissive of him. Dr. Demento suggests Al try to make his own original song, which he refuses. However, after Dr. Demento gives himguacamolelaced withLSD, Al comes up with an original new song, which becomes his next hit, "Eat It".Madonna, in search of the "Yankovic bump", begins a relationship with Al to convince him to parody her song "Like a Virgin", though he insists he now only writes original songs. Dr. Demento and Al's bandmates warn him that Madonna is a bad influence, but they continue their romance. Just before a major show, Al learns thatMichael Jacksonhas taken "Eat It" and parodied it as "Beat It", which angers him since he believes people will assume "Eat It" is a parody of "Beat It". An intoxicated Al suffers a near-fatal car accident and is rushed to the hospital, where he comes up with "Like a Surgeon" after regaining consciousness. He premieres the song at a show that same night, while still heavily injured, but when he is reminded that "Eat It" is the last song for the show, he gets drunk on stage, insults the crowd, and is arrested for lewdness.
Once released, Al confesses to Madonna that he fears he has alienated everybody who cared about him and that she is the only one he has left. Suddenly, Madonna is captured by agents ofPablo Escobar, who is a huge fan of Al and uses the kidnapping to coerce him to play at his 40th birthday party. Al flies to Colombia and goes on a rampage to break into Escobar's compound, where he confronts the drug lord. After refusing to play a song for him, he gets into a shootout and kills Escobar and his mercenaries to free Madonna. With the kingpin dead, Madonna tries to talk Al into giving up music and helping her take over Escobar's drug empire, but Al rejects her.
Al returns home to work in his father's factory, as his father had always wanted; but Al's father admits that Al never belonged in that line of work and that he had secretly supported Al's chosen path all along. The elder Yankovic reveals he grew up in anAmishcommunity and was excommunicated for taking up the accordion, prompting him to prevent Al from making the same mistake. Al then brings his father's song, "Amish Paradise", to the stage, winning him a major award in 1985 before being assassinated onstage by one of Madonna's henchmen. Madonna later visits Weird Al's grave before being grabbed by a zombified Al.

In 2010,Funny or Diereleased a fake trailer for a satirical biographical film titledWeird: The Al Yankovic Storydirected byEric Appeland starringAaron Paulas musician"Weird Al" Yankovic.[9]Additional co-stars in the three-minute-long trailer includedOlivia Wildeas Madonna,Gary ColeandMary Steenburgenas Yankovic's parents, andPatton Oswaltas Dr. Demento. Yankovic himself cameoed as a record producer.[10]At the time, the fake trailer was intended to parody prior biographical films on musicians, such asRay(2004) andWalk the Line(2005).[11]
Yankovic would play the trailer on his concert tours leading some fans to think it was for a real feature film or encourage him to adapt it into one. On the heels of other successful musician biopics includingBohemian Rhapsody(2018) andRocketman(2019), Yankovic began to legitimately consider the idea of making a full-length film. He and Appel began to shop the idea around Hollywood, but the studios' initial impressions were that the film was going to be in the vein of aZucker, Abrahams and Zuckerfull-on parody and passed on the idea. The two looked at common tropes in other musician biopics, realizing that facts about the musician's life were often changed arbitrarily, and used a similar approach to writing Yankovic's biographical story with the same type of creative freedom.[12]They opted to retain the setting of the film within Yankovic's early career between 1979 and 1985, only going off this period for the inclusion of "Amish Paradise" from 1996 at the end of the film.[13]Some events in the film are based on facts from Yankovic's life: he did receive his first accordion from a traveling salesman; "My Bologna" was recorded in a public bathroom, though in real life, this was a bathroom across from theKCPRradio station offices; there has been a "Yankovic effect" in that being parodied by Yankovic helped boost the success of the original songs by other musicians, notably withNirvanaand Yankovic's parody "Smells Like Nirvana"; and Madonna did originally come up with the concept of Yankovic's parody "Like a Surgeon", which Yankovic had heard about and agreed was a good idea.[14]
A feature film of the same name was officially announced in January 2022, withDaniel Radcliffeset to star in the titular role. It was directed by Appel from a screenplay he co-wrote with Yankovic.[15][16]Appel jokingly stated, "When Weird Al first sat me down against my will and told me his life story, I didn't believe any of it, but I knew that we had to make a movie about it."[9]
Yankovic and Appel were aware that Radcliffe was a fan of classic comedic musicians such asTom Lehrer;[12]for his part, Radcliffe felt that his November 2010 appearance onThe Graham Norton Show, during which he sang a rendition of Lehrer's song "The Elements", was the reason for his casting: "I guess Al saw that and was like, 'This guy maybe gets it.' And so he picked me."[17]The actor was already a fan of Yankovic's work through his own appreciation as well as that of his girlfriend,Erin Darke, who would play Yankovic's music on road trips.[12]He was also looking to expand his repertoire, believing the part gave him more creative capabilities similar to his role inSwiss Army Man(2016).[12]
As part of his preparation, Radcliffe learned the principles of playing the accordion, Yankovic's signature instrument, through video tutorials Yankovic had made for him.[18]Radcliffe sang the songs live on camera while filming, but his vocals were replaced with pre-recorded ones by Yankovic in the final product.[4]Yankovic and Appel would later express some regret over not letting Radcliffe perform his own vocals, given Radcliffe's Broadway background, but ultimately felt that having Radcliffe lip-sync to Yankovic's real voice was integral to the biopic parody, as it was the method used withRami Malekand hisFreddie Mercuryportrayal inBohemian Rhapsody.[19]
In March 2022,Evan Rachel Wood,Rainn Wilson,Toby Huss, andJulianne Nicholsonwere confirmed to star.[20]A few months later in July, it was revealedQuinta Brunsonwould also appear in the film.[21]Even thoughWeirdis a parody, the filmmakers sought to cast actors known primarily for dramatic roles. Appel believed the humor would then come from the actors playing their roles in a serious, grounded manner, as if they were in a dramatic biopic, despite the absurdity of the scenes.[22]
Yankovic reached out to his "holiday card mailing list" to bring a number of celebrities to cameo in the film, most shown during the Dr. Demento pool party scene.[23]While the script called for Al to be challenged by Freddie Mercury at the pool party, terms of Yankovic's agreement with the band Queen for "Another One Rides the Bus" said that Yankovic could not mention Mercury. They reached out toThe Lonely Island(Andy Samberg,Akiva Schaffer, andJorma Taccone) to appear as the other members of Queen instead, but while Samberg was unavailable, Schaffer and Taccone still wanted to participate in the film, and were cast asAlice CooperandPee-wee Herman, respectively.David Dastmalchianwas eventually cast as bassistJohn Deacon.[24]Lin-Manuel Mirandacontacted Yankovic within minutes of the announcement of the film's production, requesting a role in it, and Yankovic was able to fit his cameo as an ER doctor during a time when Miranda was in Los Angeles.[24]
Patton Oswalt, who played Dr. Demento in the original short, had been set to play this role in the film, but he broke his foot shortly before shooting began, and due to the tight schedule, the production could not afford to wait. They were able to bring in Wilson to play the role three days before filming commenced.[12][24]Oswalt was still able to cameo in the film as a heckler in a bar.[8]Aaron Paul, who played Yankovic in the original short, had been set to cameo as the said bar heckler, but he came down withCOVID-19during the filming period and was unable to participate.[25][24]
Once Radcliffe signed on to star,The Roku Channelagreed to invest inWeird.[12]The film had a budget of around $8 million and was shot over eighteen days, after initially being planned for twenty-two days.[1]Filming was limited to eighteen days as part of Roku's contract due to a combination of cost-saving measures and the ongoingCOVID-19 pandemic.[12]Principal photographywas originally planned to take place inAtlantato take advantage of tax breaks,[26]but Roku allowed the film to be shot in Los Angeles, which enabled Yankovic and Appel to hire a number of celebrities forcameo appearancesin the film.[11]Filming began on February 10, 2022.[27][28]Radcliffe concluded shooting his scenes after sixteen days on March 4, inPomona, California.[29][30]The pool party scene was shot inTarzana, California.[24]Overall filming wrapped on March 8, 2022.[31]Post-production was done while Yankovic was onThe Unfortunate Return of the Ridiculously Self-Indulgent, Ill-Advised Vanity Tourin 2022, with Yankovic working remotely with Appel's team to finalize the film.[12]
Yankovic had the original16mmfootage shot for the "Eat It" video scanned in 4K and this footage was briefly used in the film with Radcliffe's face digitally superimposed onto Yankovic's.  Yankovic later edited the newly-scanned footage to match the original video frame-for frame and released it on YouTube.[32]
Dr. Demento's pool party draws inspiration from a similar scene in the filmBoogie Nights(1997), while Al being arrested onstage is based on the1969 incidentwithThe DoorsfrontmanJim Morrisonduring a concert in Miami.[33]The end-credits scene includes a parody ofCarrie(1976), in which Madonna comes to visit Al's grave, only to be grabbed at the wrist by a zombified arm.[34]
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story (Original Soundtrack)is the soundtrack album accompanying the film. Yankovic released it digitally the same day of the film's release, on November 4, 2022. The album includes an original song recorded by Yankovic for the film, "Now You Know",[35]several of his parodies featured in the film with new recorded versions, and the soundtrack compositions byLeo Birenbergand Zach Robinson.[36]It was released on CD on January 27, 2023,[37]followed by a release onvinylon May 19, 2023.[38]
Weird: The Al Yankovic Storyhad its world premiere at theRoyal Alexandra Theatreduring theToronto International Film Festivalon September 8, 2022,[39]and was released onThe Roku Channelon November 4, 2022.[9][40]Yankovic requested that the film have a limited release in theaters to make it eligible for the95th Academy Awards; Roku declined, preferring for the film to be instead eligible for the75th Primetime Emmy Awards.[41]
Village Roadshow Entertainment Groupacquired the rights to distribute the film in all international markets excluding Canada, Latin America, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[42]
Australian distributorUmbrella Entertainmentannounced a release on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD, with a release date in April 2023.[43]
In August 2023,Shout! Studiosannounced a release on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD in the United States and Canada with a release date of December 12, 2023.[44][45]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 84% based on 160 reviews, with an average of 7.2/10. The website's consensus reads, "Suitably silly,Weird: The Al Yankovic Storyspoofs the standard biopic formula with all the good-natured abandon fans will expect."[46]Metacriticassigned the film aweighted average scoreof 70 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[47]
Owen GleibermanofVarietyreviewed, "Weirdis witty and inventive enough to sustain what could, in lesser hands, have been a one-joke movie, anSNLriff on itself. The film's ultimate joke is that 'Weird Al' Yankovic's entire career was a joke — not just because he made so-daft-they're-funny versions of other people's songs, but because what he did made him a court jester of imitation."[48]Leah Greenblatt ofEntertainment Weeklygave the film a grade of B, writing that the film is "analternative-factsfever dream so bent on the certifiably ridiculous that it circles back around somehow to sweetness. You don't need any of it, really, but as far as celebrityhagiographiesgo, you kind of can't beat it."[3]Nick Allen ofRogerEbert.comgave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and praised Radcliffe's performance as Yankovic.[49]
Reviewer Amy Nicholson, writing in theNew York Timescalled the film an "uproarious sham biopic" and praised Radcliffe as "winningly guileless in his performance, twitching his costume-y eyebrows and mustache like gentle bunny ears even as he lip-syncs 'Another One Rides the Bus' with such commitment that his neck veins nearly pop."[50]Kellen Quigley of theSalamanca Presscompared the film favorably to the 2007parodybiopicWalk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, noting that both films had come shortly after a wave ofOscar baitbiopics.[51]Rafael Motamayor atIGNgave it 9 out of 10 and called it "amazing".[52]

Eric Appel(born August 13, 1980) is an American filmmaker working in television, film, and commercials.
Originally fromEndicott, New York, Appel attended theArt Institute of Pittsburgh, majoring in computer animation. Describing his childhood interests, Appel said, "I was always playing around with video cameras, but I was also the kid that drew cartoons. It’s weird. I was so obsessed with movies and television, but nobody ever told me that I should go to film school... [W]hen I decided to go to school for animation, it felt like a no-brainer. However, when I actually went away to college, I realized that I had made a mistake (and also that I wasn’t that great at drawing). I actually spent more time working on videos with my roommate, who was majoring in video production, than I did working on my own project
."
While in college, Appel also began performingimprov comedy, after his girlfriend brought him to a "show at the University of Pittsburgh called 'Friday Nite Improvs,' where anyone from the audience could volunteer to go up on stage and perform these improv games." After moving toNew York City, Appel started taking classes at theUpright Citizens Brigade Theater, "and it wasn’t long before I was basically living at the theatre. I became very involved very quickly. [I was] taking improv classes, interning, running the lights for shows and really helping out in any way that I could so I could just be around comedy as much as possible."[1][2]
While still in New York, Appel got a job writing forThe Andy Milonakis Show, then moved toLos Angelesfor that show's third season when its production was relocated to California. He subsequently wrote forCrank YankersandHuman Giant, then went to work for the comedy websiteFunny or Die. "Funny or Die was such a young company when they hired me...there were about eight of us all sitting around a large dining room table on laptops. Every day a few people would disappear to go shoot some shit and then the next day they would be sitting next to you editing it. Then it would go up on the site and it would either get a million hits or nobody would watch it and it would disappear and then it was on to the next thing. Everyone there worked at their own pace and you were encouraged to just go pick up a camera and make something...I used this as an opportunity to start directing my own sketches and quickly found out that not only do I like directing more than writing, but also that I’m better at it."[3]
Appel would go on to extensively direct series television, with credits includingEagleheart,NTSF:SD:SUV,The Office,New Girl,Selfie,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Son of Zorn,Die HartandThe Afterparty.[4]
In 2022, Appel made his feature directorial debut withWeird: The Al Yankovic Story, based on a Funny or Die short that he directed twelve years earlier.[5][6]The film won aCritics Choice Awardfor Best Made for Television Movie.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
