Antonio Flores is a humblevaletliving with his mother Cecilia. He is separated from his wife, Isabel, and shares custody of their teenage son. His neighborhood is under threat of upcoming gentrification plans, which local bike shop owner Natalie is trying to fight. Meanwhile, actress Olivia Allan is having an affair with city developer and married billionaire Vincent Royce. One night, when Olivia is getting into her Uber with Vincent standing next to her, Antonio crashes his bike into the car. The three are photographed together, sparking rumors of Olivia and Vincent's affair. Fearing he will lose his company if his wife Kathryn divorces him, Vincent comes up with a plan to have Olivia and Antonio pretend to be a couple. Olivia accepts because she wants to avoid any bad publicity before the premiere of her new film,Earhart, in which she stars asAmelia Earhart. Antonio requests $12,850 to pay for Isabel's debts.
Antonio and Olivia go out for lunch surrounded by paparazzi, where Olivia is rude and calculating, and Antonio is out of place. Everybody falls for the ploy, except for Kathryn, who hires a private investigator to tail them. At the premiere ofEarhart, she questions Antonio, who stands up for himself when she criticizes his occupation. As he leaves the event, Antonio realizes that he has become famous, especially within the Latin American community. Antonio and his friends drive a drunk Olivia home to avoid any unflattering paparazzi pictures.
The next day, Olivia is given a proper breakfast by Antonio's family. She admires their closeness and love for each other. Vincent is incorrectly led to believe that Antonio and Olivia slept together, making him jealous.Earhartreceives positive reviews after the premiere but Olivia is lonely and unsure of Vincent's promise to leave his wife. Olivia attends Antonio's son's play at school. Out of jealousy, Isabel kisses Antonio, who tells her the truth about Olivia. Antonio and Olivia bond, and Olivia welcomes her anonymity in a Latin-American neighborhood. Back home, they pretend to have sex to mess with private investigators observing them from across the street. Cecilia tells Antonio she is glad he has found love again, like she has with their Korean landlord Mr. Kim, even though neither can speak the same language. Olivia acknowledges that she has not been living a healthy lifestyle.
The following day, Isabel tells Antonio that she wants to file for divorce, because she does not want to be with someone who thinks so little of himself. Olivia and Antonio fight over each of their self-destructive tendencies—her aloofness and his self-deprecation—and they publicly "break up". Vincent's lawyer later approaches Antonio to pay him $25,000, explaining that he grew up like Antonio and he is happy whenever he can do the right thing. Antonio hesitates, but takes the money.
Cecilia suffers a stroke and dies in the kitchen with Mr. Kim at her side. At the funeral, Antonio delivers a heartfelt eulogy about his mother's hardships to give him and his siblings a better life in the United States, and thanks Mr. Kim for giving her happiness. He speaks in English so Mr. Kim's family can translate. He makes up with Olivia, who decides to break up with Vincent. Kathryn learns the truth about Vincent, files for divorce, and takes over the company. To thank Antonio, she cancels the gentrification plans. Antonio builds up the courage to ask out Natalie. The film closes with Antonio and Olivia discussing Antonio's love life while the paparazzi take photos from the street.

It was launched on October 29, 2007, initially as ajoint venturebetweenNews Corporation(later21st Century Fox) andNBC Universal, which was laterbought byComcast. Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initiallybrandedas "Hulu Plus," which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and un-delayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—anover-the-topstreaming television service offering access tobroadcast televisionchannels.
In 2011, Hulu launchedits services in Japan, marking its first and only international expansion. Three years later in 2014, Hulu Japan was acquired byNippon TVand spun off from its American counterpart.[2]Since February 2021, Hulu's original content has since been distributed outside of the U.S. viaDisney+under theStarbrand. In 2019, Disney acquired a majority stake in Hulu as part of itsacquisition of 21st Century Fox, and subsequently acquired the remaining stakes held by AT&T and Comcast in 2019 and 2023, respectively, giving it full ownership. After the acquisition, Disneysoft launchedan integration of Hulu into Disney+ as a content hub in December 2023, allowing subscribers of both services to access Hulu content from within the Disney+ app. Hulu is one of the three streaming services in the Disney Bundle, alongside Disney+ andESPN+.

The combined company will remain publicly traded on theNew York Stock Exchange, but will be controlled by Disney executives.

Discovery(WarnerMedia's successor after its merger withDiscovery, Inc.) over a joint venture known asVenu Sports, with Fubo being granted a preliminary injection to stop its launch in August 2024.

The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]

Linked page for 'Pantelion Films' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantelion_Films):
Pantelion Filmswas an American film production company that was created in 2010 and based inSanta Monica, California. The studio's goal was to bring wider theatrical distribution of movies aimed at Latino audiences. It was backed byTelevisaUnivisionandLionsgate Studios. Making theatrical relationships with movie exhibition chains includingRegal Entertainment Group,AMC Theatres,Cinemex, andCinemark, the studio raised the level of theatrically-released Latino films. Under that arrangement, Pantelion was active with its own office from 2010 to 2023. The studio's first film was 2011'sFrom Prada to Nada, which Lionsgate and Grupo Televisa announced it had commissioned for a television series that did not materialize in 2012.[1]The studio's office was discontinued in 2023 and its website redirected in 2024 effectively ending the studio's operational lifecycle though not the usage of its trademark for existing unreleased if not future productions.
Pantelion Films billed itself as the first major Latino Hollywood film studio. The studio was part of a transformation of Hollywood film studios that recognized in the early part of the 2010s that one of the fastest growing segments of the United States entertainment was Hispanic audiences.[2]Pantelion Films' stature within the film industry was raised further when it successfully acquired the U.S. distribution rights to the 2012Will Ferrellfilm,Casa de Mi Padre. The studio was able to move Latino films from strictly beinglimited releasefilms to a wider, single weekend release on more than 200 screens simultaneously. This distribution practice was new to the United States with respect to Hispanic audiences and represented the first major attempt by a U.S. based studio to cater to Latino audiences in this manner.
The original chairman of Pantelion was James M. McNamara, former chief executive ofTelemundo, its chief executive was former Lionsgate executive, Paul Presburger through 2022, and its chief operating officer was Edward Allen. Pantelion Films said that Latinos were the fastest growing segment of the movie going audience in the 2010s and were loyal DVD consumers.[3]As Lionsgate released many of Tyler Perry's films which reached an African American audience, Lionsgate and Grupo Televisa were striving for similar success with Latino audiences. McNamara said, "Latinos don't see themselves reflected in Hollywood movies" and said the studio's goal was to change that in their film releases.[4]
Pressberger said that the studio hoped to avoid the clichéd, stereotyped images of Latino life and culture. "We get out of the stereotypes of narco kings and drug dealers and gang members" in our films.[5]Financially, tax breaks were "driving the decisions everywhere in the world," Presburger said as film companies including Pantelion looked to lower risks of investment through tax credit deals in the 2010s.[6]An example of how Pantelion actively used tax breaks came in 2014 when it reached a multi-picture deal with Indomina Media of the Dominican Republic to produce up to four Spanish-language films annually to be released by Pantelion.[7]The films were to be entirely produced in the Dominican Republic to take advantage of governmental film incentives.
Pantelion was not the first to target the Latino audience. Other attempts by U.S. studios to reach Latino audiences had met with little financial success.New Line Cinemastruck a deal with the director ofMi Familia,Gregory Nava, to produce feature films for the Latino market.[8]But that did not gain momentum and was discontinued. Other studios trying to reach the market wereSamuel Goldwyn Filmsin the early 2000s and a venture betweenUniversal Studioswhich had a distribution agreement with Arenas Entertainment, another Latino film and television series producer, was discontinued in 2003.  As the first decade of the 2000s continued,  some Spanish-language films received theatrical distribution from Latino-based exhibitors including Cinema Latino or on art circuits. But the business model of Pantelion was to have larger opening weekends in U.S. multiplexes than had ever been previously attempted instead of limited release and bicycling of a limited numbers of prints around the country.
The studio was able to placeFrom Prada to Nadaon 256 U.S. theater screens and the film brought in just over $3 million at the box office.[9]The Los Angeles Times viewed the studio's first film as a "modest" box office success and noted the heavy television advertising onUnivisionin an attempt to reach audiences in the 21 cities in which the film was released. The studio's debut film received anALMA Awardgiven toAlexa Vegaas Favorite Movie Actor in a Comedy or Musical. The film's success was significant enough that Televisa and Lionsgate extended their business relationship to include television program development, including the From Prada to Nada series announced in 2012. The studio's follow up film toPrada,No Eres Tú, Soy Yo, reached 226 theaters though brought in less money with $1.3 million.[10]The studio also picked up the U.S. rights for the foreign filmSaving Private Perezwhich was placed on 161 U.S. screens and brought in $1.4 million at the box office.[11]The studio released the Will Ferrell filmCasa de Mi Padrein 2012 which would become the studio's highest-grossing title to that point with a $5.9 domestic box office total. The film was described as an "homage to classic westerns and telenovelas" and shot in Spanish.[12]The studio's follow-up film,Girl in Progressopened on Mother's Day weekend and would gross over $2 million domestically. In 2013, Pressburber said that his company made a slight shift from low budget films to "films that incorporate Latino talent and Latino themes but have universal appeal and can resonate with a broad commercial audience."[13]
Pantelion's biggest successes came with starEugenio DerbezwhoseInstructions Not Includedled to afirst-look dealwith Derbez in 2014.[14]The film set a record for the highest grossing Spanish-language film to date, earning $44.4 million in the United States and $99 million worldwide.[15]The film opened on 348 screens in the United States on its first weekend handily winning the week's best per screen average with $22,547 per screen before expanding to 717 screens.[16]Derbez's 2017 releaseHow to Be a Latin Loverbecame the studio's highest weekend box office performer earning $12 million in the last weekend of April in 2017."[17]
Pantelion also picked up its first English-language film when it obtained the North American rights to Paul Walker's film,Hours. Two weeks prior to the film's release date of December 13, 2013, Walker was killed in a car accident in Los Angeles, California on November 30, leavingHoursas the first film starring Walker to be released after his death. Pantelion's second English-language feature was announced asSummer Camp, starringDiego Bonetaand directed byAlberto Marini, but was beaten to the theaters by George Lopez's Pantelion release,Spare Parts,[18]andThe Vatican Tapes. In 2015, Pantelion releasedUn Gallo con Muchos Huevos, which was the first wide theatrical release for a Mexican animated feature film.
Late in 2016, Hemisphere Media Group partnered with Lionsgate to create a subscriptionvideo on demandservice incorporating Pantelion's titles.[19]The service, calledPantaya, was launched in August 2017.[20]In 2021, Hemisphere Media Group acquired full ownership rights to the Pantaya streaming service from Lionsgate for $124 million, following the latter's decision to focus on the expansion of its Starz brand.
Subsequently, in May 2022, TelevisaUnivision reached a deal with Hemisphere Media Group to acquire Pantaya, targeting the platform in order to fortify their ownViXstreaming service.[21]The acquisition was completed on September 13 of that year.[22]Following the acquisition's completion, Pantelion's social media was discontinued thereafter with Pantelion's web presence redirected to the ViX service in the summer of 2024. Remaining employee contacts from Pantelion were folded into the Lionsgate organization with the Pantelion office closed in 2023 effectively ending the studio's operational lifecycle as an independently-run arm of Lionsgate. The studio's name would likely remain in use until all productions reached completion and distribution. The Pantelion name is still considered an active trademark.
The studio's debut film, "From Prada to Nada," received an ALMA Award nomination for Favorite Movie and won for Favorite Actress in a Comedy or Musical awarded to Alexa Vega. Pantelion's "Girl in Progress" won ALMA's Favorite Movie award in 2012. In 2019, Pantelion Films was awarded an Impact Award by theNational Hispanic Media Coalitionfor their "Excellence in Production of Latino-Themed Content."[23]"Radical" received a nomination for best feature film in the 2024 Imagen Awards.[24]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
