Marmadukeis a 2022animatedcomedy filmdirected byMark Dippé, and co-directed byPhil Nibbelink, Youngki Lee, and Matt Whelan, based on the comic stripof the same nameby Paul andBrad Anderson. The second feature-length film based on the strip following the2010 film, it starsPete Davidsonas Marmaduke, along withJ.K. Simmons,Brian Hull,Shelby Young,David KoechnerandJulie Nathanson. The film is aninternational co-productionof the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, Korea, Hawaii and the United Kingdom.
It was released by SC Films in international countries and onNetflixin the United States on May 6, 2022. The film was universally panned by critics and audiences, with criticisms going towards its animation, screenplay, story, characters, and humor. It is considered to be one of theworst animated films ever made.
Phil, his wife, and their two kids Barbara and Billy live with their dog, a Great Dane by the name of Marmaduke. The film opens at Billy's birthday party. Marmaduke takes a cannonball dive from the second floor of the family home into the backyard pool, releasing a tidal wave. Barbara records it on her phone and the video goes viral. It comes to the attention of a world-renowned dog trainer, Guy, who offers to turn Marmaduke into a world-class show dog. At first, the family isn’t sure about Marmaduke entering the competitions. When Phil learns there is a one million dollar top prize, he’s persuaded to make an agreement. Marmaduke goes into training and, after some initial resistance, he begins to make progress.
Guy enters Marmaduke into a local dog show to test his skills. During the preliminary setup, Marmaduke encounters anAfghan Houndnamed Zeus, who entices him to eat prior to the competition, which results in him getting bloated. Marmaduke does his best to conceal the matter and struts onto the field with Guy. Before one lap around the field, Marmaduke releases voluminous clouds of noxious flatus, enveloping the entire field in the process. He soars through the air and lands backside down in the winner’s trophy and defecates in it, much to the horror of everyone.
Disgraced, Guy refuses to keep training Marmaduke, leaving him deflated and dejected. Marmaduke runs away from home, but when he runs down the street, he sees the family cat, Kingtut, in the middle of an intersection. Marmaduke saves him but has difficulty connecting with his character. Persuaded by Kingtut, Marmaduke embarks on a trip around the globe, performing heroic stunts along the way. His circumnavigation convinces Guy to take Marmaduke back on track for the World Dog Championship. Marmaduke encounters Zeus again at the competition along with many other dogs: littleWelsh corgiJuan Pedro, beautiful pinkpoodleShantrelle, and strongStaffordshire bull terrierVinnie. The competition consists of three challenges, but right after Marmaduke passes the second challenge, he lands on Guy, who immediately gets hospitalized. Without a trainer, his owners end up stepping in to coach him, allowing him to tackle the final challenge.
In the third and final challenge, the dogs perform a unique act, with Marmaduke and Billy doing a cowboy act with King Tut, pleasing the audience. Later, the judge's final results reveal Zeus as the winner. However, Marmaduke uncovers that Zeus's owner rigged the scores, leading Zeus to be disqualified and resulting in theZen-poweredJapanese ChinZhi taking the top prize. Zeus tries to take back the trophy, but Marmaduke stops him. He ends up knocking over a platform where a cameraman sits, causing Marmaduke to push his owners out of the way, getting hit by the platform when saving the cameraman's life. Marmaduke is initially thought to be dead, but it is revealed that he is still alive, and initially winning the World Dog Championship and his family lived happily ever after.
During the mid-credits scene, Zeus gets caught by security and is sent to the dog pound to get his fur shaved and re-grown, while his Henri and Philipe are put in jail.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
