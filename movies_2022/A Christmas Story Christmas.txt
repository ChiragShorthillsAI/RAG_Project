Billingsley reprises his role as Ralphie Parker alongsideIan Petrella,Scott Schwartz,R. D. Robb,Zack Ward. AdditionallyErinn Hayes, River Drosche, and Julianna Layne play Ralphie's wife and kids, withJulie Hagertyacting in the role of Mrs. Parker. Principal photography began in late February 2022 in Hungary and Bulgaria.A Christmas Story Christmaswas released in the United States on November 17, 2022, onHBO Max.[1]The film received generally positive reviews from critics.
In December 1973, 33 years afterA Christmas Story, 42-year-old Ralph "Ralphie" Parker lives inChicagowith his wife, Sandy, and two children, Mark and Julie. Ralph has been taking the year off from his job to write his first novel, but its excessive length leads multiple publishers to reject it. Mrs. Parker calls to tell Ralph that his father, "the Old Man", has died, and the grief-stricken family makes its way to Hohman, Indiana to be with her. She gives Ralph two tasks: write his father's obituary, and take up his mantle of making Christmas special for the family.
Ralph's children befriend one of the Bumpus kids next door, and have their snowman smashed by two bullies on a snowmobile. Ralph reunites with Flick, who now owns his father's old tavern, and Schwartz, who still lives with his mother and has run up a large tab at Flick's. While leaving the house to go ice skating, Sandy slips and sprains her ankle.
As Christmas Eve approaches, the family goes toHigbee's, where Ralph miraculously buys everything Mark and Julie asked for while the children speak to the store's Santa. On the way back, Ralph's car overheats, and Ralph accidentally hits Julie in the eye during an impromptu snowball fight. After Julie receives a temporary eyepatch at the hospital, the family discovers their car was burglarized in the hospital parking lot; the presents are gone, and there is little money left to replace them.
Back at Flick's, Flick offers to forgive Schwartz's tab if he sleds off a giant ramp; Schwartz manages to complete the stunt, but Mark breaks his arm sledding down the nearby hill afterwards. After Ralph is rejected by his final prospective publisher, he laments his difficulties, but is encouraged by his mother and Sandy. Remembering his favorite Christmas with his father inspires Ralph to write a long article instead of a standard obituary; however, he leaves it on the desk, needing to prepare for Christmas Day. Mark and Julie manage to get back at their bullies by building a snowman over a tree stump so that the snowmobile crashes.
On Christmas Eve night, the star falls off the Parker's tree and breaks, upsetting Julie. Frustrated, Ralph ignores objections from his wife and his mother and goes out to find a new star. All the local businesses are already closed, so Ralph breaks into Flick's tavern to "borrow" the star from the tree. On his way out, he is apprehended by Scut Farkus, now a Hohman police officer. Ralph is terrified of what Scut might do to him, but Scut brings him home, saying he owes Ralph because their childhood fight set him on a better path in life.
Mrs. Parker goes into the basement to change afuseand finds several thoughtfully-picked, pre-wrapped gifts, which the Old Man had bought shortly before his death. On Christmas morning, the family is delighted to open them, and all their other presents as well. Ralph is confused by compliments he receives about his piece in the newspaper, and Sandy reveals she found the obituary manuscript and took it to the local paper because of its high quality. The phone rings, and Ralph is offered a new job as a syndicated columnist, fulfilling his dream of becoming a full-time writer. Much of the town comes to the Parker house for Christmas dinner; after dinner concludes, the core family asks Ralph to read them his story about the Old Man. Ralph takes a seat in his father's armchair and begins reading, and his narration slowly transitions into Jean Shepherd's opening narration from the first film.

Max, also known asHBO Max,[b]is an Americansubscription video on-demandover-the-topstreamingservice. It is a proprietary unit ofWarner Bros. Discovery Global Streaming & Games, which is itself a division ofWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD).[2]The platform offers content from thelibrariesofWarner Bros.,Discovery,HBO,CNN,Cartoon Network,Adult Swim,Animal Planet,TBS,TNT,Eurosport, and their related brands. Max first launched (as HBO Max) in the United States on May 27, 2020.
The service also carries first-run original programming under the "Max Originals" banner, programming from the HBOpay televisionservice, and content acquired via either third-party library deals (such as those with film studios for pay television rights) or co-production agreements (including, among others, those withBBC StudiosandSesame Workshop).
When the service was first launched as HBO Max, it succeeded bothHBO Now, a previous HBO SVOD service; andHBO Go, theTV Everywherestreaming platform for HBO pay television subscribers. In the United States, HBO Now subscribers and HBO pay television subscribers were migrated to HBO Max at no additional charge, subject to availability and device support. HBO Max also supplanted the streaming component ofDC Entertainment'sDC Universeservice, with its original series being migrated to HBO Max as Max Originals. The HBO Max service began to expand into international markets in 2021.
According toAT&T,[c]HBO and HBO Max had a combined total of 69.4 million paying subscribers globally on June 30, 2021, including 43.5 million HBO Max subscribers in the U.S., 3.5 million HBO-only U.S. subscribers (primarily commercial customers like hotels), and 20.5 million subscribers to either HBO Max or HBO by itself in other countries.[3]By the end of 2021, HBO and HBO Max had a combined total of 73.8 million paying global subscribers.[4][5]At the end of Q1 2022, HBO and HBO Max had 76.8 million global subscribers.[6]
Since the April 2022 merger ofWarnerMediawithDiscovery, Inc.to form Warner Bros. Discovery, Max is one of the combined company's two flagship streaming services, the other beingDiscovery+(which primarily focuses onfactualandrealityprogramming from the Discovery brands). WBD initially announced plans for HBO Max and Discovery+ to merge in 2023, but the company ultimately chose to retain Discovery+. As part of the decision, WBD migrated some Discovery+ shows to Max whilst also leaving them on Discovery+. WBD went on to replace HBO Max with a newly rebranded service, shortening the service's name to "Max", which launched in the United States on May 23, 2023, in Latin America on February 27, 2024, and in Europe on May 21, 2024, introducing a redesigned user interface, and adding more Discovery content. The rebrand was also applied to Netherlands, Poland, France, and several other regions in 2024. In Belgium and the Netherlands the name "HBO Max" was retained with a new Max logo.
On October 10, 2018, WarnerMedia announced that it would launch anover-the-topstreaming servicein late 2019, featuring content from its entertainment brands.[7]The original plan for the service called for three tiers with a late 2019 launch.[8]Randall L. Stephenson, chairman and CEO of WarnerMedia's parent,AT&Tindicated in mid-May 2019 that it would use the HBO brand and would tie into cable operators as HBO cable subscribers would have access to the streaming service. A beta was expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a full launch in the first quarter of 2020 at the time.[9]
Otter Mediawas transferred in May 2019 to WarnerMedia Entertainment fromWarner Bros.to take over the streaming service as Brad Bentley, executive vice president and general manager of direct-to-consumer development, exited the post after six months. Andy Forssell transferred from being the chief operating officer of Otter to replace Bentley as executive vice president and general manager while still reporting to Otter CEO Tony Goncalves, who would lead development.[10]
On July 9, 2019, WarnerMedia announced that the service would be known as HBO Max and that it would launch in spring 2020, whileReese Witherspoon'sHello SunshineandGreg Berlantiwere signed to production deals for the service. (The "Max" moniker is shared with HBO's sister linear pay television serviceCinemax, which has alternately identified by its suffix name since the mid-1980s and used it prominently in its branding from 2008 to 2011.)[11]On October 29, 2019, it was announced that HBO Max would officially launch in May 2020.[12]
On January 8, 2020, AT&T announced thatAudience, a channel exclusive to subscribers of AT&T-owned television providers such asDirecTVwith some original programming, would be sunset on May 22, eventually transitioning to abarker channelfor HBO Max.[13]Warner Bros.and HBO Max announced theWarner Maxfilm label on February 5, 2020, which would produce eight to ten mid-budget movies per year for the streaming service starting in 2020.[14]On April 20, 2020, WarnerMedia announced HBO Max's launch date as May 27.[15]Later that year on October 23, it was announced that WarnerMedia decided to consolidate the Warner Max label into the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after its chairman,Toby Emmerich, and his development and production team led by Courtenay Valenti of Warner Bros. Pictures, Richard Brener of New Line and Walter Hamada (who oversees DC-based films), was put to manage the company's entire film output, both theatrical and streaming releases.[16][17][18]
In July 2022, as a part of a cost-cutting and strategic move following the merger ofDiscovery, Inc.with WarnerMedia to formWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD), it was reported that HBO Max had ceased new original series development inCentral Europe,Nordic Europe, the Netherlands, and Turkey, as well as removed selected international series from the platform worldwide. It was reported that France and Spain had been largely excluded from these cuts, due to French regulations requiring streaming services to produce domestic content, and Spanish-language content appealing to a wide range of markets served by HBO Max.[19][20][21]With the cancellation ofGordita Chronicleslater that month, it was reported that the service was also abandoning development of live-action children's and family programming.[22]
On August 3, 2022, it was reported that multiple Max Original films and HBO series had been quietly removed from the service without prior notice as part of cuts to direct-to-streaming films. The company thenwrote offfilms and series that had underperformed on the service.[23][24]It was also thought that avoiding payment forresidualsplayed a part.[25]This followed news that had broken the previous day that then-upcoming Max Original filmsBatgirlandScoob! Holiday Haunthad been both abruptly cancelled, despite being nearly complete.[26][27]During an earnings call the next day, WBD CEODavid Zaslavstated that the company would cut children's programming and emphasize theatrical films over direct-to-streaming releases.[28][29]
Later that month, more programs were pulled from the streaming service, including animated and unscripted series such asThe Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo,Final Space,Summer Camp Island,Infinity Train,Close Enough, and nearly 200 episodes ofSesame Street, among others,[30][31]which was met with heavy backlash from fans, critics, actors, and creators alike.[32][33][34]On August 24, 2022, the HBO Max original filmsHouse Party(which was pulled from its slate just 17 days before its release) andEvil Dead Risewere both shifted to theatrical releases.[35]WBD later reached licensing deals with thefree ad-supported streaming television(FAST) servicesThe Roku ChannelandTubi(owned byFox Corporation) in 2023; the deal covers over 2,000 hours of library programming, some of which being shows that had been pulled from HBO Max.[36][37]
During its third-quarter earnings report in November 2022, WBD stated that the merged service was now targeting a "Spring 2023" launch in the U.S., ahead of the original schedule. Perrette also stated of a potential price increase for HBO Max's ad-free tier in 2023, explaining that it was "an opportunity, particularly in this environment".[38]A price hike for the ad-free tier in the U.S. was later announced on January 12, 2023, which saw the price raised by $1 to $15.99 a month (the yearly plan would be unaffected by this move), effective immediately for new subscribers, while current subscribers would see the price hike starting on February 11, 2023.[39]
On March 14, 2022, after Discovery shareholders approved its merger with WarnerMedia, Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels stated that the company planned to pursue an eventual merger of HBO Max with its own streaming serviceDiscovery+. Wiedenfels stated that this process would most likely begin with a bundle of the two services as a short-term option, with a long-term goal to eventually merge the services into one platform.[40]
During an earnings call in August 2022, WBD head of Global Streaming and Interactive JB Perrette revealed that Discovery+ and HBO Max would merge "next Summer", with the unified service launching first in the United States, and rolled out to other markets beginning in late-2023.[29]When announcing the merged service, Zaslav did not immediately indicate whether it would continue to carry the HBO brand. He stated that HBO was one of the "great crown jewels of the company" and would "always be the beacon and the ultimate brand that stands for the best of television quality".[41]In early-December 2022, it was reported by CNBC via inside sources that multiple names were being considered—including simply "Max".[42][43]
In February 2023, Zaslav revealed during an earnings call that WBD would officially announce the service on April 12.[44]He also announced that WBD would continue operating Discovery+ in conjunction with the service rather than shut it down, stating that it was profitable, and that its subscribers were "very happy with the product offering".[44]One day before the scheduled announcement,The New York Timesconfirmed that the service would be called "Max", and that it would retain HBO Max's existing pricing and be available in multiple price tiers for six months (on December 5 its legacy ad-free tier will be removed with former users in this tier downgrading to the ad-free tier after this date).[45][46]WBD acquired the max.comdomain nameearlier that year from Max International, anutritional supplementcompany.[47]
WBD officially unveiled Max on April 12: the new service would first launch in the United States on May 23, and in other regions throughout 2023 and 2024. While the new service maintains similar price points to HBO Max, support for4K resolutionvideo andDolby Atmosbecame exclusive to the new "Ultimate" tier, and the ad-free plan was also reduced from four concurrent streams to two.[48]In addition to all Warner Bros. Pictures releases from 2023 onward, WBD plans to have more library films and television series available on Max in 4K.[47][49][48]
Perrette explained that the HBO branding had been dropped from the service's name so that it could be associated with itsoriginal programmingas a flagship brand on Max, rather than having to be associated with the entirety of its library—which included children's and family programming at odds with HBO having traditionally been associated withpremiumand adult-oriented programming.[50][51]The Max logo was designed by the British agency DixonBaxi, and incorporates elements of both the HBO and Warner Bros. logos, including a center-dotted "a" resembling the center-dotted "O" from the HBO logo, and the "m" and "x" letters containing curves based on Warner Bros.' long-time shield logo. The service also changed its corporate color from purple to blue, in homage to Warner Bros.' historical use of blue-colored logos.[52][53]
The rebrand was promoted with the tagline "The one to watch".[54][55]Pato Spagnoletto, chief marketing officer of Warner Bros. Discovery Streaming, identified the campaign as the largest marketing spend in company history.[53][56]WBD's stock fell by nearly six percent after Max's announcement.[57]Within the first 3 months of Max's rebrand, WBD lost 1.8 million subscribers across their streaming platforms, but attributed it to an overlap of subscribers of Max and Discovery+, as well as expected churn.[58]In November 2023, it was reported that WBD lost 2.5 million subscribers over a six-month period, with their shares falling 19% as a result.[59]
In May 2024, WBD announced a partnership with Disney to offer a bundle of Max with its competitorsDisney+andHuluin the United States, It was launched on July 25, 2024, at a price of $16.99 per-month for ad-supported, and $29.99 per-month for ad-free.[60][61]
Existing HBO Max subscribers were grandfathered under their current plan features for least six months, following that period all legacy ad free customers were moved to the ad free tier (existing ad supported were moved to the ad lite tier).[64][46]
HBO Max was formed under WarnerMedia's Entertainment division, then headed byRobert Greenblatt.Kevin Reilly, president of WarnerMedia Entertainment Networks, which includes most of the company's ad-supported entertainment channels such asTBS,TNT, andTruTV, was also given the role of as chief content officer of HBO Max with responsibility for HBO Max-exclusive original programming and library content. Andy Forssell was named the service's executive vice president and general manager while still reporting toOtter MediaCEO Tony Goncalves, who leads development.[11]Casey Bloys, programming president of HBO, retained oversight of the core HBO service but was not initially involved with Max-exclusive programming.
On August 7, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a significant restructuring under new presidentJason Kilar, which he described as "leaning into this great moment of change" towards direct-to-consumer services. As a result, Greenblatt and Reilly both left the company. WarnerMedia Entertainment was dissolved, with programming operations combined with Warner Bros. in a new Studios and Networks group under that studio's CEO Ann Sarnoff. Bloys was given complete programming oversight of HBO and HBO Max, as well as Reilly's other previous responsibilities, reporting to Sarnoff. Forssell became the head of a new HBO Max operating business unit, reporting directly to Kilar.[65]On April 23, 2021,Adult Swimand HBO Max's adult animation development teams merged under the leadership of Suzanna Makkos.[66]
On August 15, 2022, HBO was reorganized by Warner Bros. Discovery, resulting in layoffs within HBO Max's non-scripted originals, live-action family originals, international originals, and casting units (HBO itself never had an in-house casting department). Makkos also began reporting to HBO's head of comedy Amy Gravitt.[67][68]
Max features first-run and library content from HBO and other Warner Bros. film and television studios and brands.[69][70][71]The service also includes films available through HBO's existing pay television rights that are sourced fromWarner Bros. Picturesonly.[70][72][73][74]
As with HBO's other streaming platforms,HBO GoandHBO Now(but as opposed to its add-on services onPrime Video Channels,YouTube Primetime Channelsand, until its removal from that platform in 2021,Apple TV Channels), Max originally did not include feeds of HBO's linear cable channels,[75]nor does it include any content fromCinemax.[76]Though Cinemax shares its film content with the linear HBO channel, and therefore the majority of films in the combined library will be on both services in different windows, these films will not necessarily be available on both Max and Cinemax at the same time.[77]
On December 4, 2024, Max added a “Channels” tab offering live feeds of HBO and its linear multiplex channels (with the exception of HBO Family and HBO Latino). Initially available on a limited basis to U.S. subscribers of Max’s Ad-Free and Ultimate Ad-Free tiers using adult profiles, the feature will allow users to restart, rewind and fast-forward, and navigate between streams of the linear channel feeds directly from within the player.[78][79]

Original content produced will be under the bannerMax Originals, including series, films, and specials.Original episodic content is released weekly, eschewing the "binge" format made popular byNetflix.Kevin Reillystated this was to ensure that originals would remain in the spotlight for extended periods, by letting said shows "breathe" as opposed to "fading quickly after a binge and burn". He also noted that the weekly schedule helped to drive the success of past HBO shows likeSuccessionandChernobylwhich they co-produced withSky UK, and became hits precisely due to their staying power.[87]
A slate of 31 original series were planned for its first year, with plans to expand to 50 for its next year, but production timelines may have been interrupted by theCOVID-19 pandemic.[70]Max also has podcasts about the films and TV series on the service.[90]It also produces original podcasts exclusively for the service, withBatman: The Audio Adventuresbeing the first.[91]

Over 700 episodes of BBC content were available on the service at launch, including the first 11 seasons of the 2005Doctor Whorevival, as well as future seasons twelve through fourteen, and a variety of other shows includingThe Honourable Woman,Luther,Top Gear, and the original British version ofThe Office.

It also announced the animated seriesGremlins: Secrets of the MogwaiandTiny Toons Looniversity, with the former premiering alongside the rebrand on May 23, 2023.[128][129][130]In June 2023, Max picked up a pilot.
On October 2, 2024, WBD renewed its contract withprofessional wrestlingpromotionAll Elite Wrestling(AEW), which adds digital rights for Max in the United States. As part of the agreement, Max will hold the rights to simulcast AEW's weekly programs beginning in January 2025. Later in the year, AEWpay-per-viewevents will become available for purchase and streaming on Max; while PPVs will continue to be sold through other platforms, they will have a discounted price on Max, and Max will be promoted as the main home for AEW PPVs.[131][132]
In late 2020, due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, WarnerMedia moved two Warner Bros. films originally intended as major theatrical releases to either exclusive or simultaneous releases on HBO Max.The Witcheswas released exclusively on HBO Max in the U.S. on October 22,[133]andWonder Woman 1984debuted simultaneously in North American theaters and on HBO Max on December 25, although the latter was initially only available on the service for a month.[134]Week-long free trials were discontinued in December 2020.[135]
On December 3, 2020, it was announced that the studio's entire 2021 film lineup would see a simultaneous theatrical release and a one-month limited release on the streaming service, starting withThe Little Thingson January 29.[136]Subsequent films released under the same-day theatrical/streaming window to date wereJudas and the Black Messiah(February 12),[137][138]Tom and Jerry(February 26),Godzilla vs. Kong(March 31),Mortal Kombat(April 23),Those Who Wish Me Dead(May 14),The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It(June 4),In the Heights(June 10),Space Jam: A New Legacy(July 16),The Suicide Squad(August 5),Reminiscence(August 20),Malignant(September 10),Cry Macho(September 17),The Many Saints of Newark(October 1),Dune(October 22),King Richard(November 19), andThe Matrix Resurrections(December 22). Standard release windows applied to each film after their initial limited-run streaming release on the service; HBO Max would then reassume streaming rights to the aforementioned Warner Bros. films upon their respective pay television premieres on the linear HBO service in mid-to-late 2021 or 2022, depending on the scheduled start of their individual HBO exhibition agreements.[139][140]
This decision, called "Project Popcorn" within Warner Bros.,[141]was met with backlash from filmmakers, production companies, theDirectors Guild of America, theCreative Artists Agency, and movie theater owners as Warner Bros. had not informed anyone about their plan ahead of the announcement.[142][143][144][145][146]Viewership of the films varied, withMortal Kombatreaching 3.8 million,The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do Ittotaling 1.6 million, andIn the Heightstotaling 693,000 (according toSamba TV, as WarnerMedia does not report viewership numbers for HBO Max).[147]
Warner Bros. spent over $200million alone compensating talent for the shift to streaming;Deadlinereported in January 2022 that such a business move "will never occur again given its high cost".[141]
In March 2021, it was announced that Warner Bros. would discontinue same-day releases in 2022, as part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas) and will instead use a 45-day exclusive release window for theaters.[148]The Matrix Resurrectionswas the final film released in 2021 as part of Project Popcorn. The 45-day release window for HBO Max was only used for two films (The BatmanandFantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore) before it was reported in August 2022 that as part of a restructuring of Warner Bros' film distribution strategy following the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc, the length of the window would now be decided for each film on a case-by-case basis.[149]
On August 13, 2023, CNN announced a new streaming news hub on Max known asCNN Maxto launch on September 27, which features a mix of original news programs and simulcasts of primetime programs from CNN's U.S. andinternationallinear networks.[150][151]CNN Internationalwill be also available through Max in European countries such as France and Poland.[152]
CNN had previously attempted a standalone subscription service in 2022,CNN+, but was closed almost immediately after the completion of the WarnerMedia/Discovery merger due to it conflicting with the company's goal of having one streaming service to encompass all WBD properties.[153][154]
Beginning on March 30, 2025, Max announced that it will be removing this feature on the Basic with ads plan.[155]
On March 1, 2022, Turner Sports announced an eight-year deal to hold rights toUnited States men'sandwomen'snational soccer team home matches, such as FIFA World Cup qualifying and international friendlies. This excludesFIFAandCONCACAFevents, whose rights are held by Fox, and away matches. It was stated that at least half the matches per-season would be exclusive to HBO Max.[156]The first match was streamed on January 17, 2023.[157]
On October 5, 2023, Max announced plans to launch a new sports-focused tier in the United States, to be known initially as theBleacher ReportSports add-on. The tier would feature live sporting events and studio shows fromTNT Sports, includingMajor League Baseball(MLB), theNational Basketball Association(NBA), theNational Hockey League(NHL), and theNCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, as well as exclusive USA Soccer matches and programs, and select on-demand content.[158][159]On December 14, 2023, amid the closure of theGCN+service, WBD announced that its programming rights would be consolidated into the sports add-on in February 2024, including theGiro d'Italiaand variousUCItours and events.[160]
The service was to be available as a free preview until February 29, 2024, after which it was to become an $9.99 add-on on top of an existing Max subscription. However, amid changes to TNT Sports' portfolio (including its impending loss of rights to the NBA in 2025, and other acquisitions such as college sports and international events such as theFrench Open), the launch of the sports add-on as a paid service was delayed indefinitely.[158][159]On February 26, 2025, it was announced that the add-on had been scrapped as part of a change in strategy, and that live sports content would be available at no additional charge as part of the "Standard" and "Premium" tiers of Max (as B/R sports on Max). JB Perrette stated that WBD had been "actively involved in exploring ways to evolve the sports distribution ecosystem in the U.S.", and that offering sports content as part of the existing tiers was the best option for subscribers.[161][162]
Similar to the Bleacher Report Sports add-on in the United States, a sports-focused tier will be added to Max in Europe during its launch over the summer of 2024 in conjunction with its pan-European sports brandEurosport. This tier will offer the linear channelsEurosport 1andEurosport 2, and coverage for various sports events including the2024 Summer Olympics, Giro d'Italia,Vuelta a España, andTour de France.[152]
On July 9, 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery announced thatTNT Sportswill arrive at Max in Chile the week of July 15 with an innovative proposal where sports fans will be able to subscribe independently or by adding it to the platform's available plans. It will include live events and original content.
The most relevant Chilean soccer competitions are added, such as theChilean Primera División,Primera B,Copa Chileand original programming, among others.[1]
From February 2025,TNT Sportscontent will be available to users with a subscription toPack Fútbolwith their enabled cable operator and to TNT Sports subscribers independently.
From October 24, 2024, in Spain, Max has added a newMax DAZNpackage that will cost €44.99 per month, in addition to the Sports package that is optional for the Standard and Premium plans, it includes fourDAZNchannels in addition toEurosportwith the best sport that fans could wish for.
LaLiga, theUFC, or theFormula 1andMotoGPworld championships will be available to subscribers of theMax DAZNPackage, in addition to having all the movies, series and documentaries on the platform with the same advantages as the Premium Plan[163]
At launch, HBO Max did not support4K,HDR,Dolby Vision, orDolby Atmos, but support for these technologies were planned as "part of the HBO Max product roadmap".[164][165]Support for 4K, HDR, and Atmos was added starting with the release ofWonder Woman 1984,[166][non-primary source needed]with WarnerMedia promising to add more content in these formats throughout 2021 and beyond.[167]
The service providedclosed captioningsupport at launch, but initially lacked support foraudio description(AD) for those with visual impairments.[168]In October 2020, theAmerican Council of the Blindannounced it had reached a settlement with WarnerMedia whereby at least 1,500 hours of HBO Max content will be available with AD by the end of March 2021, increasing to at least 6,000 hours by March 2023, along with otheraccessibilityenhancements to the website and apps by September 2021.[169]HBO Max later began rolling out AD on select titles on March 26, 2021.[170]
The majority of active subscribers to the HBO pay TV service (which previously included HBO Go), and most customers that were subscribed to HBO Now at time of launch, can access HBO Max for no extra charge, with all three services generally sharing the same price point of $14.99 per month. However, this transition is contingent on the customer's current provider or biller having signed a new distribution agreement for HBO Max with WarnerMedia.[75][171]
On May 27, 2020, as part of an agreement with Time Warner that renewed its carriage contract for theTurner Broadcasting Systemnetworks and gave its over-the-top television serviceSling TVdistribution rights to the linear HBO channel.Dish Networksecured an option to become a distribution partner for HBO Max following the exclusivity period with Apple.[172][173]HBO content is also available as a premium add-on forDirecTV StreamandHulufor the same $14.99 price as HBO Max.[174]
In announcing HBO Max, WarnerMedia immediately confirmed that HBO subscribers on AT&T-owned platforms (includingAT&T TV,DirecTV,U-verse, andAT&T Mobility) would receive HBO Max on-launch at no additional charge.[175][176]AT&T customers who are subscribed to their highest-tiered internet, TV and wireless plans would also receive HBO Max for free, while those on lower-tiered plans will get a free trial ranging from one month to one year.[177]Existing HBO Now subscribers billed directly by HBO were also migrated to HBO Max on-launch at no additional charge. On April 27, 2020, an agreement was announced for HBO Now subscribers via Apple (both in-app subscriptions andApple TV Channels) to be migrated to HBO Max. Content from HBO Max would be listed in theApple TV appalong with there being a dedicated HBO Max hub in the app.[178][179]OnApple TVdevices, HBO Max is available to the regular fourth generation Apple TV and fifth and sixth generationApple TV 4K; earlier versions which do not support third-party app download are not supported.
WarnerMedia subsequently negotiated with other pay TV providers for similar arrangements.[171]On February 20, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a distribution deal withYouTube TVthat would allow members to add HBO and Cinemax, while also being able to include HBO Max as an add-on.[180]On April 15, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a similar deal withCharterSpectrum(which acquired Warner's formercable divisionafter it was spun off in 2009, in May 2016) to give access to HBO Max for HBO subscribers via theirTV Everywherecredentials.[181]A similar agreement was announced withHuluon May 1 for most existing subscribers via Hulu + Live TV, as well as being available as an add-on to all other plans on the service.[182]On May 20, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia had made distribution deals withAltice USA,Cox Communications,Xbox,Samsung,PlayStation,Verizon Communicationsand the National Cable Television Cooperative (NCTC).[183]An agreement withComcast(Xfinity) was announced a few hours after the platform's launch.[184]Max is also available onXfinityFlex andCoxContour Stream Player.[185][186]
The most prominent platforms without agreements to carry HBO Max at the launch wereAmazon(maker of theFire TVandFire HDdevices) andRoku, which together are estimated to control 70% of the U.S. streaming player market.[184]With both platforms, non-Max HBO content remained available as usual through the companies' respective channels platforms and/or through HBO Now (which was rebranded to just "HBO" on July 31, 2020) while deals for HBO Max were being worked out. On May 13, 2020,John Stankey, CEO of AT&T, revealed toVarietythat Amazon was very unlikely to become a launch partner for HBO Max; the parties have remained at an impasse following the launch, reportedly due to a disagreement about whether Amazon can host the additional Max programming directly on itsAmazon Prime VideoChannels platform as it does for HBO currently.[187][184]On November 16, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia and Amazon had reached an agreement to make HBO Max available on Fire TV and Fire Tablet devices beginning the following day, while also allowing subscribers of HBO via Prime Video Channels access to the HBO Max app at no extra cost (although the additional Max programming will still not be hosted on the Prime Video Channels platform).[188]The dispute with Roku was reported to hinge on carriage commissions and advertising sales on the future ad-supported tier.[184]On December 16, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia and Roku had reached an agreement to make HBO Max available on Roku devices beginning the following day, while also allowing subscribers of HBO via Roku Channels access to the HBO Max app at no extra cost (although the additional Max programming would still not be hosted on the Roku Channels platform); conversely, Roku remote controls from the past five years which included an HBO Now app shortcut button now route viewers directly to the HBO Max app instead.[189]Dish Networkwas also erroneously mentioned as a holdout in some media reports; HBO has not been available at all from Dish since late 2018 due to a separate dispute.[190]On July 29, 2021, WarnerMedia and Dish announced that they had reached an agreement to resolve the dispute and restore HBO to Dish's satellite service, along with offering access to HBO Max to HBO subscribers via Dish at no extra cost.[191]
There were plans for HBO Max to introduce an ad-supported tier by 2021,[192]with AT&T later announcing during their Investor Day event on March 12, 2021, that the tier would launch in June of the same year.[193]HBO original programming will continue to be ad-free for subscribers of the tier, but the tier will not allow access to Same-Day Premieres.[194]WarnerMedia later announced during their 2021 upfront presentation on May 19 that the ad-supported tier would launch during the first week of June at a price point of $9.99 a month.[195]The tier would end up launching on June 3, while also adding a yearly option for both tiers (priced at $99.99 a year for the ad-supported tier and $149.99 a year for the ad-free tier).[196]
Localized versions of HBO Max launched on June 29, 2021, in Latin America and the Caribbean,[197]on October 26, 2021, in Andorra, Spain and the Nordics (excluding Iceland), and on March 8, 2022, in Central and Eastern Europe and Portugal, in part by converting existing streaming services operated by HBO in some of those markets to the HBO Max platform.[198][199]In the interim, some HBO Max original programs have been made available on WarnerMedia's existing international platforms, also includingHBO Asia.[200][201]The European launches of HBO Max featured a notable promotion, offering the service with a 50% discount "for life" for new subscribers as long as they maintain their subscription.[202]
In other countries, HBO and/or Max original programs are licensed tothird-party networks and streaming servicesunder long-term deals. In these cases, Max has left it up to individual rightsholders to decide whether to offer its programming on an over-the-top basis. The extent and lengths of the deals vary by country; not all networks that carry HBO programs also carry Max programs, and in some cases individual programs are carried by different services.[203][204][205]
WarnerMedia said in late 2019 that it planned to continue HBO's existing international licensing partnerships for the time being.[206]However, as part of the WarnerMedia further restructuring announced in August 2020, WarnerMedia presidentJason Kilarsaid HBO Max would be expanding its scope globally.[65]Operations chief Andy Forssell indicated later that year that the company ultimately plans to have HBO Max active in 190 countries, but that a timeline for most of the remaining countries had not been decided.[199]
Following the merger of WarnerMedia with Discovery, Inc. in April 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery has decided to halt international expansion of HBO Max in favor of waiting to replace the existing service, as well as HBO Go in Asia-Pacific region, with Max, and instead continuing to license its content to other international distributors such asSky EuropeandFoxtelin markets where HBO Max isn't available, in an attempt to reach financial stability for the company.[207]This also included postponing the launch of Max in France and Belgium until the summer 2024, despite there already being plans to launch the service as HBO Max in 2023.[208]Plans for expansion of Max are expected to restart sometime in 2026, beginning with the regions where Sky Europe operates,[209]although the service has continued to expand before then, but in the form of an additional VOD hub for existing pay TV operators in countries like New Zealand, Japan and Greece.[210][211][212]
HBO Max was launched on June 29, 2021, in the 39 territories of Latin America and the Caribbean, where HBO already operated directly its streaming service HBO Go, and premium television channels.[213][214]HBO Max in Latin America and the Caribbean was rebranded as Max on February 27, 2024.[215]
Max does not operate in Canada;[216]rights to most Max Original programming produced by Warner Bros. or its subsidiaries are held byBell Media, which distributes them via its OTT serviceCrave, and its English- and French-language pay television servicesCraveandSuper Écran(which themselves include access to the OTT version of Crave viaTV Everywherecredentials). The agreement was first announced in 2019, also renewing Crave's existing rights to first-run HBO programming (Bell operates anHBO channelas a multiplex of Crave) and pay-one rights to Warner Bros. Pictures releases. It does not include the rights to series produced for the service by third-party studios.[203][217][218]The agreement was most recently renewed in 2024 for an unspecified length.[219]
The Bell agreement has excluded some of Max's youth, family, and animation programming, which have often been picked up byCorus Entertainmentfor its specialty channels, such asCartoon Network,Treehouse, andAdult Swim[220](in conjunction with the company's long-standing output agreement withCartoon Network).[221][222][223][224][225]
Under a long-term agreement until 2024 between HBO andSky Group(Comcast), Sky operatesSky Atlanticwhich broadcasts the majority of HBO's programming. Sky Atlantic is available in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy. In February 2011,Sky Atlanticlaunched on the Sky platforms in theUnited KingdomandIreland, which maintains a distribution deal with HBO to offer the majority of its programming on the channel. Under the five-year agreement between HBO and Sky, newer HBO programs will air on Sky Atlantic before airing on other television channels within the United Kingdom and Ireland. Before 2011,TG4in Ireland had a long-term agreement to broadcast HBO programming free-to-air, this ceased following the creation of Sky Atlantic. In many other countries, Max has licensed exclusive rights to its programming to television networks owned by third parties, includingSky Atlanticin theUnited Kingdom.
In March 2021, WarnerMedia confirmed that HBO Max would not launch in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy before 2025 due to an existing deal for HBO programming withSky Groupwhich was renewed in 2019 but does not automatically include Max Originals produced by third-party companies or Warner Bros. Television themselves.[226][227][228]
On December 9, 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery and Sky announced a brand new non-exclusive bundling partnership in the UK and Ireland, where Max is expected to launch in early 2026. Following its launch, Sky customers will gain access to the ad-supported version of Max at no additional cost.[229]
On August 15, 2012, HBO announced plans to launchHBO Nordic, a multiplatform video distribution service servingNorway,Denmark,SwedenandFinlandthat was created through a joint venture with Parsifal International.[230][231]Thevideo on demandservice launched in December 2012.[232]HBO programming also airs inIcelandonStöð 2.[233]In Spain, HBO programs were previously broadcast on pay television serviceCanal+, since 2011.[234]In 2016, during the discontinuation of the Canal+ branding in Spain, HBO launched a standalone streaming service called HBO España, which was the Spanish equivalent of HBO Now and HBO Nordic.
HBO Europehad announced on multiple occasions that they were not aware that they were going to replace their current service with HBO Max, nor would their rates be increased.[235]However, in December 2020, the head of HBO Max, Andy Forssell, revealed that all HBO services in Europe, including HBO España and HBO Nordic, would be replaced by HBO Max. On October 26, 2021, HBO Max was launched in the Nordics (excluding Iceland) and Spain and Andorra.[236][237]
Starting in 2024, HBO Max's programming began to be integrated as part of more expensive packages in the Spanish TV service Movistar Plus+ with all programming from the service becoming available on Movistar Plus+ by April 2024.[238][239]The rebranding to Max went into effect on May 21, 2024.[240][241]On September 17, 2024, a linear TV channel dedicated to broadcasting HBO and Max content was launched, exclusively on Movistar Plus+, as Max Avances.[242]
In the 2010s,HBO Europelaunched streaming serviceHBO Goin 13Central and Eastern Europeancountries. HBO programs in Portugal were previously broadcast on the premium television channel TVSéries from the services ofTVCine, since 2015. In 2019, less than a year before the discontinuation of TVSeries, HBO Europe launched a standalone streaming service called HBO Portugal. Similarly to the Nordics and Spain, HBO Max was launched in Portugal[243]and Central and Eastern Europe on March 8, 2022,[244]replacing HBO Portugal and HBO Go.

The HBO catalog was also available to stream on their streaming service. From 2019 to 2023, OCS had the complete exclusivity on the HBO catalog in France. Before that, other channels likeCanal+,Canal+ SériesorNT1could aired reruns of selected HBO series after their original run on OCS.[246]However, OCS didn't have the rights on the Max catalogue. The deal ended in December 2022, with HBO productions leaving OCS from January 2023 onwards.[247]
In October 2021, formerCanal+executive Vera Peltekian was appointed as VP and commissioning editor of original HBO Max programming forFrance. HBO Max's launch in France was set for 2023, but this ended up getting delayed after Warner Bros. Discovery decided to halt the global rollout of HBO Max to replace the existing service with Max first.[208]Meanwhile,Canal+, theTF1 Group, andWarner TVbroadcast a selection of the Warner Bros.-produced scripted live-action Max Original series, certain films and reunion specials.

Warner Bros. Discovery India decided to premiere their HBO Max original programming, including their original films, onAmazon Prime Video,[273]and onDisney+ Hotstar(until 2023) due to a previously established deal in 2016.[274]It later moved toViacom18'sJioCinemaon May 1, 2023.[275][276]On February 14th, 2025, JioCinema merged with Disney+ Hotstar to form JioHotstar which integrates HBO contents that were previously on JioCinema.[277]
Originally, HBO Max was planned to launch in Southeast Asia, but was halted.[49]Instead, it launched as Max in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, Hong Kong, and Taiwan on 19 November 2024, replacing theHBO GoAsia services.[278]
In Japan,U-Nextreached a deal to carry HBO and HBO Max original programs in Japan beginning on April 1, 2021. This replaced a previous deal between HBO andAmazon Prime VideoJapan.[279]This deal between Warner Bros. Discovery and U-Next was renewed in March 2023, making the streaming service the home of HBO content in the country in a "multi-year" deal between the two. On September 18, 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery signed an exclusive partnership agreement with U-Next. The deal will allow Max to launch within the U-Next system featuring a library of more than 2,500 works and 16,000 episodes from 8 brands including HBO, Max Originals,Harry Potter, DC, Warner Bros., Cartoon Network, Discovery Channel, and Animal Planet. It officially launched on September 25, 2024 at 2:00 p.m.[211][280]
OSNcurrently carries HBO content across 22 countries in the Middle East and North Africa region on its linear channels as well as itsOSN+streaming service. An exclusive, multi-year licensing deal was renewed in March 2023, meaning a Max launch is unlikely in this region in the near future.
HBO Max received mixed reception from media observers on launch. The range of available content was generally well received, but many commented on the likelihood of confusion with HBO's other since-deprecated streaming platforms, HBO Go and HBO Now, and the service's higher subscription price compared to other newly launched streaming platforms likeDisney+.[75][309][310]Television critics also expressed frustration that thelibrary of original series(not including its former late night adult content) for sister network Cinemax was not originally available on HBO Max, though much of its output had arrived on the service by the end of 2021.[311]
AT&T announced in July 2020 that HBO Max had nominally achieved 26.6 million subscribers after its first month of operation, including 23.6 million wholesale customers, primarily legacy HBO pay TV subscribers that were covered by new agreements that added access to HBO Max at no extra charge.[312]However, only 4.1 million customers had activated their HBO Max accounts by the same date.[312]The latter figure was seen by many observers as a disappointment, particularly in light of Disney+ having reached 10 million subscribers within a day of launch;The New York Times's media criticBen Smithwrote that WarnerMedia had "badly botched" the launch.[313]
However, AT&T executives contended that it had been a "flawless launch" citing increased customer engagement compared to HBO Now and overall growth in total subscriptions to either HBO or HBO Max (36.3 million, vs. 34.6 million HBO or HBO Now subscribers at the end of 2019), while acknowledging that there was more to do to persuade existing HBO subscribers to start using the HBO Max apps.[314]Executives had previously noted that HBO Max was starting from a different place than other streaming services as it was building on the existing HBO subscriber base, and had to work within the constraints of many of HBO's pre-existing deals (such as those with Amazon and Roku).[315]
In October 2020, AT&T revealed that the number of activated HBO Max subscribers had reached 8.6 million by the end of September, while the number of nominal (eligible) subscribers reached 28.7 million. The total number of HBO / HBO Max subscriptions in the U.S. also increased to 28 million.[316]With an agreement being reached the following month with Amazon (which is reported to have had 5 million HBO subscribers through Prime Video Channels), the number of HBO Max-eligible subscribers is understood to have increased to over 33 million.[188]In September 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery was sued by a shareholder, alleging that WarnerMedia had overstated the number of HBO Max subscribers by including unactivated subscriptions bundled with AT&T services.[317][318]
Upon its launch, it was noted that Max had grouped directors and writers for its films and television series under a singular "creators" credit.[319]TheDirectors Guild of AmericaandWriters Guild of America Westcondemned the move amidst the2023 Hollywood labor disputes. Max announced that they would fix the credits, agreeing with the outcry from the guilds regarding proper credit for its creators, noting the altered credits were a result of "an oversight in the technical transition" from HBO Max to Max.[320]Deadline Hollywoodreported the consolidation was a result of WBD's IT departments creating the "catch all" for the credits to be in place for launch, and that executives, who could have intervened, had been unaware of the single credit until the discourse arose online after its launch. Additionally, it was reported that it would take "weeks" to fix, given the service would need to make the adjustment on each platform.[321]The credits would later be fixed, beginning in late June.[322]

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]
Warner Bros. owns some shared universes. Some of them are based on books and comics, including some of the highest grossing IP's in the movie industry.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
