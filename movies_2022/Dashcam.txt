Ascreenlifefilm,Dashcamis presented entirely from the perspective of Hardy'siPhoneas shelivestreamsher actions for viewers. The film was produced byJason Blumthrough his companyBlumhouse Productions, Savage through his companyBOO-URNS,and Douglas Cox through Shadowhouse Films. Savage and Shepherd developed the idea forDashcambased on Hardy's livestreamedYouTubeseriesBand Car, in which she would work out song ideas inreal-timewith viewers while driving around Los Angeles. Savage felt the concept would make for a goodfound footagehorror film, and ultimately asked Hardy to appear in it.

It was released theatrically byMomentum Picturesin the United Kingdom and the United States on 3 June 2022.

American musician andconservativeconspiracy theoristAnnielivestreamswhile driving her car, where she creates music on the spot with comments from the live chat being used as lyrics. Tired ofCOVID-19pandemicrestrictions and homelessness inLos Angeles, she flies toLondonfor a surprise visit to her friend and former bandmate Stretch, who now works as afood deliverydriver. Stretch's girlfriend Gemma immediately clashes with Annie over politics and social issues. Annie accompanies Stretch on a delivery job, where she antagonizes restaurant owners with heranti-mask views.
Annie refuses to remove herMAGA hatwhen she and Stretch return home, prompting Gemma to attack her. That night, after she overhears Gemma urging Stretch to kick her out, Annie steals Stretch's car and phone before accepting a delivery job meant for him. She arrives at a closed restaurant, where the owner offers her money to transport an elderly woman named Angela to an address she has written down. Angela soils herself, forcing Annie to stop at a diner, where she is surprised to see a tattoo ofAriana Grandeon Angela's stomach. A woman enters to look for Angela and attacks Annie, who flees the diner with Angela.
Stretch tracks Annie down via her livestream and forces his way into the car. The two argue and pull over, after which Angela vanishes. Stretch finds her standing on top of a tree in a nearby forest, but falls from the tree whilst trying to reach her, followed by Angela slowly floating to the ground. The woman from the diner returns with a shotgun and attempts to kill Annie and Stretch, who escape in the car with Angela. They remove Angela's face mask to find that her mouth is stapled shut.
Annie and Stretch attempt to flag down a passing car, which runs over Stretch. The driver reveals herself as the woman from the diner and claims to be the mother of Angela, whom she says is actually 16 years old, which she then proves by showing Annie a picture of a young Angela with the same tattoo on her stomach. Annie tries to drive away in the woman's car, but crashes it and is attacked by the woman. Stretch recovers and helps Annie trap the woman's arm in the steering wheel, accidentally snapping it. Angela appears, rips her mother's head off, and pursues Annie and Stretch as they flee.
Angela chases Annie and Stretch into an abandoned amusement park, where she finds and kills Stretch. Annie escapes in a car, but Angela causes her to crash. Angela pushes the car into a lake with hertelekineticpowers, but Annie traps her in the car and swims to the shore as the car sinks, though she fails to notice Angela silently rising from the lake and into the sky behind her. Annie finds a remote house, which she recognizes as the destination to which she was asked to escort Angela. Inside the house, she findsoccultsymbols and cult members who slash their own throats and die in front of her. Angela attacks Annie, who kills her with a cult member's knife; a large,slug-like,humanoid creature emerges from Angela's mouth and chases Annie, who finds Stretch's car and takes herkeyboardfrom the back seat before beating the creature to death with it. She then collapses into Stretch's car and drives away while resuming her livestream, where she improvises a rap about her experience.
The film was developed byRob Savageand Jed Shepherd, who initially came up with the idea based onAnnie Hardy's seriesBand Car, livestreamedYouTubevideos in which she would work out song ideas while driving aroundLos Angeles.[2]Savage said, "When [Shepherd] showed me the show, the first conversations were like, 'Oh, that's a coolset-upfor afound footagemovie.' [...] The version we were taking aroundpre-Hostwas very much just using theBand Carset-up,but the idea was to probably take it to studios, to probably try and get an actor to play that role."[2]Savage eventually asked Hardy to star in the film.[2]
Filming took place aroundMargatein late 2020,[2][3]with the amusement park scenes shot atDreamland Margate.[3]Hardy spent her free time during production at the Albion Rooms, a hotel and recording studio owned byThe Libertines, where she simultaneously recorded material for her bandGiant Drag.[3]To promote the film, Giant Drag released the song "Devil Inside" in June 2022.[4]The song is featured in the film's closing credits.[4]
The film features references to Savage's previous filmHost(2020), such as viewers in Annie's live chat discussing theastral plane. It also features the primary cast ofHostin small roles; Jemma Moore plays Stretch's girlfriend Gemma, James Swanton (who portrayed the demon inHost) portrays the monster, Seylan Baxter plays the restaurant owner who tasks Annie with transporting Angela,Haley Bishopvoices the flight announcer atLos Angeles International Airport, Emma Louise Webb voices cabin crew on Annie's flight, Radina Drandova plays an emergency responder, and Caroline Ward and Edward Linard portray newlyweds who are accidentally killed by Stretch. Ward and Linard's characters also die in the same way as their characters inHost, the former from blunt force trauma and the latter burning to death.
Dashcampremiered at the2021 Toronto International Film Festivalon 13 September 2021.[5]In February 2022,Momentum Picturespurchased the distribution rights for the film.[6]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 47% based on 88 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The critical consensus reads, "Dashcamis visually and thematically provocative, although the film's grating protagonist undercuts its effectiveness."[7]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted average scoreof 48 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[8]
Clarisse Loughry ofThe Independentpraised the film and said, "[It's] a riot. Sure, it's a film whose spell I can imagine being instantly broken the second you remove it from the precise context it was madefor—ina cinema, with as large an audience as possible, all of them hooting andhollering—butthat should hardly be counted as a mark against it. If anything, it's proof that Savage knows exactly the kind of film he's making.Dashcamis pure chaos, headlined by a character with a maelstrom for a personality."[9]
Dennis Harvey ofVarietygave the film a middling review and noted, "As a showcase for [Hardy],Dashcammay be a little too much of a goodthing—she'san acting natural, but this character is so vividly irksome it turns the whole film into a sort of deliberatelyoff-puttingstandup routine.Dashcamfeels longer than the bare 66 minutes it logspre-finalcredits. It's a cleverstunt—still,not so clever that it can't wear out its welcome."[10]

Hardy was raised inOrange County, and began taking guitar lessons at age nine.[2]In the tenth grade, Hardy went to a boarding school inOjaiof which she says: "There was nothing to do there.  I was acting there and I was in the choir."[13]It was there that she met another girl who also had a guitar. According to Hardy, "Her dad was teaching herBeatlessongs.

I put zero thought into writing songs – I was like, "oh, this is just how they come out. They're beamed to me from a spaceship and they come out finished and then I add a cat solo". Now I'm aware that I have some control over the situation and I put a little more thought into if I was a listener how I'd like to hear it, I guess."[26]The same year, Hardy began recording material under the projects PnP (short for "party and play") and Annie Hardy and the Psychos, both featuring her friend and bandmate Monica Barciki.[26]

When you are taking that much painkiller you have no grasp of what your natural pain levels are."[44]Hardy attributed her muscle pain and fibromyalgia diagnosis to performing with aGretschguitar that was too heavy for her body to support: "I didn't realize that through all the touring and sitting in fucked-up chairs and the most painful part of getting onstage every night, was that my guitar was so fucking heavy. I never explored that aspect. I'm pretty small and now I have aDan Armstrongguitar that is 5 pounds and it sounds rad and it looks cool – and it doesn't hurt at all. It seems dumb in retrospect."[44]
In 2022, Hardy openly discussed her codependent addiction toAdderallthat she developed with a "controlling, manipulative" boyfriend following the release of Giant Drag's second album,Waking Up Is Hard to Do(2013).[45]Hardy's Adderall abuse eventually progressed to an addiction tomethamphetamine.[45]After separating from this boyfriend, Hardy subsequently began an "intense, tempestuous" relationship with Robert Paulson, a rapper known by his stage nameCadalack Ron.[12]In early March 2015, Hardy and Paulson gave birth to a son named Silvio.[12]Silvio died at the age of 17 days ofSIDS(sudden infant death syndrome).[12]Paulson subsequently died of a drug overdose in January 2016.[12]
