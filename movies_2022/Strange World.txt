It was directed byDon Hall, co-directed and written byQui Nguyen, and produced byRoy Conli. Starring the voices ofJake Gyllenhaal,Dennis Quaid,Jaboukie Young-White,Gabrielle Union, andLucy Liu, it follows a legendary family of explorers, the Clades (Gyllenhaal, Quaid, Young-White, and Union), who must set aside their differences as they embark on a journey to a mysterious subterranean land inhabited by surreal lifeforms, in order to save the miracle plant Pando, which is their society's source of energy.
Hall conceivedStrange Worldin 2017 while finishing co-directingMoana(2016).Strange Worlddraws inspiration frompulp magazines,Journey to the Center of the Earth(1864),Fantastic Voyage(1966),Jurassic Park(1993) andKing Kong(1933). To communicate non-verbally, several animators worked to create the movement of the character Splat. While the film is predominantly CGI, the film incorporates 2D animation from Randy Haycock, with additional 2D animation byEric GoldbergandMark Hennin certain scenes.Henry Jackmanprovided the musical score. The film introduced Walt Disney Animation Studios' first openlyLGBTQlead character, leading to the film being pulled out for a theatrical release in some regions.
Strange Worldpremiered at theEl Capitan TheatreinHollywood, Los Angeles, on November 15, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 23. The film grossed $73.6 million with a projected loss of $197 million for Disney, making itone of the biggest box-office bombs of all time. It received generally positive reviews from critics.
In Avalonia, a land surrounded by an endless wall of mountains, adventurers Jaeger Clade and his 15-year-old son Searcher brave the wilderness to explore new worlds. While trying to traverse the mountains, Searcher discovers a green plant that gives off energy. He and the rest of the expedition team decide to return to Avalonia with the plant, while Jaeger angrily continues his mission alone.
25 years later, Searcher, now 40, has made a name for himself by introducing the miracle plant, dubbed Pando, as a fuel source for Avalonia. He and his wife Meridian are Pando farmers, while their son, Ethan, has a crush on his friend Diazo and chafes at his father's expectation of becoming a farmer like him. One night, Callisto Mal, the president of Avalonia and one of Jaeger's former expedition teammates, shows up in her airship, theVenture, to inform the Clades that Pando is losing its power and asks Searcher to help find the cause. He joins an expedition to travel into a giant sinkhole, in which the roots of Pando have been located. On the way down, Meridian tries catching up in hercrop-dusterwhen Ethan and their three-legged dog Legend stows away on theVenture. TheVenture, attacked by redwyvern-like creatures, crash-lands in a subterranean world, where Searcher and Legend are separated from the group. They are attacked by a creature called a "Reaper", but are rescued by Jaeger, who has been living underground all these years. He has been trying to cross the mountains from below, but is blocked by an acidic ocean, and states his intention to board theVentureto attempt to cross it.
Meanwhile, Ethan sneaks away from theVentureto find Searcher. He befriends an amorphous blue creature, naming it Splat, before being reunited with Searcher, Legend and Jaeger. They are attacked by more Reapers, but are rescued by Meridian and Callisto and return to theVenture. Searcher insists on completing their mission, while Jaeger wants to continue journeying across the Strange World. Ethan becomes frustrated with them and their opposing worldviews. After another wild encounter, Searcher and Jaeger finally have a heart-to-heart talk and realize that they do respect each other's goals in life. They eventually find a cluster of Pando's roots, which is being attacked by the Strange World's creatures. When Searcher learns that Ethan wants to explore more of the Strange World, he blames Jaeger's influence on him. Ethan angrily jumps off theVentureand on to one of the Reapers. Searcher follows him aboard a small flying vehicle, but as they are reconciling, they realize that they have passed through the mountains to the ocean beyond, where they see the eye of agiant turtle-like creature. The two realize that Avalonia is on the creature's back, and that they have been traveling through its body, meaning that the Reapers and all the other creatures are its immune system.
Seeing that Pando is an infection attacking the creature's heart, they head back to inform the expedition team that Pando must be destroyed, but Callisto has them locked up to prevent them from stopping the mission, while Jaeger furiously sails off to see for himself. After Legend and Splat free the family, Searcher and Ethan head to the creature's heart to clear a path for the Reapers, while Meridian takes over the ship and convinces Callisto to help. Jaeger returns, and with his help, they break through Pando, and the creatures appear and destroy it, bringing the heart back to life and saving the land.
One year later, Ethan is in a relationship with Diazo as they and their friends collect resources from the Strange World. Avalonia has shifted from Pando energy towind turbines. Jaeger revisits his ex-wife Penelope, who has remarried during his absence, and Searcher and Jaeger's relationship has improved. The camera zooms away from Avalonia to show the giant turtle-like creature on an ocean-covered planet.
Additional voice cast forStrange Worldinclude Terri Douglas,Liza Del Mundo, Shondalia White, Melanie Minichino,Michael Ralph,Shane Sweet, Arthur Ortiz, andMatt Yang King.[12]
Non-speaking roles in the film include Legend, the Clades' three-leggedBernedoodledog; Splat, the blue creature from the Strange World; the other Avalonia creatures; and Penelope Clade, Jaeger's ex-wife and Searcher's mother who retired from adventuring and remarried to a man named Sheldon. In the end credits, Legend and Splat are listed as playing "themselves".
Development onStrange Worldbegan in 2017, afterDon Hallfinished co-directingMoana(2016). His frequent creative partnerChris Williamsalso involved the project before leaving Disney in November 2018 to direct theNetflix AnimationfilmThe Sea Beast(2022). Hall pondered the origins of a generational family with the concept of "environmental overtones", which was described as "Indiana JonesmeetsNational Lampoon's Vacation". Shortly after the announcement ofRaya and the Last Dragon(2021) at theD23 Expoin August 2019, a major redone happened, with the creative leadership on the film were being swapped, while some cast members were replaced.[13]Hall reteams withQui Nguyen, who serves as co-director and writer.[12]During a story meeting, Disney artistBurny Mattinsonsuggested adding a dog character for the Clades, which ultimately became the character Legend in the final film.[14]Overall, the budget ofStrange Worldwas approximately between $135–180 million.[b]
Nguyen adds that filmmakers wanted to make sure that, at the end of the film, viewers "could go backward and — like watchingThe Sixth Sense— be able to track all those moments and go, 'They told us all along what this was, and only now have we realized we got that last puzzle piece.'"[15]
On June 6, 2022, following the release of the teaser trailer,Jake Gyllenhaalwas announced as the voice of Searcher Clade.[6]Eleven days later, the rest of the main cast for the film was announced at France'sAnnecy Animation Festival, includingJaboukie Young-Whiteas Ethan Clade,Gabrielle Unionas Meridian Clade,Lucy Liuas Callisto Mal, andDennis Quaidas Jaeger Clade.[7]The inclusion of Young-White voicing agaycharacter named Ethan marks Walt Disney Animation Studios' first openly LGBTQ main character.[8]
According to Hall,Strange Worldtakes heavy influence frompulp magazines—popular fiction from the first half of the 20th century that was printed on inexpensive wood pulp papers, in addition to science fiction works such asJourney to the Center of the Earth,Fantastic VoyageandKing Kong.[9]He also said "[he] loved reading the old issues of pulps growing up. They were big adventures in which a group of explorers might discover a hidden world or ancient creatures. They've been a huge inspiration forStrange World."[16]
The miracle plant Pando is named aftera forest in Utahin America.[17]The land of Avalonia was given a "warm, nostalgic"color schemeto contrast with the titular strange world inside the creature, for which the filmmakers "avoided earth tones and leaned into reds and magentas." They also created a way for the character Splat to communicate non-verbally, similar to themagic carpetinAladdin.[9]
The production team for the film conducted research on climatologists, paleontologists and biologists, as well as a farmer, while filmmakers visited National Geographic for research, which is reflected not just in the film's setting, but in its inhabitants.[15]
The land of Avalonia is named after the island ofAvalonof Arthurian legend and presented as a utopic community.[18]
Henry Jackmanwas announced to compose the score for the film on September 5, 2022, marking his third collaboration with Don Hall, afterWinnie the PoohandBig Hero 6, and his fifth overall feature-length scoring work with Walt Disney Animation Studios, which includes theWreck-It Ralphfilms.[19]Walt Disney Recordsreleased the score album on November 23, 2022, in addition to the song "They're The Clades!" performed by James Hayden, also having a reprised version of the tracks, the same day as the theatrical release.[20]
Strange Worldpremiered at theEl Capitan TheatreinHollywood, Los Angeles, on November 15, 2022,[21]and was theatrically released in the United States on November 23, 2022.[22]MPAA rated the film PG,[23]whereas Common Sense Media rated it a 8+[24]in the United States
Despite being theatrically released in most regions,Strange Worldwas not released theatrically in some regions; due to Disney's opposition to local regulations regarding theatrical windows, the company announced on June 8, 2022, thatStrange Worldwould not see a theatrical release in France and would instead go straight toDisney+in the region following its theatrical release in other regions.[25]Deadline Hollywoodreported that Disney pulled out for a theatrical release in 20 countries, mainly the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, Russia and China; a Russian release had already been pulled due to theongoing invasion of Ukraine,[26]while Disney opted to exclude release in other regions due to the inclusion of a gay main character, Ethan Clade. This was done to prevent those regions' censorship of LGBTQ+ references, as a main storyline in the film revolves around Ethan having a crush on another boy called Diazo.[26]
This was the first film to feature the commemorative 100th anniversaryDisney logoin celebration ofthe company's centennial in 2023, created by Disney Studios Content andIndustrial Light & Magic, which was revealed at the 2022D23 Expo.Christophe Beckcomposed a new arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star", whileTim Daviesconducted it.[27]
Following the project announcement, the first look concept art of the film was released on December 9, 2021.[22]Max Evry of/Filmsaid the image "[looked] a lot likeAvatar, or at the very least thePandorasection ofDisney World'sAnimal Kingdom."[28]The marketing campaign forStrange Worldbegan on June 6, 2022, with the release of a teaser trailer. Petrana Radulovic forPolygonfelt it was "an homage to retro sci-fi flicks" and similar toRaya and the Last Dragon, it "definitely seems to lean more into the action than Disney's typical musical fantasies."[29]A new trailer was shown at the 2022D23 Expoand the official trailer was released on September 21, 2022,[30]followed by a cast reaction video a day later. Lex Briscuso of/Filmsays it "honestly looks like a breath of fresh air when it comes to animated family stories."[31]A "special look" trailer was released on October 19, 2022. Rafael Motamayor of/Filmsaid "Though the upbeat song and the focus on laughs kind of sells this as a more formulaic Disney film in terms of tone, the prominent use of monsters and big action hopefully makes this more of an inventive film from the studio."[32]Two featurettes "Welcome To Strange World" and "100 Years of Amazing Characters", which showcased the characters of Splat and Legend, were released on November 3, 2022, and November 8, 2022, respectively.
Strange Worldbegan streaming on Disney+ on December 23, 2022.[33]
According to Flix Patrol,Strange Worldwas the most streamed film on Disney+ upon its release on the streaming service.[34][35]AccordingWhip Media'sTV Time,Strange Worldwas the 8th most streamed film across all platforms in the United States, during the week ending December 25, 2022,[36]and the 6th during the week of December 30, 2022.[37]Strange Worldwas the 6th most popular film on Fandango’s transactional digital serviceVudu, during the week ending January 1, 2023.[38][39][40][41]
Walt Disney Studios Home EntertainmentreleasedStrange WorldonUltra HD Blu-ray,Blu-ray, andDVDon February 14, 2023.[42]
Strange Worldgrossed $38 million in the United States and Canada, and $35.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $73.6 million.[4][5]Following its opening weekend,VarietyandDeadline Hollywoodestimated the film would lose the studio $100–197 million.[3][43][44]
In the United States and Canada,Strange Worldwas released alongsideGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery[45]andDevotion, as well as the wide expansions ofThe FabelmansandBones and All, and was initially projected to gross $30–40 million from 4,174 theaters over its five-day opening weekend.[2][46]The film made $4.2 million on its first day (including $800,000 from Tuesday night previews), which led to less optimism about it meeting initial box office projections and could debut to as low as $23 million.[47]The film ended up debuting even lower than initial re-adjustments, making $11.9 million in its opening weekend (a five-day total of $18.6 million). Overall, it ranked in second place at the box office behind Disney's ownBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever.[48][49]Several publications labeled the film abox office bomb, withThe Hollywood Reportersaying was "the worst opening for a Disney Animation Thanksgiving title in modern times" andVarietycalling it a "catastrophic result for Disney". The low box-office opening was attributed to negativeword-of-mouth, large budget overall, the lack of movie theater attendance, the expectation of its streaming release onDisney+as the result ofCOVID-19 pandemic, rocky company politics, conservative backlash over inclusion of gay characters, critical reviews, a vague and unremarkable premise, and lackluster marketing compared to other Disney animated films.[c]Some analysts believe that then-Disney CEOBob Chapek's decision to sendPixar's,Soul,LucaandTurning Red, straight to Disney+ so that Disney could focus on building its streaming service caused consumer confusion for families. WhenBob Igerreturned as Disney CEO prior its release, the distribution division - which was formerly led by Kareem Daniel - was quickly dismantled.[54]Strange Worldcompleted its theatrical run in the United States and Canada on February 2, 2023.[55]
Strange Worldwas the most watched movie worldwide on Disney+ for the last week of 2022 and the first two weeks of 2023. It topped the Disney+ chart in almost every country where it was available.[56][57][58]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 72% of 169 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's consensus reads: "Strange Worldis a Disney milestone in terms of representation – but as a storytelling experience, this dazzlingly animated adventure offers little audiences haven't already seen."[59]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[60]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an overall positive score of 82%, including an average four out of five stars.Strange Worldwas the first film from Walt Disney Animation to earn lower than "A–" and is considered the lowest CinemaScore rating of all Disney animated films since 1991.[50][61]
Peter Debruge ofVarietywrote "it's the characters as much as the environment that make this vibrant,Journey to the Center of the Earth-style adventure movie colorful and diverse in all the best ways. Great as the people and places they explore may be, however, the relatively unimaginative story consigns this gorgeous toon to second-tier status ... instead of cracking the pantheon of Disney classics."[62]Lovia Gyarke ofThe Hollywood Reporterpraised the visuals, writing it was "meticulously and wondrously rendered by theStrange Worldanimators, who drew much of their inspiration from pulp magazines of the 30s and 40s. There's a painterly feel to the landscape, which, combined with the film's sci-fi bent, might trigger memories of Disney'sTreasure Planet."[63]Tracy Brown of theLos Angeles Timesalso praised the visuals as "vibrant, weird, visually stunning... From its lush palette to its cute and deadly flora and fauna, this strange, mysterious world is very much deserving of its status as the film's title character."[64]
Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timeswrote while the film is not in the same category as "Frozen,ZootopiaandEncanto, it's a family-friendly fun fest with the expected ingredients of fast-paced action, ingenious visuals, terrific voice performances and, yes, some heaping spoonfuls of upbeat messaging about family ties, the importance of being true to oneself and how we should all take great measures to take care of not only each other but the world in which we live, no matter how STRANGE that world might be."[65]Brian Truitt ofUSA Todaygave the film three stars out of four, statingStrange Worldis "an enjoyable piece of vibrant world building that steps away from the musical bent of recent non-Pixar efforts likeEncantoand theFrozenflicks."[66]Odie Henderson ofThe Boston Globepraised the film's environmental and father-son messages, as well as the "excellent voice-over work plus the score by Henry Jackman make the preachiness palatable and the film fun. The look of Avalonia's underworld is a lovely distraction; its garish and bright pinks, reds, and greens look lifted from the colored roofs of a suburban New Jersey neighborhood in the 1970s."[67]
ForThe Washington Post, Kristen Page-Kirby found "the story is too basic and the characters too slight forStrange Worldto pack a punch. The visual beauty of the film isn't enough. After all, pretty is as pretty does — and inStrange World,pretty doesn't do much."[68]Jacob Stoller ofPaste Magazineadmitted that while the film "can be arresting—especially with its inventive setting and bulbous creatures—and its attempts at deconstructing the sweaty, macho-man ethos hawked by its inspiration are admirable. But with muddled themes and slight characters, remnants of the old dime magazines coordinate to bringStrange Worlddown on the wrong side of familiar."[69]Cath Clarke ofThe Guardianfelt the characters "aren't half-bad", but the "clunky script feels like it's been re-drafted and re-drafted to the point of incomprehension – blowing any chance of conveying a message. However well-meaning, it makes for a surprisingly dull watch."[70]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger.

The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
