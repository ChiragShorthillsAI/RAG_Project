Lifshitz. The film starsGeorgina Campbell,Bill Skarsgård, andJustin Long. The plot sees a woman finding out that the rental home she reserved has been accidentally double-booked by a man, not knowing of a dark secret within the dwelling.
Barbarianpremiered atSan Diego Comic-Conon July 22, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on September 9, 2022, by20th Century Studios. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Cregger's writing and direction, tense atmosphere and the performances of the cast (particularly Campbell and Skarsgård), and had grossed $45.4 million worldwide against a budget of $4–4.5 million.
Tess Marshall arrives at an Airbnb inDetroiton the evening before a job interview. However, she finds it has been double-booked and is already occupied by a man named Keith. Initially unnerved by the situation, Tess warms to Keith and decides to stay the night while he sleeps on the couch. When she awakes during the night, she is shaken to find her bedroom door open, but Keith is asleep and assures her he did not open the door.
Tess goes for her interview the next morning and is cautioned to stay on guard while in the neighborhood around the house, which is suffering from heavyurban decay. Returning to the house, she hurries inside when a homeless man runs down the street urging her to leave. She accidentally locks herself in the basement and stumbles across a hidden corridor, leading to a room with a camera, a stained mattress, a bucket and a bloody handprint.
Keith returns to the house and frees Tess from the basement. Ignoring Tess' warning, he investigates the hidden corridor. When he does not return, Tess follows and finds another hidden door and a deeper subterranean tunnel, where Keith is, injured. While they argue about where to go, Keith is suddenly attacked by a naked, deformed woman known as The Mother who kills Keith by bashing his skull against a wall.
The house's owner, an actor named AJ, is fired from a television series over allegations that he raped his co-star. Pressured to sell assets to pay his legal costs, AJ travels to Detroit to inspect the house before selling it. He finds the hidden tunnel and tries to measure it, believing it may increase the house's value. The Mother attacks AJ in the tunnel, and he falls into a hole where he meets Tess. A flashback to 1981 shows Frank, the house's original owner, buying supplies for ahome birththen stalking a woman and gaining access to her home with the implication that he is going to abduct her.
In the present, The Mother locks Tess and AJ in the hole. Tess tells AJ that The Mother wants them to act as her children. AJ is dragged away by The Mother, who forcibly tries tobreastfeedhim. Tess uses the opportunity to escape the house with the help of Andre, the homeless man, who warns her that The Mother will come after her at nightfall.
With The Mother distracted by Tess's escape, AJ finds a room which The Mother refuses to approach. Inside, he encounters a bedridden Frank and assumes him to be another victim of The Mother. AJ assures Frank that he will call the police, before finding evidence that Frank had abducted and raped dozens of women. Horrified, AJ berates Frank before Frank kills himself with a concealed revolver.
Tess leads police to the house, but they dismiss her story due to lack of evidence, assuming from her disheveled appearance and lack of identification that she is a delusional drug-addicted squatter, and leave as night falls. Tess breaks into the house, retrieves her car keys, and drives into The Mother when she leaves the house, seemingly killing her. Tess returns to the basement to rescue AJ, but he mistakenly shoots her with Frank's revolver. AJ helps Tess escape, finding that The Mother's body has vanished, and they take shelter with Andre.
Andre explains that The Mother is a product of Frank's multi-generational incest with his victims. The Mother bursts in, violently kills Andre and chases Tess and AJ up a water tower. AJ loses his gun and pushes Tess off the water tower to save himself. The Mother jumps after her and shields her from the fall. AJ finds Tess is still alive, but as he tries to rationalize his actions to Tess, The Mother awakens and gouges his eyes out before splitting his head open. The Mother attempts to comfort Tess, who remorsefully shoots The Mother dead with Frank's gun and limps away as the sun rises.
Zach Creggerwas inspired by the non-fiction bookThe Gift of Fear, citing a section that encourages women to trust theirintuitionand not ignore the subconsciousred flagsthat arise in their day-to-day interactions with men. He sat down to write a single thirty-page scene that would incorporate as many of these red flags as possible. Cregger settled on a woman showing up to anAirbnblate at night, only to find that it had been double booked, as the ideal set-up for this exercise. He stuck to the rule that if he was surprising himself with his writing, then he has to be surprising his audience. "As long as I have no long plan, then no one could know what's coming."[7]
He became frustrated during the writing process, fearing the direction of the story was too predictable. So Cregger, with no forethought, decided to introduce a twist that would "flip [the scene] on its head."
I just wanted to write a fun scene for myself and it ended up being something that hooked me, and I didn’t know where it was going, and then it turned into a feature film.[8]
While writing the screenplay, Cregger named the filmBarbarianas a placeholder. As the story progressed, the name eventually became the title of the film.[9][10]
Early in pre-production, Cregger reportedly reached out to multiple financiers and distributors, includingA24andNeon, but was rejected.J. D. Lifshitzand Raphael Margules agreed to produce the film through their BoulderLight Pictures banner, and were later joined byVertigo Entertainment, after Lifshitz and Margules reached out to Vertigo'sRoy Leewho had served as an early mentor to the duo. In mid-2020, Lifshitz and Margules accrued a $3.5 million budget for the film, largely through foreign financing, most of it from the French production company Logical Pictures.[3]
Zac Efronwas the first choice to play AJ, whom Cregger had envisioned as a "beefcakekind ofhimbo."[11]However, when Efron turned down the role, Cregger decided to take the character's image in a different direction and castJustin Longfor his "warm and disarming and charming, lovable presence onscreen" which he thought would make AJ more engaging to audiences.[12]
That same year, Lee brought inBill Skarsgård, who had previously worked with Lee onIt(2017) andIt Chapter Two(2019), to costar and serve as an executive producer.Barbarianbeganprincipal photographyin early 2021 in Bulgaria. The film was shot inSofia, while exterior neighborhood shots beyond the house's block were filmed in theBrightmoorneighborhood of Detroit.[13][14]In April 2021, Logical's founder and the film's main financier, Eric Tavitian, died of cancer. Unsure of the film's future, Lee secured financial backing fromNew Regencywho increased the budget to $4.5 million, and as a result,20th Century Studiosbecame the film's distributor, stemming from a prior distribution deal between Regency andThe Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century's parent division.[3]
Barbarianhas been characterized as having themes related tosexual abuseandtrauma, and, owing to the book by which Cregger was inspired, themes of different forms ofmisogyny. Writing forFilm School Rejects, Aurora Amidon asserted that the film is essentially about "the ripple effects of abuse", concerning the characters of AJ and Frank—who, in the habit of harming women for their own pleasure,  are cut from the same cloth.[15]

New Regency Productions[a]is an American-British-Luxembourgish entertainment company formed byArnon Milchan. It was founded in 1991 as the successor toRegency International Pictures(formerly known asEmbassy International Pictures N.V.).
Arnon Milchan founded his company asEmbassy International Pictures N.V., which held the name for seven years until it was changed toRegency International Pictures. This company originally had no distribution deal of producing films with various studios such asThe Ladd Company,Columbia Pictures,TriStar Pictures,Warner Bros.,Touchstone Pictures,Vestron Pictures,Universal Picturesand20th Century Fox(now known as 20th Century Studios), with the latter ending up being the distributor of the majority of Regency's library.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
