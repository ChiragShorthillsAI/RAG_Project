Studio 666is a 2022 Americancomedy horror filmdirected by B. J. McDonnell from a screenplay by Jeff Buhler and Rebecca Hughes, based on a story byDave Grohl, who stars, alongside hisFoo FightersbandmatesNate Mendelin his film debut,Pat Smear,Taylor Hawkinsin his final film,Chris Shiflettin his feature film debut, andRami Jaffeein his film debut, portraying fictionalized version of themselves.
Whitney Cummings,Leslie Grossman,Will Forte,Jenna Ortega, andJeff Garlinco-star in theensemble cast. In the film, the Foo Fighters move into a cursed mansion to record a new album.
Studio 666is the first non-documentary to feature the Foo Fighters; the band was previously the subject of the filmFoo Fighters: Back and Forth(2011) and the television seriesFoo Fighters: Sonic Highways(2014). The film was released theatrically in the United States on February 25, 2022, byOpen Road FilmsandBriarcliff Entertainment. It received mixed reviews.
In 1993Encino, Skye Willow, drummer of theheavy metalband Dream Widow, is crawling along the floor with a broken leg, followed closely by band's frontman, Greg Nole, who is holding a hammer. Skye sees the body of another band member, who has had his jaw broken by Greg, before Greg drives the hammer through her forehead and repeatedly hits her head with it, crushing her skull. Greg then hangs himself from a window.
In 2019, theFoo Fighters—Dave Grohl,Taylor Hawkins,Rami Jaffee,Nate Mendel,Chris Shiflett, andPat Smear—are pressured by their manager Jeremy Shill to overcome theirwriter's blockand record a new album. The group move into the mansion, where Grohl becomes fascinated with the house as a source of inspiration. One of their tech helps, Krug, is electrocuted by a wire and the band decides to dedicate their album to him.
Grohl finds a basement containing satanic objects and is possessed by Nole's demonic soul after listening to a demo tape. Under the demon's control, Grohl forces the band to continue production on the album. Later, a delivery man named Darren, who had earlier tried to give Grohl a demo tape, is decapitated outside the manor by an unknown figure with hedge clippers. The next day, as Shiflett is cooking on the grill, the same figure pushes his face onto it. Shiflett attempts to escape but he has his head smashed with the grill cover and is stabbed repeatedly in the neck, before the figure is revealed to be Grohl.
The band later finds Darren's corpse, but Grohl convinces them not to call the police and takes their phones. After watching Grohl eating Shiflett's remains, the band soon learn of the mansion's backstory and Grohl's possession with the help of a neighbor, Samantha. To exorcise Grohl, they need to find a book needed to free him of the possession. As Samantha and Jaffee have sex, they are both killed when Grohl sneaks under the bed and drives a chainsaw through their heads, before cutting them in half. Hawkins is pressured by Grohl to finish the song while Mendel and Smear retrieve the book from the basement. Hawkins finishes the song and is partially decapitated by Grohl with a cymbal.
Mendel and Smear free Grohl from the possession, and the souls of the Dream Widow band members send the demon to hell. However, Jeremy and real estate developer Barb Weems ambush the remaining members, revealing that they planned the whole thing. While Smear is fixing a car from underneath, Mendel is stabbed in the eye, causing him to accidentally hit the gas, which runs over Smear's head and runs over Barb. As Mendel gets out of the car to help Barb, she stabs him through the chin and dies alongside him. Grohl battles Jeremy only to back down in horror when Jeremy tells him of the album's success and the start of his solo career. One year later, Grohl, the only Foo Fighter survivor, prepares to perform a solo concert, with marks of possession around his eyes.

In 1986, at age 17, Grohl joined thepunk rockbandScream, replacing drummerKent Stax. After Scream broke up in 1990, Grohl became the drummer for Nirvana. He first appeared on the band's second album,Nevermind(1991). After the 1994suicide of Kurt Cobain, Nirvana disbanded and Grohl formed Foo Fighters as a one-man project. After he released the albumFoo Fightersin 1995, he assembled a full band to tour and record under the Foo Fighters name. They have since released 11 studio albums.
Grohl is also the drummer and co-founder of the rock supergroupThem Crooked Vultures, and has recorded and toured withQueens of the Stone AgeandTenacious D. He has organized side projectsLate!, which released the albumPocketwatch, andProbot. Grohl began directing Foo Fighters music videos in 1997. He released his debut documentary,Sound City, in 2013, then the 2014 documentary miniseriesSonic Highwaysand the 2021 documentary filmWhat Drives Us. In 2021, Grohl released an autobiography,The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music.[1][2]In 2022, he and the Foo Fighters starred as themselves in the comedy horror filmStudio 666.
In 2016,Rolling Stoneranked Grohl the 27th-best drummer of all time.[3]Grohl was inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Fameas part of Nirvana in 2014 and as a member of Foo Fighters in 2021.[4]
Grohl was born inWarren, Ohio, on January 14, 1969,[5]the son of teacher Virginia Jean (née Hanlon) and newswriter James Harper Grohl.[6]He is of German, Slovak (on his father's side), Irish, and English (on his mother's side) descent.[7][8]His father, James, was a journalist and the special assistant to U.S. SenatorRobert Taft Jr.James was described as "a talented political observer who possessed the ability to call every major election with uncanny accuracy".[9]When he was a child, Grohl's family moved toSpringfield, Virginia. When he was seven, his parents divorced,[10]and he was subsequently raised by his mother. At the age of 12, he began learning to play guitar. He grew tired of lessons and instead taught himself, eventually playing in bands with friends.[11]He said, "I was going in the direction of faster, louder, darker while my sister, Lisa, three years older, was getting seriously intonew waveterritory. We'd meet in the middle sometimes withBowieandSiouxsie and the Banshees."[12]
At 13, Grohl and his sister spent the summer at their cousin Tracey's house inEvanston, Illinois. Tracey introduced them topunk rockby taking the pair to shows by a variety of punk bands. His first concert wasNaked RaygunatThe Cubby Bearin Chicago in 1982.[13]Grohl recalled, "From then on we were totally punk. We went home and boughtMaximumrocknrolland tried to figure it all out."[11]In Virginia, he attendedThomas Jefferson High Schoolas a freshman, and was elected class vice president. In that capacity, he managed to play pieces of songs by punk bands likeCircle JerksandBad Brainsover the school intercom before his morning announcements. His mother decided he should transfer toBishop Ireton High SchoolinAlexandriabecause hiscannabisuse was lowering his grades. He stayed there for two years, beginning with a repeat of his first year. After his second year, he transferred yet again toAnnandale High School.[11]While in high school, he played in several local bands, including a stint as guitarist in a band called Freak Baby, and taught himself to play drums.[14]When Freak Baby fired its bass player and reshuffled its lineup, Grohl switched to drums. The reconstituted band renamed itself Mission Impossible.[11]
Grohl said he did not take formal drum lessons; instead, he taught himself how to play the drums by listening toRushandpunk rock.[15]Rush drummerNeil Peartwas an early influence: "When I got2112when I was eight years old, it fucking changed the direction of my life. I heard the drums. It made me want to become a drummer."[16]During his developing years as a drummer, Grohl citedJohn Bonhamas his greatest influence, and eventually had Bonham'sthree-rings symboltattooed on his right shoulder.[17]Mission Impossible rebranded themselves Fast before breaking up, after which Grohl joined thehardcore punkband Dain Bramage in December 1985.[18][19]In March 1987, Dain Bramage ended when Grohl quit without warning to join Scream, having produced theI Scream Not Coming DownLP. Many of Grohl's early influences were at the9:30 Club, a music venue in Washington, D.C. In April 2010, he said, "I went to the 9:30 Club hundreds of times. I was always so excited to get there, and I was always bummed when it closed. I spent my teenage years at the club and saw some shows that changed my life."[20]
As a teenager in Washington, D.C., Grohl briefly contemplated joiningGwar, ashock rockband that was seeking a drummer.[21]At age 17, he auditioned for the local bandScreamafter the departure of the drummer, Kent Stax. Grohl lied about his age, claiming he was older.[22]To his surprise, the band asked him to join, so he dropped out of high school in his junior year. He said: "I was 17 and extremely anxious to see the world, so I did it."[23]
Over the next four years, Grohl toured extensively with Scream, recording a live album (their show of May 4, 1990, in Alzey, Germany, being released by Tobby Holzinger asYour Choice Live Series Vol.10) and two studio albums,No More CensorshipandFumble, for which Grohl wrote and sang "Gods Look Down". During a Toronto stop on their 1987 tour, Grohl played drums forIggy Popat a CD release party held atEl Mocambo.[24]In 1990, Scream unexpectedly disbanded mid-tour following the departure of their bassist,Skeeter Thompson.[25]
While playing in Scream, Grohl became a fan of theMelvinsand eventually befriended them. During a 1990 tour stop on theWest Coast, the Melvins guitaristBuzz Osbornetook his friendsKurt CobainandKrist Novoselic, members ofNirvana, to see a Scream performance.[26]In October 2010, Grohl toldQ, "I remember being in the same room with them and thinking, 'What?That'sNirvana? Are you kidding?' Because on their record cover they looked like psycho lumberjacks... I was like, 'What, that little dude and that big motherfucker? You're kidding me.'"[27]Following the breakup of Scream, Grohl called Osborne for advice.[28]Osborne informed him that Nirvana was seeking a drummer, and gave Grohl the phone numbers of Cobain and Novoselic, who invited Grohl to Seattle to audition. Grohl soon joined.[25]
Nirvana had already recorded several demos for the followup to their 1989 debut album,Bleach, and had spent time recording with the producerButch ViginWisconsin. Initially, the plan was to release the album onSub Pop, but Nirvana received a great deal of interest based on the demos. Grohl spent the initial months with Nirvana traveling to various labels to discuss record deals, and signed withDGC Records.[29]
In early 1991, the band enteredSound City Studiosin Los Angeles to recordNevermind, which is depicted in Grohl's 2013 documentarySound City.[29]Nevermind(1991) exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide commercial success.[30]At the same time, Grohl was compiling and recording his own material, which he released on a cassette,Pocketwatchin 1992, on the indie label Simple Machines. Grohl released the cassette under the pseudonym "Late!"[31]
In the later years with Nirvana, Grohl's songwriting contributions to the band increased. In Grohl's initial months inOlympia, Washington,[32]Cobain overheard him working on the song "Color Pictures of a Marigold", and the two subsequently worked on it together. Grohl later recorded the song for thePocketwatchcassette. Grohl said in a 2014 episode ofFoo Fighters: Sonic Highwaysthat Cobain reacted by kissing him upon first hearing a demo of "Alone + Easy Target" that Grohl had recently recorded.[33]
During the sessions forIn Utero, Nirvana rerecorded "Color Pictures of a Marigold" and released it as a B-side on the "Heart-Shaped Box" single, retitled "Marigold". Grohl also contributed the riff for "Scentless Apprentice". Cobain said in a 1993 interview withMTVthat he initially thought the riff was "kind of boneheaded", but was gratified at how the song developed, a process captured in part in a demo on the Nirvana box setWith the Lights Out. Cobain said that he was excited at the possibility of having Novoselic and Grohl contribute more to the band's songwriting.[34]
Prior to Nirvana's 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time atRobert Lang Studiosin Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs. They completed several of Grohl's songs, including the futureFoo Fighterssongs "Exhausted", "Big Me", "February Stars", and "Butterflies". Cobain arrived on the third day, and the band recorded a demo of "You Know You're Right". It was Nirvana's final studio recording before thesuicide of Cobainon April 5, 1994.[35][36]On April 10, 2014, Grohl was inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Fameas a member of Nirvana.[37]
Following Cobain's death, Grohl went into isolation and retreated for several months, unsure of what to do next, and moved toCounty Kerry, Ireland.[38]In a 2022 interview, Grohl said:
I was still in Seattle, and I just felt, "I gotta get out." I [had to] go somewhere where I could just disappear and sort through my life, and try to figure out what to do next... I was winding around these country roads – so beautiful – and I was finding peace… and I come upon this hitchhiker, and I was considering picking him up, and I saw that he had a Kurt Cobain T-shirt. And to me that meant: "You can't outrun this thing, so it's time … to push through and find some sort of continuation." So I flew home and I immediately started recording those Foo Fighters songs.
In October 1994, he scheduled studio time atRobert Lang Studiosand quickly recorded a fifteen-track demo. With the exception of a single guitar part on "X-Static" played byGreg Dulliofthe Afghan Whigs, Grohl performed all of the instruments himself.[40]
Grohl wondered if his future might be in drumming for other bands. In November, Grohl took a brief turn withTom Petty and the Heartbreakers, including a performance onSaturday Night Live. He declined an invitation to become Petty's permanent drummer.[41][42]Grohl was also rumored as a possible replacement forPearl JamdrummerDave Abbruzzeseand performed with the band for a song or two at three shows during Pearl Jam's March 1995 Australian tour. However, by then, Pearl Jam had already settled on ex-Red Hot Chili PeppersdrummerJack Irons, and Grohl had other solo plans.[43][44]
After his demo received interest from major labels, Grohl was signed byGary Gersh, Nirvana'sA&Rrep-turned-president ofCapitol Records. Grohl did not want the effort to be considered the start of a solo career, so he recruited other band members: former Germs and touring Nirvana guitaristPat Smearand two members of the recently disbandedSunny Day Real Estate:William Goldsmith(drums) andNate Mendel(bass).[45]He and Novoselic decided against Novoselic joining; Grohl said it would have felt "really natural" for them to work together again, but would have been uncomfortable for the other band members and placed more pressure on Grohl.[46]Grohl's demo was remixed byRob SchnapfandTom Rothrockand released in July 1995 as Foo Fighters'self-titled debut album.[47]During a break between tours, the band entered the studio and recorded a cover ofGary Numan's "Down in the Park". In February 1996, Grohl and his then-wife Jennifer Youngblood made a briefcameo appearanceonThe X-Filesthird-season episode "Pusher".[48]
After touring for the self-titled album for more than a year, Grohl returned home and began work on the soundtrack to the 1997 movieTouch. Grohl performed all of the instruments and vocals himself, save for vocals fromVeruca SaltsingerLouise Poston the title track, keyboards by Barrett Jones (who also co-produced the record) on one track, and vocals and guitar byX'sJohn Doeon "This Loving Thing (Lynn's Song)". Grohl completed the recording in two weeks, and immediately joined Foo Fighters to work on their follow-up.
During the initial sessions for Foo Fighters' second album, tension emerged between Grohl and drummer Goldsmith. Goldsmith said, "Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do 13 hours' worth of takes on another one...It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else". Goldsmith also believed that Capitol and producerGil Nortonwanted Grohl to drum on the album.[49]With the album seemingly complete, Grohl headed home to Virginia with a copy of the rough mixes and found himself unhappy with the results. He wrote and recorded a few new songs, "Walking After You" and the hit single "Everlong", alone at a studio in Washington, D.C. Inspired by the session, Grohl opted to move the band, without Goldsmith's knowledge,[49]to Los Angeles to re-record most of the album with Grohl on drums. After the sessions were complete, Goldsmith announced his departure from the band, and was replaced by FormerAlanis MorissettedrummerTaylor Hawkins.[50]Grohl later expressed regret, and said, "There were a lot of reasons it didn't work out, but there was also a part of me that was like, you know, I don't know if I'm finished playing the drums yet".[51]
The album was released in May 1997 asThe Colour and the Shape. It produced several singles, including "Everlong", "My Hero", and "Monkey Wrench", and cemented Foo Fighters as a staple of rock radio.[52]
The following September, Smear left the band, citing a need to settle down after a lifetime of touring.[10]Smear was replaced by Grohl's formerScreambandmateFranz Stahl. Stahl departed before the band recorded its third album[10]and was replaced by touring guitaristChris Shiflett, who later became a full-fledged member during the recording ofOne by One.
Grohl's life of non-stop touring and travel continued with Foo Fighters' popularity. During his infrequent pauses he lived in Seattle and Los Angeles before returning toAlexandria, Virginia. It was there that he turned his basement into a recording studio where the 1999 albumThere Is Nothing Left to Losewas recorded.[53]It was recorded following the departure from Capitol and their former president Gary Gersh. Grohl described the recording experience as "intoxicating at times" because the band members were left completely to their own devices. He added, "One of the advantages of finishing the record before we had a new label was that it was purely our creation. It was complete and not open to outside tampering."[54]
In 2000, the band recruitedQueenguitaristBrian Mayto add some guitar flourish to a cover ofPink Floyd's "Have a Cigar", a song which Foo Fighters previously recorded as a B-side. The friendship between the two bands resulted in Grohl and Taylor Hawkins being asked to induct Queen into theRock and Roll Hall of Famein 2001.[55]Grohl and Hawkins joined May and Queen drummerRoger Taylorto perform "Tie Your Mother Down", with Grohl standing in on vocals forFreddie Mercury.[56]May later contributed guitar work for the song "Tired of You" on the ensuing Foo Fighters album, as well as on an unreleased Foo Fighters song called "Knucklehead".
Near the end of 2001, Foo Fighters returned to the studio to work on their fourth album. After four months in the studio, with the sessions finished, Grohl accepted an invitation to joinQueens of the Stone Ageand helped them to record their 2002 albumSongs for the Deaf. (Grohl can be seen drumming for the band in the video for the song "No One Knows".) After a brief tour through North America, Britain and Japan with the band[10]and feeling rejuvenated by the effort, Grohl recalled the other band members to completely re-record their album at his studio in Virginia. The effort became their fourth album,One by One.
On November 23, 2002, Grohl achieved a historical milestone by replacing himself on the top of theBillboardmodern rockchart, when "You Know You're Right" by Nirvana was replaced by "All My Life" by Foo Fighters. When "All My Life" ended its run, after a one-week respite, "No One Knows" by Queens of the Stone Age took the number one spot. Between October 26, 2002, and March 1, 2003, Grohl was in the number one spot on the Modern rock charts for 17 of 18 successive weeks, as a member of three different groups.
Grohl and Foo Fighters released their fifth albumIn Your Honoron June 14, 2005. Prior to starting work on the album, the band spent almost a year relocating Grohl's home-based Virginia studio to a brand new facility, dubbedStudio 606, located in a warehouse near Los Angeles. Featuring collaborations withJohn Paul JonesofLed Zeppelin,Josh HommeofQueens of the Stone AgeandNorah Jones, the album was a departure from previous efforts, and included one rock and one acoustic disc.

On November 3, 2009, Foo Fighters released their firstGreatest Hitscollection, consisting of 16 tracks including a previously unreleased acoustic version of "Everlong" and two new tracks "Wheels" and "Word Forward" which were produced byNevermind's producerButch Vig. Grohl said he felt theGreatest Hitswas too early and "can look like an obituary". He did not feel they had written their best hits yet.[57]
Foo Fighters' seventh studio album,Wasting Light, was released on April 12, 2011. It became the band's first album to reach No. 1 in the United States.[58]Despite rumors of a hiatus,[59]Grohl confirmed in January 2013 that the band had completed writing material for their follow-up toWasting Light.[60]

On June 12, 2015, while playing a show in Gothenburg, Sweden, Grohl fell off the stage, breaking his leg. He left temporarily and returned with a cast to finish the concert.[63]Afterward, the band canceled the remainder of its European tour. To avoid having to cancel the band's upcoming North American tour, Grohl designed a large "elevated throne" which would allow him to perform on stage with a broken leg. The throne was unveiled at a concert in Washington, D.C., on July 4, where Grohl used the stage's video screens to show the crowd video of him falling from the stage in Gothenburg as well as X-rays of his broken leg.[64]Beginning with the show on July 4, Foo Fighters began selling new tour merchandise rebranding the band's North American tour as theBroken Leg Tour.[64]In 2016, Grohl lent his throne toAxl RoseofGuns N' Rosesafter Rose broke his foot.[65]He lent it again in 2021 to Darin Wall, of the Seattle metal band Greyhawk, after Wall was shot in the leg.[65]

Foo Fighters covered Killing Joke's "Requiem" during the late 1990s, and were joined by Killing Joke singerJaz Colemanfor a performance of the song at a show in New Zealand in 2003.[84]Also in 2003, at the45th Annual Grammy Awards, Grohl performed in an ad hoc supergroup withBruce Springsteen,Elvis Costello, andSteven Van Zandtin tribute to the recently deceased singer/guitaristJoe Strummer.[85]

Nathan ‍Gregor ‍Mendel(born December 2, 1968) is an American musician who is the bass guitarist for the rock bandFoo Fighters, as well as a former member ofSunny Day Real Estate. He has also worked with musical actsThe Jealous SoundandThe Fire Theft. He has released one solo album,If I Kill This Thing We're All Going to Eat for a Week, under the nameLieutenant. Though not a founding member, he is the longest-serving member of the band after lead vocalist and guitaristDave Grohl, and has appeared on every album by the group sinceThe Colour and the Shape.
Mendel was born inRichland, a mid-sized city in southeastWashington. His first instrument was theviolin. At the age of 13, Mendel started to get interested in rock music and joined a band,[1]a friend who played guitar suggesting he play the bass.[2]Mendel stated that "as I picked up that bass I went on a 20-year detour intopunk", helped by his town usually having concerts ofDIYpunk bands such asScream.[3]This led to a "pretty limited musical education", as despite taking some lessons with a bassist from a local band, Mendel mostly taught himself to play, and "it was all hardcore punk rock, likeMinor Threat,Black FlagandBad Brains. Instead of studying the bass playing of someone likeJohn Entwistle, which would have given me a foundation of how to play. I just wanted to play a lot of notes fast."[2]His family isJewish.[4][5]
Mendel began his musical career in thehardcoreband Diddly Squat, which only recorded a7" singlebut did a national tour during the 1988 summer vacation. After Diddly Squat ended, Mendel moved toSeattle, where he spent four months on thestraight edgeband Brotherhood. Afterward, he joined the band Christ on a Crutch, which included bandmate Glen Essary and lasted until 1993. In 1992, Mendel and hisUniversity of WashingtonhousemateDan Hoernerdecided to form a band, and invited drummerWilliam Goldsmithto form the group that would end up being namedSunny Day Real Estate (SDRE).[1]Mendel added that SDRE was an attempt to "play more intricate, interesting music".[2]While Mendel toured Europe with Christ on a Crutch,Jeremy Enigkjammed with the remaining members and eventually became a full-time member of SDRE.[6]
Just before Sunny Day Real Estate disbanded in 1995, Mendel and Goldsmith were invited byDave Grohlto join his band, theFoo Fighters, during the week of Halloween in late October 1994. He has remained a bandmember ever since, being one of the only original members in the Foo Fighters' current lineup along with Grohl and formerNirvanalive guitaristPat Smear.[7]Although Sunny Day Real Estate reunited for two more albums (How It Feels to Be Something OnandThe Rising Tide), he stayed with the Foo Fighters, in Sunny Day Real Estate, he was replaced by Jeff Palmer, and Palmer was replaced by Joe Skyward, when Skyward left the band,Jeremy Enigk(lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and keyboardist) moved to the bass. After Sunny Day Real Estate disbanded once more, he joined with other Sunny Day Real Estate members Jeremy Enigk andWilliam Goldsmithto formThe Fire Theft, who released a self-titled album in 2003.[2]In 2001, he played withJuno.
He scored a role in the indie movieOur Burden Is Light, in which he also played a minor role as the main female character's best friend's boyfriend and bassist. In the movie, Mendel plays in a band named Bleeder, consisting of himself, Jessica Ballard, andTaylor Hawkins.
In June 2009, it was confirmed thatSunny Day Real Estateplans to reunite again, with Mendel back in the fold.[8][9]The band toured in 2009, confirming a new album in the works.[10]However, recording sessions proved to be unproductive and by 2013, the group had broken up once again.
Mendel at first considered the bass a melodic instrument, and thus liked to input more personality in his bass parts.Bass Playerdescribed Mendel's style inSunny Day Real Estateas "heavy-handed and fleet-footed, rooted in punk rock but prone to melodic flights that encircled the band's airy arrangements", and Mendel added that in his first years of the Foo Fighters he tried "to make these songs as complicated as I could and put as much bass on there as possible". He eventually changed his priorities to the more traditional bass style where the instrument acts as "the bridge between the melodic element and the percussion", saying that he "alter[ed] the way I play bass so it works in this band, so I can support Dave's songs as best as possible." The priorities he learned to take with his playing was to "play tight and lock better with the drums"[2][11]adding that when Grohl and drummerTaylor Hawkinsdecide to redo the drum tracks, at times Mendel would have to remake his whole basslines.[12]
Mendel is known to use apickalmost exclusively. His preferred style wasalternate picking, but on the fifth Foo Fighters album,In Your Honor, he started to employdownpickingbecause "with this kind of music, you need the consistency and percussive sound you get from playing with downstrokes." For the acoustic shows, Mendel playedfingerstyle.[2]
Mendel's main set-up consists ofFender Precision BasseswithGHSstrings, played throughAshdownamplifiers.[2]Mendel described the Precision as "iconic" in both its looks and its sound. The bassist's preferred P-Bass is his first, a 1971 model sold to him by the lead singer of Christ on a Crutch which Mendel adapted to be easier to play.[11]Mendel also playsLaklandbasses, particularly theBob GlaubSignature, one of which was employed on the Foo Fighters' seventh album,Wasting Light. He uses aFulltone Bassdrivepedal, though Mendel downsized the usage ofeffects pedalsas the Foo Fighters rose its number of musicians – "Now that we have three guitar players, there's a lot of distortion going on, so I try to keep it clean and stay in line with thekick drum. That way, I know that even if we're playing a big echoey venue, at least the bass will come across with some bite and precision."[2]In 2012, Mendel received his own signatureFender Nate Mendel Precision Bass, which has become popular globally due to it being a very well built, simply modified vintage style Precision Bass.
Mendel met Kate Jackson, co-founder of independentpublic relationsfirm Grandstand Media, in 2009 while she was director of marketing and publicity atSub Pop Recordsand Mendel was touring as part of a reunion of the original lineup of Sub Pop recording artistsSunny Day Real Estate. They were married on October 11, 2014, accompanied by close friends and family including Mendel'sFoo Fightersbandmates.[13]On July 19, 2018, Mendel took a one-show leave of absence from the Foo Fighters' Concrete & Gold tour, withJane's AddictionbassistChris Chaneyfilling in for him for one night at thePPG Paints ArenainPittsburgh, as he chose to be with Jackson as she gave birth to the couple's twin girls.[14]
Mendel has expressedfringeviews onHIV & AIDS. In January 2000, he organized a sold-out concert in Los Angeles to benefitAlive & Well AIDS Alternatives, anHIV/AIDS denialismgroup.[15]In April 2000,MTV Newsreported that "The Foo Fighters have gone on record advocating Alive & Well, an alternative AIDS information group that questions the link between HIV and AIDS."[16]TheCenters for Disease Controldescribe AIDS as the "most severe stage of HIV."[17]Sandra Thurman, then director of theOffice of National AIDS Policycommented:
For the Foo Fighters to be promoting this is extraordinarily irresponsible behavior. There is no doubt about the link between HIV and AIDS in the respected scientific community and it's quite unfortunate that a band reads one book and then adopts this theory. To say [that HIV does not cause AIDS] is akin to saying the world is flat.[18]
Responding to coverage of the Alive & Well benefit inMother Jonesmagazine, Mendel wrote, "I am not a medical professional, and I am relatively new to these questions, but I am convinced that those who have tested HIV positive and those sick with AIDS are being done a disservice by not having all the information available to them."[19]Links and references to Alive & Well were removed from the band's website by March 2003.[20]

Linked page for 'Pat Smear' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Smear):
Georg Albert Ruthenberg(born August 5, 1959), better known by his stage namePat Smear, is an American musician. He was the lead guitarist and co-founder of Los Angeles–basedpunkbandThe Germsand arhythmguitarist forgrungebandNirvana(which he joined as a touring guitarist in 1993). After Nirvana disbanded following thesuicideof frontmanKurt Cobain, drummerDave Grohlwent on to formFoo Fighters, with Smear joining on guitar. Smear left the band in 1997 before rejoining as a touring guitarist in 2005 and being promoted back to a full-time member in 2010.
Smear was born and raised inWest Los Angeles, California to aGerman Jewishfather andAfrican AmericanandNative Americanmother. His parents enrolled him in piano lessons at a young age, and a few years later he began teaching himself to play the guitar.[1]
At age 13, he left home to join a commune. Later, he attended Innovative Program School (IPS), an alternative school withinUniversity High Schoolin Los Angeles.[2]It was there he met vocalistDarby Crash, alongside whom he would play in the Germs in the late 1970s.[3]Smear and Crash were both expelled from IPS due to concerns they were inciting unruly behavior among the students.[1][4]
Smear lists his influences asJoan Jett,Brian James,Brian May, andSteve Jones. He also stated that "all the guitar playing" ofJohn McKayonSiouxsie and the Banshees'sfirst album"really inspired me"[5]and thatYesguitaristSteve Howeis "the best guitarist ever".[6]As a teenager in 1976, Smear andDarby Crashformed theGermswith bassistLorna Doomand drummer Dottie Danger (the pseudonym ofBelinda Carlisle, who would go on to frontThe Go-Go's). Smear was the only band member who had any musical knowledge or proficiency at the time.[7]For most of his time in the Germs, Smear reported that he didn't own a guitar but rather "just borrowed from whoever we were playing with".[8]
Carlisle was soon replaced byDon Bollesand, in 1979, the band released their first album,(GI), produced byJoan Jett.[9]The record is now regarded as a milestone in the history ofpunk rock, with Smear earning praise for his guitar work: "Smear has an equal claim to being the album's star [alongside Darby], though, and for good reason – not only did he co-write everything, his clipped, catchy monsterriffingwas as pure punk in the late-'70s sense as anything, wasting no time on anything extraneous."[10]
The Germs, along with Smear, appeared in the punk documentaryThe Decline of Western Civilization(1981), directed byPenelope Spheeris.[11]Darby Crash died before the film was released, leading to the band breaking up.
Following the demise of the Germs, Smear played in 1981 with the ex-ScreamerskeyboardistPaul Roesslerand his sisterKira Roesslerin Twisted Roots.[12]Although short-lived, the band was the toast of the Hollywood punk scene. He also had a brief stint as a member of punk bandthe Adolescentsin 1981.
Smear was briefly indeathrockband45 Gravewith Don Bolles (the former drummer for the Germs). During this stint, they recorded a 7" titledBlack Crossand other tracks that would later appear on 45 Grave's 1987 compilation album,Autopsy.
During this time, he also worked as an actor inbit parts,[3]appearing in the television showsQuincy, M.E.andCHiPs, and in the filmsBlade Runner,Breakin'andHoward the Duck.[13]While working onBreakin', Smear became friends withCourtney Love.[14]He also appeared as an extra in the music video forPrinceandthe Revolution's single "Raspberry Beret," sitting in front ofLisa Coleman's piano. According to Smear, he was hand-picked by Prince himself for the video.[13]
Smear would go on to make two solo albums of his own,Ruthensmear,released in 1987 and recorded with Paul Roessler, andSo You Fell in Love with a Musician...,released in 1992.
Smear recorded and mixed a cover of "Circle One" in December 1992 withCourtney Loveon vocals and bass, Smear andEric Erlandsonon guitar, andPatty Schemelon drums.[15]A 7-inch vinyl was released under the name The Holez in 1993.[16]The cover later appeared on the compilation albumA Small Circle of Friendsin 1996.
In 1993, he received a call fromNirvana's frontmanKurt Cobain, asking him to join the band as a second guitarist for an upcoming tour.[14]At first, Smear thought his friend, Carlos "Cake" Nunez, was pranking him; however, Courtney Love had told Smear a few days prior that Cobain was going to call him. Smear accepted immediately and played his first show with Nirvana onSaturday Night Liveon September 25, 1993. He toured with Nirvana for about six months.[14]Smear appeared on their live albumsMTV Unplugged in New York,From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah, as well as on material for the compilationsNirvanaandWith the Lights Outand the concert DVDLive and Loud.
Following Cobain's death, Nirvana drummerDave Grohlformed a band to support his self-titled album, which would ultimately become known asFoo Fighters. Smear joined the group from its inception in late October 1994, but because theirfirst albumwas a collection of demos recorded solely by Grohl, Smear did not appear on a Foo Fighters album untilThe Colour and the Shape(1997).
Shortly after the release ofThe Colour and the Shape, Smear quit the band. As Smear later explained, he quit mainly due to exhaustion from the band's relentless touring schedule.[14][17]Smear's departure was also related to inner-band tensions that sprung up around Grohl's divorce from his first wife, Jennifer Youngblood, who was a close friend of Smear.[17]Grohl explained that he "begged" Smear to stay and Smear agreed to remain in Foo Fighters temporarily due to scheduled touring obligations, but only until a replacement guitarist could be recruited. Grohl eventually invitedFranz Stahl, his former bandmate fromScream, to fill the lead guitarist slot.[17]
Smear announced his departure from Foo Fighters during a live performance at the1997 MTV Video Music Awards; he played partway through the set, then introduced Stahl who completed the gig.[14]
Smear kept a fairly low profile during his absence from Foo Fighters. He produced the debut album for the band Harlow and made scattered television appearances. He was employed as a creative consultant in a motion picture about the Germs and Darby Crash, entitledWhat We Do Is Secret, named after one of the band's best-known songs. The film was released at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 23, 2007, had a limited theatrical release in 2008, and is now available on DVD. In the film, Smear is depicted by actorRick Gonzalez. In 2005, he began performing reunion shows with the Germs, including actorShane West, who portrays Darby Crash in the film, filling in as lead vocalist.
In late 2005, Smear began performing select shows with Foo Fighters again. He continued to play intermittently with the group, often not for the entirety of a concert, as a touring musician for the next five years. Smear appeared with the Foo Fighters as an additional musician on their live acoustic album,Skin and Bones(2006), contributing acoustic and electric guitar. He was also featured as a guest musician on the group's sixth studio album,Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace(2007), playing rhythm guitar on the track "Let It Die." Smear described his participation as "the oddest recording experience I had with Foo Fighters", given he had no input in composition and was "going in and playing on a song that was already written".[18]
In August 2010, Foo Fighters began recording their seventh studio album,Wasting Light, with producerButch Vig. The recording sessions were documented on the band's website and Twitter, with Smear being present in many of the photos that were posted. A December press release confirmed that Smear was part of the project and was considered a core member of the band once again, becoming the band's third guitarist alongside Grohl andChris Shiflett.[19]The album was released on April 12, 2011, marking the group's first studio release with Smear as an official member sinceThe Colour and the Shapein 1997.Wasting Lightdebuted at number one in twelve countries and was the first Foo Fighters album to top the United States'Billboard 200chart. The album and its songs were nominated for fiveGrammy Awards, includingAlbum of the Year. The record won theBest Rock Albumaward, while "White Limo" was chosen as theBest Hard Rock/Metal Performanceand "Walk" won bothBest Rock PerformanceandBest Rock Song.
Smear continued his work with the band on their follow-up albumSonic Highways(2014). Every song on the album was written and recorded in a different city across the United States and features guest musicians with ties to that city's musical history. The process was filmed for a companion television series,Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways, which was broadcast onHBOin the months surrounding the album's release. Sonic Highways was released on November 10, 2014 and debuted at number two on theBillboard 200.
In 2017, the Foo Fighters released their ninth studio album,Concrete and Gold. Smear once again performed guitar on all tracks, as well as contributed percussion on the songsRunand Happy Ever After (Zero Hour). The group's tenth studio album,Medicine at Midnight, was released on February 5, 2021 and went on to win threeGrammy Awards, including Best Rock Album. Five days after the release of the album, Foo Fighters were announced as one of the 2021Rock and Roll Hall of Famenominees in their first year of eligibility. They were officially selected as part of the 2021 induction class on May 12, 2021.

Smear appeared alongside his bandmates in the comedy horror film,Studio 666, directed by BJ McDonnell. The film was released on February 25, 2022 and received mixed reviews.
During the Foo Fighters' Friday night performance at Bumbershoot Festival on August 29, 1997, Nirvana bassistKrist Novoselicjoined his former bandmates Dave Grohl and Pat Smear on stage for the Foo's encore to salute the late Kurt Cobain. Grohl took his position on drums, Novoselic played bass, and Smear accompanied on guitar. A spotlight encompassed the microphone stand to honor Cobain, who died by suicide on April 5, 1994. They performed a cover of Prince's "Purple Rain", after which a roadie for the Foo Fighters joined them on stage and sang a version ofLed Zeppelin's "Communication Breakdown".
On December 22, 2010, the remaining members of Nirvana played together during a Foo Fighters show at Paladino's in Tarzana, California, which was recorded for a documentary.

Smear is closely associated withHagströmguitars, after buying one toward the end of his time in the Germs and using them as his preferred model for many years. He collaborated on designing a signature guitar with the company.[8]Smear now primarily usesGibsonguitars. He can be seen with classic models such as a White SG Custom or a Les Paul but mostly custom shop variations on the rare Johnny A model.[citation needed]Smear also uses aGibson Barney Kesselmodel guitar while playing with the Foo Fighters.[22]

Hawkins said that his drumming was chiefly influenced by classic rock drummers, includingPhil CollinsofGenesis;[47]Stewart Copelandofthe Police,[47]whom he idolized and eventually befriended;[48]BudgieofSiouxsie and the Banshees;[49]Roger TaylorofQueen;[47]Stephen PerkinsofJane's Addiction;[47]Jim GordonofDerek and the Dominos;[47]Neil PeartofRush;[50]Alex Van HalenofVan Halen;[51][52]andJohn BonhamfromLed Zeppelin.[53]
Hawkins was once guest editor ofRhythmand interviewed Collins, Copeland, Taylor, and Perkins for the issue.[47]
It was thanks to Rush that I got into Genesis. After listening to Neil, I bought theSeconds Outlive album, which was released in 1977. It's just amazing. Not only hearing Phil Collins playing the drums, but also singing. He gets a really bad rap from some people for 'daring' to take over afterPeter Gabrielquit, but you just hear the way he sounds here. The beauty of this album is that it's got songs from ...Trick of the Tail, the first album Genesis did without Gabriel. Collins is an incredible drummer. Anyone who wants to be good on the drums should check him out – the man is a master.[50]
Hawkins's first two major inspirations were Roger Taylor and Stewart Copeland. He reported that listening to these two drummers' different styles showed him a wide spectrum of drumming style. He also mentioned that he would play along with songs on the radio or records, like Queen'sNews of the World, to enhance his skills when he was young.[54][55]
During his career, Hawkins used a variety of different brands, includingLudwig Drums, Tama Drums, and, most notably,Gretsch Drums, which he endorsed and played from 2005 until his death. He was also known to useZildjian Cymbals.

I wasn't ajunkie, per se, but I was partying. There was a year where the partying just got a little too heavy. Thank God on some level this guy gave me the wrong line with the wrong thing one night and I woke up going, 'What the fuck happened?' That was a real changing point for me." In the same interview, Hawkins also said he was sober.[63]
Hawkins suffered fromstage fright.[64][65]Speaking about his health in a June 2021 interview withRolling Stonemagazine, Hawkins said: "I'm healthy. I'm good... I getsinus infectionsreally bad. And I just found out from my doctor, got all my blood tests and my heart everything checked and he goes, 'Dude, you're in amazing shape. Your heart's big, because you exercise a lot. It's like a runner's heart.' And that's fine. The only thing is, he said, 'I think you have sleep apnea.' And my wife's always saying you snore and you fucking make weird noises while you're sleeping and stuff."[65]
On March 25, 2022, Hawkins was inBogotá, Colombia, where he was scheduled to perform with the Foo Fighters later that evening.

Colombia's National Institute of Forensic Medicine stated that they would "continue the medical studies to achieve total clarification of the events that led to the death of Taylor Hawkins", and theattorney general's office would continue to investigate his cause of death in a "timely manner".[72]
A May 2022 article from Andy Greene and Kory Grow inRolling Stonemade the case that Hawkins was suffering from extreme exhaustion in the period leading up to his death, and allegedly asked that no more dates be added to the scheduled tour.[75]However, two of the interviewees,Chad SmithandMatt Cameron, have since disavowed the article, stating that they were quoted out of context and that their comments were misrepresented.[76]Noting that official autopsy results had not, at that time, been made public, the Green–Grow article went on to state that "his friends believe[d] he wasn't using hard drugs recreationally at the time of his death" and that the post-mortem forensics performed indicated that the mass of Hawkins' heart was "about double... normal size" (indicatingcardiomegaly), raising the possibility that "it could have collapsed" apart from any contribution of drugs in his system."[75][needs update]

Shiflett was born inSanta Barbara, California. He has two older brothers, Mike, andScott, who also became a musician – best known as the bassist of the punk rock bandFace to Face. When Shiflett was 11, he started learning how to play the guitar. A promising youngsoccerplayer, Shiflett played with theAmerican Youth Soccer Organization(AYSO) from 1982–1984 under legendary coach Noemi Vazquez. Pressed to make a choice on his career, Shiflett joined his first band by the time he reached the age of 14. Shiflett is a supporter ofArsenal F.C., having discovered the club while readingJohn Lydon's autobiography in the early 1990s.[3][4]

Offered the job, and seeing an opportunity that he knew he could not pass up, he quickly parted ways with No Use for a Name to join Foo Fighters. His departure was abrupt, as his former band was about to head out on tour in support of their albumMore Betterness!.
Dave Grohlsaid part of his motivation to hire Shiflett was that he had a history in the underground punk scene, including opening for Grohl's former bandScreamas bassist of the group Rat Pack.

Shiflett has noted several times that one of his favorite songs that he plays with Foo Fighters is "All My Life" from their fourth studio albumOne by One. He has said that he was afraid of being fired even before he started to play with the band, as previous guitaristPat Smearhad asked to return.

In addition to his full-time duties with Foo Fighters, Shiflett also plays in his own side-project,Jackson United, as well asViva Deathwith his brother, Scott. For numerous projects, Shiflett performed under the name Jake Jackson. He played with the cover band Chevy Metal along with the late Foo FighterTaylor Hawkins.

After graduating fromFairfax High School, he continued to play in various bands, and he took session work in recording studios.[3]
Around 1989,Jakob Dylanand his friend Tobi Miller formed a group called the Apples, playing various clubs in the L.A. area. While waiting in line atCanter'sDeli after 2:00 am, Jaffee heard the Apples wanted an organist and pianist, and he was told that Dylan and Miller were then in the Kibitz Room bar attached to Canter's. They met; Dylan and Miller played Jaffee some demo tapes in their car stereo, and Jaffee immediately joined the group. A few weeks later, they changed their name to the Wallflowers and signed withVirgin Records. In 1992, they released their first album,The Wallflowers.[3]The Wallflowers toured throughout the U.S. and Canada in 1992 and early 1993. They served as the opening act forCracker, theSpin Doctorsand10,000 Maniacs, and they started headlining their own shows.[3]
Virgin appeared to lose interest in the Wallflowers because of poor album sales. The band's two familiar label representatives left the label, after which the record company tried to use the Dylan name as a selling point, against the band's directive. In mid-1993, the label released the band from their contract.[3]Other labels were not interested in signing the band, and Jaffee filled his time by playing gigs withEl Vezas well as taking more session work. He kept his interest in the Wallflowers, saying later, "I believe in these songs, and I'm here for the duration because no one is writing songs like these anymore, songs that have room for a Hammond organ and me."[3]
The Wallflowers signed toInterscope Recordsin 1994. While working withT Bone Burnett, who was producing the band's next album, Jaffee was frequently called in as a session musician for producersPaul Fox,Matt Hydeand Rick Neigher.

At the same time, the Wallflowers released their second album,Bringing Down the Horse, which went quadruple Platinum.[3]The band toured in support of the album, but in 1997, Jaffee and his wife had a daughter, and he left the tour to be with his family for two months. That same year, he performed session work withEverclear,Grant Lee Buffalo,Richie Sambora,Macy Gray,Jeremy Toback,Joe Henry,Melissa Etheridge,Ramsay MidwoodandGarth Brooks.[3]
The Wallflowers received aGrammynomination in 1998 for "Heroes" which appeared in the filmGodzilla. In late 2000, the band releasedBreach. The band headlined their own tour for a year but also opened forTom Petty and the Heartbreakers,the WhoandJohn Mellencamp.[3]Following this, the Wallflowers releasedRed Letter Days, touring again during 2002–2003.[3]With a new drummer, the band releasedRebel, Sweetheart, their fifth album, on May 24, 2005. The Wallflowers toured to promote the album, but Jaffee disagreed with the band, and he abandoned the tour with three dates remaining.[4]
In 2005, Jaffee began collaborating withFoo Fighters. He was made an official member in 2017.[5]
Jaffee led the house band onThe Fran Drescher Showand, as of 2010, co-owned a recording studio called Fonogenic Studios in theSan Fernando Valley.[6]

Orville Willis Forte IV[3]was born inAlameda, California, on June 17, 1970.[4]The son of artist and former schoolteacher Patricia C. (néeStivers)[5][6]and financial broker Orville Willis "Reb" Forte III.[3]He grew up inMoragabefore moving toLafayetteat age 13.[7]He went by "Billy" in his early years until he was teased at school for it also being a girl's name. At that point he decided he would from then on be known as "Will".[8]Forte described himself as having been a "really happy little boy" whose parents were "wonderful" and created a "very loving environment".[9]He was interested in comedy from a young age, growing up idolizing comediansPeter Sellers,David Letterman, andSteve Martinas well as the sketch-comedy television seriesSaturday Night Live.[10]He often pulled pranks on his parents,[10]and would record himself performing imaginary radio shows. He did not aim to be a comedian, but initially wanted to become afootballplayer.[9]
Forte was "a laid-back teen with a lot of friends", and a member of the varsity football and swim teams atAcalanes High Schoolin Lafayette where he graduated in 1988. He was voted "Best Personality" by his graduating class and served as freshman class president.[8][11]He had no ambitions for a television or film career, though his mother noticed a "creative streak" in him. After high school, he attended theUniversity of California, Los Angeles, where he was a member of theLambda Chi Alphafraternity and completed a degree in history.[12]Forte wanted to become a financial broker like his father atSmith Barney Shearson, but felt "miserable" there.[8]He co-wrote a feature-length script while there,[9]and later said that he discovered he loved writing "more than anything [he] had ever done in [his] life".[8]He had been encouraged to attempt comedy during his years at university, and he decided to change his career path to do so.[13]
Forte began taking classes atThe GroundlingsinLos Angeles, animprovisationalandsketch comedytroupe and school, while tutoring children to make ends meet. His first successful foray into comedy was101 Things to Definitely Not Do If You Want to Get a Chick, acomic bookhe produced about incompetent men.[10]The comics landed him his first professional job writing forThe Jenny McCarthy Show, a short-livedvariety showstarringJenny McCarthy. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to submit a packet to theLate Show with David Lettermanand was told Letterman responded favorably to animation.[10]After only nine months atLetterman, he was "let go" from the job. He recalled his stint on the program as unpleasant, noting that he did not have enough experience in writing.[14]"What an honor to work at that show but I don't think I was fully mentally prepared. [...] I always wonder what it would be like if I'd had a couple more years of experience before going there."[15]
Forte left New York and returned to Los Angeles, where he began performing with the Groundlings' Main Company, withCheryl Hines,Jim Rash, andMaya Rudolph.[9]He triedstand-up comedythree times, mostly at open mic nights, but quit after being voted into the Main Company.[9]He joined the writing teams of two failed sitcoms, includingThe Army ShowandAction. Forte got jobs writing for3rd Rock from the SunandThat '70s Show. He loved writing and had mostly given up on acting, aside from acting with the Groundlings.[9]While performing with the troupe in 2001, he was spotted byLorne Michaels, the creator ofSaturday Night Live(SNL). Forte felt his confidence was higher than usual, asThat '70s Showhad been picked up for two more years.[9]He was invited to audition forSNL, which he regarded as unexpected.[14]
At his audition forSNL, he performed multiple original characters, includingTim Calhoun, a speed reader, a prison guard, in addition to impressions of singerMichael McDonaldand actorMartin Sheen.[9]His final character was an older piece from his days with the Groundlings, in which he portrays a gold-painted street performer who performsfellatioto pay for his face paint, which devolves into a song needlessly uttering the words "cock" and "face paint" dozens of times.[14]He felt his time to shine as a performer was already over, as he was in his thirties when he auditioned.[8]To his surprise, he was offered a chance to be on the show, but declined, opting instead for the financial stability of his work atThat '70s Show.[16]He felt working forSNLcould not live up to the idealized version he had dreamed of, but he later realized he would be making a mistake.[15][17]
AfterWill FerrellleftSaturday Night Livethe following spring, Forte joined the cast, premiering at the beginning of the show'stwenty-eighth seasonin the autumn. He was promoted to repertory player after his first year.[13]His early years on the program were characterized bystage frightand an inability to properly interpret sketches that he did not write himself.[17]He had to "re-learn" how to perform after years as a writer, and later felt his natural tendency to "overthink" things improved his performance.[15]He was particularly uncomfortable portraying PresidentGeorge W. Bush, as he felt he was not the best impressionist and it paled in comparison to Ferrell's impersonation of Bush.[18]His only role was often Bush, leaving him no chance for more "absurd" pieces he favored. He was nearly fired from the program following his third season (2004–05), but after two three-week extensions to decide his fate, he was brought back.[17]Forte estimated it took five seasons for him to feel fully comfortable performing on the show.[19]He made his film debut inAround the World in 80 Days.[20]
"I've always liked weirder stuff. My main thing onSNLwas that I was never gonna change my sensibility to get on TV—I was just gonna write what I liked writing and hopefully have a hit on that show somewhere."
His humor atSNLhas been described as bizarre,[14]and he became known for many "10-to-1" sketches—pieces that were considered odd, placed at the very end of the show. He was also well known for his charactersTim Calhoun,Greg Stink, andthe Falconer. Forte's favorite sketch on the show was one in which he played a motivational coach alongside football starPeyton Manning.[13]He also co-starred withAndy Sambergin the firstSNLDigital Short, "Lettuce". He often spent long hours crafting his sketches for the program, missing deadlines, but his pieces were usually received warmly attable reads.[16][17]During his time at the show, he co-starred in and wrote the 2007 filmThe Brothers Solomon. The film was originally a pilot forCarsey-Werner, and its creation was an extension of his agreement to terminate his contract to appear onSNL.[21]
Forte's best-known character onSNLwasMacGruber, aspecial operationsagent who is tasked in each episode with deactivating a ticking bomb but becomes distracted by personal issues. The sketches were based on the television seriesMacGyver. It was created by writerJorma Taccone, who relentlessly pitched the idea to Forte.[18]He was initially reluctant to commit to the sketch, deeming it too dumb, but accepted after persuasion from Taccone.[22]The first sketch aired in January 2007, and led to multiple more segments in the following years. In 2009, the sketches were spun off into a series of commercials sponsored byPepsipremiering duringSuper Bowl XLIIIwhich featured the actor behind MacGyver,Richard Dean Anderson, as MacGruber's father. The advertisements led the character and sketches to receive a wider level of popularity.[22]After the success of the advertisements, creatorLorne Michaelsapproached Forte, Taccone, and writer John Solomon with the idea to produce aMacGruberfilm.[23]
Regarding his experiences onSNL, Forte remarked, "Looking back, the experience is something I'll never forget. I still miss it, and I'll always miss it. That's my family."[19]His celebrity impressions includedGeorge W. Bush,Tom DeLay,John Edwards,Timothy Geithner,Newt Gingrich,Chad Lowe,Zell Miller,David Petraeus,Harry Reid,Brian Williams, andHu Jintao.[24]
In the summer of 2009,MacGruberwas shot on a tight schedule for four weeks inAlbuquerque, New Mexico.[22][25]It was written while simultaneously producing the weekly episode ofSNL, and the show'sproduction processleft the trio deprived of sleep.[26]Forte was positive regarding the film, saying,
What you see with this movie is exactly what we wanted to do. It's the three of us having a bunch of fun writing it, then having fun making it with a bunch of our friends—old friends and new friends. I think that fun comes across when you watch it. It's rare that you get that kind of creative freedom.[18]
The film was released in May 2010 and received mixed reviews.[27]It fared worse at the box office, where it failed to recoup its budget and was pulled from theaters after its third week.[28]Forte found the failure tolerable, commenting, "When you make something that you're really proud of and it doesn't do well, you can live with it."[17]The film has since seen more of a positive reception and has been dubbed acult classic.[29][30]
Forte leftSaturday Night Liveshortly before the beginning of the show'sthirty-sixth seasonin 2010. He felt it was the "right time to go", considering his eight-year tenure there, his expansion into film withMacGruber, and his age. In addition, his sister had just had children and he wanted to move to the West Coast to be closer to them.[13]He soon regretted the decision, calling the following year an "emotionally trying period", as he felt "devastated" that he would no longer be on the program.[10]He assumed his shot at a film career was ruined,[17]and he imagined that if acting did not work out, he would return to mostly writing.[10]Afterwards he entered what he has called a "lost period"[14]and had small supporting roles, such asRock of Ages,That's My Boy,andThe Watch, all of which were not successful.[14]The only commercial successful film which he worked on wasGrown Ups 2, where he made acameoas a male cheerleader.[14]He also took a role asPaul L'astnamé, the cross-dressing boyfriend ofJenna Maroneyon the critically acclaimed sitcom30 Rock.[14]
Forte took his first dramatic role for the 2013 filmRun & Jump. DirectorSteph Greenoffered him the part, and Forte imagined it a "fun thing to try", though he noted that she had more confidence in him than he had himself.[13]Later, he sent an audition tape toAlexander Paynefor a role in his next film,Nebraska.[13]He equated his casting in the film to his fear of joiningSNLa decade prior, noting that he was "terrified" to begin working on it.[14]He felt scared initially, but followedBruce Dern's acting advice to "look for the truth" in each scene—in other words, "In every scene, you're just trying to play it as honestly and as real as you can."[15]
Forte began working onThe Last Man on Earth, a sitcom, with longtime collaboratorsPhil Lord and Christopher Millerin 2013. Though it was the duo's idea, Forte attached himself to the concept, crafting atreatmentover a weekend. The series waspitchedaroundHollywoodto positive responses and was picked up in 2014 byFox.[31]Forte served as the series' creator, a writer, the lead role, and showrunner for the first season. He felt odd being in charge of its writing team (composed of longtime friends), and awkward at delegating tasks, so much so that he would end up doing the work himself.[15]Being a showrunner "truly was an amount of work I never knew existed," he said, which involved him working a "minimum of 12 hours" daily.[32]The series premiered in 2015 to positive responses,[33]and was renewed for the next three seasons.[34]
In 2016, Forte played Hulka, a low-level weed dealer, in the comedyKeanu, starringJordan PeeleandKeegan-Michael Key.[35]In 2018, he playedNational Lampoonmagazine co-founderDouglas Kenneyin theNetflixbiographical filmA Futile and Stupid Gesture.[36]The film was directed byDavid Wainand featuresDomhnall Gleesonas co-founderHenry Beard.[37]Forte voicedShaggy Rogersin theScooby-DoofilmScoob!.[38]In 2021, Forte starred inSweet Tooth, reprised his role as MacGruber in aTV seriesonPeacock, and began voicing Wolf Tobin in the animated sitcomThe Great North. In 2022, it was announced that Forte had a leading role for Disney and Pixar's first animated television seriesWin or Lose. It is set to premiere on Disney+ in 2025.[39]He voiced an older version of the titular character inScott Pilgrim Takes Off. In 2024, Forte was announced in the main role of Martin inSunny Nights.[40]
Forte dated hisLast Man on Earthco-starJanuary Jonesin 2015.[41]He and Olivia Modling were engaged in 2019; they met in 2018.[41]They have two daughters Zoe Douglas Forte, born in February 2021, and Cecilia, born approximately 18 months later.[42]He and Modling married on July 31, 2021.[43]They live in a modestly sized Craftsman home inSanta Monica, California. Forte bought the home in 2002, just two weeks before joining the cast ofSaturday Night Livewhich required him to move toNew York City. He admitted later that "it was not the greatest timing."[5]
Forte's mother, Patricia has visited every film set on which he has worked and made an appearance on aMother's Dayepisode ofSNL, in which he sang a song to her onWeekend Update. Will  officiated his sister Michelle's wedding; he filmed the birth of his niece and nephew.[44]
Will Forte has discussed and joked about hisOCDtendencies.[45][5]He recounted listening to only one song in his office atSNLfor an entire year because he wanted to challenge himself.[46]During an interview withLarry King, he discussed his OCD as a challenge he had to overcome but not one he wished he did not have, as it is a part of his personality.[47][48]In a February 2015 article onGrantlandthe writer of the article said that Forte mentioned OCD often but it was not clear if he had ever been formally diagnosed, though Forte related how he and a former girlfriend had gone through an OCD questionnaire and it concluded that Forte "should immediately talk to someone about this".[45]
Forte is an avid gamer. While filmingA Good Old-Fashioned Orgy, he achieved one of the world's highest scores on the arcade version ofDonkey Kong.[49]

Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
