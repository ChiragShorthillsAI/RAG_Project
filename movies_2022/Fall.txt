Fallis a 2022survivalpsychological thrillerfilm directed and co-written byScott Mannand Jonathan Frank. StarringGrace Caroline Currey,Virginia Gardner,Mason GoodingandJeffrey Dean Morgan, the film follows two women who climb a 2,000-foot-tall (610 m)television broadcasting tower, before becoming stranded at the top.
It was theatrically released in the United States on August 12, 2022 byLionsgate Films. The film was a box office success, grossing $21 million worldwide against a $3 million budget, and received generally positive reviews from critics;[2]Currey and Gardner's performances were particularly praised, with criticism for the film's visual effects and screenplay.
Best friends Becky and Hunter are climbing a mountain with Becky's husband Dan, who loses his footing and falls to his death. A year later, Becky has given up climbing and becomes an alcoholic recluse and contemplates suicide. She has estranged herself from her father, James, because he disapproved of her relationship with Dan. Just before the anniversary of Dan's death, Hunter invites Becky to climb the decommissioned 2,000-foot (610 m) B-67 TV Tower in the desert before it is demolished the following winter. Hunter tells Becky that she can scatter Dan's ashes from the top as a form of healing. A fearful and initially reluctant Becky accepts, hoping to finally move on from Dan's death.
The next day, Hunter and Becky arrive and successfully climb a severely corroded ladder to a tiny platform at the top of the tower, where Becky scatters Dan's ashes. As the two begin their descent, however, the ladder breaks, stranding them several hundred feet above the next intact section and almost two thousand feet above the ground. Even worse, the backpack with their water and a smallquadcopter dronehave fallen onto acommunications dish, just beyond the reach of their rope.
Despite the remote location, Hunter is initially confident that emergency services will notice the crash of the ladder, but help never arrives. They try to use their cellphones, but find thatradio interferencefrom the communications dish is blocking the signal. Hunter tries sending a message for help by packing her phone in one of her shoes and dropping it out of range of the interference, but the phone is destroyed upon impact with the ground before the message can be transmitted.
The pair later notice two men camping in an RV nearby and get their attention with aflare gunfound in an emergency box on the platform. The men see it, but instead of helping them, they steal Hunter's car and drive off.
As the night falls, Becky notices a tattoo on Hunter's ankle: "1-4-3", a numeric code Dan used to tell Becky that he loved her. Hunter tearfully admits to a four-month sexual affair that ended shortly before Becky and Dan's wedding. The next day, in penance, Hunter climbs to retrieve the backpack but nearly falls to her death. She injures her hands in the process, but successfully ties the rope to the bag, and Becky uses all of her remaining strength to pull both Hunter and the backpack up. Becky has a nightmare of a vulture eating off of Hunter’s dead body. Becky uses the tower'saviation obstruction lightingwarning light to charge the drone and sends it to a nearby motel a few miles away with a written message for help, but it is struck by a truck and destroyed while flying over a road.
At night, Becky isdeliriousfrom the lack of food and water, but in a brief lucid moment, when she asks Hunter for her other shoe to pad it with her phone inside, Becky learns Hunter had actually fallen onto one of the communication dishes when retrieving the backpack and was killed; Becky has been hallucinating her presence since then. The next day, Becky is awakened by a vulture gnawing at her wounded leg, and kills and eats it. Her strength partially restored, Becky climbs down to the dish where Hunter's body lies and types a text message to her father. She then puts the phone into Hunter's shoe for protection, shoves it into a hole that vultures had eaten in the corpse's abdomen, and pushes it off the tower. Hunter's body cushions the impact and the message transmits. Becky's father alerts emergency services, who then rush to the tower. She is rescued and reunited with her father.
Originally the film was intended as a short. According to director Scott Mann, the idea came to him while he was shootingFinal Scoreat a stadium in the UK: "We were filming at height, and off camera we got into this interesting conversation about height and the fear of falling and how that's inside of all of us, really, and how that can be a great device for a movie."Fallwas filmed inIMAXformat in theShadow Mountainsin California'sMojave Desert. The look of the fictitious B67 tower in the film was inspired by the realKXTV/KOVR tower, a radio tower inWalnut Grove, California, which is 2,049 feet (625 m) high and one of thetallest structures in the world.
According to director Scott Mann, the filmmakers considered green screen or digital sets, but ultimately opted for the real thing. They decided to build the upper portion of the tower on top of a mountain so that the actors would appear to be thousands of feet in the air, even though in real life they were never more than a hundred feet off the ground.[3]Currey and Gardner were offered stunt doubles, but they opted to perform their own stunts.[3][4]Filming was difficult, because often weather such as lightning and strong winds posed a challenge.[5][6]The film cost $3 million to produce.[7]
Although the film was produced by Tea Shop Productions and Capstone Pictures, once production finished,Lionsgate Filmsacquired the film's distribution rights without a minimum guarantee for the producers. After it did well in test screenings, Lionsgate decided to release it in theaters.[8]They ordered the crew to change or remove over 30 uses of the word "fuck" from the film so it could earn aPG-13 ratingfrom theMotion Picture Associationinstead of a likelyR rating, to increase profitability.
As reshooting the scenes would have been time-consuming and expensive, they turned to Flawless, a company established in 2021 by Nick Lynes andFalldirectorScott Mann, todeepfakethe actor's faces andartificially redubthe "fucks" they said to PG-13-acceptable epithets like "freaking." The first project to use Flawless's services,Falldid earn a PG-13 rating. According to Mann, "neural reshoots" were completed within two weeks during the final stages of post-production.[7][9]This method was also applied to foreign language dubbing for overseas distribution including Spanish and Japanese.[10]
The film was released in theaters in the United States on August 12, 2022 by Lionsgate,[11]who spent $4 million releasing and promoting the film.[8]
It was released digitally on September 27, 2022, followed byBlu-rayandDVDreleases on October 18, 2022.[12]
Fallgrossed $7.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $14.6 million in other territories, for worldwide total of $21.8 million,[13]against its $3 million budget.[7]
In the United States and Canada,Fallwas released alongsideMack & Ritaand the wide expansion ofBodies Bodies Bodies, and projected to gross $1–2 million from 1,548 theaters on its opening weekend.[14]It made $923,000 on its first day,[15]and went on to debut to $2.5 million. While finishing 10th at the box office, it was the highest-earning new release for the week.[16]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 79% of 149 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "Fundamentally absurd yet as evocatively minimalist as its title,Fallis a sustained adrenaline rush for viewers willing to suspend disbelief."[17]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 62 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[18]Audiences surveyed byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an overall 69% positive score, with 44% saying they would definitely recommend it.[16]
Following the popularity of the film's Netflix release, a sequel was announced to be in development in March 2023.[19][20][21]In October 2023, it was revealed that two sequels were concurrently in development, while the associated studios viewedFallas a franchise. Scott Mann will serve as producer on both movies, while also serving as co-writer and director of the third movie. The two sequels will feature returning characters from the first installment and a new supporting cast as well. Mark Lane, James Harris, Christian Mercuri, and David Haring will serve as additional producers. The projects will be joint-venture productions between Tea Shop Productions,  Flawless Productions Inc., and Capstone Pictures. Principal photography is scheduled to commence on the second movie in June 2024.[22][23]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
