A third Smile film is currently in development.
At a psychiatric ward inNewark, New Jersey, therapist Rose Cotter meets graduate student Laura Weaver,[a]who explains that she recently witnessed her professor kill himself. Laura claims to be terrorized by an invisible Entity that only she can see that appears as various smiling people and has foretold her death. She begins screaming and choking, prompting Rose to call for help; Laura suddenly calms down and smiles uncannily, then fatally slits her own throat, terrifying Rose.
The next day, Rose sees a patient named Carl, who smiles in the same way and tells her that she is going to die. Rose calls for nurses to restrain Carl, only to realize Carl has been asleep the entire time. Concerned for Rose's mental well-being, her supervisor, Morgan, orders Rose to take a week off. Rose's hallucinations continue, leading those around her to believe she may be a danger to herself. Rose visits her former therapist Madeline, who suggests that Rose's problems stem from her childhood, in which she witnessed her abusive and mentally ill mother die from overdose.
Rose sees a toy train and buys it as a birthday present for her nephew, Jackson, the son of her older sister, Holly. At the party, he unwraps her present to find the corpse of Mustache, Rose's cat, horrifying everyone. Rose has a public breakdown and sees a guest smiling unnaturally at her, causing her to fall into a glass coffee table and injure herself. This convinces Rose that she has fallen victim to a curse, although her fiancé Trevor believes she has gone crazy.
Upon learning that Laura's professor was smiling at her before his death, Rose visits the professor's widow, Victoria, and learns that he had also witnessed a suicide shortly before his own. Rose asks her ex-boyfriend Joel, a police detective, to review old police records. They find several cases of people who witnessed someone commit suicide while smiling at them before doing the same to themselves within a week.
Rose tries to patch things up with Trevor but realizes he has called on Madeline for psychological intervention without asking her first. Upset, she leaves to speak with Holly, who also dismisses Rose's belief in a curse. Holly compares Rose's behavior to their late mother, and Rose accuses Holly of abandoning her before their mother's death.
Rose and Joel discover the sole exception in the chain of suicides: convicted murderer Robert Talley. Rose and Joel visit him in prison, where he claims that the Entity feeds ontraumaand that the only way to escape it is to brutally kill someone else in front of a witness to traumatize them, passing the curse to the witness. Rose angrily rejects this idea, after which a terrified Robert yells at her to leave when he realizes that Rose is the one who is cursed. Later, Madeline visits Rose for a therapy session, only to reveal herself as the Entity in disguise when the real Madeline calls. Rose drives to her hospital with a knife and murders Carl in front of Morgan, but this is revealed to be a hallucination. Rose wakes up in her car to find Morgan standing outside. He notices the knife, but she speeds away, prompting him to alert the police.
Rose drives to her abandoned family home, realizing the Entity's curse ends with her if she dies alone. The Entity appears as Rose's mother, and it is revealed that Rose could have saved her mother but chose not to. The Entity attacks Rose, and a fire starts during the struggle, seemingly killing the Entity. Rose flees the house and returns to Joel's apartment. Joel smiles at Rose, who realizes this is another hallucination.
In reality, Joel has tracked Rose's phone to her old house and finds her outside. Rose panics and runs back inside, where the Entity reveals its true form: a skinless, semi-humanoid monstrosity with multiple sets of malformed jaws nesting within an enormous, smiling mouth. The sight of the Entity's visage causes Rose to fall into a trance, and the Entity possesses her. Joel breaks down the front door and witnesses a smiling Roseset herself on fire, passing the curse on to him.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 79% based on 195 reviews, and an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "Deeply creepy visuals and a standout Sosie Bacon further elevateSmile's unsettling exploration of trauma, adding up to the rare feature that satisfyingly expands on a short."[31]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[32]Audiences surveyed byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled atPostTrakgave it an overall 69% positive score, with 53% saying they would definitely recommend it.[27]
Marisa Mirabal ofIndieWiregave the film a grade of B−, noting its plot's similarities to films such asIt Follows,The Ring,OculusandFinal Destination. She wrote: "Smilenavigates unhealed trauma through a supernatural lens and mischievous juxtaposition, despite feeling like a shadow of other stories", and added that it "delivers a captivating and claustrophobic mental hellscape that will cause one to both grimace and grin."[33]Tasha Robinson ofPolygonwrote: "Smileis often a gimmicky, even corny horror movie, packed with so many jump-scares that the sheer pile-on borders on laughable... But no matter how excessively the legitimate scares pile up, they're startling and convincing. The editing and music are impressively tuned for maximum impact whenever the slow-burning tension resolves with an abrupt, ugly surprise. All of which makesSmilean efficient ride, if an unusually unrelenting one."[34]
Katie Rife ofRogerEbert.comgave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, writing: "In padding out the concept from an 11-minute short into a nearly two-hour movie,Smileleans too heavily not only on formulaic mystery plotting, but also on horror themes and imagery lifted from popular hits likeThe RingandIt Follows."[35]Kevin MaherofThe Timeswrote: "There are some nice jump scares and Bacon is charismatic but it's achingly derivative and dull", and gave the film 2 out of 5 stars.[36]Jeffrey M. Anderson ofCommon Sense Mediaalso gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, writing: "The image of a creepy, sinister smile is so primal and so chilling that it might have inspired something truly penetrating, but, sadly, this horror movie is content to fall back on noisyjump scares."[37]
At the2023 MTV Movie & TV Awards,Smilewas nominated forBest MovieandMost Frightened Performance(Bacon).[38]At the51st Saturn Awards, the film was nominatedBest Horror Film.[39]
Laura Hasn't Sleptwas written and directed byParker Finnin 2019, and later debuted atSouth by Southwestin 2020. The positive reception at the film festival resulted inParamount Picturescommissioning the filmmaker for a feature film adaptation,[40]though it was later revealed that the movie is a continuation of the original story.[41][42][43]
The premise follows Laura as she recounts to her therapist a series of horrific dreams and hallucinations where she is being pursued by a smiling man. As she does so, she begins to realize that she is not where she thinks she is, that she is again experiencing an extrasensory episode, and that the counselor she is confiding in is actually the entity that has been tormenting her.[40]While the ending of the short film seems to indicate that the character dies, Laura later appears inSmilewhere she seeks the help of Dr. Rose Cotter; indicating that the resolution toLaura Hasn't Sleptwas a continued hallucination. The character ultimately sets in motion the events of the full-length film.[41][42][43]
The short movie later received a wide release as a bonus feature on the home video media release ofSmile; Paramount marketed the feature as a "Smileoriginal short film".[44]Finn additionally called the short "the origin" ofSmile.[41][45]
Following the release ofSmile, during interviews between November and December 2022, writer and director Parker Finn stated that he had intentionally left portions of the first movie ambiguous, with various plotlines unresolved, while expressing interest in exploring those details in a potential sequel film.[19]The filmmaker stated that while additional installments may explore the backstory of the entity, he would like to keep its mysterious nature intact.[43]He noted that a follow-up movie would be notably different from the first, stating that he believed "there is still a lot of interesting stuff to explore in the world ofSmile. ...I'd want to make sure that there's a new, exciting, fresh way into it that the audience isn't anticipating. I also want to find some new ways to scare them and unnerve them."[19][43][46]
In April 2023, Paramount Pictures officially announced at CinemaCon 2023 that a sequel had beengreen-litand was inpre-production, with Parker Finn once again serving as writer and director.[47]In December 2023,Naomi Scottwas cast in the leading role.[48]In January 2024,Lukas Gagewas added to the cast of the sequel.[49]Kyle Gallner reprised his role as Joel withRosemarie DeWittalso joining.[50]Smile 2was released on October 18, 2024.[51]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
