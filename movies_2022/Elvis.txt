It starsAustin ButlerandTom Hanksas Presley and Parker, respectively, withOlivia DeJonge,Helen Thomson,Richard Roxburgh,David Wenham,Kodi Smit-McPhee, andLuke Braceyin supporting roles.
A biographical film aboutElvis Presleywas first announced in 
2014, with Luhrmann set to direct. However, the project languished indevelopment helluntil early 2019, when Hanks joined the film. Butler was cast in the title role that July, beating out several other actors includingMiles TellerandHarry Styles. Filming began in Australia in January 2020 but was put on hiatus in March after Hanks tested positive forCOVID-19at the onset of thepandemic. Production resumed in September, wrapping in March 2021.
Elvispremiered at theCannes Film Festivalon May 25, 2022, and was released in Australia on June 23 and in the United States on June 24, byWarner Bros. Pictures. It was a commercial success, grossing over $288 million worldwide against an $85 million budget. It also received generally positive reviews from critics, with Butler's performance garnering widespread critical acclaim. TheAmerican Film InstitutenamedElvisone of the top-ten films of 2022.Elvisreceived eight nominations at the95th Academy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Actorfor Butler, amongnumerous other accolades. A stage adaptation, with Luhrmann attached as a producer, is in development.[8]
Raised mostly by his doting mother Gladys,Elvis Presleyspends his childhood in the slums ofTupelo, Mississippi, finding solace in music and comic books. After moving with his parents toMemphis, Tennessee, he is ridiculed by his peers due to his fascination with the African-American music ofBeale Street.Colonel Tom Parker, at the time a carnivalhuckster, manages country singerHank Snowbut realizes Elvis'crossoverpotential when he hears "That's All Right," initially assuming that the artist is black. That night, after witnessing hisintense sex appealat a "Louisiana Hayride" performance, Parker invites Elvis to accompany him on a tour and convinces Elvis to let him take control of his career, which begins Elvis' meteoric ascent: he moves fromSun RecordstoRCA Records, his father Vernon is appointed as business manager ofElvis Presley Enterprises, and the family is lifted out of poverty.
The regional public is polarized on Elvis. Feeling that his music will corrupt white children and stoke racial hostility,segregationistSouthern Democrat Mississippi SenatorJames Eastlandcalls Parker to an informal hearing and probes his mysterious past. When Elvis flouts the authorities' warnings and performs suggestive dance moves at a concert, he faces legal trouble. Parker persuades the government todraftElvis into theArmyinstead of penalizing him. Elvis returns frombasic trainingonly to be devastated by his mother's death from drinking. Duringhis military serviceinWest Germany, he meets 14-year-oldPriscilla Beaulieu, the daughter of anAir Forcepilot. After his discharge, he embarks on afilm careerand later marries Priscilla.
As the popular culture of the 1960s passes Elvis by, the assassinations ofMartin Luther King Jr.andRobert F. Kennedyin 1968 devastate him. Although he wants to become more politically outspoken in his music, Parker has booked a family-friendlyChristmas television specialwhere he will only perform frivolous feel-good songs. Elvis works withSteve Binderto re-imagine the special, and his performance, including the closing song "If I Can Dream," incorporates not only a review of his past songs but also political commentary. Corporate sponsors threaten litigation, enraging Parker; however, the show is highly successful.
Afterward, Elvis headlines at the largest showroom in Las Vegas in theInternational Hotel, and resumes concert tours. Parker's control of Elvis' life tightens as he refuses his request for a world tour. Motivated by gambling debts, Parker manipulates Elvis into signing a contract for a five-year Las Vegas casino residency. Elvis' problematic behavior and prescription drug addiction overtakes him, and a despondent Priscilla divorces him on his 38th birthday, taking their daughterLisa Mariewith her. After discovering that Parker cannot leave the country because he is astatelessillegal immigrant, Elvis attempts to fire him. Parker subsequently informs Vernon that the family owes him an $8.5 million debt accumulated over the years and convinces Elvis of their symbiotic relationship; though they became distant afterward, Parker continues as his manager.
Increasingly exhausted after a continuously rigorous schedule of shows, Elvis expresses to Priscilla his fear of being forgotten after death, as he believes he has achieved nothing worthwhile. On June 21, 1977, inRapid City, South Dakota,[9]an obese, pale, and weak Elvis sings "Unchained Melody" to thunderous applause. He dies shortly thereafter, on August 16, 1977; Parker claims what really killed Elvis was neither his heart attack nor drug-related suicide as some believe, but rather his love for his fans. A series of lawsuits in the 1980s exposes Parker's financial abuse of Elvis, with Parker settling out of court and cutting his ties to the Presley estate after failing to claim immunity as a stateless person. Having gambled away the rest of his ill-gotten fortune, Parker becomes poor, and on January 20, 1997, is rushed for a heart attack to a hospital in Las Vegas, where he dies. Elvis remainsthe best-selling solo artist in history, beloved by millions worldwide even decades after his death.

On June 12, 2022, Luhrmann revealed that when Presley sings in the film, it is Butler's vocals that are used when he is young.

The first three-minute trailer for the film premiered duringNBC's live coverage of the2022 Winter Olympicson February 17, 2022, and was uploaded online the same day.[44][45][46]Nick Relly ofRolling Stonestated "The trailer opens with a foreboding voiceover from Hanks's Parker, in which he acknowledges that he is considered the "villain of this here story"—owing to the widespread belief that Parker's interest in Elvis was mainly financially motivated. From there, we're given a look at some of Elvis' most electrifying early performances, with Butler bearing an uncanny resemblance to the King himself."[47]Sasha Urban ofVarietyand Rania Aniftos ofBillboardpraised Butler's performance as he "uncannily resembled Presley".[48][49]The second trailer premiered online on May 23, 2022, two days before the film's world premiere at the2022 Cannes Film Festival.[50]James White of Empire stated "With typical Luhrmann swagger and style, this could be a good fit of filmmaker and subject".[51]Screen Rant-based Adam Bentz stated "The trailer highlights how the biopic spans a period of over twenty years and chronicles both the singer's opulent rise to stardom and eventual fall from grace."[52]
In a May 2022 interview with Sotheby's, Luhrmann refuted the label of "biopic" to describe the film: "As it turns out, I've just made a film calledElviswhich isn't even really about Elvis. It's really about American in the fifties, sixties, and seventies."[53]NMEmagazine dedicated a standalone free-print issue of 36 pages, covering Presley's life, interviews with Butler, Luhrmann and other cast members.[54]A special Elvis-inspired shoot with artistsWalliceand Master Peace, musical guide to 10 tracks from Presley and the city ofMemphisand the magazine's interview with Presley in 1960 (from the archives).[55]The magazine issues were made available digitally and through physical prints in stores on June 16, 2022.[55]AnABCspecial,Exclusively Elvis: A Special Edition of20/20, featuring a look at Presley's real-life and the making of the film, aired on June 21, 2022, to promote the film.[56]AMC Theatres, in collaboration with Feverup, announced a pre-sale special where viewers could purchase tickets to the film for $10.99.[57]The final trailer was released online on June 22, 2022.[58]
Elviswas released in cinemas in Australia on June 23, 2022, and in the United States on June 24, byWarner Bros.

Pictures to debut its entire 2021 slate concurrently in movie theatres and onHBO Max, before the film was officially pushed to 2022.[63]
The film became eligible to be made available on HBO Max andpremium video on demand(PVOD) on August 8, 2022, 45 days after its theatrical release, under a plan announced byWarnerMediain 2021.[64]However,IndieWirereported shortly before that date that the mergedWarner Bros. Discoveryhad decided to instead releaseElvissolely to PVOD on August 9 and to Blu-ray/DVD on September 13 with HBO Max availability likely to follow in the fall.[65]The film became available for streaming exclusively on HBO Max on September 2, followed by the HBO network premiere on September 3.
The film had its world premiere at the2022 Cannes Film Festivalon May 25, 2022, where it received a twelve-minute standing ovation from the audience, the longest for an Australian film at the festival and tying withHirokazu Kore-eda'sBrokerfor the longest overall.[66][67][68]It also opened theGuadalajara International Film FestivalinMexicoon June 10[69]and at theSydney Film Festivalin Australia on June 15.[70]
Following the film's reception of its eight Oscar nominations, Warner Bros. announced its return to theaters for a limited engagement starting on January 27, 2023.[71]
In June 2022, Luhrmann revealed that he had originally planned a four-hour cut of the film which notably contains scenes of Presley with his first girlfriend, Dixie, and his meeting with PresidentRichard Nixonin 1970, sequences that he was sorry to leave out of the theatrically-released cut.[72]
In September 2022, Luhrmann commented on the possibility that the four-hour cut could see the light of day.[73]
In November 2022, Luhrmann re-ignited interest in the four-hour cut, stating he wanted to cut together a sequence of Austin Butler performing as Presley in an uninterrupted full concert (as many of Butler's individual performances were interspersed throughout the theatrically-released cut). According to Luhrmann, this concert version would be a "director's assembly," not a full version of the film, with the material still needing to be edited and worked on.[74]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 77% of 398 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's consensus reads: "The standard rock biopic formula gets all shook up inElvis, with Baz Luhrmann's dazzling energy and style perfectly complemented by Austin Butler's outstanding lead performance."[88]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[89]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakgave the film an 88% overall positive score, with 72% saying they would definitely recommend it.[79]
Butler's portrayal of Presley was widely acclaimed.Justin Changof theLos Angeles Timesdescribed Butler as "a decent physical match for Elvis and a better one vocally."[90]David Rooney wrote forThe Hollywood Reporterthat Butler "captures the tragic paradox of a phenomenal success story who clings tenaciously to theAmerican Dreameven as it keeps crumbling in his hands."[91]Clarisse Loughrey ofThe Independentwrote that he "makes a compelling argument for the power of Elvis, at a time when the musician's arguably lost a little of his cultural cachet."[92][93]
On the film itself,Robbie CollinofThe Telegraphgave it four out of five stars, calling it "a bright and splashy jukebox epic," but that "it veers in and out of fashion on a scene-by-scene basis: it's the most impeccably styled and blaringly gaudy thing you'll see all year, and all the more fun for it."[94]Kevin Maher ofThe Timescalled it Luhrmann's "best film sinceRomeo + Juliet... The power in the musical numbers is drawn from Butler's turn but also from Luhrmann, who edits with the kind of frenetic rhythms that are almost impossible to resist (feet will tap) ... They are the spine-tingling highlights that make the entire project a must-see movie."[95][96]Jim Vejvoda ofIGNcalled it "a dizzying and at times even overwhelming chronicle of the rock icon."[97]Owen GleibermanofVarietycalled it "A fizzy, delirious, impishly energized, compulsively watchable 2-hour-and-39-minute fever dream – a spangly pinwheel of a movie that converts the Elvis saga we all carry around in our heads into a lavishly staged biopic-as-pop-opera."[98]Joshua Rothkopf wrote forEntertainment Weeklythat it "delivers the icon like never before" and that Luhrmann recaptured "hisMoulin Rouge!mojo with a hip-swiveling profile loaded with risk and reward." He went on to praise Butler's performance, saying that he "stares down the lens and melts it."[99]
Manohla DargisofThe New York Times, while praising the visuals and Butler's performance, felt mixed about the film being told from Colonel Tom Parker's perspective, saying "I would have loved to have listened in on Luhrmann and Hanks's conversations about their ideas for the character; if nothing else, it might have explained what in the world they were after here. I honestly haven't a clue, although the image ofSydney Greenstreetlooming menacingly inThe Maltese Falconrepeatedly came to mind, with a dash ofHogan's Heroes."[100]In a review forIndieWire, David Ehrlich wrote that it "finds so little reason for Presley's life to be the stuff of a Baz Luhrmann movie that the equation ultimately inverts itself, leaving us with an Elvis Presley movie about Baz Luhrmann. They both deserve better." He also criticized Hanks's portrayal of Parker, calling it "a 'true true' performance defined by a fat suit, a fake nose, and an accent that I can only describe as the 'Kentucky FriedGoldmember'."[101]On a historical note, journalistAlanna Nash, who had written an acclaimed biography of Parker in 2010, called the film a "Baz Luhrmann fever dream" that kept the liberties with history fair except to Parker, citing that Luhrmann's approach of presenting it through a present-day lens meant that the complicated character researched by Nash of Parker is simplified.[102]
FilmmakersGuillermo del ToroandMax Hechtmanboth praised the film, with del Toro saying "Austin Butler and Baz showcase Elvis’ world shaking, transformative talent, his joy, his soul, his sadness — actor and director working in tandem to re-embrace and re-energize the power and danger that Elvis possessed."[103][104]
Prior to its world premiere at theCannes Film Festival,Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis's daughter, praised the film in anInstagrampost after seeing it twice, and she went on to give her thoughts on Butler's performance as her late father, stating that he "channeled and embodied my father's heart and soul beautifully. In my humble opinion, his performance is unprecedented and FINALLY done accurately and respectfully", while touting Butler as a frontrunner for theAcademy Award for Best Actor. Regarding Luhrmann's directing, she wrote that:
You can feel his pure love, care, and respect for my father throughout this beautiful film, and it is finally something that myself and my children and their children can be proud of forever ... your utter genius combined with your love and respect for my father and this project is just so beautiful and so inspiring. I know I'm being repetitive, but I don't care, Thank you for setting the record straight in such a deeply profound and artistic way.
She added that watching the film reminded her of her own son, Benjamin, who died by suicide in 2020, saying he would have loved it as well.[105][106]
On January 10, 2023, Lisa Marie appeared at the80th Golden Globe Awardsin support of Butler's win forBest Actor – Motion Picture Drama; it was her last public appearance before her death two days later.[107]
Presley's ex-wife,Priscilla, gave her thoughts on the film, saying in full:
For those curious about the new filmELVIS, Baz Luhrmann, the director, provided a private screening for me and Jerry Schilling at Warner studios recently. This story is about Elvis and Colonel Parker's relationship. It is a true story told brilliantly and creatively that only Baz, in his unique artistic way, could have delivered. Austin Butler, who played Elvis is outstanding. Halfway through the film, Jerry and I looked at each other and said WOW!!! Bravo to him... he knew he had big shoes to fill. He was extremely nervous playing this part. I can only imagine. Tom Hanks was Col Parker in this film. What a character he was. There was two sides to Colonel, Jerry and I witnessed both. The story, as we all know, does not have a happy ending. But I think you will understand a little bit more of Elvis's journey, penned by a director who put his heart and soul and many hours into this film.[108]
In an interview withTodayon August 16, 2022, Priscilla defended parts of the film's portrayal of Elvis and Parker's tense relationship, stating, "I lived the arguments that they had, I lived Elvis trying to explain he didn't want to do the movies with all the girls and the beaches and everything, that he really wanted to do serious things. So living that, with him, and watching the movie, it brought back a lot of memories."[109]On May 21, 2022, Presley's granddaughter, actress and filmmakerRiley Keough, shared her response after viewing the film at Cannes, saying in full:
It was a very emotional experience. It's very intense to watch when it's your family. The first movie I ever watched in the theater and said I wanted to make movies wasMoulin Rouge!, I was 12. It was a real honor to know Baz was doing this movie.Romeo + JulietandMoulin Rouge!, for the age I was at the time, were really powerful. It wasn't like I distrusted Baz in any way, but you're protective over your family. At the end of the day, we're not going to tell Baz Luhrmann how to make a movie. In the first five minutes, I could feel how much work Baz and Austin put into trying to get it right. That made me emotional immediately. I started crying five minutes in and didn't stop. There's a lot of family trauma and generational trauma that started around then for our family. I felt honored they worked so hard to really get his essence, to feel his essence. Austin captured that so beautifully.[110][111]
At the95th Academy Awards,Elviswas nominated forBest Picture,Best Actor,Best Sound,Best Production Design,Best Cinematography,Best Makeup and Hairstyling,Best Costume Design, andBest Film Editing.[112]The film's other nominations include nineBritish Academy Film Awards(winning four),[113]sevenCritics' Choice Movie Awards(winning one),[114]and threeGolden Globe Awards(winning one).[115]TheAmerican Film InstitutenamedElvisone of the top-ten films of 2022.[116]
Elvis was indeed influenced bybluesandR&B, but the movie downplayed thecroonerandcountryinfluences on his music.[117][118]

In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros.

In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]

After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]

Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
