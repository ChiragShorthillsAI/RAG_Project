On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 12% of 17 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 2.3/10.[9]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 30 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[10]
Nadir Samara ofScreen Rantgave the film two stars out of five, and said: "ThoughMeasure of Revengeis not an excellent film, it does have some flare. […] The script is far from perfect but if one squints, there is occasional fun to be had."[11]John Anderson ofThe Wall Street Journalcommented that it "moves with too much trepidation—or too much style, one might say—for a convincing urban thriller. Director Peyfa's oblique approach to the narrative leads one astray."[12]Michael Nordine ofVarietycalled the film "a mess from start to finish" and wrote that Leo "does her utmost to make it work, but there's simply nothing here to save." Nordine criticized it for "the washed-out, smartphone-esque cinematography and incoherent screenplay, neither of which are done any favors by a series of jarring edits."[13]John Serba ofDecideropined that "Measure of Revengeis likeDeath Wishif it sucked and didn't always make sense" and "Leo normally is the type of actress who can find at least a nugget of credibility in a bad movie, but the odds are really stacked against her here."[14]Alex Saveliev ofFilm Threatwrote that the film "stuffs a lot into a 90-minute narrative, and the strain shows. The plot lurches from one awkwardly-staged, heavy-handed, poorly-lit, bathed in eye-scorching soft-focus sequence to another with little regard for tonal shifts or narrative fluidity." Saveliev concluded by stating: "For a film that deals with a mother's child passing,Measure of Revengeis depressing for all the wrong reasons. […] Maybe it's best for Peyfa to remain in the shadows for a while. The cinematic world may not be for him."[15]Martha K. Baker ofKDHXradio, was positive about the film, praising it for "masterful use of flashbacks, in particular scenes from Lillian's famous roles, inThe Scarlet LetterandHamlet, for example, with allusions to literature that includeEdgar Allan Poe. Lines from the plays spider in and out of Lillian's mind. "Measure of Revenge" almost demands a second viewing to catch all the lines and allusions."[16]

She has an older brother, Erik Leo.[4]Her paternal aunt is art historianChristine Leo Roussel.[5]Leo's parents divorced, and her mother moved them to Red Clover Commune, inPutney, Vermont.[2]
Leo began performing as a child with theBread and Puppet TheaterCompany. She attendedBellows Falls High SchoolinBellows Falls, Vermont, and studied acting atMountview Academy of Theatre Artsin London andSUNY Purchase, but did not graduate, choosing to leave school and move to New York City to begin auditioning for acting jobs.[6][7][8][9]Leo spent summers at her father's house in Springs, a section ofEast Hampton, New York.[3][10]
Leo's acting debut came in 1984, for which she was nominated for aDaytime Emmyat the12th Daytime Emmy Awardsfor Outstanding Ingenue/Woman in a Drama Series forAll My Children. Following this, Leo appeared in several films, includingStreetwalkin',A Time of Destiny,Last Summer in the Hamptons, andVenice/Venice.She also had several appearances on television, most notably her role asDet. Sgt. Kay HowardonHomicide: Life on the Streetuntil 1997. Three years later she reprised her role in the television filmHomicide: The Movie. After a brief hiatus from acting, Leo's breakthrough came three years later in theAlejandro González Iñárritufilm,21 Gramsreleased to critical acclaim. Leo appeared in a supporting role alongsideSean Penn,Naomi Watts,Benicio del Toro, andClea DuVall. Leo shared a Best Ensemble Acting award from the Phoenix Film Critics Society in 2003 and the runner-up for theLos Angeles Film Critics Associationfor Best Supporting Actress.

That same year, Leo earned critical praise for her performance in the filmFrozen River, winning several awards, including the Best Actress award from theIndependent Spirit Awards, the Spotlight award from theNational Board of Review, and Best Actress nominations from theScreen Actors Guild Awards,Broadcast Film Critics Association, andAcademy Awards. CriticRoger Ebertbacked her for a win, stating: "Best Actress: Melissa Leo. What a complete performance, evoking a woman's life in a time of economic hardship. The most timely of films, but that isn't reason enough. I was struck by how intensely determined she was to make the payments, support her two children, carry on after her abandonment by a gambling husband, and still maintain rules and goals around the house. This was a heroic woman."[11]
FollowingFrozen River, Leo continued to appear in several independent films, and had a minor role in the 2008 filmRighteous Kill, withAl Pacinoand herHide and Seekco-star,Robert De Niro. Leo appeared in a series of films throughout 2009, includingAccording to Greta, the title character inStephanie's Image,True Adolescents, andVeronika Decides to Die.
In 2010, Leo received fame for her role inDavid O. Russell'sThe Fighter. Rick Bentley ofThe Charlotte Observersaid: "Both actors (Mark WahlbergandChristian Bale) are very good, but they get blown off the screen by Melissa Leo, who plays their mother, Alice Ward. Leo's Oscar-worthy portrayal of Alice as a master manipulator goes beyond acting to a total transformation."[12]Roger Ebertreferred to it as a "teeth-gratingly brilliant performance." Leo and several of the film's actors including her co-starAmy Adamsand Bale were nominated. For her performance Leo received several awards, including theGolden Globe,Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association,New York Film Critics Circle,Screen Actors Guild, and culminating in her winning theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actress. While accepting her Oscar, Leo said: "When I watchedKatetwo years ago, it looked so fucking easy!" She apologized afterwards for using profanity, admitting that it was "a very inappropriate place to use that particular word ... those words, I apologize to anyone that they offend".[13][14]
Prior to her win, Leo had created some controversy by attempting to self-promote her Oscar campaign, rather than rely on the marketing department of the studio. Leo personally bought ad space in Hollywood trade publications, which was initially thought might backfire in a similar manner to previous Oscar contendersChill WillsandMargaret Avery.[15]
Following her Oscar win, Leo appeared in theHBOminiseriesMildred PiercealongsideKate Winslet,Evan Rachel WoodandGuy Pearce. Her performance garnered anEmmy Awardnomination forOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.

She moved out of the city during the COVID-19 pandemic, but returned in 2023.[19]
Leo publicly rejected the label of feminist in statements made during a 2012 interview withSalon: "I don't think of myself as a feminist at all. As soon as we start labeling and categorizing ourselves and others, that's going to shut down the world. I would never say that."[20]She reiterated these sentiments in a 2017 interview.[21]

The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
