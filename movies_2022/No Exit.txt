Recovering addict Darby Thorne learns that her mother is in the hospital after suffering a brain aneurysm, and is undergoing emergency surgery. Her sister, Devon, warns her not to attempt to visit due to the strain her drug abuse has put on the family. Undeterred, she escapes rehab and attempts to drive toSalt Lake City. While stopped in the middle of the road, Darby is approached by local officer, Corporal Ron Hill, who tells her that the interstate is closed because of a developing blizzard and she must either turn back or stay at a local visitors center to wait out the storm. She agrees to stay at the visitors center with the only people inside being Ash, Lars, and a married couple, Ed and Sandi. Desperate to contact her family, Darby goes outside to find a cellphone signal and ends up discovering a kidnapped girl in a van belonging to one of the people inside.
Unable to determine who the kidnapper is, Darby returns inside while coming up with a plan. She attempts to send a text message to the police with details about the kidnapping, but is unsuccessful due to poor signal. Playing a round ofBullshitto pass the time, Darby uses her knowledge of the van's license plate to question the others about where they are from and heading to, ultimately deducing that Lars is the kidnapper. Sneaking through a damaged wall in a bathroom which is currently under construction, Darby returns to the van. Darby breaks in and talks to the girl, promising to save her. Unaware of her presence, Lars enters the van and reveals the girl's name to be Jay. It is revealed that Jay has a medical alert bracelet forAddison's disease, a rare condition which can cause an adrenaline overdose if the sufferer becomes too stressed. Inside, Ed grows suspicious of Lars' strange behavior. As Lars exits the van to retrieve food for Jay, Darby sneaks back inside the cabin through the hole in the wall.
In the bathroom, Darby runs into Ash, whom she tells about Jay and the kidnapping. Ash agrees to help her and modifies a nail gun found amongst the construction to fire without a safety. When Darby goes outside, however, Jay reveals that Ash and Lars are both accomplices in the kidnapping. Ash takes Darby back inside and threatens to kill her if she informs Ed or Sandi about Jay. He also confiscates her phone and deletes the unsent messages to the police. Outside, Jay cuts herself free and runs into the woods nearby. In the bathroom, Darby attacks Ash with a hammer, but he gains the upper hand. Lars returns through the hole in the wall and stops Ash from strangling Darby. In the struggle, Darby takes Ash's keys.
Ash and Lars force Darby to help them look for Jay. Ash reveals that they are transporting her to their "Uncle Kenny", who runs ahuman traffickingring, while Lars ignorantly believes it to be "finding them better homes". Darby uses a flashlight to blind the kidnappers and runs away. Ash fires his gun, alerting Ed and Sandi. Ed and Sandi rush outside to find Jay unconscious in the snow. Darby returns and tells Ed and Sandi about the kidnappers. After locking the entrance, Ed negotiates with Ash and Lars, bluffing that he too has a gun. He offers  to give them the car keys in exchange for the medicine Jay needs to survive. As Darby hides the keys in the snow outside, Ash and Lars cover the cabin in gasoline and threaten to burn it down if they don't give them Jay and the keys. Jay wakes up and identifies Sandi as her maid. A flashback reveals that Sandi helped Ash and Lars take Jay from her home under the agreement she'd be ransomed, unaware of their true intentions. She agreed to meet with the kidnappers to give them Jay's medicine. In the present, Sandi confesses her involvement to Ed and lets Ash and Lars inside.
After learning that Darby is the only person who knows where the keys are, Ash kills Ed and Sandi and uses anail gunto pin Darby's wrist to a wall. Her phone receives a text message; Ash reads it and informs her that her mother has died. A subsequent text reveals that Darby's text to the police went through after all and that Corporal Ron is on his way to the cabin. When Ash threatens to hurt Jay, Darby reveals the keys' whereabouts. Ash gives his gun to Lars before leaving to search for the keys. Darby convinces Jay to bring her a hammer and to turn off the lights so she can attempt an escape.
Darby snorts heroin to numb her pain receptors and pulls the nail out of her wrist, freeing herself. With Lars distracted, she takes his gun as Ash returns. During a standoff with Darby holding Lars hostage, Jay hits Ash's nail gun with the hammer, thus shooting a nail in Lars' forehead.  He survives, but stumbles forward and slips on Ed and Sandi's blood, forcing the nail all the way into his head, killing him instantly. With Ash distracted by the chaos, Darby and Jay rush to the car and attempt to drive away. Ash fires the nail gun at the tires, puncturing them, and causing the car to crash into a light pole. Ash attempts to cover up the crimes by lighting the cabin on fire before setting his sights on an unconscious Darby in the vehicle. Corporal Ron arrives, however Ash pretends to be a concerned citizen helping Darby. Darby shoots Ash causing Ron to deem her as the threat and shoot her. Ash stretches out to take her weapon and shoots Ron. Ash proceeds to finish him off with the nail gun. Ash returns to Darby and puts the gun to her head. Darby uses a screwdriver to stab his neck, killing him. Darby uses Ron's radio to call for help.
Some time later, Darby is back in the rehab center and tells the group she has been sober for 48 days. She is told she has a visitor, her estranged sister, Devon.

It was launched on October 29, 2007, initially as ajoint venturebetweenNews Corporation(later21st Century Fox) andNBC Universal, which was laterbought byComcast. Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initiallybrandedas "Hulu Plus," which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and un-delayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—anover-the-topstreaming television service offering access tobroadcast televisionchannels.
In 2011, Hulu launchedits services in Japan, marking its first and only international expansion. Three years later in 2014, Hulu Japan was acquired byNippon TVand spun off from its American counterpart.[2]Since February 2021, Hulu's original content has since been distributed outside of the U.S. viaDisney+under theStarbrand. In 2019, Disney acquired a majority stake in Hulu as part of itsacquisition of 21st Century Fox, and subsequently acquired the remaining stakes held by AT&T and Comcast in 2019 and 2023, respectively, giving it full ownership. After the acquisition, Disneysoft launchedan integration of Hulu into Disney+ as a content hub in December 2023, allowing subscribers of both services to access Hulu content from within the Disney+ app. Hulu is one of the three streaming services in the Disney Bundle, alongside Disney+ andESPN+.
On January 6, 2025, Disney began its acquisition of a 70% stake inFuboTV, with the latter merging with Hulu's Live TV service. The combined company will remain publicly traded on theNew York Stock Exchange, but will be controlled by Disney executives. As part of the deal, Fubo settled a lawsuit againstESPN Inc.(majority-owned by Disney),Fox Corporation(21CF's successor), andWarner Bros. Discovery(WarnerMedia's successor after its merger withDiscovery, Inc.) over a joint venture known asVenu Sports, with Fubo being granted a preliminary injection to stop its launch in August 2024. The merger will take 12 to 18 months according to Disney and Fubo. Venu Sports was discontinued a few days later.
The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

In July 2007,Providence Equity, the owner ofNewport Television, became one of the earliest "outside" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 millionequity investment,[17]before the company was known as "Hulu."[18]With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an "independent voice on the board."[18]In April 2009,the Walt Disney Companyjoined the Hulu consortium as a stakeholder, with plans to offer content fromABC,ESPNandDisney Channel.[19][20][21][22]
Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
