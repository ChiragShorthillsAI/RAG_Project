Catherine, known as Birdy, is a fourteen-year-old English girl living in13th-centuryLincolnshire,England, with her father, Lord Rollo, mother, Lady Aislinn, and seventeen-year-old brother Robert. Her other brother, Edward, is amonkat a nearbymonastery. The headstrong and rambunctious Birdy is attended by her nurse, Morwenna, and is friends with a peasant boy named Perkin who often joins in her antics. The indulgent Rollo is informed that the family finances are in terrible shape and that he can solve them by marrying Birdy to a wealthysuitor. When Birdy starts her first period, Morwenna shows her how to deal with it and Rollo begins seriously looking for suitors. Aislinn gives birth to astillbornchild, the latest of several such tragedies.
Unwilling to grow up and lose her freedom, Birdy begins chasing off potential suitors through strange and off-putting antics. Birdy's friend Aelis comes to stay with them. Handsome Uncle George, with whom Birdy is smitten, soon returns from the crusades. Birdy discovers Aelis and George kissing, and breaks off her friendship with Aelis. George breaks Aelis' and Birdy's hearts by marrying Ethelfritha, a wealthy widow. Rollo announces that Aislinn is pregnant again, much to the anger of Birdy, who fears that her mother will die in childbirth.
A new suitor, Sir Henry Murgaw, arrives, and Birdy dubs him Shaggy Beard for his unkempt appearance. Birdy attempts to scare away the much older man, but Shaggy Beard finds her antics alluring. Saying that he "enjoys the chase," he gives Birdy a purse full of money, saying that she should spend it when she agrees to marry him. Aelis' father marries her off to a nine year old boy, but her new husband soon dies. This pleases Robert, who is secretly in love with Aelis and plans to ask her to marry him. Aelis' father demands a higher bride price than Robert can afford. Birdy decides to give Shaggy Beard's money to Robert so he can marry Aelis.
Birdy runs off to Uncle George's. There she learns that her romantic notions of George's adventures are false.  Ethelfritha suggests that the two of them run off and have adventures, but Birdy realizes that if she does so she will miss her family and friends.  Resolved to marry for the sake of the family, Birdy returns home to find her mother in labor. When complications arise, Rollo helps talk Aislinn through the labor and she gives birth to twin daughters. The day has finally arrived and Birdy says tearful goodbyes as she prepares to leave with Shaggy Beard. As the carriage  trundles away, Rollo intervenes, and says that Birdy will remain with them.  Shaggy Beard insists that she marry him and the two men agree to a duel. Despite his poor swordsmanship, Rollo disarms Shaggy Beard, who fakes a back injury in order to remove himself from the duel. The assembled people take Birdy out of the carriage, ending the marriage agreement.
Birdy, who has been keeping a diary of these events, summarizes what she has learned and vows to preserve what freedom she can in her world.  As she roughhouses with Perkin, a suitor approaches.

She is the creator, writer, and star of theHBOtelevision seriesGirls(2012–2017), for which she received severalEmmy Awardnominations and twoGolden Globe Awards.[2][3]Dunham also directed several episodes ofGirlsand became the first woman to win theDirectors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series.[4]She started her career writing, directing, and starring in her semi-autobiographicalindependent filmTiny Furniture(2010), for which she won anIndependent Spirit Awardfor Best First Screenplay. She has since written and directed the 2022 filmsSharp StickandCatherine Called Birdy.
In 2013, Dunham was included in the annualTime100 list of the most influential people in the world.[5]In 2014, Dunham released her first book,Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's "Learned".[6]In 2015, along withGirlsshowrunnerJenni Konner, Dunham created thepublicationLenny Letter, afeministonline newsletter.[7][8]The publication ran for three years before its discontinuation in late 2018.[9]
Dunham briefly appeared in films such asSupporting CharactersandThis Is 40(both 2012), andHappy Christmas(2014). She voiced Mary in the 2016 filmMy Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea, which premiered at theToronto International Film Festival. On television, aside fromGirls, she has played guest roles inScandalandThe Simpsons(both 2015). In 2017, she portrayedValerie SolanasinAmerican Horror Story: Cult.[10]
Dunham's work, as well as her outspoken presence onsocial mediaand in interviews, have attracted significant controversy, praise, criticism, and media scrutiny throughout her career.[11][12]
Dunham was born in New York City.[13][14]Her father,Carroll Dunham, is a painter, and her mother,Laurie Simmons, is an artist and photographer, and a member ofThe Pictures Generation, known for her use of dolls and dollhouse furniture in her photographs of setup interior scenes.[15][16]Her father isProtestantof mostlyEnglishancestry;[17]whereas her mother isJewish.[18][19][20][21]Dunham has described herself as feeling "very culturally Jewish, although that's the biggest cliché for a Jewish woman to say." TheModern Hebrew poetryofYehuda Amichaihelped her to connect with herJudaism.[22][23][24]
Dunham attendedFriends Seminarybefore transferring in seventh grade toSaint Ann's SchoolinBrooklyn, where she metTiny Furnitureactress and futureGirlsco-starJemima Kirke.[25][26]As a teen, Dunham also won aScholastic Art and Writing Award.[27]She attendedThe New Schoolfor a year before transferring toOberlin College,[28][16]where she graduated in 2008 with a degree in creative writing.[16]
She has a younger sibling,Cyrus, a 2014 graduate ofBrown University, who appeared in Dunham's first film,Creative Nonfiction, and starred in her second film,Tiny Furniture.[16][29]The siblings were raised in Brooklyn and spent summers inSalisbury, Connecticut.[30]
While a student atOberlin College, Dunham produced several independentshort filmsand uploaded them toYouTube. Many of her early films dealt with themes of sexual enlightenment and were produced in amumblecorefilmmaking style, a dialogue-heavy style in which young people talk about their personal relationships. In 2006, she producedPressure, in which a girl and two friends talk about experiencing an orgasm for the first time, which makes Dunham's character feel pressured to do so as well.[31][32]"I didn't go to film school", Dunham explains. "Instead I went to liberal arts school and self-imposed a curriculum of creating tiny flawed video sketches, brief meditations on comic conundrums, and slapping them on the Internet."[33]
Another early film, entitledThe Fountain, which depicted her in a bikini brushing her teeth in the public fountain at Oberlin College, went viral on YouTube.[34][35]"Her blithe willingness to disrobe without shame caused an outburst of censure from viewers," observedThe New Yorker'sRebecca Mead.[16]Dunham was shocked by the backlash and decided to take the video down:
There were just pages ofYouTubecomments about how fat I was, or how not fat I was," Dunham said. "I didn't want you to Google me and the first thing you see is a debate about whether my breasts are misshapen."[16]
Pressures(2006),Open the Door(2007),Hooker on Campus(2007), andThe Fountain(2007) were released asDVDextras withTiny Furniture.[36]
In 2007, Dunham starred in a ten-episode web series forNerve.comentitledTight Shots,[37][38]described byThe New York Times Magazine'sVirginia Heffernanas "a daffy serial about kids trying to make a movie and be artsy and have tons of sex."[39]
In 2009, Dunham created theIndex Magazineweb series,Delusional Downtown Divas, which satirized the New York City art scene. The production was unpaid, so Dunham and her friends "pooled their money from babysitting and art-assistant gigs and borrowed some camera gear."[40]
Also in 2009, Dunham premieredCreative Nonfiction— a comedy where she plays Ella, a college student struggling to complete a screenplay[41]— at theSouth by SouthwestFestival in Austin, Texas. She was initially rejected by the festival the year before; she re-edited and successfully resubmitted the film.[42]
Dunham had a career breakthrough with her semi-autobiographical 2010 feature filmTiny Furniture; the film won Best Narrative Feature atSouth by Southwest Music and Media Conference, and subsequently screened at such festivals asMaryland Film Festival.[43]Dunham plays the lead role of Aura.[16]Laurie Simmons(Dunham's real-life mother) plays Aura's mother, and Dunham's real-life sibling Cyrus plays Aura's on-screen sibling. For her work onTiny Furniture, Dunham also won anIndependent Spirit Awardfor Best First Screenplay.[44][45][46]
The success ofTiny Furnitureearned Dunham a blind script deal atHBO.[47]The network set Dunham up with veteran showrunnerJennifer Konner. Konner toldVulture'sJada Yuanthat she got involved with Dunham because she was an obsessiveTiny Furniturefan:
I got a copy ofTiny Furniturefrom [HBO president]Sue Naegle. Actually, [New Girlcreator]Liz Meriwethertold me about it and said, 'Oh, there's this great movie. This girl, she's 23, she wrote, directed, and starred in it; she's in her underwear the whole time.' And I was like, 'I really don't want to see that.' And then she was like, 'Oh, trust me, it's great.' So Sue gave it to me just because she had it ... I used to, like, give out copies of the movie. But I'd just broken up with my writing partner and couldn't be less interested in the idea of supervising anybody. I really was like, 'I'm going to find my voice, and be on my own.' And then they called me and they were like, 'Oh, theTiny Furnituregirl is doing a show, do you want to supervise her?' And I was like, 'Yes! One million percent. Sign me up. Totally on board.'[48]
Dunham's star was also raised considerably when she was profiled byDavid CarrinThe New York Times; he was later credited with introducing her toJudd Apatow.[49][50]Apatow watchedTiny Furniture, and was surprised Dunham had also written and directed the film. "I emailed her and told her I thought it was great", Apatow toldThe Hollywood Reporter. "It turned out she was in the middle of negotiating a deal to develop a show for HBO and that her partner was Jenni Konner, whom I had worked with onUndeclaredand a bunch of other projects. They asked me if I wanted to be a part of it, and I was thrilled to jump in."[51]
Dunham's television series,Girls, was greenlit byHBOin early 2011.[52]Three episodes were screened to positive response at the 2012 South by Southwest Festival.[53]
The series follows Hannah Horvath (portrayed by Dunham), a 20-something writer struggling to get by in New York City. Some of the struggles facing Dunham's character Hannah—including being cut off financially from her parents, becoming a writer and making unfortunate decisions—are inspired by Dunham's real-life experiences.[54]
Dunham saidGirlsreflects a part of the population not portrayed in the 1998 HBO seriesSex and the City. "Gossip Girlwas teens duking it out on theUpper East SideandSex and the Citywas women who [had] figured out work and friends and now want to nail romance and family life. There was this 'hole-in-between' space that hadn't really been addressed," she said.[54]The pilot intentionally referencesSex and the City, as producers wanted to make it clear that the driving force behindGirlsis that the characters were inspired by the former HBO series and moved to New York to pursue their dreams.[54]Dunham herself says she "revere[s] that show just as much as any girl of my generation".[54]
The first season premiered on HBO on April 15, 2012, and received critical acclaim.The New York Timesapplauded the series, writing that "Girlsmay be themillennial generation's rebuttal toSex and the City, but the first season was at times as cruelly insightful and bleakly funny asLouieon FX orCurb Your Enthusiasmon HBO."[55]James Poniewozik fromTimereserved high praise for the series, calling it "raw, audacious, nuanced and richly, often excruciatingly funny".[56]
Despite the acclaim, the series also generated significant criticism over its lack of racial representation and Dunham's frequent on-screen nudity.[57][58]
The first season garnered Dunham fourEmmy Awardnominations for her roles in acting, writing, and directing the series, as well as twoGolden Globe AwardsforBest Television Series – Musical or ComedyandBest Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy.[59][60]In February 2013, Dunham became the first woman to win aDirectors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Seriesfor her work onGirls.[61]
Girlswas renewed for a second season in April 2012, before the first season had finished airing.[62]The first season finale drew over one million viewers.[63]
The second season ofGirlscontinued to receive critical acclaim. David Wiegland of theSan Francisco Chroniclesaid: "The entire constellation of impetuous, ambitious, determined and insecure young urbanites inGirlsis realigning in the new season, but at no point in the four episodes sent to critics for review do you feel that any of it is artificial".[64]Verne Gay ofNewsdaysaid: "Sharper, smarter, more richly layered, detailed and acted".[65]Ken Tucker ofEntertainment Weeklyfelt that "As bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as it was in its first season,Girlsmay now be even spunkier, funnier, and riskier".[66]The second season ran on HBO from January 2013 to March 2013, with third and fourth seasons subsequently being renewed.

In October 2018, Dunham and Konner announced thatLenny Letterwould be shutting down,[9][115]reportedly due to a decline in subscribers and failure to build momentum upon other platforms.[116]
Dunham has received criticism for her production of the filmOrgasm Inc.: The Story of OneTaste. Hundreds of women and men claim that Dunham's production company was responsible for using their image against their consent, filing a lawsuit against Netflix to disallow the film, signing petitions, and creating viral videos protesting the violation.[117][118][119]The film reportedly relies on "personal journals" attorneys have claimed to be fabricated despite the film presenting itself as a documentary.[120]
Dunham claimed in her bookNot That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's "Learned"that she had been sexually assaulted by a person she called "Barry". Other details in the book indicated that "Barry" was a formerOberlin Collegeclassmate.[121][122][123]In the book, Dunham describes "Barry" as a man who wore cowboy boots, sported a mustache, hosted a radio show, worked at a campus library, and graduated from Oberlin in 2005; this description was characterized by the attorney of Dunham's former classmate as detailed enough to point towards his client. Dunham later apologized for the confusion and Random House reprinted the book with a disclaimer, releasing a statement saying: "Random House, on our own behalf and on behalf of our author, regrets the confusion."[124]Other passages in the book recounting interactions of a sexual nature, starting when she was seven years old – with her then one-year-old sibling Grace (nowCyrus) – also attracted significant controversy,[125]and prompted numerouseditorialsaboutchildren's sexualityand personal boundaries.[126][127][128]
Dunham's work and her outspoken presence on social media and in interviews have attracted significant controversy, criticism, and media scrutiny throughout her career.[11][12]On several occasions, Dunham has been accused of making racially insensitive remarks.[129][130]Upon release,Girlswas met with criticism regarding the all-white main cast in the otherwiseculturally diverse setting of New York City.[131][132]Though some pointed out that many Americans are friends with other people of the same race, and adding a "token" African-American or Asian-American friend would be "immature" to reality.[133]Donald Gloverguest starred as Sandy, a black Republican and Hannah's love interest, in the first two episodes of season two, which was criticized astokenismin response to the initial backlash from the first season.[134]
Dunham spoke publicly about the criticism on several occasions; in an interview withIndieWire, she said:
I am a half-Jew, half-WASP, and I wrote two Jews and two WASPs. Something I wanted to avoid was tokenism in casting. If I had one of the four girls, if, for example, she was African-American, I feel like—not that the experience of an African-American girl and a white girl are drastically different, but there has to be specificity to that experience [that] I wasn't able to speak to. I really wrote the show from a gut-level place, and each character was a piece of me or based on someone close to me. And only later did I realize that it was four white girls. As much as I can say it was an accident, it was only later as the criticism came out, I thought, 'I hear this and I want to respond to it.' And this is a hard issue to speak to because all I want to do is sound sensitive and not say anything that will horrify anyone or make them feel more isolated, but I did write something that was super-specific to my experience, and I always want to avoid rendering an experience I can't speak to accurately.[135]
In September 2016, Dunham criticizedNFLplayerOdell Beckham Jr.for his interactions with her at theMet Gala. Dunham said: "I was sitting next to Odell Beckham Jr., and it was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards. He was like, 'That's a marshmallow. That's a child. That's a dog.' It wasn't mean — he just seemed confused. The vibe was very much like, 'Do I want to f--- it? Is it wearing a ... yep, it's wearing a tuxedo. I'm going to go back to my cell phone." She added, "It was like we were forced to be together, and he literally was scrollingInstagramrather than have to look at a woman in a bow tie. I was like, 'This should be called the Metropolitan Museum of Getting Rejected by Athletes'."[136]Dunham was criticized for her comments, which some considered to be an example of "white entitlement".[137][138]She later apologized for her characterization of his interactions and thoughts.[139]
In December 2016, Dunham declared on a podcast that she wished she had had anabortion, explaining that she wanted to better understand women who have. The comment was widely condemned as insensitive.[140][141]Dunham later issued a lengthy apology on her Instagram.[142][143]
In November 2017, Dunham defendedGirlswriterMurray Miller, whom actressAurora Perrineauhad accused of sexually assaulting her in 2012 when she was seventeen. Dunham responded to the accusations by saying: "While our first instinct is to listen to every woman's story, our insider knowledge of Murray's situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3% of assault cases that are misreported every year."[144]After an immediate backlash, Dunham apologized for that statement, saying that it was "absolutely the wrong time to come forward with such a statement" and that "every woman who comes forward deserves to be heard, fully and completely, and our relationship to the accused should not be part of the calculation anyone makes when examining her case."[144]Dunham was described as a "hipster racist" for her defense of Miller, as Perrineau is of mixed race.[145][146]In December 2018, Dunham stated that, contrary to her previous statement, she had no "insider information" that exonerated Murray.[147][148][149]
In October 2018, Dunham was hired to write the screenplay for an untitled film based upon the memoirA Hope More Powerful Than the Sea: One Refugee's Incredible Story of Love, Loss, and Survival, byMelissa Fleming, which follows the true story ofDoaa Al Zamel, who fled Egypt for Europe and became one of few survivors of ashipwrecked refugee boat, surviving days in open water and supporting herself and two orphaned children with only an inflatable water ring.[150]Steven SpielbergandJ. J. Abramsare set to produce the film.[151]Dunham's hiring received backlash from those who felt that, instead of Dunham, a Syrian woman should have been hired.[152][153][154]Daniel Medina, a journalist, wrote: "Lena Dunham constantly talks about representation as crucial to enrich storytelling. Yet, in practice, she has shown a disregard for actually elevating those voices. Now, she's been signed on to write a Syrian refugee's story?".[155]AuthorAlia Malekstated: "The idea that Lena Dunham is better situated to tell the story of a Syrian than somebody else implicit in that is a kind of hierarchy."[156]
In January 2022, ahead of the film'sSundancepremiere,autisticself-advocateandsex educatorAmy Gravino posted a Twitter thread alleging that she was approached to be a consultant on Dunham's filmSharp Stick, but was subsequently "ghosted" before she had a chance to meet with Dunham in person.[157][158]In aVarietyarticle covering the subject, Gravino claimed that the film's star, Kristine Froseth, had approached her business manager while doing research for her character Sarah Jo, whom she concluded displayed characteristics that suggested she was autistic. Gravino also claimed that Dunham had personally done research on her work and was excited to meet with her. However, according to the film's producers, Dunham rejected Froseth's suggestion to approach Gravino, and clarified to Froseth that she had never intended to depict Sarah Jo as autistic.
An unnamed spokesperson also released a statement toVarietythat read, "Sarah Jo was never written nor imagined as aneurodivergentwoman. Nothing about Sarah Jo wascodedto suggest or convey neurodivergence." Gravino responded to this defense by saying, "You can’t just say the character isn’t going to be neurodiverse; the coding is still there and it comes across that way in the writing and acting choices, even though it’s not explicitly stated." She also criticized the film for its "infantilization" of Sarah Jo, though the producers countered this assessment by stating that the character's childlike qualities were included to reflect the trauma she experienced, rather than to suggest that she was autistic.[157]
In 2012, Dunham began datingJack Antonoff, the lead guitarist of the bandfun.and the founder ofBleachers.[159][160]Dunham and Antonoff remained together until December 2017; they subsequently separated announcing that the separation was "amicable".[161][162]

In fall of 2012, Dunham appeared in a video advertisement promoting PresidentBarack Obama's re-election, delivering a monologue, which, according to a blog quoted inThe Atlantic, tried to "get the youth vote by comparing voting for the first time to having sex for the first time".[179]Fox Newsreported criticism from conservatives such asMedia Research Center's Lauren Thompson, public relations professionalRonn Torossian, and media trainer Louise Pennell, who labeled the advertisement as tasteless, inappropriate, and a ploy to lure the younger female vote.[180]It included a comment from Steve Hall of Ad Rants saying that "not everyone was so offended." A friend of Dunham said the actress was not paid for her performance on the spot, and Dunham defended the ad by tweeting "The video may be light but the message is serious: vote for women's rights." InThe Nation,Ari Melberwrote "the ad's style is vintage Lena: edgy and informed, controversial but achingly self-aware, sexually proud and affirmatively feminist."[181]
In 2014, Dunham was named the Recipient of Horizon Award 2014 byPoint Foundationfor her support of the gay community.[182]
In April 2016, she wrote in support ofHillary Clinton, pledging to move toVancouver, British Columbia, Canada, ifDonald Trumpwon the election.[183][184]Dunham rebuked Trump for theAccess Hollywood tape.[185]After Trump's win, Dunham wrote she will not be moving to Canada, saying, "I can survive staying in this country, MY country, to fight and love and use my embarrassment of blessings to do what's right."[186]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
