Interceptoris a 2022actionthriller filmdirected byMatthew Reillyin his directorial debut, from a screenplay by Reilly andStuart Beattieand a story by Reilly. An international co-production between Australia and the United States, the film starsElsa PatakyandLuke Bracey. It follows a tough and reality-bruised army officer who finds herself in charge of a lonenuclear missileinterceptor base in the middle of thePacific Oceanafter she is wrongfully drummed out of her dream job atthe Pentagon.
The film began streaming onNetflixon June 3, 2022, and climbed to number one on the streamer's top 10 list with about 50 million hours viewed.[3]It received mixed reviews from critics, and was nominated forBest Production Designat the12th AACTA Awards.
The United States has two interceptor launch sites aimed at intercepting any nuclear warhead launches; the first,Fort GreelyinAlaska, is attacked by unknown assailants presumably affiliated with aterroristfaction, while 16 nuclear warheads are simultaneously seized from Russian territory. The second site is a remote platform in the middle of thePacific Ocean.U.S. ArmyCaptain J. J. Collins is recently reassigned to the latter of the two interceptor missile launch sites. Following a high-profile case where she reportedsexual misconductby her superior, she experiencedhazing,bullyingand threats and a new deployment as retaliation.
Under Lt. Colonel Marshall, and working alongside Cpl. Beaver Baker and Cpl. Rahul Shah in the station's command center, Collins is part of the last line of defense after the hostile takeover of Fort Greely. The station is infiltrated by a small group of operatives led by ex-military intelligence soldier Kessel, who promptly kill Marshall and the other occupants of the base, leaving only Collins, Shah, and an unconscious Baker (who was grazed by a stray bullet) in the command center.
The infiltrators attempt to enter the command center, by which they can disarm the interceptor system and leave the U.S. open to nuclear attack from the sixteen stolen warheads. However, they are rebuffed and attempt to forcibly enter instead withblowtorches.
An operative launches a surprise attack after entering via a floor hatch, but is defeated and killed by Collins and Shah. Baker regains consciousness and reveals himself to be aninside manfor the infiltrators and motivated by a big payday andxenophobia, holding both Collins and Shah at gunpoint while allowing Kessel and the remaining operatives to enter and assume control.
Kessel hijacks a live feed and streams hismanifestoabout the failures in thehistory of the United Statesonline, naming the sixteen American cities to be destroyed, and instructing the terrorist faction to launch the nukes immediately. Collins breaks free of her restraints and locks Kessel, Baker, and a henchman back out of the command center, while defeating and killing Kira, the lone enemy operative still in the room, and another henchman.
Kessel attempts to force Collins to surrender, torturing her father, but she refuses and her father is apparently killed when the transmission is cut. Kessel then plans toscuttlethe station if he cannot take control of it. As the station begins to sink, Shah volunteers to drop through the floor hatch to the ocean below and manually re-engage the station's hatches, such that the interceptors are still able to launch and destroy the warheads when they eventually pass through the airspace overhead. Shah succeeds, but he is killed by Baker.
Collins hides in the command center and lets Kessel, Baker, and the remaining henchman take over and disable the seemingly empty center. Her ruse works, with Baker going to check up on the station's roof to find and eliminate her. Collins is able to stealthily dispatch the remaining henchman while Kessel flees the room.
Grabbing alaptop, Collins ascends to the roof and plugs the device in, planning to manually launch the interceptor missiles using this method. She is found by Baker and they engage inhand to hand combat, with Collins emerging victorious after killing Baker.
Kessel, who had called in a Russian submarine to pick up the team of operatives earlier, finds Collins just as she successfully launches the interceptor missiles with a fraction of a second left before the nukes would have crossed the point of interception. His plan failed, he engages in combat with Collins, who manages to defeat and subdue him, just as the Russian submarine ascends from the sea. A pair of Russians emerge from the submarine tower, but rather than shooting Collins, they fire at Kessel instead, and the Russian Captain salutes Collins before departing.
Collins later recovers from her ordeal in the hospital, and she is personally given a promotion by the U.S. president for her efforts. She also receives a visit from her father who had been rescued by friends who had witnessed his plight on the live broadcast, and he comforts her over her grief for Shah's death.
In addition, Mark Dessaix plays the dismissivegame theorystrategist advising the President, whileChris Hemsworthappears in an uncreditedcameoas the laid-back salesman at abig boxconsumer electronics store.
Reilly began writing the screenplay forInterceptorin 2017. The script's action took place predominantly on one set, as Reilly wanted to ensure that the film's budget would not go over $15 million. Beattie was so sold on the script that he contacted Reilly asking if he could rewrite it, to which the latter agreed.[4][5]Beattie shared the script with producers, who were told that Reilly intended to serve as director. Reilly experienced some pushback on this, but was successful in maintaining his position as director.
On March 4, 2021, it was announced thatElsa PatakyandLuke Braceywould star in the film, with Beattie producing with Matthew Street and Michael Boughen for Ambience Entertainment.[6][7]Pataky prepared for the role by training for up to five hours each day with the help of her husband,Chris Hemsworth,[8]who served as an executive producer and also had an uncreditedcameo roleas a salesman for an electronics store.[9][10]
Filming took place inNew South Wales,Australiaover a period of 33 days,[4]beginning on March 29, 2021.[11]

Paul Byrnes ofThe Sydney Morning Heraldgave the film three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, "Parts of it are laughably silly, but that's intentional. It's not quite a satire, having some Serious Things to say, but mostly it's a romp."[16]Nicolas Rapold ofThe New York Timesstated that it "is clunky and barely coherent anytime there's not a fight scene."[17]Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiangave the film three stars out of five and called it "absurd yet entertaining."[18]

"My life pretty much fell apart; she was my everything. We did everything together; we’d done everything together for the previous 18 years. And suddenly I’d have days where I’d look at the clock and it’d be quarter past one in the afternoon, and I’d think:I’ve got ten hours ‘til I’m going to go to bed. I cried every day for six months. I howled in my car. I’d take the dog for the longest of walks that she’s ever had in her life."
— Reilly on his wife Natalie's suicide.[24]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
