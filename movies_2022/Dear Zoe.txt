Fifteen-year-old Tess DeNunzio lives in Pittsburgh with her mother Elly, stepfather David, and younger half-sister Em.

After Tess’s three-year-old half-sister, Zoe, died in a hit-and-run accident on the day of theSeptember 11 attackswhile Tess was supposed to be watching her, Tess helped David care for Em while Elly coped with depression. The family attends therapy together, though Tess feels excluded from David and Elly’s grief. Tess has a breakdown after discovering of Elly's emotional affair with Justin, a much younger grocery store clerk. Tess moves in with Nick, though she regrets abandoning Em. Tess begins to care for one of Nick’s puppies. Nick agrees to drive Em home from school so that the sisters can spend time together. Tess and Nick attend church together, but she runs from the church screaming when a hymn reminds her of 9/11.
Tess is attracted to her neighbor, Jimmy Freeze, who claims to know her father. She offers him a beer, but Nick intervenes and instructs her not to socialize with him. When a suspicious man approaches Tess on the porch with a wad of cash, Tess realizes that Nick is dealing drugs out of the back of his truck. Tess confronts her father, who doesn’t stop selling drugs, but gives the man a black eye for appearing at his home. One night, Jimmy climbs through Tess’s window. While smoking weed together, Jimmy reveals he struggles to bond with his father and stepmother, and was sent to a correctional facility. He also discusses his mother’s death, though Tess doesn’t mention Zoe. They kiss goodnight. Jimmy continues to visit her at night, but Tess keeps their developing relationship a secret from Nick.
When summer begins, Em feels isolated, as she only sees Tess on rides home from school. Tess and Elly begin to have weekly phone calls, during which Tess notes that they’re both improving and Elly admits she’s afraid of losing Tess, which Tess promises won’t happen. Though missing Em and Elly, Tess continues to live with Nick, finding it easier to forget Zoe there. Jimmy gets Tess a summer job at an amusement park where he works. Soon, Jimmy and Tess profess their love for one another.
On the evening of Tess’s 17th birthday, Nick and Jimmy are both arrested; Tess realizes Jimmy sells drugs with her father. Her mother brings her presents; Tess tells her about the park and Jimmy. When Nick and Jimmy arrive home, Jimmy stays with Tess. They have sex for the first time and Tess tells Jimmy about Zoe: Tess missed the school bus, and her mother instructed her to watch Zoe outside. Tess ran inside to watch news coverage of 9/11, and returned to find Zoe stepping off the curb, only to be hit by a car. Jimmy assures Tess that he still loves her.
Tess moves back to her old house. Tess stands on the grass where Zoe landed after the car accident and cries. She reconciles with her mom, David and Em.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
