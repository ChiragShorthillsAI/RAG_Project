Lightyearis a 2022 American animatedscience-fictionaction-adventure filmproduced byPixar Animation StudiosforWalt Disney Pictures. Presented as afilm within a film,Lightyearis aspin-offof theToy Storyfilm seriesand centers on the characterBuzz Lightyear, who appears inToy Storyas an action figure of his character inLightyear. The film was directed byAngus MacLaneand produced by Galyn Susman, from a screenplay and story written by MacLane and Jason Headley, both of whom co-wrote the latter with Matthew Aldrich. It starsChris Evansas the voice of the title character, withKeke Palmer,Peter Sohn,Taika Waititi,Dale Soules,James Brolin, andUzo Adubain supporting roles. The film follows Lightyear who, after being marooned on the hostile planet T'Kani Prime with his commander and crew, tries to find a way back home while encountering a threat to their safety.
The concept of a human Buzz Lightyear, who exists in afictional universe within a fictional universe, was first introduced in the 2000direct-to-videofilmBuzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins, which was the pilot for the TV seriesBuzz Lightyear of Star Command(2000–2001). MacLane, an avid science-fiction fan, pitched the idea of a film featuring Buzz Lightyear at Pixar, after finishing work onFinding Dory(2016). The project was officially announced in an investor meeting held by Disney in December 2020. The animators gave the film a "cinematic" and "chunky" look, evoking the science-fiction films MacLane grew up watching. To design the vehicles of the film, MacLane usedLegopieces to build various ships and pitch them to the designers and artists. For itsIMAXscenes, the team used two virtual cameras, a regular camera with a 35mm equivalent sensor, and a larger sensor equivalent to 65 millimeters, a procedure earlier initiated by Pixar inWALL-E(2008). Development onLightyearlasted for five and a half years, on an approximate $200 million budget.Michael Giacchinocomposed the film's score, whileRen Klyceserved as its sound designer.
Lightyearpremiered at theEl Capitan TheatreinHollywood, Los Angeles, on June 8, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 17. It became the first Pixar film to be released in theaters worldwide sinceOnwardin March 2020, and the first to include scenes specifically formatted for IMAX theaters. Analysts considered the film to be abox-office bomb, grossing $226.4 million worldwide and losing the studio an estimated $106million.
"In 1995, a boy namedAndygot aBuzz Lightyeartoy for his birthday. It was from his favorite movie. This is that movie."
A Star Command exploration vessel changes course to investigate signs of life on the unknown world T'Kani Prime. Awakening from hibernation, Space RangerBuzz Lightyearand his commanding officer and best friend Alisha Hawthorne explore with a new recruit. They are forced to retreat to their exploration vessel after discovering that the planet hosts hostile lifeforms. While attempting to leave, Buzz accidentally damages their vessel, causing them to be marooned on T'Kani Prime. He volunteers as the test pilot for thehyperspacefuel crystal they will need to develop to return home.
One year later, the crew has constructed a new colony to conduct repairs. However, after a four-minute test flight, Buzz finds that four years have passed on T'Kani Prime, due tothe effectsoftime dilationfrom having traveled at relativistic speeds. Alisha gifts Buzz with Sox, a robotic feline companion, and Buzz decides to continue testing the hyperspace fuel. With every test, four more years pass on T'Kani Prime, until eventually over sixty-six years have passed. During this time, the colony develops, with Alisha raising a son with her wife Kiko, subsequently dying of old age, while Sox improves the fuel's composition, allowing it to obtain faster-than-light speeds.
Against the orders of Alisha's successor Commander Cal Burnside, Buzz, accompanied by Sox, uses the new fuel composition for a successful hyperspace test. However, he and Sox skip twenty-two years into the future during which T'Kani Prime has been invaded by Zyclops robots led by Zurg, the robots' commander. Buzz and Sox meet up with members of the colony's defense forces; Alisha's now-adult granddaughter Izzy Hawthorne, Mo Morrison, a fresh, naïve recruit, and Darby Steel, an elderly paroled convict. While initially reluctant to work with them, Buzz eventually warms to them after they escape from a nest of insects and investigate a mining facility to repair their ship. Together, they plan to destroy the invading force at Zurg's mothership.
As they head back to the ship, Zurg intervenes and captures Buzz, then reveals himself to be an older version of Buzz from an alternate timeline, which split upon Buzz's return to the planet after the successful hyperspace test: without the robot army to detain them, soldiers from the colony attempted to arrest Buzz under Burnside's orders, forcing him to flee into space. This Buzz and his Sox escaped at full speed and, via time dilation, flew hundreds of years into the far future, where he encountered and stole extremely advanced technology, and eventually developed a way to travel back in time to prevent himself from stranding the Star Command crew upon the planet. Having worn out his own fuel, Zurg needs fresh fuel to travel further into the past and complete his mission, so he requests it from his younger self. Realizing this would erase Alisha and Kiko's life together, along with Izzy and the lives of all the other colonists, Buzz refuses.
Aided by Zurg's Sox, Buzz and the cadets escape Zurg's ship and set it to self-destruct. On their return to the planet via a crash landing, Zurg attacks and takes the fuel for himself. Buzz ejects to shoot the fuel, causing an explosion that seemingly kills Zurg. With the fuel gone, Buzz finally accepts T'Kani Prime as his home. Burnside arrests the group with the intention of detaining them for their actions, but relents in light of Buzz's bravery against the robot armada. Allowed to revive the Space Ranger Corps, Buzz selects Izzy, Mo, Darby, and Sox as his team. With a new fuel crystal created using the computer left behind during the mutiny, Buzz and his team embark on a new adventure.
In a post-credits scene, Zurg is shown to have survived the explosion.[3]

Development ofLightyearbegan following the production ofFinding Doryin 2016. After co-directingFinding DorywithAndrew Stanton,Angus MacLanewas allowed topitchthe idea of making aBuzz Lightyearfilm, having always wondered what movie Andy Davis saw in the originalToy Story(1995) to get interested in a Buzz Lightyear action figure. MacLane, ascience fictionfan, had felt attracted to the character of Buzz since he started working atPixar, feeling that the film's story was very "personal" for him, whose favorite movie since childhood had beenStar Wars(1977).[8][9]An aspect present in theToy Storyfilms thatLightyearexplores is Buzz's disagreement over the nature of reality, which, coupled with his heroic ideals, made an amalgam of sci-fi clichés that MacLane intended to make more than just a punchline.[8][10]
In February 2019,Tim Allen, who voiced Buzz in the films, expressed interest in doing another film as he did not "see any reason why they wouldn't do it",[11]while in that May, onThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,Tom Hanks, who voicedWoody, said thatToy Story 4(2019) would be the final installment in the franchise,[12]but producer Mark Nielsen disclosed a possibility of a fifth film, as Pixar was not ruling out that possibility.[13]In December 2020 at a Disney Investor Day meeting,Lightyearwas announced as aspin-offfilm depicting the in-universe origin of the human Buzz Lightyear character, withChris Evansproviding the character's voice.[4]
When asked about the relationship betweenLightyearandBuzz Lightyear of Star Command, aToy Storyspin-off series that also serves as an in-universe production starring the Buzz character, MacLane, who directed the CG opening sequence forStar Command,[14]said that he did not have it in mind while working on the film, but always pictured the series being developed in-universe after a trilogy ofLightyearfilms.[15][9]He later explained thatLightyearserves as a "live-action" film within theToy Storyuniverse, whereasStar Commandserves as a hand-drawn animated series based on the film, from which the toy versions of Buzz and Zurg derive.[16][17]On May 4, 2022, production ofLightyearwas completed after spending five and a half years in development.[18]The budget was approximately $200 million.[19]
Producer Galyn Susman said that the creative team did not discuss bringing back the original voice actor for Buzz Lightyear,Tim Allen, in any capacity for this film because they believed that his voice would have tied the film too closely toToy Storywhen the film aims to be its own stand-alone story while also saying: "Tim really is the embodiment of the toy Buzz, and this isn't the toy world, so it really doesn't make sense. There's not really a role. It would just cause more confusion for audiences instead of helping them understand the movie we're trying to tell."[20]
Chris Evanswas announced as the voice of the human Buzz Lightyear along with the project's announcement in December 2020.[4]Evans was the first and only choice MacLane had for Buzz;[21]MacLane defended the recasting as "Tim's version of Buzz [Lightyear] is a little goofier and is a little dumber, and so he is the comic relief. In this film, Buzz is the action hero. He's serious and ambitious and funny, but not in a goofy way that would undercut the drama [...] Chris Evans has the gravitas and that movie-star quality that our character needed to separate him and the movie from Tim's version of the toy inToy Story."[22]
Evans visited Pixar's offices one day and they pitched him the project during a visit; he accepted the offer immediately, given his love for animation.[8]Evans credited Allen as his guideline and also wanted to "create his own understanding of the character, and try to make some fresh tracks in the snow while paying homage to his work in the film".[22]He eventually felt comfortable with his own interpretation and had to lower his voice for the role.[22]
Keke Palmer,Dale Soules,Uzo Aduba,James Brolin, Mary McDonald-Lewis,Efren RamirezandIsiah Whitlock Jr.were reported to have been cast in supporting roles in February 2022, following the release of the official trailer.[23]On May 6, 2022,European Space AgencyastronautTim Peakewas revealed to have a cameo as "Tim from Mission Control".[7]On May 25, it was revealed thatFormula OnedriversCarlos Sainz Jr.andCharles Leclercwould cameo in the film; both playing the same undisclosed character for the Spanish and Italian dubs of the film, respectively.[24]
The animators wanted the film to look "cinematic" and "chunky" in order to evoke the feeling of the science fiction films MacLane grew up with.[21]In order to achieve this, they asked a formerIndustrial Light & Magicemployee to build a spaceship model for them, from which the animators drew inspiration; this technique was inspired by designers for early science fiction films using models as inspiration for their sets and props.[21]MacLane said the animation took several "visual lessons" from early science fiction andspace operafilms such as those of theStar Warsfranchise, though without intentionally imitating such films.[25]The visual effects studio Perception helped with the opening and end credits of the film.[26]To design the vehicles of the film, MacLane usedLegopieces to build various ships and pitch them to the designers and artists.[27]Zurg was redesigned for the film, influenced byanimerobots, to look more grounded and menacing than his previous appearances which MacLane believed were too comical.[28]
Korean animators Chun Sung-uk and Lee Chae-yeon worked on the animation process in their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. They said that it is "overwhelming to see the full scale of what computer animation can do on the big screen".[29]The animation team went toNASAto research about spaceships, space suits and overall set pieces as they wanted "everything to look like a live-action film rather than an animation".[29]According to Lee, a 3D animator, who also worked onToy Story 2and3, said "The director wanted to make a film that felt true so he asked for a much more toned-down version of Buzz's personality. Being part of the team required an enormous amount of responsibility, but it was really exciting for me professionally".[29]
"If you're watching the film in a regular theater, you may not notice. But when you see the film inIMAX, those shots are actually shot "in IMAX," for lack of a better word [...] all of that stuff started back onWALL-E, and each film has kind of had its own version. Like, how do we want to shoot this film? What's the aspect ratio? What do we want the feel of it to be from the lens? And it all sounds like kind of small, little things. But they all add up.
For the IMAX release,Lightyearis the first ever animated feature film to have its aspect ratio opened up from 2.39:1 to 1.43:1 for select sequences of the film.[31]Jane Yen, who served as the film's visual effects supervisor, spoke to/Filmstating that the team had developed virtual IMAX cameras to shoot the sequences in 1.43:1 and then would be cropped to standard-definition.[32][33]The film includes 30 minutes of IMAX animation.[34]The team shot this footage using two different virtual cameras, a regular camera with a 35mm equivalent sensor and a 65mm equivalent sensor, which was earlier initiated by Pixar inWALL-E(2008).[30][34]
Recurrent Pixar composerMichael Giacchinowas announced to compose the score for the film, marking his eighth collaboration with the studio and the second time he would score an installment to a film franchise from Pixar that is traditionally scored byRandy Newman, afterCars 2(2011).[35]He earlier scored for theToy Storytelevision specials:Toy Story of Terror!(2013) andToy Story That Time Forgot(2014), the former was written and directed by MacLane.[35]
Following the announcement of the film, a first look was shown at the Disney Investor Day on December 10, 2020.[36][37]The marketing campaign forLightyearbegan on October 27, 2021, with the release of ateaser trailer, set toDavid Bowie's "Starman", that received 83 million views in its first 24 hours.[38]Compared to other Pixar films, the teaser's viewership ranks second behind a teaser forIncredibles 2(114 million).[39][40]It was positively reviewed by commentators, withCNN-based editor Leah Asmelash writing, "the trailer filled many millennials with sentimentality".[41]The first trailer was released online on February 8, 2022,[42][43]and was then aired atSuper Bowl LVIon February 13, 2022.[44][45]ComicBook.com's Aaron Perine opined that "the animated movie will be as comedic as expected of these family movies" and further stated "Chris Evans' version of the Space Ranger takes shape as he gets used to some alien surroundings. Also of note would be Lightyear's new companion, a robot cat that will also end up being comedic relief played byPeter Sohn."[42]Aaron Couch ofThe Hollywood Reporterhad stated "TheLightyeartrailer reveals that Buzz is sent on a rescue flight after he and a group of people are stranded on a planet. After a year of hard work, they've managed to send Buzz off world for help."[46]
On April 27, 2022, the first 30 minutes of the film was premiered atCinemaConalong with the second trailer,[47][48]which released online six days earlier.[49][50]It was positively received by critics, who referred to the film as "Pixar'sStar Wars" and a "beautifully animated, fun, and emotional journey", and appreciated the cinematic qualities, including animation and visuals.[48][51]Critics further went on to praise the robotic cat Sox voiced by Sohn, and called him "the standout performer."[52]CNBC's Sarah Whitten compared Sox, withK-2SOfromRogue OneandBaymaxfromBig Hero 6, attributing the character with a "dry sense of humor and blunt vocal delivery and also an innocence and caring nature".[52]On May 5, 2022, a poster, stills from the film, and a "special look" trailer was released online.[53][54]
Fandango Media's managing editorErik Davis, and John Rocha, film critic forOutlaw Nation, predicted a demand for Sox toys, even before the film's release.[52]Mattel, which had the master toy license forToy Storyfranchise, had announced a newLightyeartoy line consisting of action figures, playsets and vehicles.[55][56]After Sox's character in the film received praise from insiders, Mattel created "an animatronic interactive version" which costs $80, apart from the plush and action figures. Mattel's executive lead, PJ Lewis had said "We knew he was much more than a sidekick and offered multiple ways to drive product innovation for the 'Lightyear' line. Plus, we have a few cat people on the team who were smitten."[52]
Legoreleased three sets based on scenes from the film, which were released on April 24, 2022.[57]On May 29, 2022,Ferrariannounced thatLightyearwould be a sponsor on their cars starting at the2022 Monaco Grand Prix. In addition,Charles LeclercandCarlos Sainz Jr.would also be cast for roles in the film, respectively voicing for the Italian and Spanish versions.[58]American food manufacturing companyLightlife, collaborated with Disney and Pixar for launching several food packages inspired from the film. It also planned for a sweepstake promotion, which enable customers to win several prizes, including private film screening and Disney merchandises.[59][60]Singapore-basedWE Cinemasannounced the debut of "Lightyear Premium Pack" with refreshments marketed with stills and images from the film.[61]A half-hour-long documentaryfeaturetteentitledBeyond Infinity: Buzz and the Journey to Lightyearwas released on theDisney+streaming service on June 10 in anticipation of the film's release, chronicling the conception and production ofLightyear.[62]
Lightyearpremiered at theEl Capitan TheatreinHollywood, Los Angeles, on June 8, 2022,[63]and was theatrically released in the United States on June 17, 2022,[64][65]byWalt Disney Studios Motion Picturesin RealD 3D, 4DX, Dolby Cinema, and IMAX formats.[66][64]It is Pixar's first film sinceOnward(2020) to receive a theatrical release afterSoul(2020),Luca(2021) andTurning Red(2022) were assigned direct-to-streaming releases onDisney+in response to theclosure of cinemas due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[67][68]Lightyearalso became Pixar's first film to have virtual IMAX cameras in its progress.[69]
Lightyearwas banned in theMuslim world(includingBahrain,Brunei,[70]Egypt,Iraq,Jordan,Kazakhstan,[71]Kuwait,Lebanon,Malaysia,Oman,Palestine,Qatar,Saudi Arabia,Syria,Tunisia,[72]and theUnited Arab Emirates)[73][74][75]due to a scene featuring a same-sex kiss between Uzo Aduba's female character Alisha Hawthorne and her partner Kiko.[76]ThePeople's Republic of China(PRC) also requested that the scene in question be removed;[77][78]however Disney declined to make the cuts.[79]Indonesiastated that they did not ban the film, "but suggested the owner of the movie think about their audience in Indonesia where an LGBT kissing scene is still considered sensitive."[75]InSingapore, the scene resulted in the film being allowed only for people above 16 years of age (NC-16).[80]Despite bans across most of the Arab world,Moroccorefused to ban the film and showed it in cinemas, despite a petition requesting a ban on the film.[81][82]
The specific scene was initially cut from the film in mid-March 2022, but following then-Disney CEOBob Chapek's response to Florida'sParental Rights in Education billand the internal polarizing uproar it caused within Disney, the scene was reinstated.[83][84]Speaking toVariety, Evans stated about the scene: "it's nice, and it's wonderful, it makes me happy. It's tough to not be a little frustrated that it even has to be a topic of discussion [...] The goal is that we can get to a point where it is the norm, and that this doesn't have to be some uncharted waters, that eventually this is just the way it is. That representation across the board is how we make films."[85]
Lightyearwas made available onDisney+on August 3, 2022, with the option to view the theatrical version of the film or the IMAX Enhanced version.[86][87]The film was also released onDisney+ Hotstarin Indonesia and Malaysia as the film did not release theatrically in these territories following the demand of removing the same-sex kiss.[88]The movie was released under the ratings of 18+ for Malaysia and 21+  for Indonesia (both Indonesian and Malaysian equivalents of the adults-onlyNC-17), with mature content warning included prior to the start of the film.IGN Southeast Asiaalso confirmed that the same-sex relationship remained untouched, even for the previously mentioned same-sex kiss.[89]Disney+ in theMiddle East and North Africaregion (excludingIsrael) did not include the film as they decided to align with local censorship rules, meaning that content aimed at children that include LGBTQIA+ references, including this film, will not be released in these territories.[90]
It was streamed by 1.7 million U.S. households during its first five days on Disney+ according toSamba TV.[91]According toNielsen, it was viewed for 1.3 billion minutes and ranked third overall in streaming titles for the week.[92]Its viewership fell sharply in the second week to 700 million minutes, with the film being positioned tenth overall and third among all streaming films.[93]

According toWhip Media,Lightyearwas the 2nd most watched movie in the United States across all platforms, during the weekend of August 5, 2022, to August 7, 2022.[95]According to the streaming aggregator Reelgood,Lightyearwas the 10th most watched program across all platforms, during the week of August 12, 2022.[96]According toNielsen Holdings,Lightyearwas the 9th most streamed movie across all platforms, during the week of August 29, 2022, to September 4, 2022.[97]
Lightyearwas the most watched movie worldwide on Disney+ in August 2022.[98]It was on the number one spot on the platform for 35 days consecutively.[99]
Lightyeargrossed $118.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $108.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $226.4 million.[1][2]It was the fourth highest-grossing animated film of 2022 in the U.S. and the fifth worldwide.[100]Deadline Hollywoodcalculated the film lost the studio $106million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[101]
In the United States and Canada,Lightyearwas projected to gross $70–85 million from 4,255 theaters in its opening weekend, with some estimates reaching as high as $105 million.[19][102][103]However, after making $20.7 million on its first day (including $5.2 million from Thursday night previews), estimates were lowered to $51–55 million. It went on to debut to $50.6 million, finishing second behind holdoverJurassic World Dominion.[104]Additionally, the film earned $34.6 million from 43 international markets, bringing its worldwide three-day debut to $85.2 million.[105]In its second weekend,Lightyeardeclined 64.1% to $18.2 million,[106]the second-lowest sophomore drop for a Pixar film afterOnward(73%), which opened at the onset of the pandemic.[107]
BothDeadline HollywoodandVarietyattributed the performance to competition fromJurassic World DominionandTop Gun: Maverick, though ultimately noted it as a disappointment given the brand strength of both Pixar and theToy Storyfranchise.[102][108]Los Angeles Timeswriter Ryan Faughnder believed that the film was at a disadvantage, since, as a spin-off film, it did not have well-knownToy Storycharacters such asWoody. He also noted that spin-offs tend to not gross as much as the main franchise installments, and compared the film to the spin-off filmsSolo: A Star Wars Story(2018) andHobbs & Shaw(2019).[109]Pamela McClintock ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote that, in addition to competition fromJurassic World DominionandTop Gun: Maverick, the lackluster opening was attributed to brand confusion in the film's marketing.[110]McClintock, Martha Ross ofThe Mercury News, andThe Washington Post's Sonny Bunch also questioned if the response from people over the inclusion of alesbiancouple kissing and the decision not to castTim Allenin the role of Buzz Lightyear were the reasons for the film's low opening.[110][111][112]Other box office analysts believed family audiences might have not shown up to theaters after becoming accustomed to the availability of Pixar films at home after their three previous films,Soul(2020),Luca(2021), andTurning Red(2022), were released directly toDisney+during the pandemic.[108][113]Some box office analysts theorized that family audiences were reluctant to attend theaters in general due to COVID-19 concerns, although this was disproven afterMinions: The Rise of Gruopened to $107 million in the U.S. and Canada two weeks later.[114][115][116]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 74% of 319 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website's consensus reads: "Lightyearsettles for being a rather conventional origin story instead of reaching for the stars, but this gorgeously animated adventure ably accomplishes its mission of straightforward fun."[117]It is the lowest rated film of theToy Storyfranchiseon Rotten Tomatoes.[102]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 60 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[118]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an overall positive score of 85% (including an average 4 out of 5 stars), with 62% saying they would definitely recommend it.[102]
Peter Bradshaw's four-star review forThe Guardianstated: "This cracking origin story forToy Story's spaceman hero is fun and clever and reminds us why we loved Pixar in the first place."[119]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reportercalled it "a funny spinoff with suspense and heart, a captivatingly spirited toon take on splashy live-action retro popcorn entertainment."[120]Emma Stefansky ofThrillistsaid: "There's plenty inLightyearto enjoy, and it's one of Pixar's better efforts over the last 10 years, but it ultimately feels half-done. It feels like it ought to be the beginning of something, like its narrative is a prologue stretched into a feature awaiting the much more interesting second and third and fifth installments down the road."[121]RogerEbert.com-based critic Odie Henderson praised the score who called it as "one of Giacchino's best scores" and "a delectable spoof of bombastic space movie music that elevates every scene it plays under".[122]Valerie Complex ofDeadline Hollywoodstated: "Lightyeardoes not rely too much onToy Storylore to build its world, but it would have benefited from showing some connection to that part of the franchise instead of using title cards." She further praised the technical aspects, and wrote: "The animation is gorgeous and hyper-realistic. The art department put their all into designing this universe and its characters and robotic villains," but criticized the screenplay saying "sometimes the story becomes convoluted and drags on, almost like there was a need to pad the runtime, causingLightyearto get into even more trouble and creating a never-ending slew of trampling obstacles."[123]
Variety'sOwen Gleibermanwrote: "Lightyearin its eminently conventional and likable way, is a far less audacious movie than that. For what is surely not the first time,Buzz's I-can-do-anything myopic bravado has failed [...] part of that may be that in theToy Storyfilms, heisa toy — that's part of the joke, one that Buzz is never quite in on. He thinks he's a real Space Ranger! So when you actually turn Buzz Lightyear into a Space Ranger, you enlarge him and diminish him at the same time."[124]In contrast,BBC's Nicholas Barber wrote: "The story is thin, repetitive, and almost entirely dependent on the heroes being clumsy" and gave the film two stars.[125]David Ehrlich ofIndieWirewrote: "Lightyearremains firmly stuck in the past even as it hurtles toward the future. And while screenwriters Jason Headley andAngus MacLaneneed that push-pull in order to tell a story about reconciling the lure of nostalgia with the potential for something new, it's hard for a movie to sell us on living in the moment when every scene feels like it's settling for less."[126]Kaleem Aftab ofTime Outcalled the film "a franchise low, Pixar's metaToy Storyspin-off gets lost in space."[127]The film has received criticism from some conservatives, who have argued that the film's scene with a same-sex kiss is inappropriate for children, saying thatDisneysexualizes them.[128]
When asked aboutLightyearin 2023, Pixar's chief creative officerPete Docterstated that while the studio "love[s] the characters and the premise", he believed "we asked too much of the audience. When they hear Buzz, they're like, great, where's Mr. Potato Head andWoodyand Rex? And then we drop them into this science fiction film that they're like,What? [...] it was just a little too distant, both in concept, and I think in the way that characters were drawn, that they were portrayed. [...] the characters in 'Toy Story' are much broader, and so I think there was a disconnect between what people wanted/expected and what we were giving to them."[129]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle. Its first film appearance was with the release ofStrange World.[60]The logo received widespread praise from critics and audiences and won Gold in the "Theatrical | Film: Design" medium at the 2023Clio Entertainment Awardsin November 2023. The standard version of the logo premiered theatrically withThe Beach Boys.[61]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
