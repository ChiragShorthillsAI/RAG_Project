Albus DumbledoreandGellert Grindelwaldbriefly meet in aMuggleteashop, where they acknowledge their mutual feelings. Grindelwald vows to destroy the Muggle world, but Dumbledore denounces the plan as madness, saying he only supported it because he was in love with Grindelwald.
In 1932,Kweilinprefecture of China,Newt Scamanderhelps aqilin— a magical creature that can see into one's soul as well as the future — give birth.[7]Apparatingin,Credenceleads Rosier and Carrow to attack and kill the mother, then kidnap the newborn. Unbeknownst to them, the qilin has twins, the younger of which Newt saves before collapsing exhausted. Awyvernfrom his travelling menagerie flies them all away.
Grindelwald's acolytes arrive to Nurmengard and give Grindelwald the qilin and he cuts its throat; intending to harness its ability of precognition.Queenie Goldsteinsurreptitiously observes his actions with shock and later talks with Credence and confesses that she does not tell Grindelwald everything.
Unable to battle Grindelwald due to a blood pact they formed when young, Albus Dumbledore recruits Newt and his brother Theseus, who runs theaurorsin Britain, to thwart Grindelwald's plan for world domination. After Queenie’s defection to Grindelwald, Jacob Kowalski is continuing with his life as baker, but his heart is not in it. On behalf of Dumbledore,IlvermornyCharms teacher Lally Hicks recruits Jacob and using a bookportkey, travel to a Berlin-bound train to join Newt.Tina Goldsteinis very busy with the heading upMinistry of Magicand so cannot join them. Newt relays Dumbledore’s plan to defeat Grindelwald to them, along with Theseus, Senegalese-French wizard Yusuf Kama, and Newt's assistantBunty Broadacre. He gives Jacob a fake wand; Theseus, a red and gold tie; Lally, a book; and Bunty, a note.
In Berlin, Bunty goes off to have Newt’s suitcase copied with six identical ones. Yusuf is planted as a spy in Grindelwald's inner circle. Grindelwald has Queenie use herlegilimencyto test Yusuf's trustworthiness, believing her validation. Despite, on Dumbledore’s behalf,  Newt's attempt to persuade into doing otherwise, the outgoing SupremeMugwumpof the International Confederation of Wizards (ICW) Anton Vogel acquits Grindelwald of all previous criminal charges, allowing him to run in the elections for the head of the ICW in a three-way competition against Vicência Santos and Liu Tao.
Grindelwald and his acolytes have already infiltrated and undermined the GermanMinistry of Magicand they arrest Theseus. Dumbledore apparates in and dispatches Newt to the Erkstag, the secret German wizarding prison where Theseus is held. Using his talents with creatures, Newt and Theseus flee from a giantmanticorein the heart of Erkstag and use a tie portkey to escape.
Grindelwald plots to assassinate the competing Brazilian candidate, Santos, but Lally uses Jacob with his fake wand as a diversion to successfully prevent this and escape using Dumbledore's book portkey afterwards, though Jacob is then framed for attempting to murder Grindelwald who uses this to justify the suppression of all Muggles.
Credence tracks down in the streets of Berlin and, in amirror world, battles Dumbledore but is quickly disarmed by the much more able older man. Credence learns he is the illegitimate son of Albus's younger brother,Aberforth Dumbledoreand he starts to question his loyalty to Grindelwald.
Wizarding world leaders gather inBhutanfor the election of a new Supreme Mugwump of the ICW, at which a "Walk of the Qilin" ritual, a qilin will judge who (if any) of the candidates is pure of heart, takes place, after which the witches and wizards around the world will cast their votes. Usingnecromancy, Grindelwald reanimates the dead qilin and, knowing Dumbledore and Newt will bring the surviving qilin twin to the ritual, gives Credence a last chance to redeem himself by destroying it. To thwart Grindelwald's cohorts, each ally of Dumbledore carries an identical suitcase, with only one containing the qilin.
After all reconvening atHogwarts, the team travel one by one, each with a duplicate suitcase, via a portkey to the ICW vote in Bhutan. On arrival, they are confronted by Grindelwald's followers who target the cases, but Dumbledore hasbooby-trappedthem. Jacob convinces Queenie to come back from Grindelwald, but they are caught. Vogel uses the manipulated dead qilin to bow to Grindelwald during the selection ceremony, and so the latter is subsequently elected as the new Supreme Mugwump. Whereupon, he declares war on all Muggles and tortures Jacob with theCruciatus curseuntil Santos intervenes. Against Vogel’s protestations, Newt and Bunty expose Grindelwald by revealing that the qilin is dead, backed up by Credence. Bunty, who has the real suitcase, produces the surviving qilin. The election is voided so a new, fair election can occur. The living qilin passes by Grindelwald and bows to Dumbledore. Shocked, Dumbledore thanks the qilin for the honour but convinces it that there is another equally worthy. The qilin goes on to bow to Santos, who is then elected as the new Supreme Mugwump instead. Enraged, Grindelwald tries to kill Credence, who is simultaneously protected by Aberforth and Albus. Dumbledore's and Grindelwald's clashing spells break the blood pact and their ensuing battle results in a stalemate, on which Grindelwald disapparates. In the aftermath, Aberforth accepts the dying Credence as his son and takes him home to Hogsmeade.
As a coda, at his New York bakery, Jacob and Queenie have a small wedding ceremony with a few guests and while preparing his speech Newt steps outside asTina Goldsteinarrives and spots Dumbledore watching from across the street. Dumbledore thanks Newt before disappearing into the night.

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros.

Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]

Yates is a founding member ofDirectors UK.[7]He has had a close partnership withWarner Bros.as a director and producer.[8]
David was born on 8 October 1963 inSt Helens,Lancashire, England.[n 1]His parents died when he was young.[9]Raised in the village ofRainhill, Yates was inspired to pursue a career in filmmaking after watchingSteven Spielberg's 1975 movieJaws.[1]Yates's mother bought him aSuper 8mm camera. He used this to shoot various films in which his friends and family featured.[10]One such film,The Ghost Ship, was shot on board the vessel where his uncle worked as a cook.[11]He attended Grange Park High School,[12]St Helens Collegeand then theUniversity of Essex.[13][14][15]Yates said that he "used to skive off college all the time" and never expected to attend university before being surprised by his A-Level exam results. While at the University of Essex, Yates formed the Film and Video Production Society.[16]He graduated with aBAin Government in 1987.[17]
In 1988, Yates made his first filmWhen I Was a GirlinSwindon. The film entered the festival circuit where it was namedBest Short Filmat theSan Francisco International Film Festival. It contributed towards Yates's acceptance into theNational Film and Television Schoolin 1989 and led to theBBChiring him to directOranges and Lemons, a short drama film in 1991. Before completing film school, he began to direct, produce and write the screenplay to the dramatic shortThe Weaver's Wife. He also made his fourth short film,Good Looks, which was presented at theChicago International Film Festival. After graduating in 1992, Yates directed an episode of the film studies programmeMoving Pictures.[10][13][19][20][21][22]
From 1994 to 1995, Yates directed several episodes of theITVpolice proceduralThe Billbefore directing and producing three episodes of the television documentaryTale of Three Seaside Townsalongside producer Alistair Clarke. The programme followed media personalitiesRussell Grant,Honor BlackmanandPam Ayresvisiting and exploring theSouth Coasttowns ofBrighton,EastbourneandWeymouth.[23][24]Yates directed his fifth short filmPunchbefore making his feature film debut in 1998 with the release of the independent historical-drama filmThe Tichborne Claimant. The film, which was shown at theEdinburgh International Film Festival, was written by Joe Fisher and based on the true events of theTichborne Case. It starredStephen FryandRobert Hardyand was shot on location inMerseysideand on theIsle of Man.[25][26][27]
Yates returned to television in 2000 to direct the episodes ofGreed,EnvyandLustfor the BBC miniseriesThe Sins, starringPete Postlethwaite, as well asThe Way We Live Now, the four-part television adaptation of thenovel of the same namebyAnthony Trollope. Yates shared theBritish Academy Television Award for Best Drama Serialwith screenwriterAndrew Daviesand producerNigel Stafford-Clarkat the2002 BAFTA Awards.[28]
One year later, Yates attended the56th BAFTA Awardswith aBritish Academy Film Award nomination for Best Short Filmfor the fourteen-minute production,Rank, which expressed the social elements of racism, friendship and adolescence through the story of a street gang that crossGlasgowto witness the arrival of a group of Somali refugees.[29][30]Yates said that even thoughThe Way We Live Nowwas "a very big production" and "enormous fun to do",Rankwas an opportunity to "shake all that off" and "get back to [his] roots". Of the casting, Yates said that he "wanted to use non-actors to tell the story, to create a reality ... the kids we cast in Glasgow had never done a film before."[10]The film was noted for its gritty style and cinematography, with a review fromEye For Filmstating that "such intelligent use of camera and cast lifts Yates out of the pool of promising young directors into the front line of genuine hopefuls. This work demands respect."[19][31]
The 2003 six-part thrillerState of Playwas Yates's next achievement.[5]Yates collected the TV Spielfilm Award at theCologne Conferencein Germany and won theDirectors Guild of Great Britain Awardfor Outstanding Directorial Achievement.[3][32]The serial was recognised by various award ceremonies, receiving thePeabody Awardfor Broadcasting Excellence and being presented with twoBritish Academy Television Craft Awards.[33]The quality of the serial sparked Hollywood film bosses to consideradapting it into a film, with producerAndrew Hauptmandeclaring that "it's a blistering political thriller and we want to make an equally blistering movie."[34]State of Playis regarded by critics fromThe GuardianandThe Timesas one of the best British television dramas of the 2000s.[35][36][37]
Yates directed the television adaptation of nine-year-oldDaisy Ashford's novelThe Young Visiters, starringJim BroadbentalongsideHugh Laurie. According to a review byVarietymagazine forBBC America, Yates and his team yielded "a warm and surprisingly unsentimental production that has 'evergreen' written all over it".[38]
In 2004, Yates's two-part dramaSex Trafficwas broadcast onChannel 4. It won eight BAFTA Awards includingBest EditingforMark Day, who regularly worked with Yates on many of his television projects and short films. Day commented on his collaboration with Yates saying that "we are very good friends because we have spent so much time together". He also said, "David shoots in a similar style from piece to piece, although this wasn’t quite as frantic asState of Play."[39]Yates was nominated for another Directors Guild of Great Britain Award for his direction ofSex Trafficand won his second BAFTA for Best Drama Serial at the British Academy Television Awards.[40]Being a British-Canadian production,Sex Trafficgained four wins at Canada's annual television award ceremony, theGemini Awards, including Best Dramatic Miniseries. Spanning across two parts, the three-hour-long drama reveals how thetrafficking of young womeninto slavery is a big business which operates throughout Europe; both parts were acclaimed for their "shocking" portrayal of such a sensitive topic.[41][42][43]
Also in 2004, Yates was involved in plans for a film adaptation ofEvelyn Waugh's novelBrideshead RevisitedforWarner Independent Pictures. He was set to work withPaul Bettany,Jude LawandJennifer Connellyon the project, but pulled out in the later stages due to constant budget issues affecting the film's production.[44][45]
Yates then directedRichard Curtis' script toThe Girl in the Café, a television film starringBill NighyandKelly Macdonald. In June 2005, the film was aired on the BBC in Britain and was also broadcast in the United States onHome Box Office.The Girl in the Caféachieved three wins at theEmmy Awards, including thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Made for Television Movie, and gained a total of four nominations includingOutstanding Directingfor Yates.[13][46][47]
During the period of working on plans forBrideshead Revisited, Yates was told by his agent that he had made the director shortlist for the fifth film in theHarry Potterseriesand that Warner Bros. was eyeing him to direct. Shortly after, he was confirmed to directHarry Potter and the Order of the PhoenixbyWarner Bros. Pictures, with production scheduled to begin in early 2006.[45][48]When asked how Yates got the job, producerDavid Heyman("a big fan" of Yates's television work)[49]said that "actors in David's television projects give their best performance, often of their career. It's important to keep pushing the actors, particularly the young ones on eachPotterfilm. This is a political film, not with a capital P, but it's about teen rebellion and the abuse of power. David has made films in the U.K. about politics without being heavy handed."[50]
Before production began, Yates invitedHarry Potter and the Goblet of FiredirectorMike Newellto a pub and "picked his brains about what it was going to be like to step into someone's shoes on a movie of this scale".[3]The first scene that Yates shot featured agiantinteracting with human characters. The scene was the very first high-scalevisual effectspiece Yates filmed in his career.[3][51]After the film's post-production material was well received by the studio, Yates was chosen to direct the sixth film,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which according to Yates was going to be "a cross between the chills ofPrisoner of Azkaban[the third film in the series] and the fantastical adventure ofGoblet of Fire".[6][44]
In 2007,Order of the Phoenixopened to positive reviews and commercial success. Yates won the title ofBest Directorat theEmpire Awardsand collected thePeople's Choice Awardfrom theEuropean Film Academy.[52]However, the film was criticised by fans of the series for having the shortest running time out of the five released instalments; Yates said that the original director's cut was "probably over three hours", resulting in much footage being cut, condensed and edited to fit within the studio's preferred time frame.[53][54]
During production ofHalf-Blood Prince, Warner Bros. executiveAlan F. Hornannounced that the seventh and final novel in the series,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was to be split into two cinematic parts with Yates, once again, as the director.[55]Yates spoke of the decision to appoint him as the director of the final films, remarking that "they wanted to do aHarry Potterthat felt ... more grown up. What's smart about the studio and the producers is they have always wanted to push it a bit.Chris Columbusdid a wonderful job of casting and making this world incredibly popular. But rather than do more of the same, they said, 'Let's bring inAlfonso Cuarónand let him run with it. Then later, let's bring in David Yates, who's done all this hard-hitting stuff on TV.' It's a testament to their ambition to try to keep the franchise fresh. The bizarre thing is, I did one [film] and they asked me to stay for three more, so obviously they liked something."[3]
Half-Blood Princewas released in 2009 and became the only film in the series to earn anAcademy Awardnomination forBest Cinematography.[56][57]Yates worked alongside French cinematographerBruno Delbonnelon, what Yates called, extensively colour grading the "incredibly rich" picture by making it look "very European" and drawing influences from the Dutch painterRembrandt.[58][59][60]The film garnered a mix of accolades and was acclaimed for its stylised character-driven approach, but some fans complained about the script's deviation from the novel and the film's slightromantic comedynature.[61]In response to this criticism, BAFTA member and film criticMark Kermodepraised Yates's direction and ranked the film "second best" in the series, behindPrisoner of Azkaban.[62]
Yatesbegan to filmDeathly Hallows – Part 1andDeathly Hallows – Part 2back-to-back in early 2009 and finished reshoots in late 2010.[63]He stated that he had shot the two parts of the final adaptation differently, with Part 1 being a "road movie" and "quite real", "almost like avéritédocumentary", while Part 2 is "more operatic, colourful andfantasy-oriented", a "big opera with huge battles."[64][65][66]Yates reshot the final scene of theHarry Potterseries atLeavesden Studiosafter the original version, filmed atLondon King's Cross railway station, did not meet his expectations. In the film, the scene takes place at the magicalPlatform 9¾.[67]
Part 1 was released worldwide in November 2010 to commercial success along with generally positive reviews, some of which reflected on Yates's directing style.The Dallas Morning Newsaffirmed that "David Yates' fluid, fast-paced direction sends up the crackling tension of a thriller" andThe New York Timesanalysed Yates's approach to J. K. Rowling's character development by saying that he has "demonstrated a thorough, uncondescending sympathy for her characters, in particular the central trio ofRon Weasley,Hermione GrangerandHarry Potterhimself."[68][69]The film was praised for its "dark" atmosphere and its loyalty to the source material, but it was criticised for its slow middle act, the handling of exposition, and the somewhat disjointed pacing.[70][71]
Part 2 was screened in July 2011 and became an instant record-breaking success with critical acclaim.[72][73]The Daily Telegraphdescribed Part 2 as "monumental cinema awash with gorgeous tones" andTotal Filmwrote that Yates combines "spectacle and emotion into a thrilling final chapter."[74][75]Author J. K. Rowling remarked that "everyone who watchesDeathly Hallows – Part 2is going to see that he's steered us home magnificently. It's incredible."[76][77]Part 2 is one of twoHarry Potterfilms to pass the $1 billion mark during its original theatrical run; it became thehighest-grossingfilm in the series and the highest-grossing film of 2011, making Yates the director of the highest-grossing non-James Cameronfilm of all time in August 2011.[78][79]Amongst other accolades, Yates won his second Empire Award for Best Director and joined the principal creative team ofHarry Potterin receiving the 2012ADG Award for Outstanding Contribution to Cinematic Imageryfor their work onDeathly Hallows – Part 2and the series in general.[80]

Rowling, David Heyman, Mike Newell, Alfonso Cuarón,David Barron,Rupert Grint, andEmma Watsonin collecting theMichael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinemaon behalf of theHarry Potterfilms.Daniel Radcliffe, who portrayed the films' titular character, commented on working with Yates, saying that he "added his own sense of grit and realism [to the series] that perhaps wasn't there so much before. I think we all had a fantastic time working with David. I know we did."[1][81]
By 2012, Yates was working on a fewWarner Bros.projects, including aTarzanfeature film and anAl Caponebiopic calledCicero.[82][83]He also controversially said that he was working withBBC Worldwideon plans to develop aDoctor Whofilm,[84]although this was denied by the showrunner,Steven Moffat, in July 2012.[85]Because of production delays, Yates began to explore other projects including television work.[86]
In 2013, he returned to television by signing on to direct thetelevision pilotofTyrant, an American drama production set against the US–Middle East conflict.[87]The following year, Yates began shootingThe Legend of Tarzan, starringAlexander Skarsgård,Samuel L.

He wrote and directed the filmThe Fabulous Baker Boysand is mainly known for his screenplay adaptations of novels, especially for all but one of theHarry Potterfilms(the exception beingThe Order of the Phoenix) and forWonder Boys, for which he was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.
Kloves, born inAustin, Texas, grew up inSunnyvale, California,[2]where he graduated fromFremont High School.  He attended theUniversity of California, Los Angelesbut dropped out when he was not admitted into thefilm schoolin his third year.[2]
As an unpaidinternfor a Hollywood agent, he gained attention for a screenplay he wrote calledSwings.  This led to a meeting where he successfully pitchedRacing with the Moon(1984).[2]
His first experience with professional screenwriting left him wanting more interaction with the actors so that the characters would stay true to his vision.[2]Kloves wroteThe Fabulous Baker Boysand also intended it to be his directorial debut.  After years of trying to sell the project in Hollywood, the film finally got off the ground and was released in 1989.[2]The Fabulous Baker Boysdid reasonably well and was critically acclaimed, but his next shot as writer/director forFlesh and Bonein 1993 fared poorly at the box office. Kloves then stopped writing for three years.[2]
Realizing that he had to return to writing to support his family, he began adaptingMichael Chabon's novelWonder Boysinto a screenplay.[2]Kloves was offered the chance to direct but he declined, preferring to direct only his own original work.[2]This was his first try at adapting another work to film.[2]His screenplay was nominated for aGolden Globeand anAcademy Awardafter the film's release in 2000.
Warner Bros.sent Kloves a list of novels that the company was considering to adapt as films. The listing included thefirstHarry Potternovel, which intrigued him despite his usual indifference to these catalogs.[2]He went on to write the screenplays for the first four films in the series. However, he turned down writing the fifth film, stating that "The fourth film,Goblet of Fire, was really hard to do. I wrote on it for two years. But it’s not that simple and I don't know that I'll ever fully understand why I didn't do it."[3]AfterMichael Goldenbergwrote the screenplay for the fifth film, Kloves then returned to write the sixth, seventh and eighth installments.
In 2011, Kloves was attached to work on a film adaptation ofMark Haddon's novelThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.
Since 2016, Kloves produced theFantastic Beastsfilms, a spinoff prequel series to the mainHarry Potterseries. Kloves co-wrote the third installment withJ.K. Rowling.[4]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
