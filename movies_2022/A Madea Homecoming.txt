When Agnes asks "Why do you all look like you have yourknickersin a bunch?", everyone mishears "knickers" as "niggers". She lifts her skirt to explain that "knickers" are underwear.
They go to dinner at Red Lobster, where Cora gives Brown candy from Madea's purse for his blood sugar levels. Madea irritates Cora by reminiscing about her days as astripper. Madea tries to show the restaurant is full of strippers by shouting a line from "Up", whereupon nearly all of the women reply.
Joe arrives wearingBlack Lives Mattermemorabilia and resumes insulting Ellie over her police job. Back at the house Tim's father Richard has been waiting. Madea fires her gun without warning, making Joedefecatein his leather pants.

In 2019, Perry celebrated the grand opening of his newest Atlanta studio location, having purchased 330 acres (130 ha) of the formerFort McPhersoncomplex in 2015 to make it the new home of Tyler Perry Studios.[3]Tyler Perry Studios is one of the largest film production studios in the United States, and established Perry as the first African-American to outright own a major film production studio.[4]Through 34th Street Films, a production arm of Tyler Perry Studios, Perry guides the work of other filmmakers.[5]
In 2018, Perry sold his previous studio location opened in 2008 to anotherminority-ownedfilm production company.[6][7]The previous studio location occupied two formerDelta Air Linesaffiliated buildings in theGreenbriararea of southwest Atlanta, and included 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2) of sets and office space.[8]
Tyler Perry Studios is a notable resource for Atlanta's robust economy.[9][10]The company often advertises for film and crew positions at its southwest Atlanta location.[11]
Perry has full ownership of his films, andLions Gate Entertainmentused to serve as his distributor for all of his films starting fromDiary of a Mad Black WomantoA Madea Family Funeral. After signing his deal withParamount Global, Perry's films are now distributed byParamount PicturesandNetflixstarting withNobody's FoolandA Fall from Grace.[12]His first film,Diary of a Mad Black Woman, produced on a budget of $5.5 million, became an unexpected commercial success prompting widespread discussion among industry watchers about whether middle-class African-Americans were simply not being addressed by mainstreamHollywoodmovies. Its final gross box office receipts were $50.6 million, although it was critically panned scoring only 16 percent approval rating on the websiteRotten Tomatoes.[13]On its opening weekend, February 24, 2006, Perry's film version ofMadea's Family Reunionopened at No. 1 with $30.3 million. The film eventually grossed $65 million and, likeDiary, almost all of it in the United States.

Perry is expecting the entertainment district to be completed in 2025.[22][23]In February 2024, Perry announced his $800 million expansion project which included additional soundstages is temporarily on hold due to his concerns that rapid advances in video-relatedartificial intelligencecould reduce demand for traditional filmmaking. Perry wants the filmmaking industry to galvanize as one voice and lobby for legislation to regulate artificial intelligence in Hollywood.[24]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
