Amber is a dissatisfied manager at Tuscan Grove anItalianchain restaurantinBakersfield, California. After being recommended by her boss, Amber receives an all-expenses-paid trip to Italy to participate in Tuscan Grove's management program, and meet the CEO, Nick Martucci. Her friend, Emily, predicts that Amber will find love. Once in Italy, program supervisor Craig takes all the participant's passports. Despite the rustic images shown online, they stay in a company-ownedmotel, and are told they cannot leave the property without permission. The group begins classes with head chef Liz Bence, which are interrupted by the arrival of Nick, and his assistant Kat. Nick reacts strangely upon meeting Amber, saying she resembles his late sister.
Kat pulls Amber out of the lesson and invites her to a bar inLucca, but the plan is overheard by Deb, who tells the other managers, turning the outing into an evening at the "bar" on the Tuscan Grove campus. The following morning, Kat wakes Amber up early and drives her to a yacht, where Nick is waiting. The two have an intimate conversation and kiss. Nick then invites Amber to a party, but tells her not to tell the rest of the group. The next day, Kat takes Amber to the party inRigoli, where she shares a dance with the host Ricky's son and as a result is accosted by his lover. Kat takes her from away from the party and to a club and diner. The two kiss, but Amber stops them; Kat tells Amber that Nick is selfish, and that Amber is not the only woman that he has done this with. Amber awakens the next morning alone in the van. Later that day, she sees Kat driving off with Susie.
Susie is not at the class the following day, and Jen soon leaves, leading Amber to share her suspicions that something is not right with fellow manager Dana. Dana suggests that Nick is the mastermind, but Amber refuses to believe it, blaming Kat. Dana sneaks into the program office and finds pictures of former members, almost all of whom are women. He speculates that he and Fran were chosen because their names caused them to be mistaken for women. Amber sees Nick leaving with Jen and follows them, confronting Nick at his yacht. Nick accuses Amber of trying to push him away, and reveals that he fired Kat, calling her unstable. Amber and Dana demand their passports back from Craig, who encourages them not to "rock the boat". After Nick arrives during a group game ofMafia, Dana confronts him about his impropriety. Nick breaks down, saying that he envisioned Tuscan Grove as a high-end restaurant, only for it to turn into afast casualchain. In the evening, Dana sneaks out to a party at Nick's on-site villa, where he sees men withautomatic weapons. He returns with Amber, and they see Liz Bence, who has not been seen in days, bound and gagged inside. Dana leaves to rescue her, but is heard screaming. When Amber arrives, she finds Deb kneeling over his unconscious body. She returns to the motel and gets Fran; the two of them discover what appears to be Jen's dead body in her bed.
Amber and Fran return to the villa and find a barely-conscious Dana, who reveals that he was attacked by a pack ofwild boars. They go into the villa to hide, but discover anorgyhappening inside, attended by Nick, members of his family, Liz Bence, and attendees of Ricky's party, all filmed by Craig. The party is interrupted as the pack of boars stampede into the house, sending the guests scattering and allowing Amber to call the police. It is revealed that Jen was merely sleeping, not dead, and that Susie took a spontaneous trip toGenoa, explaining her disappearance. The members of the group return home, with Craig reminding them that they have all signed anon-disclosure agreements. Back in Bakersfield, Nick shows up unexpectedly at Tuscan Grove to ask for Amber's forgiveness, and for them to continue as a couple. She rebuffs him, and smiles as she returns to her work.
It was announced in May 2021 thatJeff Baenaand hisHorse Girlco-writer and starAlison Briewere reuniting forSpin Me Round. Like withHorse Girl, the pair co-wroteSpin Me Roundand Brie played the main role.Aubrey Plazareturned to act in the film, having not had a role inHorse Girl, withAlessandro Nivola,Molly ShannonandLil Rel Howeryalso announced in the cast. Filming began in Italy in June 2021.[3][4]The film marked the fourth time Baena had worked with Brie and Plaza for the big screen; Plaza also gave notes on the screenplay.[5]
Baena said that "the film is rooted in the expectation versus reality trope", which forms the basis for the main plot as well as other elements. One of these sub-plots – in which Amber (Brie) "had more sparks with Kat" (Plaza) than Nick (Nivola) – was added to the story when Baena and Brie noticed that Plaza's chemistry with the main character in another film (Happiest Season) was unexpectedly more popular than that of the character's love interest, and felt that Plaza could bring the same toSpin Me Round. As well as contributing to the theme of subverting expectations, Baena wanted to write a complicated character for Plaza to play as neither simply villain or victim.[5]
Spin Me Roundhad its world premiere at the2022 South by Southwestfestival on March 12, 2022.[6][7]It was released on August 19, 2022, byIFC Filmsin theaters[8]and byAMC+onvideo on demand.[9][10]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 47% based on 86 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "If it never quite lives up to its potential,Spin Me Roundremains a dizzily diverting comedy elevated by Alison Brie and Aubrey Plaza's performances."[10]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[11]

Linked page for 'Jeff Baena' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Baena):
Jeffrey Lance Baena(/ˈbeɪnə/; June 29, 1977 – January 3, 2025) was an American screenwriter and film director. His most successful films were 2004'sI Heart Huckabeesand 2020'sHorse Girl, though his projects to receive the most contemporary critical acclaim were the 2016 and 2017 filmsJoshyandThe Little Hours. Baena frequently worked with his wifeAubrey Plaza, writing partnerAlison Brie, andMolly Shannon.
He began his career as a screenwriter, co-writing the 2004 comedy filmI Heart Huckabeesand, around the same time, seeing his script forLife After Bethenter production before being shelved. Baena, as anindependent filmmaker, expanded to directing a decade later and filmedLife After Bethas his directorial debut, starring Aubrey Plaza and released in 2014. Working with producerLiz Destro, and reuniting with Plaza as well as an expanding group of frequent collaborators, Baena was then writer-director forJoshy(2016) andThe Little Hours(2017), which both became critically acclaimed and found acult audience.
Among the performers in these films was Alison Brie, with whom Baena struck up a writing partnership and created works produced byDuplass Brothers Productions. They made the 2020 psychological drama filmHorse Girltogether, Baena's most commercial film, followed by the television anthology seriesCinema Toast(2021) and Baena's final film, 2022'sSpin Me Round. His first films saw Baena implement his post-mumblecorestyle as an improvisation-heavy filmmaker, and his films co-written with Brie are marked by exploration of expectations in film form.
Jeffrey Lance Baena was born inMiamion June 29, 1977,[1][2]to Barbara (later Stern) and Scott Baena.[3]He was raised in asecular Jewishfamily[4][5]in the suburbs ofKendallandCoral Gables, where he enjoyed being surrounded byLatin and Caribbeancultures; he later said that he "felt a sense of community" there, a contrast to the negative perception of drug cartel violence.[6]His family was fromNew York Cityand had moved to Miami due to his father's work as a lawyer. Baena's parents were divorced, which he credited in part with informing his dark sense of comedy.[7]His first stepmother wasmanic depressiveand, under Florida'sBaker Act, was frequently institutionalized but then released, with Baena later commenting on systemic challenges in mental health care.[8]He had a brother and two step-siblings.[3]
AfterKillian High School,[9]Baena graduated from theNew York University Tisch School of the Artswith a degree in film, before moving toLos Angelesto pursue directing.[10]He, without really intending, achieved a minor inmedieval studiesat NYU after taking multiple classes when he "was hard-core into thealchemyshit",[5]and also took classes relating to philosophy.[7]
Baena was aproduction assistantfor filmmakerRobert ZemeckisonWhat Lies BeneathandCast Away(both 2000).[11][12]Both films were shot back-to-back and Zemeckis then took a production break, causing Baena to seek other employment.[13]He became an assistanteditorand, later,personal assistantfor writer-directorDavid O. Russell.[11][14]Baena was originally hired to help edit online documentaryBenny Hernandezbefore Russell asked him to contribute some writing ideas for it; the project was ultimately left unfinished.[13][15]After a year and a half of working together, a minor car accident injured one of Baena's eyes. Partially to keep his spirits up and pass the time during his recovery, Russell began discussing story ideas with Baena. The two ended upcollaborating on four scripts together, includingI Heart Huckabees, which Russell directed in 2004, andJay Roach'sMeet the Fockers(also 2004), for which they made uncredited revisions.[11][16]: 146–147The philosophicalI Heart Huckabeeswas noted for the ambition in its storytelling;[17][18][19][20]it was not a commercial success,[21][22]and polarized critics.[20][23]By 2005 it had become acult hit,[21][9]soon finding a place in the pop culture zeitgeist,[20]and in 2023Robbie Collinand Tim Robey wrote it was one of the bestbox-office bombs, citing its rewatchability two decades later.[24]
Before he began directing, Baena continued working as a screenwriter, mostly forstudio assignmentsandrewrites.[25][26]Warner Bros. Picturesappointed him the screenwriter for the comedyThe Awakening of Jean-Luc Barbarain 2006,[27][28]which was still in development in 2010.[29]He performed rewrites on Rami andEtan Cohen'sRevenge of the Jocks, a reverse take onRevenge of the Nerds, in 2011. At the same time he was writing an indieadaptation oftheErnest HemingwaymemoirA Moveable Feast.[30]Having always wanted to be a director, Baena considered screenwriting "a means to an end" and was critical of his own writing ability.[31]In 2012, he co-judged a short film script competition curated byRoman Coppola,[32]and played a version of himself in the filmThe End of Love;[33]a dramatization of actorMark Webber's life, Baena appeared inThe End of LovealongsideAubrey Plaza, his partner and Webber'sScott Pilgrim vs. the Worldco-star.[34][35]
Baena had planned for the comedy-dramaJoshyto be his directorial debut, but actor and collaboratorAdam Pallyhad to postpone for personal reasons. Baena then decided to work on the zombie comedyLife After Beth, from a script he started writing in 2003,[36]which became his debut.[37][38]This film had been in production but shelved shortly after it was written, and was only picked back up after comic actress Aubrey Plaza was looking for a role and her agent remembered the script; with Plaza attached, the production resumed.Flavorwirewrote that "Baena's control of the material is occasionally uncertain",[39]whileMark Kermodefelt Baena "kept things just the right side of believable, eschewing explanation in favour of cracked domesticity."[40]Life After Bethreceived mixed reviews; theRotten Tomatoes(RT) critics' consensus suggested the idea was too thin to sustain a whole film, though bolstered by Plaza's performance.[41]In 2016, it was ranked the 38th best everzombie filmand described as both "the bestzom-rom-comsinceShaun Of The Dead" and a "mumblecorerelationship break-up zomcom".[42]It premiered at theSundance Film Festivalin2014,[37][38]the same festival at whichJoshy, as Baena's second film, premiered in2016.[11]
AfterLife After Beth, Baena worked on adaptingLysergic, the autobiography ofKrystle Colethat he hadoptioned,[43][44]and suggested he might like to directDoctor Strangeas he was a fan ofthe character.[13]When production resumed onJoshy, Baena provided his large comedic cast with a 20-page outline, rather than a script, as an experiment to "keep people in the moment." Baena did not audition but cast people he knew would be able to work in such a film.[45]The film's RT critics' consensus highlighted Baena's direction for "strik[ing] a unique, disarmingly heartfelt blend of dark humor and tragedy".[46]TheLos Angeles Timespraised that despite its improvisational nature, "the film never feels unfocused or messy";[47]Christy Lemirefelt Baena's work had improved since his debut;[48]andGlenn Kennynoted Baena's skill in tonally dictating his film.[49]Joshywas ranked the fifth best ever mumblecore film separately by screenwriter Jason Hellerman and critic Mike Bedard,[50][51]with Bedard also describing it as "post-mumblecore".[52]
Jake Johnsonas well as some of Baena's filmmaker friends had acting roles inJoshy;[9]the previous year, Baena had similarly made a cameo in Johnson's 2015 filmDigging for Fire,[53]the premise of which was based on the strange things found when Johnson, Baena and friends had dug out Johnson's garden.[54]Joshywas also Baena's first film to feature actressAlison Brie, albeit briefly,[48]before she had a main role inThe Little Hours.Baena's third film, a 2017black comedy,The Little Hoursalso starred Plaza;[55]he wrote in aReddit AMAthat he "made this movie for [Plaza]",[56]for whom it was herproducingdebut[57]alongsideLiz Destroof Destro Films. Destro had produced Baena's previous films,[58]with Baena only starting development ofThe Little Hoursafter pitching it to her. Inspired by passages fromThe Decameron, which Baena had studied,[59]the film was again largely improvised and based in the disconnect of medieval beliefs to modern ones; Baena saw the potential for humor[5]and tragedy in this idea.[60]Reviews were impressed with how well the concept worked,[61][62][63][64]and praised Baena's comedic direction,[65][66][67]withMick LaSallewriting that "Baena combines a zany comic vision with a rare control of tone. [...] There's no winking or nudging, no straining for laughs. Baena devised the material, and he trusts it."[68]
Baena directed Brie two more times in the filmsHorse Girl(2020) andSpin Me Round(2022), which they co-wrote together. The latter also featured Plaza.[69][70]Both actresses were involved in different capacities in Baena's only television work,Cinema Toast, a 2021anthology seriesthat he created andexecutive produced. Baena wrote and directed episodes in the series, which reinterpretedpublic domainfootage to tell modern stories.[71][3]Baena and Brie were among the producers forCinema Toastand both of their co-written films, all of which were executive produced by theDuplass Brothers.[71][72][73]
Having formed a friendship after working on previous movies, and knowing of the creative risks Baena liked to take, Brie pitched the idea for a drama about fear of mental illness to him while on a hike. He had been suggesting that she play a "horse girl" character, and they realized they could combine the ideas to create what becameHorse Girl.[74]The pair pitched it to the Duplass Brothers, who joined and offered it toNetflix.[75]Baena and Brie wrote the screenplay together, and some of the film's dialogue was improvised. After premiering at Sundance in2020,Horse Girlbegan streaming on Netflix[76]and was the most commercially successful of Baena's works.[77]Reviews noted the use and subversion offormto inform the story,[78]which was generally praised[79][80][72]but also criticized by Adrian Horton inThe Guardian.[81]
The pair again chose to subvert expectations inSpin Me Round, the shoot of which was postponed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic in Italy. They used the delay to expand the film outline into a more detailed script.[82][83]The film combined comedy and thriller genres, and critics noted the story for "a provocative#MeToostatement".[73][83]Spin Me Roundsaw mixed reviews, its RT critics' consensus saying that "it never quite lives up to its potential" but is nevertheless enjoyable and elevated by Plaza and Brie.[84]The Hollywood Reporterfelt it was "amusing but the most lightweight" of Baena's films.[85]
Baena's films found a cult audience,[61]and critics appreciated the attention and care Baena gave to topics that were not frequently tackled in Hollywood films: Baena's films broadly deal with themes of grief, loss, love and mental health.[60][8][7]In his own words, he described them as "destabilizing, unmoored, and full of chaos";[82]literary authorWilliam Deresiewiczwrote they are "odd, generically hybrid, tonally complex".[86]Despite some similarities – his first two directorial efforts,Life After BethandJoshy, are comedies that explore how a character copes after the death of their partner[60][87][88]– and Baena's films all sharing "some unforeseen emotional kick", Ryan Gilbey wrote in an obituary forThe Guardianthat "the subjects and styles were strikingly dissimilar, a fact on which [Baena] prided himself" as he did not want to do the same thing again.[9]Baena enjoyed creative freedom to mix genres and expectations,[82]and preferred not to use labels for his works so as to not create expectations.[86]
He "never really audition[ed], ever" for his films, saying he was inspired byFederico Fellinichoosing performers based on seeing them in a more natural setting than a line reading. Baena created ideas of characters then, once he knew which actors he would use, would "try to build the part around them, and ... make it more true."[45]He ended up with a group of frequent collaborators, particularly Brie, Plaza andMolly Shannon(who each starred in four of his five films),[83][82]as well as Pally,John C. Reilly,Lauren Weedman,Fred Armisen,Paul Reiser,Paul WeitzandDebby Ryan[55][9][89][90][91][92]– Baena said this was primarily because he enjoyed working with them and always wanted to bring out new things from actors he enjoyed. He also found it advantageous to work with familiar actors due to his own "slightly nontraditional way" of writing and directing, so that he could rely on performers who understood his process.[82]Baena typically wrote and worked from film outlines, rather than full screenplays, so his films could incorporateimprovisation, though his first and final films,Life After BethandSpin Me Round, were more traditional.[45][82]He was considered one of the prominent filmmakers of the mumblecore subgenre.[50][52]
Baena was renowned for the game nights he hosted, creating a social environment among filmmakers and friends that was reflected on his film sets.[93]He met actressAubrey Plazaduring a game night in 2011,[9]after which they began dating.[94]Baena proposed to Plaza at a site related to theBasque witch trialsinZugarramurdi.[95][96]They were married in 2021, to celebrate their tenth anniversary together, in a small ceremony in their backyard.[94][10]
On January 3, 2025, Baena's body was discovered at his home in Los Angeles by his assistant. He was pronounced dead at the scene.[97]The Los Angeles County medical examiner reported the cause of death assuicide by hanging. Baena was 47.[98][99]The82nd Golden Globe Awardsceremony was held on January 5, withBest DirectorwinnerBrady Corbetpaying tribute to Baena at the end of his acceptance speech;[100]Plaza had been set to present at the ceremony but pulled out.[34]Baena's funeral took place on January 10, 2025, in Miami.[101]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
