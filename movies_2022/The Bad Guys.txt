It tells the story of a criminal group ofanthropomorphic animalswho, upon being caught, pretend to attempt to reform themselves as model citizens, only for their leader to find himself genuinely drawn to changing his ways for good as a new villain has his own plans.
Work on the film started in March 2018, with Cohen writing the screenplay; the characters and themes drew inspiration from various crime films and anime series such asPulp Fiction(1994), theOcean'sfilm trilogy,Lupin III, andSherlock Hound, while the inspiration for the film's animation style came fromSony Pictures Animation'sSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018). Production began at DreamWorks Animation's Glendale campus and some additional production assets were borrowed fromJellyfish Pictures, with voice acting being done remotely due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.

It received positive reviews from critics for its animation, screenplay, humor, and voice acting. It was also a box office success, grossing $250 million worldwide.
A sequel,The Bad Guys 2, is set to be released on August 1, 2025.[9]
In a world where humans andanthropomorphicanimals co-exist, masterpickpocketMr. Wolf leads the Bad Guys, an infamous gang of criminals: his best friend andsafecrackerMr. Snake, experthackerMs. Tarantula, master ofdisguiseMr. Shark, and loose cannon Mr. Piranha.
After yet another brazen robbery and police chase, Governor Diane Foxington insults the gang's predictability. Wolf convinces them to steal the Golden Dolphin award, which will be presented to guinea pig philanthropist Professor Rupert Marmalade IV, who has helped rebuild the city from damage by ameteorite. Infiltrating the awards ceremony, Wolf feels good after inadvertently helping an elderly woman, and his conflicted feelings delay the gang's escape, resulting in their arrest. To avoid prison and steal the award again, Wolf persuades Foxington to let Marmalade change the Bad Guys' criminal ways.
Marmalade's efforts to reform the gang are unsuccessful, culminating in a disastrous attempt to rescue guinea pigs from a research lab. Foxington nearly calls off the experiment, but sympathizes with Wolf for acting like the "big bad villain" that society expects of him. Wolf finds himself rescuing a cat from a tree, captured by Marmalade in a video that turns the gang's public image around, but Snake fears that Wolf is losing sight of their plan.
At Marmalade's charity gala, the gang execute another heist to steal the award, but Wolf, having fallen in love with Foxington, is unable to do it and decides to actually go good. However, the meteorite is stolen instead, and the gang is blamed and arrested, while a remorseful Wolf gives Foxington the location of the gang's hideout full of stolen loot. Marmalade reveals to the gang that he stole the meteorite and arranged everything to frame them, including posing as the old woman at the awards ceremony.
In prison, Wolf explains that he believes a better life is possible, leading to a fight with Snake, who is convinced that society will always treat them as dangerous monsters. The gang is rescued by Foxington, whom Wolf realizes is the Crimson Paw, a former criminal mastermind. Wolf agrees to help Foxington stop Marmalade from using the meteorite as a hypnotic power source, but the others return to their hideout only to discover their loot is gone. Snake comforts Shark by giving him the lastPush Pop, leading them all to realize that Wolf was right about a better life, but an angry Snake storms off in denial to ally with Marmalade.
Wolf and Foxington realize Marmalade is using the meteorite to control an army of guinea pigs, which he sends to rob his own charity funds throughout the city. Foxington reveals that when she tried to steal the Golden Dolphin herself, she realized she was being the type of person that society perceived her to be, and left her criminal ways behind. Attempting to steal back the meteorite, they are captured by Marmalade and Snake. The rest of the gang arrives to rescue them, and they race to deliver the meteorite to the police, but decide to bring Snake back first. Chased by the guinea pig swarm, Wolf is forced to surrender the meteorite when Marmalade kicks Snake out of his helicopter.
Reconciling with Snake, the gang is confronted by the police, while Marmalade's mind control device is destroyed. Before Foxington can defend the gang by revealing her criminal past, Wolf and the others willingly turn themselves in. Marmalade tries to claim credit for recovering the meteorite, but Snake faked his defection and swapped the meteorite with Marmalade's replica lamp. The real meteorite is destroyed, exposing Marmalade as the real thief, while Wolf frames him as the Crimson Paw, leading to Marmalade's arrest as well. As the Bad Guys are taken to jail, Wolf reveals that he left the Push Pop to prove there was good in Snake, and the gang happily accepts that they are now good guys.
In a mid-credits scene, the gang is released for good behavior after one year and join Foxington to begin their new lives.

The Washington Post's Kristen Page-Kirby gave 3 stars out of 4, and concluded: "The moral of the story doesn't pack a huge wallop. Not that it needs to. (We can't all beEncanto.) Still, it's clever, visually interesting and very, very funny. Even when the humor goes lowbrow, it makes narrative sense. A joke about flatulence is a lot funnier when it's essential to the plot.The Bad Guysgets that. In fact,The Bad Guysgets a lot of things. It knows precisely what it is — and what it sets out to do, it does well. It's a heist film with heart and humor, and where's the crime in that?"[60]IGN's Ryan Leston gave a rating of 8 out of 10 and wrote:The Bad Guysis a slick, hilarious heist movie with buckets of laughs and a lot of heart. It'sOcean's Elevenmeets Little Red Riding Hood with Sam Rockwell's Wolf going on a charm offensive to stay out of jail... and he might just win you over in the process. Richard Ayoade has a blast as the sanctimonious Professor Marmalade and the entire voice cast brings their A-game with some stellar gags that will get you roaring with laughter.The Bad Guysis a fun, family-friendly caper that's bursting with action and brimming with laughs."[61]Chicago Sun-Times'sRichard Roepergave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, and commented that "The animation combines computer-generated 2D and 3D with a look that will remind you of a Saturday-morning cartoon—only much crisper and more dazzling. There's nothing photorealistic about the animation; it's stylized and has very specific definition of Heist Movie Los Angeles, with the sky so bright it's almost overexposed, and yet somehow creating a bit of a noir vibe. This is a great-looking film with terrific performances, some lovely messaging and a steady parade of solid laughs—some the kids will enjoy and just as many targeted squarely at the grown-up kids in the audience."[62]
The Guardian's Wendy Ide gave 3 stars out of 5 and said: "LikeRoger Rabbit, the pacing owes a debt to the demented frenzy of classic Looney Tunes animations, but the film also nods to heist movies, notably theOceansseries. It's deliberately preposterous – the disguises are rarely more convincing than the kind of false nose and moustache combo you might find in a cracker. But there's a kernel of believability where it matters: in the easy repartee and fully fleshed friendships. It's sharp, silly and frequently very funny."[63]
The film was awarded the title ofTruly Moving Picture Awardat the 2022Heartland Film Festivaland was nominated for Best Animated Film at theHollywood Critics AssociationandSatellite Awards.[65][66][67]Beetz received a nomination forOutstanding Voice Performanceat the2023 Black Reel Awards.[68]The film also was nominated forOutstanding Visual Effects in an Animated Featureat the21st Visual Effects Society Awards, aKids' Choice Award for Favorite Animated Movieas well as Awkwafina receiving a nomination for Favorite Female Voice From an Animated Movie at the2023 Kids' Choice Awards, and for fiveAnnie Awards(winning one).[69][70][71]

Maron is from aJewishfamily, originally fromPolandandUkraine, includingDrohobych.[14][15]He lived inWayne, New Jerseyuntil he was six.[16]Maron's father joined theU.S. Air Forcefor two years for hismedical residencyinAlaska, and so Maron and his family moved there. When his father left the Air Force, he moved the family toAlbuquerque, New Mexicoand started a medical practice.[2]Maron lived in Albuquerque from third grade through high school.[17]He graduated fromHighland High School.[18]
In 1986, Maron graduated fromBoston Universitywith a B.A. in English literature.[19][20]
Maron first performed stand-up in 1987 when he was 24 years old.[21]His professional comedy career began atThe Comedy Storein Los Angeles, where he became an associate ofSam Kinison.[22][23]He later moved to New York City and became part of theNew York alternative comedyscene. During the summer of 1994, he appeared several times on Monday open-mic night, coordinated by Tracey Metzger, at the now-closed Greenwich Village location of theBoston Comedy Club. He auditioned unsuccessfully for the 1995Saturday Night Livecast overhaul and attributes being passed over to being high during a meeting with show creator and producerLorne Michaels.[2][24][25]
Maron continued to be a stand-up comedian and also began to appear on television; his voice was used in episodes ofDr. Katz, Professional Therapist,[26]and he hostedShort Attention Span Theaterfor a time.[6]He also recorded half-hour specials forHBOandComedy Central Presentsas well as comedy showcases like theCam Neely Foundationfundraiser, which also featured performers such asJon Stewart,Denis LearyandSteven Wright. He frequently appeared in the live alternative stand-up series he had organized withJaneane GarofalocalledEating It, which used the rock barLuna Loungein New York'sLower East Sideas its venue, from the 1990s until the building was razed in 2005.[27]
His first one-man show,Jerusalem Syndrome, had an extendedoff-Broadwayrun in 2000 and was released in book form in 2001. In 2009, he began workshopping another one-man show,Scorching the Earth. According to Maron (inScorching The Earth), these two shows "bookend" his relationship with his second wife, comicMishna Wolff, which ended in a bitter divorce.[28][29]
In May 2008, he toured withEugene MirmanandAndy KindlerinStand Uppity: Comedy That Makes You Feel Better About Yourself and Superior to Others.In January 2009, a collaboration withSam Seder, which had begun in September 2007 as a weekly hour-long video webcast becameBreakroom Live with Maron & Seder, produced by Air America.[30]Until its cancellation in July 2009, the show was webcast live weekdays at 3 p.m. Eastern, with episodes archived for later viewing. In its final incarnation, the show was informal, taking place in the actual break room of Air America Media, with the cafeteria vending machines just off-camera. This meant occasional distractions when Air America staff and management alike would occasionally come in for food and drink. Maron and Seder held court in an online "post-show chat" with viewers, in an even less formal continuation of each webcast, after the credits had rolled.
Maron's stand-up act is marked by his commitment to self-revelation and cultural analysis. He is particularly known for relentless on-stage exploration of his own relationships with family, girlfriends, and other stand-up comedians whom he has known and befriended over his years in the business.[31]In October 2013, Maron released his first hour-long special through Netflix,Marc Maron: Thinky Pain.[32]Maron would follow this with another special,More Later, which was released in December 2015 throughEpix.[33]
Kliph Nesteroff's 2015 bookThe Comedians: Drunks, Thieves, Scoundrels and the History of American Comedyis dedicated to Maron.[34]
His 2023 specialFrom Bleak to Darkwas namedNew Yorkmagazine's "No. 1 Best Comedy Special of 2023."[35]
From almost the first day of theliberal talk radionetworkAir America's broadcasts in 2004, Maron co-hostedMorning Sedition, a three-hour early-morningradio showwithMark Rileythat aired weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern time.[36]The show was unique in the Air America lineup in its heavy reliance on both live and pre-produced sketch comedy, utilizing the talents of staff writers as well as the on-air hosts. The format was aleft-leaningnear-satire of typical morning "Buddy" radio programs, including recurring characters, interviews and listener call-in segments, and it attracted a loyal fan base.[37]
As 2005 came to an end, it became known that Maron's contract would not be renewed on its December 1, 2005, end date because of problems with then Air America executive Danny Goldberg. Goldberg reportedly did not "get" the comedy or agree with the satiric and often angry tone set by Maron and other writers (Jim EarlandKent Jones) for a morning drive-time show. On November 28, 2005, it was officially announced that Maron's contract had not been renewed. His lastMorning Seditionbroadcast was on December 16, 2005, and the show was discontinued shortly thereafter.[36]
On February 28, 2006, Maron began hosting a nighttime radio program withJim Earlas a sidekick forKTLK Progressive Talk 1150AMin Los Angeles calledThe Marc Maron Showfrom 10:00 pm until midnight PST. The program was frequently delayed (sometimes for over an hour) owing to KTLK's contractual agreement to broadcast local sports events that would often go into overtime.The Marc Maron Showwas never nationally syndicated by Air America despite reported contractual clauses promising such. The show was streamed online live, but the show was not publicized, and the existence of the stream was not well promoted.[citation needed]
On July 5, it was announced that Maron's final episode would be on July 14. A few days before that date, Maron bluntly discussed his long struggle with Air America Radio's executives on-air. In 2008, Marc andSam Sederexpanded their prior collaboration on a weekly hour-long video webcast (streamed at The Sam Seder Show website) into a daily show (and "post-show chat") produced by Air America Media[38]calledMaron v. Seder.[39]The show becameBreakroom Live with Maron & Sederstarting in 2009 and could be viewed on Air America Media's website.[40]On July 15, 2009, after less than one year, Air America Media canceledBreakroom Live. According to the show's hosts, the cancellation was for financial reasons.[41]Ironically, the day before the cancellation, the show got some of the first real publicity it had ever received when MaximumFun.org posted its podcast of an interview with Maron onThe Sound of Young America.[42]
On the finalBreakroom Livewebcast, Maron said that this marked the third time since 2005 he'd been told by an executive at the network that his services would not be required in the immediate future. Co-host Sam Seder pointed out that this would be the end of hisfourthshow at Air America since the troubled network's inception.[43]
Due to a precarious state in his comedic career, on September 1, 2009, Maron began a twice-weeklypodcastcalledWTF with Marc Maronin what Maron would later describe in a 2015 interview as a "Hail Mary pass"; his first-ever guest was fellow stand-upJeff Ross.[44][45]In a free-form discussion, Maron and his guests touch on topics like the arc of the interviewees' careers, their shared past experiences, and stories from the road.[38]As of 2024, Maron has released more than 1,500 episodes of the show, garnering critical acclaim and more than 600 million downloads;[46][47][48]notable guests includePresident Barack Obama,Sir Paul McCartney,Robin Williams,Jerry Seinfeld,Chris Rock,Lorne Michaels,Leonardo DiCaprio, andBrad Pitt. The show has been noted for its influence on other long-form interview podcasts that emerged after its debut.[49][50][51]In April 2021, it was announced that Maron and his producer Brendan McDonald would be the recipients of the first-ever Governors Award by the Podcast Academy for Excellence in Audio (The Ambies) for their work onWTF.[52]The success of Maron's podcast opened up numerous other avenues on film and TV as well as giving him a massive boost to audience attendance at his stand-up shows.
His only major film credit for many years was a small part credited as "angry promoter" in the 2000Cameron CrowefilmAlmost Famous, in which he is first seen fighting withNoah Taylor's character and then yelling at and chasing after the main characters as they drive away on a bus, at which point he yells, "Lock the gates!" which is now used in the intro to his podcasts.[53]He was also featured at the Luna Lounge in the 1997 mockumentaryWho's the Caboose?starringSarah SilvermanandSam Seder.[54]In 2019, Maron starred in aLynn Shelton–directed comedy film titledSword of Trust.[55]In 2020, Maron played publicist Ron Oberman oppositeJohnny Flynn'syoung David Bowie in the movieStardust.[56]

Maron, a television series created by and starring Maron for a 10-episode first season, premiered onIFCon May 3, 2013.[59]The show is loosely autobiographical, revolving around Maron's life as a twice-divorced sober comedian running a comedy podcast out of his garage but establishing many differences between the real-life Maron and the version of him on TV. As the executive producer and star ofMaron, Maron appeared in all 51 episodes of the show from 2013 to 2016, portraying a fictionalized version of himself.[60]The show ended in 2016 after four seasons onIFC.[61]Maron directed two episodes of the show, "The Joke" and "Ex-Pod."

In an interview withKCRW, Maron stated, "I have no idea why they asked me to play guitar on the track. I'm only good at one thing on the guitar. It just so happens it was exactly the thing they needed."[71]
Reviews for the solo were positive.IFC's Melissa Locker said "Marc Maron plays a mean guitar."[72]Spin's Chris Martins called the guitar solo a "shredfest" as well as "angular."[73]The Strangercalled it "a frequency-fraying guitar solo that's better than you'd expect, although it won't makeJ Mascisjealous."[74]
Maron wrote and performed on the score for his filmSword of Trust.[75]
Maron lived inAstoria, Queens, through the 1990s and most of the 2000s, but moved back to Los Angeles in late 2009.[76]Maron also speaks openly of his caring for numerous stray cats that he takes into his home. This has led him to refer to his home, on theWTFpodcast, as the "Cat Ranch".[77]After his cat Boomer went missing, Maron began incorporating the catchphrase "Boomer lives!" to the end of each podcast. Since then, he has one addition to the "Cat Ranch" by the name of Buster Kitten. LaFonda died in December 2019. After she passed, Maron briefly replaced "Boomer lives!" with "LaFonda lives!" for a few episodes of his podcast. Monkey died in August 2020. He now usually concludes his podcast with some guitar playing and the phrase "Boomer lives... LaFonda... Monkey... Cat angels everywhere!" Maron currently lives inGlendale, Los Angeles, with his two cats, Buster and Sammy.[78]
Maron has spoken openly, in his act and on his podcast, about his alcohol and drug abuse during the 1990s.

Maron has been married twice, to Kimberly Reiss andMishna Wolff, a former stand-up comedian. Both relationships have figured prominently in his act. During numerous appearances at theEdinburgh Fringefestival in 2007, Maron riffed on his then-recent separation and divorce from Wolff.
On the October 14, 2013, episode of his podcast, Maron announced that he had broken up with his former fiancée, Jessica Sanchez.[81]He then had a five-month relationship withMoon Zappa.[82]

In September 2023, Ayoade received backlash on social media after endorsing the memoir of television writer and anti-transgender activistGraham Linehan, with whom he had worked onThe IT Crowd.[86][87]
Ayoade's 2024 book,The Unfinished Harauld Hughes, was described bySam LeithinThe Guardianas "the narrative of the making of a documentary that never gets made, about a movie that also never got made. Its protagonist-narrator is Richard Ayoade, an alter ego of the author of the book, Richard Ayoade. He's in search of an alter ego of his own – or, at least, a doppelganger. ... Its comic tenor is part satirical and part pure whimsy, and it's very beguiling."[88]
Ayoade is a fan ofFrench New Wavecinema and said in an interview withThe GuardianthatLouis Malle'sZazie dans le Métrowas the film that sparked his interest in filmmaking.[89]His favourite filmmakers include Malle,Woody Allen,Ingmar Bergman,Orson Welles,Jean-Luc Godard,Jean-Pierre Melville, andPaul Thomas Anderson.[90][91]

The episode in question was condemned for allowing Fox on as a guest, in particular for when he told a black woman in the audience that discussing racism was "boring". According to Fox, Ayoade told him that "You have never encountered racism." Fox stated that he had told Ayoade he had, because "he worked in Kenya once" and "racism can be deferential".[96]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
