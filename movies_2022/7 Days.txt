The film opens with several Indian couples discussing their traditional arranged marriages. An Indian website is a modern method for unmarried singles to seek a spouse. Both Ravi's and Rita's mothers have created profiles for them on Arranged, a website for America-based Indians.
Ravi and Rita have an awkward pre-arranged date at a dryreservoir. As her mother had posted she was a vegetarian, he had brought a special meat-free meal. When she points out that the lemonade he brought was hard and the site stated he is a teetotaler, embarrassed, he pours it on the ground.
Suddenly they both get alerts to their phones about theCOVID-19 pandemic, going back to her place they simultaneously call their moms. It is a mess, trash everywhere, dirty dishes and evidence that she drinks. Ravi waits for the car rental agency to call him back, as his train has been cancelled. As there won't be a car until morning, Rita offers him the couch. After he updates his mom, he overhears her talking dirty to someone on the phone. In a panic, he goes to her bathroom and finds hervibrator.
First thing in the morning Ravi leaves as soon as he can on foot to the agency. Rita gives him a friendly goodbye, but he leaves coldly. Relieved he's gone, she grabs a beer and a cold chicken drumstick from the fridge. Ravi suddenly pops back in, as he is told it will be three more days. He is forced to shelter in place due to the pandemic.
When Ravi asks about the alcohol and meat Rita begs him to not tell her mother. He concedes then blurts out that they aren't a good match, pointing out her dishonesty as a reason. She explains that her mother pays for her rent in exchange for her participation in the website.
Ravi tries to make small talk, and then asks Rita if he can clean, saying it relaxes him. Finished cleaning, he gets a teasing call from his brothers about being holed in with her. He is antsy whereas she is totally relaxed, used to inactivity as she's unemployed.
Chatting again, Rita admits she's not remotely interested in marriage, whereas Ravi insists he needs to get married before he can have any intimacy. He insists he's not boring, describing odd idiosyncrasies of his lab mates.
Rita gets a call from her lover, who turns out to be married. Unable to go for a walk, Ravi shows he's emotional as he describes to her aBollywoodmovie. Bored, she spikes his Coke with whiskey and, as he's never touched alcohol, it quickly affects him. He both tries to do standup and then dance for the first time, but gets sick.
Sore at Rita the next morning, Ravi blames her for his hangover. A short while later, she joins him for an online workout. Her mother calls, asking about the date, hoping she didn't divulge her true self, as he couldn't love 'that you'.
Ravi offers to teach Rita to cook. In the process, he is appalled at her process and the result, but she is pleased. His mother sets him up on avirtual blind date, which Rita coaches him through. Ravi finishes the date really happy, but dreams of Rita.
The next morning, after Rita hears Ravi's conversation via speakerphone with his mother she goes stir crazy and insists on going out, and doesn't take a mask. She arrives back late. In the morning, upon saying goodbye she coughs, so he cancels his departure to help Rita quarantine.
During the day or so of quarantining they get to know one another. she talks about her affair, he tells her very infantileknock knock jokesduring the night her bad coughing concerns him, so he spoons her. By morning he calls an ambulance.
Once Rita is hospitalised, Ravi goes through her things, with notable and increasing affection. He has a lot of difficulty having contact via phone. Ravi discovers her paintings are all sweet and about love, not raunchy as she implied.
Her mom calls, and he tells her about Rita's COVID hospitalization. She asks to zoom with him. The few times Ravi does get through, the woman in Rita's room dies. A newbie there kindly keeps him updated. When she's released, they meet in a park and their mutual affection is visible.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
