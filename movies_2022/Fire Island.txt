Searchlight Picturesannounced the purchase of Booster's script on June 30, 2021, to produce as a feature film re-titledFire Island.Spa NightdirectorAndrew Ahnreplaced Dunn as director.[7]The following month,Margaret Chojoined the cast of the film, as the only woman to be part of the film's cast.[8]Conrad Ricamora,James Scully,Matt Rogers, Tomas Matos, Torian Miller, andNick Adamswere added to the film in August 2021, withZane Phillips, Michael Graceffa, Aidan Wharton, Peter Smith, and Bradley Gibson joining the ensemble cast.[9]Principal photographybegan August 12, 2021, and was scheduled to last through September 2021, with filming taking place inManhattan,Brooklyn, andFire Island, the locale of the film's title.[10]The final script incorporated humorous topics the filmmakers had long shared as friends.[11]
InFire Island,Joel Kim BoosterreimaginesJane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" through a queer lens, transporting the classic themes miscommunication and romance to the contemporary setting ofFire Island, New York. The adaptation introduces a group of gay men who frequentFire Island, drawing parallels betweenJoel Kim Boosterpersonal experiences and those depicted in Austen's novel.[12]Through its queer adaptation of a classic novel,Fire Islandchallenges conventional narratives ofromanceandrelationships. Booster subverts traditionalgender rolesandheteronormativeexpectations, offering a fresh perspective on love, desire, and societal norms.[13]The film invites viewers to reconsider preconceived notions of romance and embrace diverse expressions of love and desire that are expressed through the movie and often overlooked in Austen's original writing."Fire Island" serves as both a tribute toJane Austen's themes and a celebration ofqueer identityand community.[12]
The film portrays the ways in which queer individuals assess one another, drawing from their own experiences of discrimination and marginalization to perpetuate a hierarchical class system seen in a straight community as way to elevate their own social status within the community.[14]The characters navigate the intricacies ofsocial classwithin thequeer community, even in a space likeFire Island, where traditionalheterosexualnorms are absent.Joel Kim Booster, thescreenwriter, draws parallels between Austen's exploration of class struggles and the dynamics observed within the queer community. He emphasizes how, in the absence of straight oppression, queer individuals can inadvertently recreate artificialclass systemsandhierarchies.[14]
Similar to Austen's novel, the forging of relationships across perceived class lines is also impacted by these biases, as Howie finds himself enamored with Charlie, a charming doctor who is part of a group of affluent and judgmental individuals.[15]Among Charlie's friends is Will, theMr. Darcyto Noah'sLizziefor adaptation. As these social circles intertwine, tensions escalate with the characters being made to feel unwelcome in Charlie's upper-class circle, with Noah and Will exchanging both flirtations and sharp remarks.[16]
In addition to class dynamics,Fire Islandtackles issues of race within the queer community, particularly highlighting the experiences ofAsian Americancharacters. The film features a predominantlyPOCcast, reflecting the diverse realities of queer individuals. Characters likeBowen Yang'sHowie represent the intersection of being queer andAsian-American, adding layers to the narrative and offering representation tounderrepresentedcommunities within theLGBTQ+ umbrella.[14]
"Fire Island" serves as a poignant exploration ofqueer spaces, particularly focusing on the titular island as a haven for the LGBTQ+ community. The film celebrates Fire Island's significance as a historic queer hotspot, where individuals could socialize without fear of judgment orpersecution. Throughout the narrative, there is a deliberate absence of straight characters, allowingqueer cultureto be glorified and celebrated authentically.[17]This specificity highlightsFire Islandas a place where queer individuals can exist free from the influence ofheteronormativity, exploring the nuances of LGBTQ+ life without the need to cater tocis-hetaudiences.[17]
By centering on found family and friendship dynamics within the community, "Fire Island" offers a nuanced portrayal of the joys and complexities ofLGBTQ+life. The movie also changes the expectations of the typical retelling ofPride and Prejudiceby concentrating more on the friendship and family elements present in the original writing, moving it away from a more traditional rom-com. By focusing on the relationship betweenLizzie(Noah) and Jane (Howie) as well as their attachment to the family house they are losing, it sets the priorities of the movie to the core of the queer experience.[16]The movie emphasizes the necessity of portraying how joyful and raunchy queer experiences while also acknowledging the potential for the community to experience internal conflicts and divisions.[17]
The film was released June 3, 2022, onHuluin the United States,Star+inLatin America, and later released on June 17Disney+viaStarin other international territories.[9][18]

He also praised the film's take on friendship betweenLGBT people, while complimenting the chemistry between Joel Kim Booster and Bowen Yang's characters.[27]David Fear ofRolling StonefoundFire Islandto be a love letter to the LGBT community andits culture, writing, "This romantic comedy has its share of those archetypes. It also has gay lead characters, gay love interests, gay heroes, gay villains, and gay people of color galore. That doesn't excuse some of the clunkier, more brochure-friendly scenarios that Fire Island throws at them. But it does give you the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing everyone to this picture-perfect spot and inviting them to the party in the Pines, had been the means of uniting them."[28]
Siddhant Adlakha ofIGNrated the movie 9/10 and wrote: "Indie director Andrew Ahn creates a mainstreamqueerclassic with the romcomFire Island, his inventive modern adaptation ofPride and Prejudice. Following a group of gay friends on a wild vacation, it features some of the funniest and most tension-filled scenes in any movie this year.

The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

When he was seventeen, Yang's father found out his son was gay from an "openchat window" on the family's computer.[11]His parents were not receptive to the news, stating that such things "did not happen in China".[18]Yang's father cried often over the revelation and, being non-religious but wanting to "solve problems", arranged for him to attend eight sessions ofgay conversion therapy.[11][18]He agreed to attend the sessions to appease his parents, who said they would otherwise not allow him to move to New York to attendNew York University, which his sister was already attending.[9]He was immediately alarmed by the counselor's mix of religion and use ofpseudo-scientificreasoning to explain away positive homosexual manifestations.[10][11]In an interview forThe New York Times,Maureen Dowdquestioned why his parents, both scientists, did not see the disconnection.[10]Bowen said, "It was a cultural thing for them, this cultural value around masculinity, around keeping the family line going, keeping certain things holy and sacred." He also said "It was me wanting to meet them halfway but realizing it had to be pretty absolute. It was an either-or thing."[10]
In 2008, Yang moved to New York City and joined his sister at NYU.[9]His father assigned her to chaperone him during this period as Bowen tried "straightnesson for size and fail[ed] miserably."[18][19]He came to accept being gay, incorporating it into his comedy, and hoped his parents would learn to accept that aspect of him.[18]They have since found a truce and enjoy a "great relationship."[11]At NYU, he was in the improv group Dangerbox, and he occasionally performed withStephanie Hsu, a member of the school's sketch comedy group.[20][21]
Yang was inspired bySandra Oh's characterCristina YangonGrey's Anatomyfor her neurotic and relentless pursuits, and aspired to be a doctor.[10][22]He went to pre-med classes and graduated from NYU with a bachelor's degree in chemistry.[10][23][14]After realizing he was actually inspired by Oh for her acting ability, he decided to pursue a career in comedy instead.[22]At NYU, he metMatt Rogers, with whom he startedLas Culturistas, a weekly comedy podcast where Yang "unapologetically expresses his personality, story and himself by sharing his experiences as a member of the LGBTQ community".[8][22]

Thepodcastthat Yang co-hosts withMatt Rogers,Las Culturistas, is described byVultureas both "delightfully screwy" and a "two-headedsnarkroutine".[26]The podcast premiered in 2016 and as of September 2019[update], has over 300 episodes.[27]Each one opens with an interview with a pop culture guest, then goes to one-minute rounds of "I Don't Think So, Honey!" (IDTSH) where the hosts and guests each expound onpet peeves.[26]IDTSH has also morphed into its own live show.[26]Yang credits theLas Culturistaspodcast with Rogers for building hisfanbase. In 2018 it was nominated for aShorty Awardrecognizing the best in social media.[4][28][29]

Yang is the third gay male, and sixthLGBTQcast member.[c]The announcement of Yang's casting onSaturday Night Livewas reported internationally, and within hours was overshadowed by revelations that comedianShane Gillis, who had been hired at the same time, airedhomophobicandanti-Asianjokes.[47][48]Gillis issued an apology, but within days was fired bySNL.[49][48]

Cho was born inSan Franciscoon December 5, 1968, to a family of Korean descent.[4]Her paternal grandfather Myung-sook Cho, aChristianminister, worked for the Japanese as a station master during theiroccupation of Korea. When Japanwithdrewfrom Korea at the end of World War II, he was denounced as atraitorby North Korea'sCommunist regimeand forced to move with his family, including his son, Cho's father Seung-hoon Cho, to South Korea.[5]During theKorean War, Myung-sook ran an orphanage inSeoul. According to Margaret herself, she "grew up in the church."[6]She was raised in a racially diverse neighborhood near theOcean Beachsection of San Francisco,[4]which she described as a community of "oldhippies, ex-druggies, burn-outs from the 1960s,drag queens, Chinese people and Koreans. To say it was a melting pot – that's the least of it. It was a really confusing, enlightening, wonderful time."[7]Cho's parents, Young-Hie and Seung-Hoon Cho,[8]ran Paperback Traffic, a bookstore on Polk Street atCalifornia Streetin San Francisco. Her father writes joke books and a newspaper column in Seoul, South Korea.[9]
At school, Cho was bullied, saying that "I was hurt because I was different and so sharing my experience of being beaten and hated and called fat and queer and foreign and perverse and gluttonous and lazy and filthy and dishonest and yet all the while remaining invisible heals me, and heals others when they hear it – those who are suffering right now."[10]
Between the ages of five and twelve, Cho was "sexually molested by a family friend". On the Loveline May 21, 1997 show withAdam CarollaandDrew Pinsky, she talks about being raped by her uncle while during the same time period he was raping his three-year-old daughter.[11]She often skipped class and got bad grades in ninth and tenth grades, resulting in her expulsion fromLowell High School.[11]Cho said she was "raped continuously through my youngest years" (by another acquaintance) and that when she told someone else about it and her classmates found out, she received hostile remarks justifying it, including accusations of being "so fat" that only a crazy person would have sex with her.[11]

[N]ot all women comedians are dangerous; some are just very funny: Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are too relatable, Joan Rivers was too firmly ensconced in the society that she mocked. Amy Schumer relies a little too much on the word "pussy" to be any kind of threat, though she would like very much to be a bad person. On the other hand, ... Margaret Cho know[s] no boundaries and inspire[s] palpable fear anytime [she] begin[s] one of [her] riffs.[95]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
