Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Canal+(French:[kanalplys], meaning "Channel Plus"), also speltCanal Plusand sometimes abbreviatedC+orCanal, is a French premium television channel owned byCanal+. The channel was launched in November 1984, and broadcasts toMetropolitan France. It broadcasts several kinds of programming, mostlyencrypted, but some unencrypted content can be viewed free of charge.
Canal+ was co-founded byAndré RousseletandPierre Lescure. An early pioneer wasAlain de Greef[fr], who joined in 1986.
In 1978, six years before Canal's launch, Jean Frydman who had the TVCS (Télévision Communication Services) project was planning a project to launch a fourth television channel in France which had its roots from the previousCanal 10project. Whilst waiting for abling to create an encrypted TV channel, the TVCS project had first planned to produce and broadcast their own programmes during time slots when three French television channels began broadcasting atest cardin the night and in the morning.[1]One year later in July 1979, it was announced that the channel had chosen to broadcast the programmes produced by public national television channel and the TVCS companyAntenne 2(now known as France 2) who had broadcast encrypted programmes that were originally intended for businesses or certain professionals.[2]
In March 1984 eight before the official launch, Canal+ started their retransmission tests in the Île-de-France region. Those first broadcasts were scheduled every day from 2 to 6pm and they were consisted of music videos, animated short films and various movie trailers.
Canal+ was launched in November 1984, when there were only three government-owned channels available in France.[3]The company was co-founded byAndré Rousselet, president of the French multinational advertising companyHavas,[3]andPierre Lescure(bornc.1945), who proved very popular with media professionals and politicians.[4]It got off to a slow start, and some politicians, including prime ministerLaurent Fabius, railed against the idea of having a commercial TV channel. However, Rousselet was a personal friend of the president,François Mitterrand, and so obtained favourable terms for the setup.Pierre Lescurewas director-general at that time. A combination of political connections and clever programming – giving the French public American hit comedies and French drama not available on the government channels – worked and subscriptions soon increased. Government regulations required that the channel give several hours of free programming each day, which was used by Canal+ to promote the subscription service.[3]Its first logo was used from inception until 1995.[citation needed]
The channel initially had to use 45% of its air-time on films, until the film industry pushed back. Sport, interview shows, documentaries, andsoft pornographyjoined films as the main staples of programming at this time.[3]Starting in 1985, Canal+ has had a tradition of showing onepornographic filmevery month  at midnight, generally on the first Saturday of the month.[5]In 1985, the government opened up the market to other private commercial television stations, offering some serious competition. However, aggressive marketing and policies ensured that the company kept growing.[3]
Alain de Greef[fr](c.1947– 29 June 2015) joined in 1986[6]joining his longtime friend Pierre Lescure. De Greef was first appointed director of production, then head of programmes, and finally as director general (1986–2000).[7]De Greef was later described as a pioneer and visionary, who set the tone and created the "Canal Plus spirit", which embodied anti-conformism along with edgy satire that became very popular. He created the satirical puppet showLes Guignols de l'Infoand cult talk showsNulle part ailleurs,[6]Groland, andLes Deschiens.[citation needed]
In 1987, Canal+ wentpublic. By 1989, Canal+ had almost three million subscribers. The company expanded into some European markets, notably Belgium, Spain, and Germany, and started setting up subsidiaries as it developed intoGroupe Canal+.[3]
In 1994, Rousselet quit the board, and was replaced by director-general Lescure.[3]
Digital satellite providerCanalSatellitewas launched as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canal+ on 6 December 1991. On 27 April 1996, Canal+ received two new sister channels: Canal+ Jaune and Canal+ Bleu.[8]A fourth channel, called Canal+ Vert, came along on 31 August 1998. The channels changed their names to Canal+ Confort (now known as Canal+ Décalé since 2005), Canal+ Cinéma, and Canal+ Sport on 1 November 2003.
In January 2000, theLagardère Grouppurchased a major stake in the digital television division.[9][10]In December 2000,Vivendiacquired Canal+.[11]In 2001, co-founder Alain De Greef was fired from his position as director-general and replaced byMichel Denisot, when the organisation wasrestructuredunder the leadership ofJean-Marie Messier, chief executive of Vivendi.[7]Criticism of Vivendi's poor share performance since the takeover grew, and in April 2002, De Greef's co-founder and CEO Pierre Lescure, clashed with Messier and was fired.[4]
An alternative logo was used between 2006 and 2009.
In September 2005, Canal+, Canal+ Cinéma and Canal+ Sport started broadcasting in the Frenchdigital terrestrial televisionnetwork. Thefree-to-airparts of Canal+ had already been broadcasting for a few months by then. In August 2008, Canal+ started broadcasting theencryptedparts of its main channel in high-definition in the terrestrial network. Canal+ announced plans to turn off theanalogue terrestrialsignals by 2010.[12]
In April 2014,Ligue 1, France's topassociation footballleague, sold broadcast rights for 2016–2020 to Canal+ for 726 millioneuros.[13]
In July 2024, reports emerged that Vivendi was exploring a potential London Stock Exchange listing for Canal+.[14]In December 2024, Canal+ Group was spun-out as independent company.[15]The channel will leave the terrestrial platform in France in June 2025, alongside Canal+ Cinéma, Canal+ Sport and Planète+, as a result of the cut in its agreement with Arcom to keep its licences afloats as a response to the non-renewal of its free-to-air channelC8by theArcom. Only 70,000 subscribers receive Canal+ in terrestrial.[16]From 6 June 2025,France 4will take over its slot; from that day, the new digital terrestrial channel plan will be introduced.[17]
Canal+ broadcasts toMetropolitan France. Its programming is mostlyencrypted, but some unencrypted programming can be viewed free of charge. The channel does not broadcast advertising, except when broadcasting onfree-to-airslots. Almost all foreign films and series can be viewed either in their original language with French subtitles (on a secondary audio channel) or dubbed in French. All programs are subtitled in French for deaf people and those who struggle with hearing. Some programs also have audio description for those who are visually impaired.[citation needed]
Canal+ is a supporter of theHybrid Broadcast Broadband TV(HbbTV) initiative, which promotes and establishes an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface.[citation needed]
Originally, subscribers would be mailed a code to punch in on their decoder's control panel to view the encrypted service (using theRITC Discret 1system); the code would be based upon the decoder's serial number (stored in the box's ROM). To avoid problems with customer's codes being not delivered on time by the postal system, Canal+ would switch to encryption based on a generic key, between the last day of the month (beginning at midnight) and the first Monday of the next month (until 9 AM). During this time, all decoders—even those with lapsed subscriptions—would be able to view the channel.[18]
However, signal piracy was rampant, especially after the magazineRadio Plansprinted decoder plans in their December 1984 issue. As a result of this, Canal+ switched to the much strongerNagravisionencryption system beginning in 1992; the Discret system was fully phased out by 1995. The new decoders utilised smart cards, cut into the shape of a key and inserted into the front of the decoder. Different decoders using theD2-MACstandard were also deployed during this time, mostly for cable subscribers. With the launch of CanalSatellite, theMediaguardencryption system was instituted, created bySECA(Société Européenne de Contrôle d'Accès), a firm owned by Canal+ andBertelsmann; Canal+ eventually bought out Bertelsmann's stake and rebranded SECA as Canal+ Technologies. This firm was sold by 2003 toThomson SA. The MediaGuard system's use in Britain (by the now defunctOnDigital/ITV Digital) led to hackers in the employ ofRupert Murdoch's rival encryption company NDS breaking into the MediaGuard system, resulting in new cards being issued to Canal+ subscribers in 2002 and Canal+ starting legal action against Murdoch. The Nagravision system continued in use until 30 November 2011, when all analog television broadcasting in France ceased.[19][20][21]
Les Chaînes Canal+is the offer name regrouping the premium Canal+-branded channels in France.[22]From 2003 to 2008 it was calledCanal+ Le Bouquet.[citation needed]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
