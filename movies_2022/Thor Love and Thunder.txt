Thor: Love and Thunderis a 2022 Americansuperhero filmbased onMarvel Comicsfeaturing the characterThor. Produced byMarvel Studiosand distributed byWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel toThor: Ragnarok(2017) andthe 29th filmin theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU). The film was directed byTaika Waititi, who co-wrote the screenplay withJennifer Kaytin Robinson, and starsChris HemsworthasThoralongsideChristian Bale,Tessa Thompson,Jaimie Alexander, Waititi,Russell Crowe, andNatalie Portman. In the film, Thor tries to find inner peace, but must return to action and recruitValkyrie(Thompson),Korg(Waititi), andJane Foster(Portman)—who is now the Mighty Thor—to stopGorr the God Butcher(Bale) from eliminating all gods.
Hemsworth and Waititi had discussed plans for a sequel toRagnarokby January 2018.Love and Thunderwas announced in July 2019, with Hemsworth, Waititi, and Thompson all set to return, as well as Portman who did not appear inRagnarok. Waititi wanted to differentiateLove and ThunderfromRagnarok, seeking to make aromance filmand 1980s-inspired adventure. He adapted elements fromJason Aaron's run onThorcomic books during the 2010s, which similarly debuted Gorr and saw Foster take on the mantle and powers of Thor whilst under treatment for cancer. Robinson joined to contribute to the script in February 2020, and further casting was revealed later that year including the appearance of theGuardians of the Galaxy. Production was expected to begin in late 2020 but was delayed by theCOVID-19 pandemic. Filming ultimately began in January 2021 in Sydney, Australia with Barry Idoine as the director of photography, and concluded at the beginning of June.
Thor: Love and Thunderpremiered at theEl Capitan TheatreinHollywood, Los Angeles, on June 23, 2022, and was released in the United States on July 8, as part ofPhase Fourof the MCU. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film for its light-heartedness, action sequences, and the performances of Hemsworth, Bale and Portman, but criticized the screenplay and tonal inconsistencies, while its humor and visual effects were met with polarized responses;[6]many critics deemed the film inferior toRagnarok. The film grossed $760.9 million worldwide, making it theeighth-highest-grossing film of 2022, as well as the second-highest-grossing film in theThorfranchise.
Gorrand his daughter, Love, the last of their race, struggle in a barren desert. Despite their prayers to their god, Rapu, Love dies. The god-killingNecroswordcalls to Gorr, leading him to Rapu's lush realm. After Rapu cruelly mocks and dismisses Gorr's plight, he renounces the god, causing Rapu to start strangling him. The Necrosword offers itself to Gorr, who kills Rapu with it and vows tokill all gods. Gorr is granted the ability to manipulate shadows and produce monsters but is cursed with impending death and corruption under the sword's influence.
Thorhas joined theGuardians of the Galaxyafter theAvengers'battleagainstThanos.[a]He learns of a distress signal fromSif, so he parts ways with the team. He finds an injured Sif, who warns that Gorr's next target isNew Asgard. Meanwhile, Dr.Jane Foster, Thor's ex-girlfriend, has been diagnosed with stage fourterminal cancer. Withmedical treatmentproving ineffective, she travels to New Asgard hoping that Thor's hammerMjolnir, which was previously fractured byHela,[b]might heal her.
Due to an enchantment Thor unknowingly placed on it years earlier to protect Foster, Mjolnir reforges and bonds itself to her. Thor arrives in New Asgard just as Gorr's attack begins. Thor is surprised to find Foster wielding Mjolnir, but teams up with her,Valkyrie, andKorgto fight Gorr. The group thwarts Gorr, but he escapes, kidnapping numerous Asgardian children and imprisoning them in the Shadow Realm. The group travels to Omnipotence City to warn the other gods and ask for their help in creating an army. The leader of the gods,Zeus, is unwilling to help, thinking they can remain safe and hidden from Gorr in the city; he also believes that Gorr will not be able to achieve his stated goal of visiting the realm ofEternity, where he will be granted one wish, presumably to destroy all gods. As a security precaution, Zeus orders the group's capture to prevent them from exposing the city's location to Gorr. When Zeus injures Korg, Thor impales Zeus with his own thunderbolt, which Valkyrie steals before they escape to confront Gorr in the Shadow Realm. On the way, Thor learns of Foster's cancer diagnosis.
The group arrives at the Shadow Realm but are unable to locate the children. Foster sees ancient drawings that depict Thor's battle-axeStormbreakeras a way to summon theBifrostto enter Eternity, and deduces the trap laid out by Gorr. She throws away Stormbreaker to prevent Gorr from accessing it. However, Gorr overpowers the group and threatens to kill Foster, forcing Thor to summon it back. Gorr successfully steals Stormbreaker and injures Valkyrie before a weakened Foster collapses.
Upon traveling back to New Asgard, Thor discovers that Foster's Thor form is not allowing her body to naturally fight the cancer. Due to this, Thor travels to Eternity's altar alone and using Zeus's thunderbolt, imbues the children with his power to fight Gorr's monsters while he battles Gorr. When Foster senses that Gorr is about to kill Thor, she joins the battle with Mjolnir to save him. They destroy the Necrosword, freeing Gorr from its influence, but the three are brought into Eternity's realm. With Gorr poised to make his wish, Thor implores Gorr to revive his daughter instead of destroying the gods. Thor then leaves Gorr to make his decision and attends to Foster, who succumbs to her illness and dies in his arms. Moved by their display, Gorr wishes for Eternity to revive Love, which it grants. As Gorr dies from the curse, he requests Thor to take care of Love.
In the aftermath, the children return to New Asgard, where Valkyrie and Sif commence their training, and a monument is erected in Foster's memory. Thor adopts Love, who accompanies him in his heroics, with Thor wielding Mjolnir and Love wielding Stormbreaker. In amid-credits scene, back in Omnipotence City, a recuperating Zeus sends his sonHerculesto kill Thor. In a post-credits scene, Foster arrives at the gates ofValhalla, whereHeimdallwelcomes her.

Jeff GoldblumandPeter Dinklagewere both originally set to reprise their respective roles asGrandmasterfrom previous MCU media andEitrifromAvengers: Infinity War(2018), but their scenes were cut from the theatrical release.[42]Lena Headeywas also set to appear in the film, but her scenes were cut as well.[43]
Shortly after the release of the thirdThorfilm,Thor: Ragnarok, in November 2017, that film's directorTaika Waititiand executives fromMarvel Studiosmet to discuss ideas for another film, which wasgreen-litfollowing the positive responses toRagnarok.[44]Chris Hemsworthindicated in January 2018 that he was interested in continuing to playThorin theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU), despite his contract with Marvel Studios being set to end with his role inAvengers: Endgame(2019).[45]By then, Hemsworth and Waititi had discussed what they would want in a potential fourthThorfilm,[46]and Hemsworth said a month later that he would consider returning if there was "another great script".[47]Tessa Thompson, who playsValkyriein theMCU films, believed in April 2019 that apitchhad been made for aRagnaroksequel that involved Waititi returning.[48]Hemsworth said then that he would continue to play Thor for as long as possible, crediting Waititi with revitalizing his interest in the role after he became exhausted and underwhelmed with it prior to makingRagnarok.[49]
In July 2019, Waititi officially signed on to write and direct a fourthThorfilm, with Hemsworth expected to reprise his role.[50]Waititi was not interested in repeating what they did withRagnarok, instead wanting to do "something more interesting for myself to keep the whole thing ignited and to make sure that I'm feeling creatively stimulated".[13]Later that month, atSan Diego Comic-Con,Marvel StudiosPresidentKevin Feigeannounced the film asThor: Love and Thunder, with a release date of November 5, 2021. Hemsworth and Thompson were confirmed to be returning along withNatalie Portman, reprising her role ofJane FosterfromThor(2011) andThor: The Dark World(2013).[7]Hemsworth, who would also serve as an executive producer,[51]was paid $20million upfront for the film,[52]an increase from the $15million upfront salary he earned for each of his appearances inRagnarok,Avengers: Infinity War(2018), andEndgame.[53]Portman agreed to return to the franchise, after her character had not been included inRagnarok, following a single meeting with Waititi, who was given creative freedom from Marvel Studios to reimagine her role in the film, in which he offered to portray the character in a different and fresh way, with a "license to be adventurous and fun and funny".[25][54][55]Thompson and Feige added that Valkyrie's bisexuality would be addressed in the sequel,retroactivelymaking her Marvel Studios' firstLGBTQsuperhero.[17][56]Marvel Studios executiveBrad Winderbaumwas producing the film alongside Feige.[11]
Don Harwin, theMinister for the Artsfor the Australian state ofNew South Wales, announced at the end of July thatThor: Love and Thunderwould be filmed atFox Studios Australiain Sydney back-to-back with Marvel Studios'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings(2021), with work set to begin onLove and Thunderthere in March 2020 ahead of an August 2020 filming start. The production was set to receive over AU$24 million (US$18 million) of subsidies from the Australian and New South Wales governments. Marvel Studios vice president David Grant said shooting the two films back-to-back would provide continuous employment for local crews, withLove and Thunderexpected to generate over AU$178 million (US$134 million) for the local economy. He added that the studio would work with "local educational institutions in creating internship opportunities".[57]Jeff Goldblumsaid in August 2019 that there was a chance he could reprise hisRagnarokrole of theGrandmasterin the sequel,[58]and Waititi confirmed in October that he would be reprising his own role ofKorgfromRagnarokandEndgame.[19]Christian Baleentered talks to join the cast in January 2020,[59]with pre-production expected to begin in April.[60]Thompson confirmed a month later that Bale would star as the villain in the film,[61]whileVin Diesel, who voicesGrootin the MCU films, said he had discussed the film with Waititi and had been told theGuardians of the Galaxywould be appearing in it.[62]In early April, Disney shifted much of theirPhase Fourslate of films due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, movingThor: Love and Thunder'srelease date to February 18, 2022.[63]Pre-production on the film was delayed due to the pandemic, with Waititi unsure when production would continue.[64]At the end of the month, Disney moved the release date up to February 11, 2022.[65]By July, filming was set to start in early 2021.[66]
When announcing the film in July 2019, Waititi said it would adapt elements fromJason Aaron'sMighty Thorcomic books by having Foster become a hero called the Mighty Thor.[7][67]Feige said that the film would include a lot of elements from Marvel comics and that the story line of Foster becoming the Mighty Thor would be an important part,[25][67]explaining that Marvel considered theMighty Thorrun to be one of the best recent comic books. Waititi read the comic while working onRagnarok, and when he agreed to direct anotherThorfilm, he told Marvel that he wanted to include Foster as the Mighty Thor.[25]The studio agreed to adapt Aaron's storyline and include Portman following discussions with Waititi about where the story could lead.[26]Waititi said they stuck close to Foster's storyline from those comics and tried to adapt its best parts. He also explained that Thor having his axeStormbreakerand then seeing his hammerMjolnirreturn "in the hands of someone else" and "no longer [being] his hammer" would explore "the idea that someone's taking his place", which he felt some fans assumed would occur, but did not believe this as such.[68]Aaron served as a consultant on the film.[69]A. C. Bradley, the creator andhead writerof the animated seriesWhat If...?(2021–present), pitched an episode of that series in which Foster would have become Thor, but the idea was rejected because the storyline was already being used forLove and Thunder.[70]
In August, Waititi was reported to have completed a script for the film,[71]but he denied this later that month.[72]While promoting his filmJojo Rabbit(2019) in October, Waititi said he had completed the first draft of the screenplay,[73]but the story would change throughout filming and editing. He was unsure if the film would include the storyline from Aaron's run in which Foster suffers frombreast cancer, which he said was a powerful part of the comics.[74]Portman later said Foster's treatment from cancer would be explored in the film.[24]Waititi added that Marvel was still discussing how much time would pass betweenEndgameandLove and Thunder, and that this would affect whether Thor is still carrying the extra weight he is depicted with inEndgame, which earned him the nicknames "Fat Thor" and "Bro Thor". Waititi did note that he wanted to "keep changing it up with Thor. He's so interesting when he's changing all the time."[73]The film is set eight years after Thor and Foster broke up, around 2024.[75]Waititi also acknowledged fans "shipping" Valkyrie withBrie Larson'sCarol Danvers / Captain Marvelbut said he did not intend to include a romantic relationship between the pair because he would rather surprise fans than do something by popular demand.[76]Jennifer Kaytin Robinsonwas hired to work on the film's screenplay with Waititi in February 2020.[77]Waititi received sole screenplay credit on the film's theatrical poster, with Robinson credited with him for the story,[78]before the final credits from theWriters Guild of Americacredited both Waititi and Robinson as the film's writers.[79]
Thor: Love and Thunderfollows Thor as he attempts to find inner peace, but must return to action and recruit Valkyrie, Korg, and Foster to stopGorr the God Butcherfrom eliminating all gods.[11]Four or five drafts of the screenplay had been completed by mid-April 2020,[64]when Waititi said the sequel was "so over the top now in the very best way" and would makeRagnaroklook like a "run of the mill, very safe film" by doubling down on its crazier aspects.[64][76]He wanted to up the ante and make the film as if "10-year-olds told us what should be in a movie and we said yes to every single thing." Waititi added that the film would explore more of Korg'sKronanculture and indicated that it would include theSpace Sharksalien race from the comics. He expressed interest in featuring the characterBeta Ray Bill, but was unsure at that point if he would.[64]
At the end of July, Waititi said they had been writing the script off and on for over a year and he was taking another pass on it that week. He said it was very romantic, and explained that he wanted to make aromance filmbecause he wanted to make something that he had not done before,[66][80]and, as such, wrote the film as a love story.[81]He later said the film was "about love, with superheroes and outer space", and that he wanted to "embrace this thing that I was always a bit dismissive of, and explore this idea of love, and show characters who do believe in love".[82]That October, Hemsworth said Waititi was still writing the script and expressed his excitement for doing something drastically different with his character, as he did in his previous three MCU films.[83]Waititi later describedLove and Thunderas the craziest film he had ever made and explained that each element was intended to not make sense. He said it would have its own "distinct flavour" fromRagnarok,[84]which he called a 1970s space opera with a festive, party-like tone. He saw this film as a 1980s adventure, taking inspiration from posters for films such asConan the Barbarian(1982) andThe Beastmaster(1982) as well as art seen on vans inVenice Beach,[13]with theworks ofJack Kirbyand the cover of "old"Mills & Boonromance novels also serving as "visual touchstones" for the film.[81]He said it was not serious or dramatic, but it did explore themes such as love, loss, and "our place in the world" while making the characters ask themselves the questions: "What is your purpose? What is the reason that you're a hero, and what do you do when you have these powers?"[13]The film's ending involving Love underwent multiple revisions.[85]
James Gunn, the writer and director of the threeGuardians of the Galaxyfilms, consulted on how the Guardians characters were used inLove and Thunder,[86]with Gunn and Waititi discussing where the characters were going before Waititi began writing. Waititi read Gunn's script forGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3(2023), which is set afterLove and Thunder, and then Gunn read Waititi's script and shared his thoughts,[87]asking for some adjustments to be made.[88]In January 2021, Gunn said the Guardians were "in great hands" with Waititi,[86]and he later praised Waititi's work on the script.[89]Chris PrattsaidLove and Thunderwould continue the rivalry between Guardians leaderPeter Quill / Star-Lordand Thor that was established inInfinity WarandEndgame,[90]whileKaren Gillansaid Waititi brought out the "bonkers side" ofNebulathrough her "pure aggression".[91]
Pre-production began in Australia by October 2020.[24]A month later, Chris Pratt was revealed to be reprising his role as Guardians of the Galaxy leader Peter Quill / Star-Lord.[92]Given the ensemble nature of the cast, industry insiders described the film as feeling like "Avengers 5".[93]In December, Feige revealed that the film's release was delayed again, this time to May 6, 2022, and he announced that Bale would portray Gorr the God Butcher in the film.[94]Jaimie Alexanderwas also revealed to be reprising her MCU role inLove and Thunder, returning asSiffrom the first twoThorfilms after not appearing inRagnarok,[18][95][96]alongside other members and allies of the Guardians of the Galaxy:Pom KlementieffasMantis,[97]Dave BautistaasDrax the Destroyer, Karen Gillan as Nebula,[98]andSean GunnasKraglin Obfonteri; Gunn also provides on set reference for Guardians memberRocket.[98][99]Matt Damonwas set to appear, after making a cameo appearance inRagnarokas an Asgardian actor playingLoki.[98][100]He received special permission to enter Australia, despite the country's stricttravel restrictions during the pandemic, sinceLove and Thunderwas providing jobs for Australians.[101]This prompted criticism as it was perceived that Damon, who traveled with his family, received preferential treatment to enter when many Australian nationals abroad were unable to return to the country.[100]Sam Neill—who appeared alongside Damon inRagnarokas an actor playingOdin—said there was a good chance he would be in the film as well, as long as he could travel from New Zealand to Australia during the pandemic.[102]
Mayes C. Rubeoserved as the film's costume designer, after doing so forRagnarok.[103][104]ForLove and Thunder, Rubeo focused on making clothes that reflect faithfully to the comics and fit Thor's mythology.[103]Making of Foster's costume required 10set constructions.[105]Rubeo created Foster's costume "based on the old comics" while maintaining her heroic attributes, with advanced technology that was "flexible and versatile". As Portman wasvegan, it was important to Rubeo that she make Foster's costume out of non-animal materialssuch as plastic and othersyntheticmaterials. To differentiate Foster from Thor, Rubeo added "silver metallic and deeper red hues" to Foster's costume since Thor's one used "new colors", as well as her winged helmet.[103][104]Rubeo created 25 costumes for Hemsworth. These included many types of Thor's typical uniform which Rubeo integrated "more vibrant colors, like reds, blues and metallic golds to match the exaggerated aesthetic of the film."[103][104]Thor's 1980s costume was influenced byKurt Russell's character Jack Burton inBig Trouble in Little China(1986),[106]and his other costumes made more "flashier" compared to Foster's. Gorr's costume—unlike those of most of the characters inLove and Thunder, which were taken directly from the comics—was redesigned for the film, with Rubeo usingclassical sculpturesas a source of inspiration for his outfit during thedrapingprocess. For a "great contrast to vibrant colors" used by other characters, Rubeo applied white to his costume rather than black, reflecting his supernatural nature.[103][104]Rubeo bought 50 yards (46 m) of linen to hide the costume'swire riggerand theheating, ventilation, and air conditioningsystem; this prevented Bale from overheating. Leather masters Augusto and Giampaolo Grassi were hired to make a breastplate forZeus' costume usinggold leaf.[106]
Principal photographybegan on January 26, 2021,[107]at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney,[57]under theworking titleThe Big Salad.[108]Barry "Baz" Idoine serves as the cinematographer,[109]after previously working with Waititi on theDisney+Star WarsseriesThe Mandalorian(2019–present).[110]Filming was delayed from an initial August 2020 start date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[57][66]Industrial Light & Magicprovided the sameStageCraftvirtual production technology used onThe Mandalorianwhich Waititi directed an episode of, creating a custom volume space at Fox Studios Australia. It featured more LED panels and offered a higher resolution than the original volume created forThe Mandalorian.[111]Waititi also used Satellite Lab's PlateLight technology (after previously using their Dynamiclight technology onRagnarok), which is a special rig designed to capture multiple lighting set-ups simultaneously within a single shot at a high frame rate, allowing Waititi to select which lighting set up he would like in post-production.[112]Waititi believed he was able to shootLove and Thundermore efficiently thanRagnarokdue to already having experience working on a Marvel Studios film.[13]
Filming occurred atCentennial Parkin Sydney in early February,[113]with Klementieff, Gillan, Bautista, and Pratt completing their scenes shortly afterward.[114][115][116]In early March, set photos revealed Damon and Neill were reprising their roles as the Asgardian actors playing Loki and Odin, along withLuke Hemsworthin hisRagnarokrole as the actor playing Thor.Melissa McCarthywas also revealed to be portraying an actress playingHelaalongside her husbandBen Falconein an undisclosed role; these cameos were for a sequence where actors reenact scenes fromRagnarok.[29]Damon filmed his part over two days.[101]Alexander completed filming her scenes by the end of the month,[117]while Goldblum was confirmed to appear as the Grandmaster,[118]andRussell Crowewas revealed to be appearing in the film in what was described as a "funcameo".[119]Crowe finished filming his scenes in late April, around which time it was confirmed that he would play Zeus in the film.[21]Crowe was originally set to playSatanin the film before his character was changed to Zeus.[120]Septimus Caton would later be cast as Satan and had makeup and prosthetic tests done, but the character does not appear in the film.[16]At the beginning of May, Waititi said there were four weeks left of shooting,[121]while Idoine said he would continue work on the film through the end of 2021.[110]Filmingwrappedon June 1, 2021,[122]by which point Neill had revealed that singerJenny Morriswould appear in the film,[123]making a cameo as aNew Asgardcitizen.[20]Goldblum andPeter Dinklage, who was set to reprise his role asEitrifromInfinity War, had their scenes cut from the theatrical release,[42]as didLena Headey, who was approached by Waititi for a role in the film.[43]
Waititi said in early June 2021 that post-production would be completed by February 2022.[124]Later in June, Diesel was confirmed to be reprising his voice role as Groot.[125]In October 2021, the film's release date was delayed to July 8, 2022,[126]whileSimon Russell Bealewas revealed to have been cast in an undisclosed role that was subsequently confirmed to be theOlympiangodDionysus,[127][20]though the scene Beale appeared in was ultimately cut from the final film and the actor was relegated to anextrarole inLove and Thunder.[128]Additional photography for the film took place in early 2022.[129]At the start of March, further reshoots were revealed to be happening "in the coming weeks",[130]and were said to have begun with Bale by the week of March 18.[129][131]The teaser trailer released in April confirmed thatBradley Cooperwould be reprising his MCU role as the voice of Rocket in the film,[11]and Akosia Sabet was revealed to be appearing as the goddessBastthe following month.[35]Following the appearance ofBrett Goldsteinin the film'smid-credits sceneasHercules, Waititi revealed in July 2022 that Feige "really wanted him" to be cast for that role.[132]
Additional characters appearing in the film include:Falligar the Behemoth, one of the gods slain by Gorr;[133]the cosmic wish-granting entityEternity;[134]Thor's magical goatsToothgnasher and Toothgrinder, based on theNorse mythologicalanimalsTanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr;[135]and Warsong, Valkyrie's winged steed.[136]The latter was renamed fromAragornas in the comics to Warsong forLove and Thunder, after previously appearing unnamed inRagnarokandEndgame.[137]Waititi had planned to haveJesusmake a cameo appearance as part of acutaway gagin the Omnipotence City sequence, after Valkyrie mentioned a "God of Carpentry".[138]The characterCyttorakwas considered to appear in the film as one of the deities seen in Omnipotent City, but the idea was scrapped.[139]Storyboardsby artist Anthony Lee Winn forLove and Thundersuggest that the charactersGalactus,Fin Fang Foom, andShuma-Gorathwere also considered for inclusion in the film; Shuma-Gorath previously appeared in the MCU filmDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness(2022) under the nameGargantos.[140]Visual effects for the film were created byWētā FX,Rising Sun Pictures,Framestore,Industrial Light & Magic,Method Studios,Luma Pictures, Raynault VFX,Base FX, EDI Effetti Digitali Italiani, Mammal Studios, Fin Design + Effects, andCinesite.[141]Matthew Schmidt, Peter S. Elliot, Tim Roche, and Jennifer Vecchiarello served as the film's editors,[109]while Jake Morrison served as the visual effects supervisor.[141]Perceptiondesigned the film's main-on-end title sequence, drawing inspiration from 1980s rock band logos and designing approximately 250 custom fonts for the sequence.[142]
In December 2021,Michael Giacchinorevealed that he would be scoring the film; he previously scoredDoctor Strange(2016) and theMCUSpider-Mantrilogyfor Marvel Studios, as well as Waititi's previous filmJojo Rabbit(2019).[143]A soundtrack album, featuring Giacchino's original themes along with the score composed by him andNami Melumad, was released byHollywood RecordsandMarvel Musicon July 6, 2022. The single "Mama's Got a Brand New Hammer", the film's main suite, was released on June 30.[144][145]Waititi wanted the music to reflect the same aesthetic of the film with its "bombastic, loud, colorful palette". "Sweet Child o' Mine" byGuns N' Rosesis featured in the film, given Guns N' Roses is one of Waititi's favorite bands, and helped "reflect the sort of crazy adventure that we're [visually] presenting";[146]the song was also used in the film's marketing.[147]The film features the song "Rainbow in the Dark" byDio, according to Wendy Dio, widow of band memberRonnie James Dio.[148]
Legosets andHasbrofigures based on the film were revealed in February 2022,[149]with additional Lego sets andFunko Popsrevealed that April.[150]The teaser trailer was released on April 18,[11]and commentators discussed its ending, which debuted Portman's Foster in the Mighty Thor costume and wielding a restored version of Thor's hammer Mjolnir. Marco Vito Oddo ofColliderand Ryan Parker fromThe Hollywood Reporterhighlighted the use of "Sweet Child o' Mine", which Oddo felt indicated Waititi would "keep the hard rock aesthetics that helpedThor: Ragnarokbecome a huge success", while Parker called it a "bright, stylish, fun trailer [that] sets a tone for the film in true Taika Waititi form".[151][147][152]Justin Harp ofDigital Spyfelt the humor fromRagnarokwas "clearly back in this film too",[153]while Tom Power ofTechRadarfelt the trailer was a "superhero, intergalactic glam rock feast for the senses" and contained intriguing footage that did a good job of teasing the film.[154]BothThe Ringer'sDaniel Chin andEmpire'sSophie Butcher highlighted the trailer's focus on Thor's journey of self-discovery as well as the lack of footage of Bale's Gorr. Chin remarked that the trailer was "dedicated to catching up with Thor as he rediscovers himself", and was excited for Portman's performance as Foster. He thought the trailer was a "far cry from theThorwe witnessed over a decade ago, as the franchise has transformed into a full-blown space comedy". Butcher felt the trailer's introspection was not surprising due to the film being set afterEndgame, and said the trailer was brief but exciting.[155][156]The trailer had 209 million global views in its first 24 hours, becoming the seventh most viewed trailer in that time period.[157]
A second trailer was released on May 23, during Game 4 of the2022 NBA Eastern Conference finals.[158]Many commentators highlighted Bale's appearance as Gorr the God Butcher in the trailer.[158][159][160]Eric Francisco ofInversenoted the similar comedic tone fromRagnarokwhile adding "some darker shades" with the inclusion of Gorr. He said Bale brought an "absolutelyterrifyingvision of Gorr the God Butcher to the screen", adding that it appears Hemsworth was ready to pass the mantle of Thor to Portman.[159]Jennifer Ouellette ofArs Technicanoted that Gorr's scenes featured a different color palette, being shown in "primarily gray tones", which she felt made the contrast between other characters "more stark".[160]Zach Seemayer fromEntertainment Tonightfelt that it "gives fans everything they've been hoping for from the brief flashes of important moments from the first trailer in April", citing scenes featuring Portman's the Mighty Thor, Thor "living up to his 'Space Viking' title", and Gorr's footage.[161]Similarly,The A.V. Club'sSam Barsanti and William Hughes also highlighted Portman and Hemsworth's Thor, Gorr's appearance, and other comedic moments in the trailer, such as when Thor is nude after Crowe's Zeus exposes his disguise.[162]Scott Mendelson ofForbescalled the trailer "the real deal" compared to the teaser, and noted similarities with theMasters of the Universefranchise. He speculated that Thor and Foster would be "pining" for each other despite it being 11 years after their first encounter, and called it "a little depressing", as he hoped the two "A+ dating specimens would have moved on". He also highlighted how Gorr's scenes played with color and contrast, and the "interplay" between Foster and Valkyrie.[163]Footage from the film was also featured in the 2022CineEuropepresentation.[164]
Ulta Beautypartnered with Marvel Studios to create a makeup collection based on the film.[165]On July 9, 2022, Waititi and Thompson appeared onVanity Fair'sNotes on a Sceneseries, analysing the "Taste the Rainbow" scene.[166]The video was met with criticism for what some viewers perceived as Waititi and Thompson "mocking" the visual effects, on the same day that multiple VFX artists who worked for Marvel had spoken out against being "underpaid" and "overworked" by the studio's productions.[167]

In early reactions to the film,Screen Rantnoted that the performances from Christian Bale and Natalie Portman were praised.[200]Owen GleibermanofVarietysaid there are "many words to describe [Thor: Love and Thunder]", stating "comedy is all part of the package" that madeRagnarok"such a genuine Marvel wildflower." Gleiberman wrote that the film "sustains its freshness" to the end, although it started with a "more awkward" first act with the Guardians of the Galaxy. He also praised Gorr's characterization–a "power[ful introduction]"–and concluded the review by saying he felt "moved" by the end.[201]David Ehrlich ofIndieWirepraised the film for its light tone and humorous moments, writing that "[Taika] Waititi continues to brighten up the Thor movies with his own flavor of wackiness, which is as welcome here as it was grating inJojo Rabbit." However, he noted that the film "is clouded by its uncertain place in the universe from the moment it starts".[2]Nick Allen atRogerEbert.comgave the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating that it was "more or less a victory lap for all that [Waititi] achieved with his previous Marvel film, the often hilarious, rousing, and plainly refreshingThor: Ragnarok. And while it has too many familiar flourishes and jokes, this entertaining sequel is still a force for good, with enough visual ambition and heart in front of and behind the camera to stand on its own." He praised Natalie Portman's performance that "conveys why it's great to see Jane again" and Christian Bale's "striking" role that he considered as the "closest we'll get to seeing him playPennywise the Clown, with a dash ofVoldemort, but tethered to the same humility [he] brings to his most human, humbled characters."[202]
Todd Gilchrist atThe A.V. Clubgraded the film 'B', feeling that it did "[revisit] the cheeky, sentimental tone of the nearly universally belovedThor: Ragnarok, and propels its eponymous hero into new adventures that bring full circle a journey that started with the very first, much-less-belovedThorback in 2011." He praised Portman and Bale's performances, with the latter's character being considered "the most interesting and sympathetic Marvel adversary sinceMichael B. Jordan's Killmonger inBlack Panther", and Waititi's "distinctive imagery [in the film] that may disturb and upset some viewers", outpacingSam Raimi's accomplishments inDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness(2022).[203]Leah Greenblatt atEntertainment Weeklyalso gave a similar grade, feeling that although "its cheerful melee of starry cameos, in-jokes, and Cliffs-Notes mythology, feels a lot like franchise fatigue, it also has frequent moments of gonzo charm, thanks largely to the Technicolor lunacy of writer-director [Waititi] and a cast that seems inordinately game to follow his lead."[204]
David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterstated, "The movie feels weightless, flippant, instantly forgettable, sparking neither love nor thunder."[109]David Sims ofThe Atlanticfelt the film delivered a "usual lightning-streaked action and tossed-off gags, but this time, there's not enough heft behind the flashiness." He found it a "hasty-feeling mess of a movie" and "disappointing given that it's directed by [Waititi]", although he praised Bale's and Russell Crowe's performances.[205]David Fear ofRolling Stonefelt the film was "oddly unengaging; even the love and death aspects often feel like cold transmissions from distant sources." He saw it as a mess due to the "collision of competing tones, subplots, conceptual big swings and chaos masquerading as pathos".[206]Eric Francisco atInversefound Chris Hemsworth's Thor in the film becoming "meandering, left in the purgatory of a roundabout tale that makes some sense on paper but in execution fails to maintain viscosity", feeling that Marvel "doesn't know what to do with [the character] anymore." He felt that despite "striv[ing] for an emotional story about loss and love, the movie gets in its own way with tiresome relentless comedy, distracted plotting, and uneven tone."[207]Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film 2 out of 4 stars, calling it "one of the goofiest and least consequential sagas in MCU history—an allegedly wild and wacky but ultimately disappointing and disjointed chapter in the ongoing story of the God of Thunder, who seems to get more clueless with each passing movie."[208]
At the London premiere Q&A, in response to the question "How gay will the film be?" Waititi exclaimed that it would be "super gay"; critics and moviegoers who saw the film expressed disappointment that this statement was false and that Marvelqueerbaitedthe audience.[209][210][211]Jade King ofTheGamerfelt expectations from queer audiences for prominent "LGBTQ+ characters and themes" inThor: Love and Thunderwere not met, writing that "the film's creators have been out there talking up the LGBTQ+ representation when it isn't really a massive part of the experience. [...] it's time to temper your expectations and stop letting Marvel continue to queerbait us into disappointment."[212]
In June 2023, Hemsworth commented on the film's response, stating: "I think we just had too much fun. It just became too silly. It's always hard being in the center of it and having any real perspective [...] you just don't know how people are going to respond."[213]He later reflected on his own performance, believing he had become "a parody of [himself]" with the improv and "wackiness" of the film, and that he "didn’t stick the landing".[214]
In February 2021, the documentary seriesMarvel Studios: Assembledwas announced.[227]The special on this film, "The Making ofThor: Love and Thunder", was released on Disney+ on September 8, 2022, part of Disney+ Day.[183]
Waititi was unaware that the tagline "Thor will return" was added to the end of the film. Waititi was open to directing anotherThorfilm if Hemsworth was also involved, stating the story would need to be "something surprising and unexpected", suggesting a low-budgetroad trip filmwith no fight scenes, similar toNebraska(2013).[228]Hemsworth hoped that a future installment would have a "drastically different tone" that would "close the book" on the character.[229]In June 2023, Hemsworth said informal conversations had discussed potential ideas for future appearances for the character. He also explained that he would want to return to Thor if all creatives were able to find another way to reinvent the character again to keep the experience "a little unpredictable" in order to not become stale with audiences.[230]Waititi noted inTitan Books'Thor: Love and Thunder – The Official Movie Special Book, which was published in August 2023, that any additionalThorfilm would need to continue the character's evolution "but still in a very fun way and still giving him things to come up against" and would need to have a villain more powerful thanHela, who is featured inRagnarok.[231]In November 2023, Waititi confirmed that he would not be involved with a fifthThorfilm.[232]

During what is known as Marvel's "Timely era",Captain Americawas licensed out toRepublic Picturesfora 1944 serial filmonly for the free advertising. Timely failed to provide any drawing of Captain America withhis shieldor any further background, and Republic created a whole new background for the character and portrayed the character using a gun.[11]From the late 1970s through the early 1990s,Marvel Comics GroupandMarvel Entertainment Group(MEG) sold options to studios to produce films based onMarvel Comics characters. One of Marvel's superheroes,Spider-Man, was optioned in the late 1970s, and rights reverted to Marvel without a film having been produced within the allocated time frame. From 1986 to 1996, most of Marvel's major characters were optioned, including theFantastic Four,X-Men,Daredevil, theHulk,Silver Surfer, andIron Man.[12]Marvel's first big-screen adaptation of one of its properties was the 1986 filmHoward the Duck,[13]which was abox-office bomb.[14]MEG was purchased byNew World Entertainmentin November 1986[15]and moved to produce films based on the Marvel characters. It releasedThe Punisher(1989) before MEG was sold toRonald Perelman'sAndrews Group. Two other films were produced:Captain America(1990) released in the United Kingdom on screens and direct to video in the United States, andThe Fantastic Four(1994), not intended for release.[16]
After MEG acquiredToyBizin 1993,Avi Aradof ToyBiz was named president and chief executive officer (CEO) of both the Marvel Films division andNew World Family Filmworks, aNew World Entertainmentsubsidiary. New World was MEG's former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group.[17][18]Marvel ProductionsbecameNew World Animationby 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films, includingMarvel Films Animation.[17][19][20]Marvel Films Animation sharedTom Tataranowiczwith New World Animation as head of development and production.[21]New World Animation (The Incredible Hulk),Saban(X-Men: The Animated Series) and Marvel Films Animation (Spider-Man) each produced a Marvel series for television for the 1996–1997 season.[22][20][23]By the end of 1993, Arad and20th Century Foxstruck a deal to make a film based on theX-Men.[24]In August 1996, New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation were sold along with the rest of New World by the Andrews Group toNews Corporationand theFox Entertainment Group. As part of the deal, Marvel licensed the rights to Captain America, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer to be on theFox Kids Networkand produced by Saban. New World Animation continued producing a second season ofThe Incredible HulkforUPN.[22][25]
On August 7, 1996, Marvel Studios was created by Marvel. Filing with theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionto raise money to finance the new corporation, Marvel,Isaac Perlmutter's Zib, Inc. and Avi Arad sold ToyBiz stocks.[12][26]ToyBiz filed an offering of 7.5 million shares with a closing price of $20.125 at the time, making the offering worth approximately $150 million. ToyBiz sought to sell 1 million shares.[27]Jerry Calabrese, the president of Marvel Entertainment Group, and Avi Arad, head of Marvel Films and a director of ToyBiz, were assigned tandem control of Marvel Studios. Under Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to controlpre-productionby commissioning scripts, hiring directors, and casting characters, providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution. Arad said of the goal for control, "When you get into business with a big studio, they are developing a hundred or 500 projects; you get totally lost. That isn't working for us. We're just not going to do it anymore. Period."[12]Marvel Studios arranged a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox to cover markets in the United States and internationally.[28]
In December 1996, Marvel Entertainment Group underwent aChapter 11 bankruptcyreorganization plan, including Marvel Studios as part of its strategic investment.[29]By 1997, Marvel Studios was actively pursuing various film productions based on Marvel characters, including the eventual filmsX-Men(2000),Daredevil(2003),Elektra(2005), andFantastic Four(2005). Unproduced projects includedPrince Namor, based on the characterNamorand to be directed byPhilip Kaufman, andMort the Dead Teenager, based on the comic book of the same name and written by John Payson andMortcreatorLarry Hama.[30]Marvel's Captain America animated series with Saban Entertainment for Fox Kids Network was set to premiere in late 1998. However, due to the bankruptcy, the series was canceled after only character designs and a one-minute promotional reel were made.[31][32][33]
The first film packaged and licensed by Marvel Studios wasBlade(1998), based on the vampire hunterBlade. The film was directed byStephen Norringtonand starredWesley SnipesasBlade. It was released on August 21, 1998, grossing $70,087,718 in the United States and Canada and $131,183,530 worldwide.[34]Bladewas followed byX-Men, which was directed byBryan Singerand was released on July 14, 2000.X-Mengrossed $157,299,717 in the United States and Canada and $296,250,053 worldwide.[35]BladeandX-Mendemonstrated that widely popular films could be made out of comic book characters not familiar to the general public.[36]Leading up toX-Men'srelease, Marvel Studios negotiated a deal with then-functionalArtisan Entertainment, successful with the low-budgetThe Blair Witch Project, for a co-production joint venture that included rights to 15 Marvel characters including Captain America,Thor(as a television series),Black Panther(with Snipes attached to produce and star),Deadpool,Iron Fist,Morbius, the Living Vampire,Longshot,Power Pack,Mort the Dead Teenager,Ant-Man,[37]and thePunisher.[38]Artisan would finance and distribute while Marvel would develop licensing and merchandising tie-ins. The resulting production library, which would also include television series, direct-to-video films, and internet projects, would be co-owned.[37]By 2001, the success of Marvel Entertainment'sUltimate Marvelimprint comics created leverage in Hollywood for Marvel Studios, pushing more properties into development.[39]
The next film licensed from Marvel Studios wasSpider-Man(2002) byColumbia Pictures, directed bySam Raimiand starringTobey MaguireasSpider-Man. The film was released on May 3, 2002, grossing $403,706,375 in the United States and Canada and $821,708,551 worldwide.[42]The early success ofSpider-Manled the film's studio to issue a seven-figure advance for a sequel. Arad spoke of the deal, "Movies make sequels. Therefore, it's a big economic luxury to know that a movie's going to get a second and third. This is a business of precedence."[43]According to aLehman Brothersanalysis, Marvel Studios made only $62 million for the first twoSpider-Manfilms.[44]Marvel was making more from half the consumer product licensing fees while making relatively little from the films, but it was enough for Marvel to regain its financial footing.[41]In October 2002, Marvel Studios announced deals for the Sub-Mariner andPrimewithUniversal Pictures.[45]
In contrast to the original storylines ofDC Comics'SupermanandBatmanfilms, Marvel films often emphasized more fidelity to its comics, applying set pieces, scenes, plots, and dialogue drawn from them.[36]In 2003,David Maiselapproached Arad about earning Marvel more for its films. Maisel, Arad, and Perlmutter met, leading to Maisel being hired as president andchief operating officer(COO). The studio's office was small onSanta Monica Boulevard, with around a dozen staff members.Kevin Feige, who later became the president of Marvel Studios, was then a junior executive generating script notes for the licensed studios.[41]In January 2003, Marvel, theSci-Fi Channel, andReveille Productionsagreed to develop two pilot films based onBrother VoodooandStrikeforce: Morituri.[46]In December 2003,Lionsgatepurchased Artisan Entertainment and they decided to let all of the character rights Artisan held, except Punisher, revert to Marvel.[47][48]: 279Marvel Studios partnered with Lionsgate in 2004 to produce eight animated films, calledMarvel Animated Features, for the direct-to-DVD market withLionsgate Home Entertainmenthandling distribution.[49][50]The line was a proof of concept for Maisel's later plan.[41]Eric Rollman was hired by Marvel as Executive Vice President of home entertainment & TV production for Marvel Studios to oversee the deal with Lionsgate.[51]
Maisel was hired in 2004 as president and chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self-finance its films.[40][41]Marvel entered into anon-recourse debtstructure withMerrill Lynchthat was collateralized by certainfilm rightsto a total of ten characters from Marvel's vast vault. Marvel received $525 million to make a maximum of ten films based on the company's properties over eight years, according to the parameters of the original deal. Those characters wereAnt-Man,the Avengers, Black Panther, Captain America,Cloak & Dagger,Doctor Strange,Hawkeye,Nick Fury,Power Pack, andShang-Chi.[52]Ambacinsured the films would succeed or they would pay the interest payment on the debt and get the film rights as collateral.[44]Initially, Marvel Studios was in talks with Universal Pictures as a possible distributor, because Universal owned the film rights to both the Hulk and Namor during that time.[53][54]Negotiations dragged on, so the studio began talks withParamount Pictures. In the second quarter of 2005, Merrill attempted to back out of full financing of each film, demanding that Marvel finance one-third of the budget. Marvel took back rights in five foreign territories from Paramount for pre-sell to meet that demand.[41]In September 2005, Marvel announced the Merrill Lynch financing deal with Paramount was on as marketer and distributor. Marvel Studios' parent company Marvel Enterprises, Inc. then changed its name toMarvel Entertainment, Inc.to reflect the change to self-production.[52]
The studio moved to a new location over aMercedes-Benzdealership inBeverly Hills, California. Maisel was also named vice-chairman of the studio, but reported to Marvel Entertainment CEOIsaac Perlmutter.[41]In November 2005,Michael Helfantjoined the studio as president and chief operating officer.[55]Also that month, Marvel gained the film rights to Iron Man fromNew Line Cinema. Marvel then revealed that it had regained the film rights to the Hulk from Universal in February 2006,[56]in exchange for letting Universal own the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulk(2008) and the right of first refusal to pick up the distribution rights to any future Marvel Studios-producedHulkfilms.[57]In April 2006, Thor was announced to be a Marvel Studios production,[58]while Lions Gate Entertainment subsequently dropped theBlack Widowfilm it had in development since 2004 and returned the rights to Marvel.[59]
Maisel and Arad fought over the rate of film releases and the strength of characters in the film lineup. Perlmutter supported Maisel and thus, in May 2006, Arad quit as studio chair and CEO.[40][60]In March 2007, Helfant was "forced out" of the studio while Maisel was named chairman and Kevin Feige was named president of production to replace Helfant asIron Man(2008) began filming.[61][62]In January 2008,Marvel Animationwas incorporated to direct Marvel's efforts in animation and home entertainment markets including then animation efforts with Lionsgate andNickelodeon.[51]In March, the company agreed to a five-picture basic cable distribution withFXfor the filmsIron ManandThe Incredible Hulk, with additional films to be named later.[63]Following the successful opening weekend ofIron Manin May 2008, Maisel had his contract extended through 2010 and Feige was promoted to president of Marvel Studios.[64]In November, Marvel Studios signed a lease withRaleigh Studiosto host its headquarters and production offices and film the next four films on the studios' slate, includingIron Man 2(2010) andThor(2011), at itsManhattan Beach Studios Media Campusfacilities.[65]By September 2008, Paramount added five additional Marvel films' foreign distribution to its domestic film distribution contract.[66]

On August 31, 2009,the Walt Disney Companyannounced that it had reached a deal to acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion.[69]The deal was completed on December 31, with Marvel Entertainment becoming a subsidiary of Disney.[70]Both Marvel and Disney stated that the merger would not affect any pre-existing deals with other film studios for the time being,[71]although Disney said they would distribute future Marvel projects withits own studioonce the deals expired.[72]Maisel stepped down from the studio following the sale to Disney.[73]In April 2010, rumors circulated that Marvel was looking to create $20–40 million films based on properties such as Doctor Strange,Ka-Zar, Luke Cage,Dazzler, and Power Pack.[74]Feige responded by saying, while budgets are generally never discussed early in development, Marvel was considering films for all characters mentioned in the rumor, except Dazzler, whose rights were at Fox.[75]
In June 2010, Marvel Entertainment set up a television division within Marvel Studios calledMarvel Televisionto be headed up byJeph Loebas Executive Vice President,[76]under which Marvel Animation would be operated.[77]In October,Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesacquired the distribution rights forThe Avengers(2012) andIron Man 3(2013) from Paramount Pictures[78]with Paramount's logo and credit remaining on those films.[79]In August 2011, at Disney's behest, the studio dismissed most of its marketing department, including EVP of Worldwide Marketing Dana Precious, VP of Worldwide Marketing Jeffrey Stewart, and Manager of Worldwide Marketing Jodi Miller. Disney subsequently began marketing Marvel's films.[80]In April 2012, the Walt Disney Company China, Marvel Studios, andDMG Entertainmentannounced an agreement to co-produceIron Man 3in China.

In August 2015, Marvel Studios was placed intoWalt Disney Studios, with Feige reporting directly to Walt Disney Studios chairmanAlan F. Horninstead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter. Marvel Television and subsidiary Marvel Animation were left under Marvel Entertainment and Perlmutter's control.[86][87]As of April 2017, Marvel Studios was housed on the second floor of theFrank G. Wells Buildingat the Disney studio lot.[1][2]Fast Companyranked Marvel Studios number eleven on its 2018 World's Most Innovative Companies list.[88]
In September 2018, it was reported that Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for the streaming serviceDisney+, to be centered on "second tier" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films. Characters being considered for series includedLokiandScarlet Witch, with the actors who portrayed the characters in the films expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes, with a "hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a "hands-on role" in each series' development.[89]In October 2019, Feige was given the title ofChief Creative Officer, Marvel, and would oversee the creative direction of Marvel Television andMarvel Family Entertainment, with both being returned to being under the Marvel Studios banner.[90]Two months later, Marvel Television was folded into Marvel Studios, with Marvel Studios overseeing development of all the Marvel Television series in production at the time of its closing.Karim Zreik, Marvel Television's senior vice president of current programming and production, would join Marvel Studios alongside his team to oversee the production of the Marvel Television series inherited by Marvel Studios.[91]
In May 2022, Marvel Studios signed a 20-year licensing deal with Stan Lee Universe to license the name and likeness of Lee for use in future films, television series, Disney theme parks and cruises, various "experiences", and merchandising. A digitally recreated Lee was not expected to make cameo appearances in future projects, rather the deal allows Marvel to use Lee's name, voice, likeness, signature, and existing images and archival material.[92]In June 2023, the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulkreverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.[93]
By October 2023, Marvel Studios was planning to hire dedicated executives to focus on its television efforts, as part of a larger plan tochange its approach to its television series.[94]Production and development executive Richie Palmer was serving as a television executive by January 2024.[95]In May 2024, Marvel Studios revealed that its live-action Disney+ series would be released under a new "Marvel Television" banner, separate from the previous company of the same name, starting withAgatha All Alonglater in 2024.[96]
In June 2021, ahead of Marvel Studios' first solely produced animated seriesWhat If...?, executive vice president of film productionVictoria Alonsonoted that the studio was creating an "animation branch and mini-studio" to focus on more animated content beyondWhat If...?.[97]Marvel Studios outsources the animation for its animated series to third-party animation studios, though executive Brad Winderbaum indicated Marvel would work with fellow Disney studiosPixarandWalt Disney Animation Studios"under the right circumstances".[98]In September 2021, Alonso was promoted to President of Physical, Post Production, VFX and Animation.[99]In November 2021, Marvel Studios announced the animated seriesX-Men '97(2024–present), arevivalofX-Men: The Animated Series(1992–1997) that is set in that series' continuity.[100]The animation branch of Marvel Studios and "mini-studio" is known as Marvel Studios Animation.[7]By April 2022, Marvel Studios had taken over production of the preschool animated seriesSpidey and His Amazing Friends, starting from its second season; the first season was produced under the Marvel Entertainment banner.[101]The "Marvel Animation" name and banner was used for the division's projects by May 2024.[96]
In March 2023, Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios by a group includingDisney Entertainmentco-chairmanAlan Bergmanand Disney's human resources and legal departments for serving as a producer on theAmazon StudiosfilmArgentina, 1985(2022); this was a breach of a 2018 agreement between Alonso and Disney which stated employees would not work for a competing studio.[102][103]Alonso reportedly did not seek permission to work on the film, and was asked by Disney to stop working on the film, as well as not to promote or publicize it, with the situation "deemed serious enough" that Disney requested a new agreement be signed. Despite this, Alonso continued to promote the film following its September 2022 premiere, and was consistently reminded of her agreement and breach of contract, ultimately leading to her firing.[102]Alonso's lawyers refuted this claim, stating Disney was aware of, and agreed to, Alonso's work onArgentina, 1985, and that she was instead "silenced[... and] was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible";[104]this incident was reported to be a disagreement with a Disney executive over the censoring ofgay pride elementsinAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania(2023) to release the film in Kuwait and comply withits restrictive anti-LGBTQ laws.[105][106]A Disney spokesperson reiterated the notion that she was fired due to "an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy" among other "key factors".[104]Disney and Alonso reached a multimillion-dollar compensation settlement in April.[107]
Also at the time of Alonso's firing, criticism from VFX workers was noted,[103]who had raised complaints of Marvel's "demanding post-production schedules". Alonso was described by some as a "kingmaker",[103][7]and "challenging to work with",[105]with Chris Lee atVulturereporting that Alonso was "singularly responsible for Marvel's toxic work environment" with VFX workers.[108][7]Alonso reportedly took days off to produceArgentina, 1985instead of her post-production commitments for the various MCU projects, which in turn resulted in the need to delay several projects in 2022 and 2023.[105]However, Alonso was also described as the "epitome of professional" and supportive on set, with Joanna Robinson ofThe Ringerdescribing the reports as a "gross mischaracterization" and the opposite of Alonso's work.[103][109]Following Alonso's firing, visual effects vendors for the various MCU projects were working with producer Jen Underdahl, the vice president of visual effects and stereo.[102][110]
In August 2023, a group of 52 on-set VFX workers at Marvel Studios filed a petition with theNational Labor Relations Boardfor an election to join theInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees(IATSE) labor union theVFX Union. This was the first time any workers in the visual effects industry had petitioned for union recognition. Lee believed if this group of workers were able to secure union recognition, it "would stand as proof of concept for the overall viability of an industry-wide unionization push", particularly at the post-production effect houses.[111]All of the workers who participated in the election vote that concluded in early September voted unanimously to form a union with IATSE, with the union then set to enter into collective bargaining negotiations with Marvel, beginning at an unspecified date.[112]
Marvel had licensed out the film rights to many of its characters to other studios in the 1990s, starting with theX-Men,[24]theFantastic Four,Spider-Man, andDaredevil, which were followed byCaptain America,Iron Man,Thor, theHulk,Ant-Manand theWasp,Black Widow,Luke Cage, thePunisher,Blade,Ghost Rider,Man-Thing,Black Panther,Deadpool, andPrime, among others.[45][113]
In February 2015, Marvel Studios andSony Pictures Entertainmentannounced that Spider-Man would appear in the MCU, with the character appearing inCaptain America: Civil War(2016) and Sony releasingSpider-Man: Homecoming, produced by Feige andAmy Pascal, in July 2017. As part of the deal, Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films.[114]In June 2015, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal did not allow Spider-Man to appear in any of theMCU television series, as it was "very specific... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed."[115]In September 2019, it was announced that Disney and Sony had reached a new agreement allowing for Spider-Man to appear in athird standalone film(produced by Marvel Studios and Feige) and a future Marvel Studios film.[116]Disney was reported to be co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of the film's profits in the new agreement, while retaining the merchandising rights to the character.[116][117]In November 2021, Pascal announced plans for a fourthSpider-Manfilm set in the MCU, in addition to long-term plans for a new trilogy of films with Marvel Studios, with said film entering active development the following month.[118][119]Sony's agreement specifies that production has to start on a film within three years and nine months of the previous one, and release within five years and nine months, otherwise the rights revert to Marvel.[48]: 295Sony has access to 856 characters within its agreement,[48]: 297includingKingpin, who is able to be used by both Sony and Marvel Studios.[120]
In March 2023,Citigroupfinancial analystJason Bazinet felt Disney may try to include the distribution rights to the Hulk and Namor in any potential sale of the streaming serviceHulutoComcast, the owner ofUniversal PicturesthroughNBCUniversal.[121]In June 2023, the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulkreverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.[93]

The "Marvel Studios Parliament", otherwise known as "The Parliament", is the creative decision-making committee at Marvel Studios and a "brain trust" of long-time executives who help to elevate each other's projects where possible.[150][151][152][94]The following executives are members of the Parliament:[153]
A number of other executives serve as lead producers on films and television series, working on each project from their inception through their release as managers alongside other executives,[152][162]as part of the Production and Development group. Some of these executives include:[153]
The Visual Development group is an in-house group of artists who work on a film from its start to provide a consistent look for the studio.[157][additional citation(s) needed]
In addition to Meinerding, the group includesAndy Park, Director of Visual Development and Production Illustrator[172][173]
Additionally,Sarah Halley Finnhas served as a frequent casting director for several MCU films and television series.[179]
Starting with the release ofSpider-Manin 2002, Marvel Studios introduced its "flipbook"production logo, created by Imaginary Forces.[191]This logo was accompanied by music from the film's score, sound effects or a song, to lead into the beginning of the film. This was the logo seen in front of all of the studio's films until 2013, when the logo was updated with the release ofThor: The Dark World, again created by Imaginary Forces. Feige stated that since Marvel was now its own entity within the Walt Disney Company, it "felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features" instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel's studio or distribution partners' logos. Feige added that they "didn't want to re-invent the wheel [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel."[192]Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002. They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, and ultimately chose 120 that were "universal and not specific to one character" and created a narrative "where each image spoke to the one before it and after."[191]The new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within theMarvel Cinematic UniversethroughCaptain America: Civil War. With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed byBrian Tyler, who wrote the scores toIron Man 3,Thor: The Dark World, andAvengers: Age of Ultron.[192]It was featured on the filmsThor: The Dark World,Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014), andGuardians of the Galaxy(2014).
In July 2016, another new logo and opening were introduced, featuring an updated fanfare, composed this time byMichael Giacchino, who first worked with Marvel Studios on the score toDoctor Strange(2016). The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.[193]It was first seen in front ofDoctor Strange.[194]The updated logo was created byPerception, which was first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update its logo. Feige specifically requested Perception "to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image, showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo." The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed "How to Build a Universe", which "was designed to pay tribute to [the filmmaking] process by touching on" how a film's origins are inspired by the comics, which then results in a script, followed by concept art, resulting in the final film. Perception looked to the initial "flipbook" logo for inspiration, and paid tribute to it in the new opening, as it opens identically to the flipbook logo. Next, the opening includes "various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays", with Perception picking "both iconic fan-favorites, as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe." To add in the concept art images, Perception looked "through a massive archive of concept art and "The Art Of..." books, to select the most iconic images for each beloved character. Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves, the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch. The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them." Finally, over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had been released at that time were included, with Perception arranging them in a way they called the "vault" "where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the "Marvel" logotype."[195]
A modified version of Perception's logo was introduced at the 2017D23Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU.[196]The logo debuted withAvengers: Infinity Waron April 26, 2018, and was used again inAnt-Man and the Wasp(2018). With the release ofCaptain Marvel, the current Perception logo was altered at Marvel Studios' behest in honor ofStan Lee; Lee died on November 12, 2018, just a few months before the release of the film.[197]The logo was altered, replacing the characters with Stan Lee's MCU cameos and other public appearances related to the MCU, accompanied by a black screen reading "Thank You Stan".[198]Similarly, the logo was retroactively modified for theDisney+version ofBlack Panther(2018) in honor ofChadwick Boseman, who died on August 28, 2020. The logo was altered, replacing the characters with images and footage ofT'Challaand Boseman. The logo premiered on November 29, 2020, which would have been Boseman's 44th birthday.[199][200]Additional modifications include having the characters who disappeared in the Blip removed forAvengers: Endgame; an additional Boseman tribute one forBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever(2022); and an all-Guardians of the Galaxy opening forGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3(2023). A shortened sequence opening was used for the Disney+ seriesSecret Invasion(2023).[201]"What If... Strange Supreme Intervened?" (2023), theWhat If...?season twofinale, replaced the live-action footage of the logo with animated images fromWhat If...?.[202]Captain America: Brave New World(2025) was the first Marvel Studios film to not feature the studio's logo animation sequence.[203]
Television specialsfrom Marvel Studios, which are marketed as "Marvel Studios Special Presentation", feature a special multicolored intro with bongo drum music, reminiscent of theCBS Special Presentationtheme featured before animated holiday specials of the 1980s and 1990s.[204][205]The intro was also designed by Perception,[206]with Giacchino (who directed and composed for the specialWerewolf by Night) once again creating the music.[205]Jamie Lovett atComicBook.comcalled the Marvel Studios Special Presentation intro "more colorful" and its fanfare "more playful" than the normal Marvel Studios intro.[207]
Marvel Knights was a production arm of Marvel Studios intended to produce some of Marvel's darker and lesser-known titles. The name originated from the "Marvel Knights" imprint ofMarvel Comics. The first film produced under the Marvel Knights banner wasPunisher: War Zone(2008), which served as arebootof thePunisherfranchise. This was followed byGhost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance(2011), which was the second and final title to be released under the Marvel Knights banner.[210]

The telephone incident had a generally negative impact on Crowe's public image, an example of negative public relations in the mass media, although Crowe had made a point of befriending Australian journalists in an effort to influence his image.[131]TheSouth Parkepisode "The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer" revolves around a lampooning of his aggressive tendencies. Crowe commented on the ongoing media coverage in November 2010, during an interview with American television talk show host and journalistCharlie Rose: "I think it indelibly changed me. It was a very, very minor situation that was made into something outrageous. More violence perpetuated me walking between the car to the courtroom with the waiting media than anything I'd done ... it very definitely affected me ... psychologically."[132]
In October 2016,Azealia Banksfiled a police report against Crowe, claiming that he choked and spat at her before proceeding to call her the 'n-word' during a party in his hotel suite. However, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office dropped the case in December. The following year during an interview withThe Breakfast Club,RZAacknowledged only Banks’ claim that Crowe had spat, though "on the floor" rather than at her directly, going on to condemn her alleged "obnoxious and erratic" behaviour.[133][134]Crowe asserted that he removed Banks from the premises because she had threatened to physically assault other attendees.[135]RZA denied hearing Crowe use the 'n-word' and confirmed Crowe's account of threats of violence by Banks, saying "(Banks) threatened to cut a girl in the face with a glass, then actually (grabbed) a glass and physically (attacked) for no logical reason. Russell blocked the attack and removed her from the suite."[136]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
