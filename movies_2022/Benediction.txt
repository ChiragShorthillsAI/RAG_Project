Terence Davies(10 November 1945 – 7 October 2023) was a British screenwriter, film director, and novelist. He is best known as the writer and director of autobiographical films, includingDistant Voices, Still Lives(1988),The Long Day Closes(1992) and thecollage filmOf Time and the City(2008), as well as the literary adaptationsThe Neon Bible(1995),The House of Mirth(2000),The Deep Blue Sea(2011) andSunset Song(2015). His final two feature films were centered around the lives of influential literary figures,Emily DickinsoninA Quiet Passion(2016) andSiegfried SassooninBenediction(2021). Davies was considered by some critics as one of the great British directors of his period.[1]
Terence Davies was born inKensington, Liverpool, on 10 November 1945,[2]as the youngest of ten children of working-class Catholic parents.[3]Though he was raised Catholic by his deeply religious mother, at the age of 22 he rejected religion and considered himself an atheist.[4][5]Davies's father, whom Davies remembered as "psychotic", died of cancer when Davies was seven years old. He recalled the period from then until he entered secondary school, at the age of 11, as the four happiest years of his life.[4]
After leaving school at 16, Davies worked for ten years as a shipping office clerk and as an unqualified accountant, before leaving Liverpool in 1971 to attendCoventryDrama School.[6]
While at Coventry, Davies wrote the screenplay for what became his first autobiographical short,Children(1976), filmed under the auspices of theBFI Production Board.[6]After that introduction to filmmaking, Davies attended theNational Film School, completingMadonna and Child(1980), a continuation of the story of his alter ego, Robert Tucker, covering his years as a clerk in Liverpool. He completed the trilogy withDeath and Transfiguration(1983), in which he speculates about the circumstances of his death. Those works went on to be screened together at film festivals throughout Europe and North America asThe Terence Davies Trilogy, winning numerous awards. Davies, who was gay, frequently explored gay themes in his films.[7][3]
Davies's first two features,Distant Voices, Still LivesandThe Long Day Closes, are autobiographical films set in Liverpool in the 1940s and 1950s. In reviewingDistant Voices, Still Lives, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that "years from now, when practically all the other new movies currently playing are long forgotten, it will be remembered and treasured as one of the greatest of all English films".[8]In 2002, critics polled forSight & SoundrankedDistant Voices, Still Livesas the ninth-best film of the previous 25 years.[9]Jean-Luc Godard, often dismissive of British cinema in general, singled outDistant Voices, Still Livesas an exception, calling it "magnificent".The Long Day Closeswas also praised by J. Hoberman as "Davies'[s] most autobiographical and fully achieved work".[10]
Davies's next two features,The Neon BibleandThe House of Mirth, were adaptations of novels byJohn Kennedy TooleandEdith Whartonrespectively.The House of Mirthreceived favourable reviews, withFilm Commentnaming it one of the ten best films of 2000.Gillian Andersonwon Best Performance in the Second AnnualVillage VoiceFilm Critics' Poll and the film was named the third best film of 2000 in the same poll.[11]
After completingThe House of Mirth, Davies intended to make an adaptation ofSunset Song, a novel byLewis Grassic Gibbonpublished in 1932, as his fifth feature, but financing proved difficult. Scottish and international backers left the project after the BBC, Channel 4 and the UK Film Council each rejected proposals for final funds. Davies apparently consideredKirsten Dunstfor the lead role before the project was postponed.[12]Afterwards, he wrote an original romantic comedy screenplay and an adaptation ofEd McBain's novelcrime novelHe Who Hesitates, neither of which were produced.[13]
In the interim, Davies produced two works for radio,A Walk to the Paradise Garden, an originalradio playbroadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 2001, and a two-part adaptation ofVirginia Woolf's novelThe Waves, broadcast onBBC Radio 4in 2007.[6]
The long interval between films ended with his only documentary,Of Time and the City, which was premiered out of competition at the2008 Cannes Film Festival. The work uses vintage newsreel footage, contemporary popular music and Davies's narration in a paean to Liverpool. It received positive reviews on its premiere.[14]
In 2010, after completingOf Time and the City, Davies produced a third radio project,Intensive Care, a personal recollection of his youth and his relationship with his mother.[15]
Davies'sThe Deep Blue Sea, based on the play byTerence Rattigan, was commissioned by the Rattigan Trust. The film was met with widespread acclaim, andRachel Weiszwon the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and topped the Village Voice Film Critics' Poll for best lead female performance.[16]
Davies finally found financing forSunset Songin 2012, and it went into production in 2014.[17][18]In October 2014 the film went into post-production.[19]It was released in 2015.[18]During this time, an attempted adaptation ofRichard McCann'sMother of Sorrowsdid not come to fruition.[20]
Davies's next film wasA Quiet Passion, based on the life of the American poetEmily Dickinson.[21]
His last film,Benediction(2021), tells the story of the British war poet and memoiristSiegfried Sassoon.[4]
In February 2023, it was announced that Davies was working on a film adaptation ofStefan Zweig's novelThe Post Office Girl, though the project was subsequently abandoned due to a lack of funding. Davies said he was working on another script in September 2023, the month before he died.[22]After his death, the script was revealed to be based on Janette Jenkins's novelFirefly, which focuses on the last five days in the life of playwright and composerNoël Coward.[23]
Davies lived in an 18th-century cottage inMistleyfrom the early 1990s until his death in 2023.[4][24][25]Davies was openly gay and often explored gay themes in his work, though he said his most serious relationship was with a woman in the late 1970s, and that he later went "on to the gay scene for a couple of months" before deciding he was also uninterested in relationships with men.[4][26]In 2015, he toldThe Guardianthat he had been celibate for most of his life, adding in another interview with the newspaper in 2022 that he would "prefer to be lonely and on [his] own" than to live a life he "couldn't justify" to himself.[4][26]
Discussing the impact his childhood had on him, Davies described his father as a "psychotic" man who made him feel "terrified all the time", and that the years following his father's death were the happiest of his childhood.[4]He explained, "The one thing I can't bear now is atmospheres. I can come into a room full of people and I can tell you who's had [an argument]. I always say: if I've upset you, just come out with it. If you cold-shoulder me, I instantly see [my father] sitting in the corner of the parlour and I'm a seven-year-old again."[4]
On 7 October 2023, at the age of 77, Davies died of cancer at his home in Mistley.[1][21]
