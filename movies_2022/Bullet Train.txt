Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.,doing business asColumbia Pictures, is an Americanfilmproductionanddistributioncompany that is the flagship unit of theSony Pictures Motion Picture Group,[2]a division ofSony Entertainment'sSony Pictures, which is one of the"Big Five" film studiosand a subsidiary of the multinational conglomerateSony Group Corporation.[3]
On June 19, 1918, brothersJackandHarry Cohnand their business partnerJoe Brandtfounded the studio asCohn-Brandt-Cohn (CBC) Film Sales Corporation.[4]It adopted the Columbia Pictures name on January 10, 1924 (operating as Columbia Pictures Corporation until December 23, 1968), went public two years later, and eventually began to use the image ofColumbia, the female personification of the United States, as its logo.
In its early years, Columbia was a minor player in Hollywood, but began to grow in the late 1920s, spurred by a successful association with directorFrank Capra. With Capra and others such as the most successful two reel comedy series,The Three Stooges, Columbia became one of the primary homes of thescrewball comedy. In the 1930s, Columbia's major contract stars wereJean ArthurandCary Grant. In the 1940s,Rita Hayworthbecame the studio's premier star and propelled their fortunes into the late 1950s.Rosalind Russell,Glenn FordandWilliam Holdenalso became major stars at the studio.
It is one of the leading film studios in the world, and was one of the so-called "Little Three" among the eight major film studios ofHollywood'sGolden Age.[5]Today, it has become the world's third largest major film studio.
The company was also primarily responsible for distributingDisney'sSilly Symphonyfilm series as well as theMickey Mousecartoon series from 1929 to 1932. The studio is presently headquartered at theIrving ThalbergBuilding on the formerMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(currently known as theSony Pictures Studios) lot inCulver City, California, since 1990.
Columbia Pictures is a member of theMotion Picture Association(MPA), under Sony Pictures Entertainment,[6]and is currently one of the five live-action labels of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, alongsideTriStar Pictures,Screen Gems,Sony Pictures Classics, and3000 Pictures. Columbia's most commercially successful franchises includeSpider-Man,Jumanji,Bad Boys,Men in Black,The Karate Kid,Robert Langdon, andGhostbusters, and the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwideisSpider-Man: No Way Home, which grossed $1.92 billion worldwide.
The studio was founded on June 19, 1918, as Cohn-Brandt-Cohn (CBC) Film Sales by brothersJackandHarry Cohnand Jack's best friendJoe Brandt, and released its first feature filmMore to Be Pitied Than Scornedon August 20, 1922. The film, with a budget of $20,000, was a success, bringing in $130,000 in revenue for the company.[7]Brandt was president of CBC Film Sales, handling sales, marketing and distribution from New York along with Jack Cohn, while Harry Cohn ran production in Hollywood. The studio's early productions were low-budget short subjects:Screen Snapshots, theHallroom Boys(the vaudeville duo ofEdward FlanaganandNeely Edwards), and theCharlie Chaplin-imitatorBilly West.[8]The start-up CBC leased space in aPoverty Rowstudio on Hollywood's famously low-rentGower Street. Among Hollywood's elite, the studio's small-time reputation led some to joke that "CBC" stood for "Corned Beef and Cabbage".[4]
CBC was reorganized asColumbia Pictures Corporationby brothersHarryandJack Cohnand best friendJoe Brandton January 10, 1924.[9]Harry Cohn became president in 1932 and remained head of production as well, thus concentrating enormous power in his hands. He would run Columbia for a total of 34 years, one of the longest tenures of any studio chief (Warner Bros.'Jack L. Warnerwas head of productionorCEO longer but did not become CEO until 1956). Even in an industry rife with nepotism, Columbia was particularly notorious for having a number of Harry and Jack's relatives in high positions. HumoristRobert Benchleycalled it the Pine Tree Studio, "because it has so many Cohns".[10]
Brandt eventually tired of dealing with the Cohn brothers, and in 1932 sold his one-third stake to Jack and Harry Cohn, who took over from him as president.
Columbia's product line consisted mostly of moderately budgeted features and short subjects including comedies, sports films, various serials, and cartoons. Columbia gradually moved into the production of higher-budget fare, eventually joining the second tier of Hollywood studios along withUnited ArtistsandUniversal. Like United Artists and Universal, Columbia was a horizontally integrated company. It controlled production and distribution; it did not own any theaters.
Helping Columbia's climb was the arrival of an ambitious director,Frank Capra. Between 1927 and 1939, Capra constantly pushed Cohn for better material and bigger budgets. A string of hits he directed in the early and mid 1930s solidified Columbia's status as a major studio. In particular,It Happened One Night, which nearly swept the 1934 Oscars, put Columbia on the map. Until then, Columbia's business had depended on theater owners willing to take its films, since it did not have a theater network of its own. Other Capra-directed hits followed, including the original version ofLost Horizon(1937), withRonald Colman, andMr. Smith Goes to Washington(1939), which madeJames Stewarta major star.[citation needed]
In 1933, Columbia hiredRobert Kallochto be its chief fashion and women's costume designer. He was the first contract costume designer hired by the studio,[11]and he established the studio's wardrobe department.[12]Kalloch's employment, in turn, convinced leading actresses that Columbia Pictures intended to invest in their careers.[13]
In 1938, the addition ofB. B. Kahaneas vice president would produceCharles Vidor'sThose High Grey Walls(1939), andThe Lady in Question(1940), the first joint film ofRita HayworthandGlenn Ford. Kahane would later become the President ofAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciencesin 1959, until his death a year later.
Columbia could not afford to keep a huge roster of contract stars, so Jack Cohn usually borrowed them from other studios. AtMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the industry's most prestigious studio, Columbia was nicknamed "Siberia", asLouis B. Mayerwould use the loan-out to Columbia as a way to punish his less-obedient signings. In the 1930s, Columbia signedJean Arthurto a long-term contract, and afterThe Whole Town's Talking(1935), Arthur became a major comedy star.Ann Sothern's career was launched when Columbia signed her to a contract in 1936.Cary Grantsigned a contract in 1937 and soon after it was altered to a non-exclusive contract shared withRKO.
Many theaters relied onwesternsto attract big weekend audiences, and Columbia always recognized this market. Its first cowboy star wasBuck Jones, who signed with Columbia in 1930 for a fraction of his former big-studio salary. Over the next two decades Columbia released scores of outdoor adventures with Jones,Tim McCoy,Ken Maynard,Jack Luden, Bob Allen (Robert (Tex) Allen),Russell Hayden,Tex Ritter,Ken Curtis, andGene Autry. Columbia's most popular cowboy wasCharles Starrett, who signed with Columbia in 1935 and starred in 131 western features over 17 years.[citation needed]
At Harry Cohn's insistence, the studio signedthe Three Stoogesin 1934. Rejected byMGM(which kept straight-manTed Healybut let the Stooges go),[14]the Stooges made 190 shorts for Columbia between 1934 and 1957. Columbia's short-subject department employed many famous comedians, includingBuster Keaton,Charley Chase,Harry Langdon,Andy Clyde, andHugh Herbert. Almost 400 of Columbia's 529 two-reel comedies were released to television between 1958 and 1961; to date, all of the Stooges, Keaton,Charley Chase,Shemp Howard,Joe Besser, andJoe DeRitasubjects have been released to home video.[15]
Columbia incorporated animation into its studio in 1929, distributingKrazy Katcartoons, taking over fromParamount. The following year, Columbia took over distribution of theMickey Mouseseries from Celebrity Productions until 1932. In 1933, The Mintz studio was re-established under theScreen Gemsbrand; Columbia's leading cartoon series wereKrazy Kat,Scrappy,The Fox and the Crow, and (very briefly)Li'l Abner.[16]Screen Gems was the last major cartoon studio to produce black-and-white cartoons, producing them until 1946. That same year, Screen Gems shut down but had completed enough cartoons for the studio to release until 1949. In 1948, Columbia agreed to release animated shorts fromUnited Productions of America; these new shorts were more sophisticated than Columbia's older cartoons, and many won critical praise and industry awards. In 1957, two years before the UPA deal was terminated, Columbia distributed theHanna-Barberacartoons, includingLoopy De Loopfrom 1959 to 1965, which was Columbia's final theatrical cartoon series. In 1967, the Hanna-Barbera deal expired and was not renewed.
According to Bob Thomas' bookKing Cohn, studio chief Harry Cohn always placed a high priority on serials. Beginning in 1937, Columbia entered the lucrative serial market and kept making these weekly episodic adventures until 1956, after other studios had discontinued them. The most famous Columbia serials are based on comic-strip or radio characters:Mandrake the Magician(1939),The Shadow(1940),Terry and the Pirates(1940),Captain Midnight(1942),The Phantom(1943),Batman(1943), and the especially successfulSuperman(1948), among many others.
Columbia also produced musical shorts, sports reels (usually narrated by sportscasterBill Stern), and travelogues. Its "Screen Snapshots" series, showing behind-the-scenes footage of Hollywood stars, was a Columbia perennial that the studio had been releasing since the silent-movie days; producer-directorRalph Staubkept this series going through 1958.
In the 1940s, propelled in part by the surge in audiences for their films duringWorld War II, the studio also benefited from the popularity of its biggest star,Rita Hayworth. Columbia maintained a long list of contractees well into the 1950s;Glenn Ford,Penny Singleton,William Holden,Judy Holliday,The Three Stooges,Ann Miller,Evelyn Keyes,Ann Doran,Jack Lemmon,Cleo Moore,Barbara Hale,Adele Jergens,Larry Parks,Arthur Lake,Lucille Ball,Kerwin MathewsandKim Novak.
Harry Cohn monitored the budgets of his films, and the studio got the maximum use out of costly sets, costumes, and props by reusing them in other films. Many of Columbia's low-budget"B" picturesand short subjects have an expensive look, thanks to Columbia's efficient recycling policy. Cohn was reluctant to spend lavish sums on even his most important pictures, and it was not until 1943 that he agreed to use three-stripTechnicolorin a live-action feature. Columbia was the last major studio to employ the expensive color process. Columbia's first Technicolor feature was the westernThe Desperadoes, starringRandolph ScottandGlenn Ford. Cohn quickly used Technicolor again forCover Girl, a Hayworth vehicle that instantly was a smash hit, released in 1944, and for the fanciful biography ofFrédéric Chopin,A Song to Remember, withCornel Wilde, released in 1945. Another biopic, 1946'sThe Jolson StorywithLarry ParksandEvelyn Keyes, was started in black-and-white, but when Cohn saw how well the project was proceeding, he scrapped the footage and insisted on filming in Technicolor.
In 1948, theUnited States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.anti-trustdecision forced Hollywood motion picture companies to divest themselves of the theater chains that they owned. Since Columbia did not own any theaters, it was now on equal terms with the largest studios. The studio soon replacedRKOon the list of the "Big Five" studios.
In 1946, Columbia dropped theScreen Gemsbrand from its cartoon line, but retained the Screen Gems name for various ancillary activities, including a 16 mm film-rental agency and a TV-commercial production company. On November 8, 1948, Columbia adopted theScreen Gems name for its television production subsidiarywhen the studio acquired Pioneer Telefilms, a television commercial company founded by Jack Cohn's son, Ralph.[17]Pioneer had been founded in 1947, and was later reorganized as Screen Gems.[17]The studio opened its doors for business in New York on April 15, 1949.[17]By 1951, Screen Gems became a full-fledged television studio and became a major producer ofsitcomsfor TV, beginning withFather Knows Bestand followed byThe Donna Reed Show,The Partridge Family,Bewitched,I Dream of Jeannie, andThe Monkees.
On July 1, 1956, studio veteran Irving Briskin stepped down as manager of Columbia Pictures and formed his own production company Briskin Productions, Inc. to release series through Screen Gems and supervise all of its productions.[18]On December 10, Screen Gems expanded intotelevision syndicationby acquiring Hygo Television Films (a.k.a. "Serials Inc.") and its affiliated company United Television Films, Inc. Hygo Television Films was founded in 1951 by Jerome Hyams, who also acquired United Television Films in 1955 that was founded by Archie Mayers.[19]
In 1957, two years before its parent company Columbia dropped UPA, Screen Gems entered a distribution deal withHanna-Barbera Productions, which produced classic animated series such asThe Flintstones,The Quick Draw McGraw Show,The Huckleberry Hound Show,The Yogi Bear Show,Jonny Quest,The JetsonsandTop Catamong others. Screen Gems distributed the company's shows until 1967, when Hanna-Barbera was sold toTaft Broadcasting. In 1960, the animation studio became a publicly traded company under the name Screen Gems, Inc., when Columbia spun off an 18% stake.
By 1950, Columbia had discontinued most of its popularseries films(Boston Blackie,Blondie,The Lone Wolf,The Crime Doctor,Rusty, etc.) OnlyJungle Jim, launched by producerSam Katzmanin 1949, kept going through 1955. Katzman contributed greatly to Columbia's success by producing dozens of topical feature films, includingcrime dramas,science-fictionstories, androck'n'rollmusicals. Columbia kept making serials until 1956 and two-reel comedies until 1957, after other studios had abandoned these mediums.
As the larger studios declined in the 1950s, Columbia's position improved. This was largely because it did not suffer from the massive loss of income that the other major studios suffered from the loss of their theaters (well over 90 percent, in some cases). Columbia continued to produce 40-plus pictures a year, offering productions that often broke ground and kept audiences coming to theaters. Some of its significant films from this era include the studio's adaptation of the controversialJames JonesnovelFrom Here to Eternity(1953),On the Waterfront(1954), andThe Bridge on the River Kwai(1957) withWilliam HoldenandAlec Guinness, all of which won theBest Picture Oscar. Another significant film of the studio was the free adaptation ofGeorge Orwell'sdystopian novelNineteen Eighty-Four(1956).
Columbia also released the productions of the English studioWarwick Films(by producersIrving AllenandAlbert R. Broccoli), as well as many films by producerCarl Foreman, who resided in England. Columbia distributed some films made byHammer, which was also based in England.
In December 1956, Jack Cohn, co-founder and executive vice-president, died.[20]In 1958, Columbia established its own record label,Colpix Records, initially run by Jonie Taps, who headed Columbia's music department, and laterPaul WexlerandLester Sill. Colpix was active until 1966 when Columbia entered into a joint agreement withRCA Victorand discontinued Colpix in favor of its new label,Colgems Records.
Shortly after closing their short subjects department, Columbia presidentHarry Cohndied of a heart attack in February 1958. His nephew Ralph Cohn died in 1959, ending almost four decades of family management.[21]
The new management was headed by Abe Schneider, who had joined the company as an office boy out of high school and become a director in 1929, rising through the financial side of the business.[22]In 1963, Columbia acquired music publisherAldon Music.[23]
By the late 1960s, Columbia had an ambiguous identity, offering old-fashioned fare such asA Man for All SeasonsandOliver!along with the more contemporaryEasy RiderandThe Monkees. After turning down releasingAlbert R. Broccoli'sEon ProductionsJames Bondfilms, Columbia hired Broccoli's former partnerIrving Allento produce theMatt Helmseries withDean Martin. Columbia also produced aJames Bondspoof,Casino Royale(1967), in conjunction withCharles K. Feldman, which held the adaptation rights forthat novel.
By 1966, the studio was suffering from box-office failures, and takeover rumors began surfacing. Columbia was surviving solely on the profits made from Screen Gems, whose holdings also included radio and television stations.[24]On December 23, 1968, Screen Gems merged with Columbia Pictures Corporation and became part of the newly formed Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. for $24.5 million.[25]Schneider was chairman of the holding company andLeo Jaffepresident.
Following the merger, in March 1969, CPI purchasedBell Recordsfor $3.5 million (mainly in CPI stock), retainingLarry Uttalas label president.
Nearly bankrupt by the early 1970s, the studio was saved via a radical overhaul: the Gower Street Studios (now called "Sunset Gower Studios") were sold and a new management team was brought in. In 1972, Columbia and Warner Bros. formed a partnership called The Burbank Studios, in which both companies shared theWarner studio lotinBurbank.
In 1971, Columbia Pictures established sheet music publisher Columbia Pictures Publications, with vice president and general managerFrank J. Hackinson, who later became the president.[26]
In 1973,Allen & Cotook a financial stake in Columbia Pictures Industries andAlan Hirschfieldwas appointed CEO,[27]succeedingLeo Jaffewho became chairman. Stanley Schneider, son of Abe Schneider (who became honorary chairman before leaving the board in 1975) was replaced as head of the Columbia Pictures studio byDavid Begelman, who reported to Hirschfield. Some years later Begelman was involved in a check-forging scandal that badly hurt the studio's image.
On May 6, 1974, Columbia retired theScreen Gemsname from television, renaming its television division to the name ofColumbia Pictures Television. The name was suggested byDavid Gerber, who was then president of Columbia's television division.[28]The same year, Columbia Pictures acquired Rastar Pictures, which included Rastar Productions, Rastar Features, and Rastar Television. Ray Stark then founded Rastar Films, the reincarnation of Rastar Pictures, which was acquired by Columbia Pictures in February 1980.[29]
Columbia Pictures also reorganized its music and record divisions.Clive Daviswas hired as a record and music consultant by Columbia Pictures in 1974 and later became temporary president ofBell Records. Davis's real goal was to revitalize Columbia Pictures' music division. With a $10 million investment by CPI, and a reorganization of the various Columbia Pictures legacy labels (Colpix,Colgems, and Bell), Davis introduced Columbia Pictures' new record division,Arista Records, in November 1974, with Davis himself owning 20% of the new venture. Columbia maintained control of the label until 1979, when it was sold toAriola Records. In addition, Columbia sold its music publishing business (Columbia-Screen Gems) toEMIin August 1976 for $15 million.[30]Both would later be reunited with Columbia Pictures under Sony ownership.
In December 1976, Columbia Pictures acquired the arcade game companyD. Gottlieb & Co.for $50 million.[31]
In 1978, Begelman was suspended for havingembezzledmoney from Columbia. Hirschfield was forced out for his refusal to reinstate him.[32][33]Begelman later resigned and was replaced byDaniel Melnickin June 1978.[34]Fay Vincentwas hired to replace Hirschfield.
Frank Pricebecame president of production in 1978. In March 1979, he would become president of Columbia Pictures, succeeding Melnick.[34]During Price's tenure he was responsible for turning out 9 of the top 10 grossing films in Columbia's history.[35]
In the fall of 1978,Kirk Kerkorian, a Vegas casino mogul who also controlledMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, acquired a 5.5% stake in Columbia Pictures.[36]He then announced on November 20, that he intended to launch a tender offer to acquire another 20% for the studio.[36]On December 14, a standstill agreement was reached with Columbia by promising not to go beyond 25% or seeking control for at least three years.[36]
On January 15, 1979, theUnited States Department of Justicefiled anantitrustsuit against Kerkorian to block him from holding a stake in Columbia while controlling MGM.[36]On February 19, 1979, Columbia Pictures Television acquired TOY Productions; the production company founded byBud Yorkinand writersSaul TurteltaubandBernie Orensteinin 1976.[37]In May, Kerkorian acquired an additional 214,000 shares in Columbia, raising his stake to 25%.[36]On August 2, the trial began; on August 14, the court ruled in favor for Kerkorian.[36]In 1979, Columbia agreed with Time-Life Video to release 20 titles onvideocassette.[38]
On September 30, 1980, Kerkorian sued Columbia for ignoring shareholders' interest and violating an agreement with him.[36]Columbia later accused him on October 2, of scheming withNelson Bunker Huntto gain control of Columbia.
In 1981, Kerkorian sold his 25% stake in Columbia back to CPI.[36]Columbia Pictures later acquired 81% ofThe Walter Reade Organization, which owned 11 theaters; it purchased the remaining 19% in 1985.
Around this time, Columbia putSteven Spielberg's proposed follow-up toClose Encounters of the Third Kind,Night Skies, intoturnaround. The project eventually became the highest-grossing film of the time,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Columbia received a share of the profits for its involvement in the development.[39]
On May 17, 1982, Columbia Pictures acquiredSpelling-Goldberg Productionsfor over $40 million.[40][41]With a healthier balance-sheet (due in large part to box office hits likeKramer vs. Kramer,Stir Crazy,The Blue Lagoon, andStripes) Columbia was bought by beverage companyThe Coca-Cola Companyon June 22, 1982, for $750 million.[42]Studio head Frank Price mixed big hits likeTootsie,Gandhi,The Karate Kid,The Big Chill, andGhostbusterswith many costly flops. To share the increasing cost of film production, Coke brought in two outside investors whose earlier efforts in Hollywood had come to nothing. In 1982, Columbia,Time Inc.'sHBOandCBSannounced, as a joint venture, "Nova Pictures"; this enterprise was to be renamedTri-Star Pictures.[43]In 1983, Price left Columbia Pictures after a dispute with Coca-Cola and went back to Universal.[44]He was replaced byGuy McElwaine.[45]
In the early 1980s, Columbia and Tri-Star Pictures set up a film partnership with Delphi Film Associates and acquired an interest in various film releases. In 1984, Delphi Film Associates III acquired an interest in the Tri-Star and Columbia film slate of 1984, which would make a $60 million offering in the financing of film production.[46]Also that year, Columbia Pictures had bought out the rights toHardbodies, which was once premiered onThe Playboy Channel.[47]
Columbia Pictures expanded its music publishing operations in the 1980s, acquiring Big 3 Publishing (the former sheet music operations of Robbins,Feist, andMiller) fromMGM/UA Communications Co.in 1983, Belwin-Mills Publishing fromSimon & Schusterin 1985, and Al Gallico Music in 1987.[48][49][50]
On June 18, 1985, Columbia's parent acquiredNorman LearandJerry Perenchio's Embassy Communications, Inc. (includingEmbassy Pictures, Embassy Television,Tandem Productions, and Embassy Home Entertainment), mostly for its library of television series such asAll in the FamilyandThe Jeffersons, for $485 million.[51]On November 16, 1985, CBS dropped out of the Tri-Star venture.[52]
Many changes occurred in 1986. Expanding its television franchise, on May 5, Columbia's parent also boughtMerv Griffin Enterprisesfor $250 million. The company was notable for:Wheel of Fortune,Jeopardy!,Dance Fever, andThe Merv Griffin Show.[53][54]Months later on August 28, the Columbia Pictures Television Group acquiredDanny Arnold's Danny Arnold Productions, Inc.. The deal included Arnold's rights to the sitcomBarney Miller(Four D Productions) among other produced series such asFish(The Mimus Corporation),A.E.S. Hudson Street(Triseme Corporation), andJoe Bash(Tetagram Ltd.). Arnold had dropped the federal and state lawsuits against the television studio, who was accusing them ofantitrustviolations, fraud, and breach offiduciary duty.[55][56][57]
Coca-Cola sold the Embassy Pictures division toDino de Laurentiis, who later folded Embassy Pictures into Dino de Laurentiis Productions, Inc. The company was renamed asDe Laurentiis Entertainment Group. Coca-Cola also sold Embassy Home Entertainment toNelson Entertainment. Coca-Cola, however, retained the Embassy Pictures name, logo, and trademark. HBO was the last partner to drop out of the Tri-Star venture and sold its shares to Columbia[58]Tri-Star later expanded into the television business with its new Tri-Star Television division.
The same year, Columbia recruited British producerDavid Puttnamto head the studio. Puttnam attempted to defy Hollywood filmmaking by making smaller films instead of big tentpole pictures. His criticism of American film production, in addition to the fact that the films he greenlit were mostly flops, left Coke and Hollywood concerned.[clarification needed]
Puttnam then discontinued multi-picture pacts with various filmmakers, includingNorman Jewison, which was permitted to expire before all of the promised product could be delivered.[59]Under Puttnam's control, he set up a $270 million package of in-house pictures and acquisitions, and the average lineup of 25 features was expected to be $10.78 million, about $4 million less of the cost at Columbia before Puttnam came on board, and a number of low-cost acquisitions such asSpike Lee's $5 million pictureSchool Daze.[60]
On October 22, 1986, Greg Coote was appointed by Columbia Pictures as key executive of the studio, to complement David Puttman's pledge on Columbia Pictures to fix its sights over its international market.[61]On December 17, 1986, the company acquired a 30% share in Roadshow, Coote & Carroll, a company Greg Coote headed, and decided that they would pick up films and miniseries to put an effort to add it up to Columbia's shares, and listed dozens of theatrical and television films and dozens of miniseries throughout the addition of the Columbia slate.[62]
On June 26, 1987, Coca-Cola sold The Walter Reade Organization toCineplex Odeon Corporation.[63]On October 14, 1987, Coca-Cola's entertainment division invested in $30 million inCastle Rock Entertainmentwith five Hollywood executives. Coke's entertainment business division owned 40% in Castle Rock, while the execs owned 60%.[64]
The volatile film business made Coke shareholders nervous, and following the critical and box-office failure ofIshtar, Coke spun off its entertainment holdings on December 21, 1987, and sold it to Tri-Star Pictures for $3.1 billion. Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. (CPE), with Coke owning 80% of the company.[65]Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names.[66]
Puttnam was ousted from the position after only one year.[67]Puttnam was succeeded byDawn Steel. Other small-scale, "boutique" entities were created:Nelson Entertainment, a joint venture with British and Canadian partners,Triumph Films, jointly owned with French studioGaumont, and which is now a low-budget label, andCastle Rock Entertainment.
On January 2, 1988, Columbia/Embassy Television and Tri-Star Television were formed into the new Columbia Pictures Television and Embassy Communications was renamed as ELP Communications to serve as a copyright holder of the Embassy television productions. In early 1988, CPE relaunchedTriumph Filmsas Triumph Releasing Corporation, which handled administrative services related to distribution of Columbia and Tri-Star's films for the North American market, while Triumph was responsible for the sales, marketing and distribution of Columbia andTri-Starfilms under the direction of each individual studio internationally, with Patrick N. Williamson serving as head of Triumph.[68]
On January 16, 1988, CPE's stock fell slightly in the market on its first day trading in theNew York Stock Exchange. Coke spun off 34.1 million of its Columbia shares to its shareholders by reducing its stake in CPE from 80% to 49%.[69]On April 13, 1988, CPE spun off Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. as a reformed company of the Tri-Star studio.[70]In April 1988, CPE sold its music publishing operations to the British company Filmtrax.[71](Filmtrax was acquired byThorn EMIin 1990.)[72]In June 1988, CPE announced the sale of Columbia Pictures Publications (consisting of the print music operations) to the investment firm Boston Ventures and was renamed CPP/Belwin.[73]CPP/Belwin was acquired byWarner Chappell Musicof Warner Bros. in 1994.[74]
On February 2, 1989, Columbia Pictures Television formed a joint-venture with Norman Lear's Act III Communications called Act III Television (now Act III Productions) to produce television series instead of managing.[75][76]
On September 28, 1989, the Columbia Pictures empire was sold to the electronics giantSony, one of severalJapanese firms then buying American properties, for the amount of $3.4 billion.[77]The sale netted Coca-Cola a profit from its investment in the studio.[78][79]Sony then hired two producers,Peter GuberandJon Peters, to serve as coheads of production when Sony also acquired the Guber-Peters Entertainment Company (the former game show production company,Barris Industries) for $200 million on September 29, 1989.[80]Guber and Peters had just signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros. in 1989, having been with the company since 1983. Warner Bros., then a subsidiary ofWarner Communications, sued Sony for $1 billion.[81]Sony completed CPE's acquisition on November 8, and the Guber-Peters acquisition was completed on the following day.
On December 1, 1989, Guber and Peters hired a longtime lawyer of GPEC, Alan J. Levine, to the post of president and COO of Columbia's newly formed company Filmed Entertainment Group (FEG).[82]FEG consisted of Columbia Pictures, Tri-Star Pictures, Triumph Releasing, Columbia Pictures Television, Columbia Pictures Television Distribution, Merv Griffin Enterprises, RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video (internationally known as RCA/Columbia Pictures International Video), Guber-Peters Entertainment Company, and ancillary and distribution companies.
In 1990, Sony ended up paying hundreds of millions of dollars, gave up a half-interest in itsColumbia House Records Clubmail-order business, and bought fromTime Warnerthe formerMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) studio lot in Culver City, which Warner Communications had acquired in its takeover ofLorimar-Telepicturesin 1989, thus ending the Burbank Studios partnership. Initially renamedColumbia Studios, Sony spent $100 million to refurbish the rechristenedSony Pictures Studioslot.
Guber and Peters set out to prove they were worth this fortune, but though there were to be some successes, there were also many costly flops. The same year,Frank Pricewas made the chairman of Columbia Pictures. His company Price Entertainment, Inc., which he founded in 1987, was merged with Columbia in March 1991. Price left Columbia on October 4, 1991, and was replaced by Warner Bros. executiveMark Cantonand reactivated Price Entertainment as Price Entertainment Company with a nonexclusive deal with SPE.[83]Peters was fired by his partner Guber in 1991, but Guber later resigned in 1994 to formMandalay Entertainmentthe following year.[84]The entire operation was reorganized and renamed Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) on August 7, 1991,[85]and at the same time, TriStar (which had officially lost its hyphen) relaunched its television division in October. In December 1991, SPE createdSony Pictures Classicsfor arthouse fare and was headed byMichael Barker,Tom Bernard, and Marcie Bloom,[86]who previously operatedUnited Artists ClassicsandOrion Classics.

Sony traded theCasino Royalerights for $10 million, as well as theSpider-Manfilming rights.[96]The superhero became Columbia's most successfulfranchise:[97]The first moviecame out in 2002, and as of 2021, there have been seven follow-up movies with US grosses in excess of $2.5 billion.[98]Between the releases of the first and second sequels in 2004 and 2007, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, giving it distribution rights to theJames Bondfranchise.

On October 25, 2001, CTT and Columbia TriStar Television Distribution (CTTD) merged to form Columbia TriStar Domestic Television.[101]On September 16, 2002, Columbia TriStar Domestic Television was renamedSony Pictures Television.[102]Also in 2002, Columbia broke the record for biggest domestic theatrical gross, with a tally of $1.575 billion, coincidentally breaking its own record of $1.256 billion, set in 1997. The 2002 gross was primarily raised by such blockbusters asSpider-Man,Men in Black II, andXXX.[103]
The studio was also the most lucrative of 2004,[103]with over $1.338 billion in the domestic box office with films such asSpider-Man 2,50 First Dates, andThe Grudge,[104]and in 2006. Columbia's box office successes of 2006 included such blockbusters asThe Da Vinci Code,The Pursuit of Happyness,Monster House,Casino Royale, andOpen Season. The studio not only finished the year in first place, but also reached an all-time record high sum of $1.711 billion, which was an all-time yearly record for any studio. It was surpassed by Warner Bros. in 2009.[105]

On January 10, 2024, Sony Pictures celebrated the centennial anniversary of the founding of Columbia Pictures with a new motion logo; the centennial print logo was previously revealed on November 14, 2023.[116][117]The motion logo, which was used throughout Columbia's 2024 slate, made its theatrical debut in the 2024 re-release ofSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse(2023).[118]
The Columbia Pictures logo, featuring the Torch Lady, a woman carrying a torch and wearing a drape (representingColumbia, apersonificationof the United States), has gone through five major changes.[119][120][121]It has often been compared to theStatue of Liberty, which was an inspiration to the Columbia Pictures logo.[121]
Originally in 1924, Columbia Pictures used a logo featuring a female Roman soldier holding a shield in her left hand and a stick of wheat in her right hand, which was based on actressDoris Doscher(known as the model for the statue on thePulitzer Fountain) as theStanding Liberty quarterused from 1916 to 1930, though the studio's version was given longer hair.[122]The logo changed in 1928 with a new woman wearing a drapedflagand torch. The woman wore aheaddress, thestolaand carried thepallaofancient Rome, and above her were the words "A Columbia Production" ("A Columbia Picture" or "Columbia Pictures Corporation") written in an arch. The illustration was based upon the actressEvelyn Venable, known for providing the voice of theBlue FairyinWalt Disney'sPinocchio.
An alternative logo in tandem with the 1924 and 1928 versions that used the slogan "Gems of the Screen"; itself a takeoff on the song "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean", later inspired the renaming of the Charles Mintz Studio intoScreen Gems.[citation needed]
In 1936, the logo was changed into the well known classic look: the Torch Lady now stood on a pedestal, wore no headdress, and the text "Columbia" appeared in chiseled letters behind her. A new form of animation was used on the logo as well, with a torch that radiates light instead of flickers.Pittsburghnative Jane Chester Bartholomew, whomHarry Cohndiscovered working as an extra at Columbia, portrayed the Torch Lady in the logo. There were several variations to the logo over the years—significantly, a color version was done in 1943 forThe Desperadoes.[121]Two years earlier, the flag became just a drape with no markings.[119][120]The latter change came after a federal law was passed making it illegal to wear an American flag as clothing. In the 1950s, the woman's robe was redrawn and shaded with a plunging neckline and an exposed slipper-clad foot. 1976'sTaxi Driverwas one of the last films released before the "Torch Lady" was revamped.
From 1955 to 1963, Columbia used the woman from the 1936 logo under the Screen Gems banner, officially billing itself as part of "the Hollywood studios of Columbia Pictures", as spoken at the end of some Screen Gems series.
From 1976 to 1993,[119]Columbia Pictures used two logos. The first, from 1976 to 1981 (or from 1975 for promotional material until 1982 for international territories) used just a sunburst representing the beams from the torch, although the woman appears briefly in the opening logo. The score accompanying the first logo was composed bySuzanne Ciani. The studio hired visual effects pioneerRobert Abelto animate the first logo.[123]The image was created with over fifty light exposures that included streak and special filter passes. The woman returned in 1981, but in a much smoother form described as resembling aCoke bottle.[119]During the studio's run with Coca-Cola, a golden version of the Torch Lady was used for the Columbia Pictures Television logo with the byline "A unit of the Coca-Cola Company" from 1982 to 1987 until it was replaced with the 1981 version and the byline was removed after Coke sold Columbia to Sony. The slogans for the 1976 and 1981 logos were "Let us entertain you" and "Movies That Matter", respectively.
From 1982 to 1985, Columbia used the 1981 logo for Triumph Films, with the woman under theArc De Triomphein the logo. The 1981 logo along with the 1936 and 1976 versions would be later used in 21st century Columbia releases, generally to match the year a given film is set in.
In 1992, the longest-running, and perhaps best known, iteration of the logo was created; the television division was the first to use it. Films began to use the new logo the year after, when Scott Mednick and the Mednick Group were hired by Peter Guber to create logos for all the entertainment properties then owned by Sony Pictures.[124]Mednick hired New Orleans artistMichael Deas,[125]to digitally repaint the logo and return the woman to her "classic" look.[126]An urban legend is that actressAnnette Beningwas the model for the current logo. Bening's face was later superimposed onto the Torch Lady in the opening intro ofWhat Planet Are You From?(2000) as an inside joke.
Michael Deas hired Jennifer Joseph, a 28-year-old graphics artist forThe Times-Picayune, as a model for the logo.[127]Due to time constraints, she agreed to help out on her lunch break. It was the first and only time she ever modeled. Joseph had recently discovered she was pregnant at the time.[128]Deas also hiredThe Times-Picayunephotographer Kathy Anderson to photograph the reference photography.[129]The animation was created by Synthespian Studios in 1993 by Jeff Kleiser andDiana Walczak, who used 2D elements from the painting and converted it to 3D.[130]The studio being part of Sony would not be referenced on-screen until 1996. VHS promos featured the current logo with a stylized "75" behind the Torch Lady, commemorating the studio's 75th anniversary in 1999 with the slogan, "Lighting Up Screens Around the World".
In 2012, the current logo was displayed as a painting at theOgden Museum of Southern Artin New Orleans. Deas gave an interview toWWL-TV: "I never thought it would make it to the silver screen and I never thought it would still be up 20 years later, and I certainly never thought it would be in a museum, so it's kind of gratifying."[131]On November 14, 2023, Sony unveiled a special centennial logo ahead the studios’ 100th anniversary, consisting of the current Torch Lady within a stylized “100” and later posted an animation that showcases the older logos in the same vein as theSpider-Versefilms on January 10, 2024, the 100th anniversary of the founding of Columbia Pictures. This logo was used on Columbia's 2024 releases.[132]
The current logo was also used forScreen Gems Networkand Columbia Showcase theatre, both now defunct programming blocks that featured syndicated airings of Sony Pictures-owned shows and films, respectively.

Koji was born in 1987 to an English mother and a Japanese father. His parents separated when he was young, and he was brought up by his mother inEpsom,Surrey.[1]
Koji started in the industry doing extra work and making short films as a teenager. At 18, he moved toThailandwhile still training in martial arts and did some small jobs in the film industry.[2]He subsequently worked in Japan's film industry for a few years, before returning to England to train at the Actors' Temple Studio in London.[2]Eventually, Koji started getting more jobs in theatre and television in the UK. Regarding his opportunities there, he stated: "In the UK I would say my dual heritage has not particularly been advantageous. Opportunities for East Asian actors at the time was and still is quite limited—although things are changing."[2]

Overall the series ran for three seasons and a total of 30 episodes from 2019 to 2023.[10]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
