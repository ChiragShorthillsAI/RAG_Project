The Estateis a 2022black comedyfilm written and directed byDean Craig. It starsToni ColletteandAnna Farisas sisters who try to get back in the good graces of their estranged aunt before she passes to inherit some of her fortune.  The film was released on November 4, 2022, bySignature Entertainment.
Two sisters, Macy and Savannah are denied for a bank loan. Their mom says her sister, with a $20 million estate, has cancer. Savannah suggests to her sister that they attempt to get their aunt Hilda's inheritance money. Macy's boyfriend is moving to Alaska for a year if there is no money, so she agrees to the plan.
But when they arrive at their aunt's mansion, they find their cousin Beatrice also there along with her husband James, making soup in kitchen. They accuse her of trying for the inheritance. Later, another cousin Richard alias Dick joins them. They trade insults between themselves. Richard hits on Macy, even though they are cousins.
Macy and Savannah take their aunt to see her sister for reconciliation, but they start physically fighting with each other. Richard buys flowers and cake for his aunt. James and Beatrice make the aunt a photo album - which she likes. Macy and Savannah are unable to compete against their cousins, so they plan to bring out the aunt's high school crush Bill. Beatrice overhears the plan and decides to get her aunt to sleep with her husband James, who rebels against it.
Macy and Savannah see Bill, but he lives in a Halfway House for sex offenders who are out of prison. They bribe him with $200, and give him the aunt's address.
Bill arrives for the date, and Dick remembers that Bill is a flasher and mentions it to Beatrice who breaks into the aunt's room and tells her about Bill being a sex offender. Aunt is willing to give Bill a second chance and get married, so Bill would inherit the estate, which spoils the cousins' plans.
The cousins all join together to take out Bill, deciding to split the estate equally between them. The plan is to show that Bill is still a flasher. Their younger sister is set as a bait for the sex offender Bill, and she agrees to get him drunk, and get him to flash.
James leaves, and wants his wife to come with him. He says it's either him or the money, and Beatrice chooses the money. The cousins lure Bill out to the garden and seat him with Ellen, but he passes out. Savannah unzips his pant and takes some pictures. Macy tries to zip him up, when her boyfriend Geoff arrives to see it happen. Hilda starts foaming at the mouth and a doctor is called who informs them it's time to say their goodbyes. The cousins give the aunt a will to sign with her giving up her estate to them. After forcing her to sign it, she rebukes them before taking her last breath.
At the will execution, the lawyer says the aunt had 17 million dollars, but only $38.17 remain after debts are accounted for. Plus Macy gets the painting of the aunt's dog.
When Macy and her sisters go home, they discover a document with the painting's value assessed at $4.3 million.

Faris has an older brother, Robert, who is also a sociologist and professor at theUniversity of California, Davis.[6][7][8]In interviews, she has described her parents as "ultra liberal"[9]and said that she and her brother were raised in anirreligious[10]but "very conservative", traditional atmosphere.[3]At age six, her parents enrolled her in a community drama class for children, as they usually encouraged her to act. She enjoyed watching plays and eventually produced her own material in her bedroom with neighborhood friends. She has said in interviews she often imagined her orthodontalretainertalking to her, and that she pictured herself "on talk shows to talk about [her] talking retainer".[3][11][12]
Faris attendedEdmonds Woodway High School. While studying, performed onstage with a Seattlerepertory companyand in nationally broadcast radio plays. She once described herself as "a drama-club dork," and said she used to wear a Christmas-tree skirt in school. She graduated in 1994).[3]She attended theUniversity of Washington, where she earned a degree in English literature in 1999.[5]Despite her love of acting, she admitted she "never really thought [she] wanted to become a movie star" and continued to act "just to make some extra money," hoping one day to publish a novel.[3][13]After graduating from college, she was going to travel to London, where she had a receptionist job lined up at an ad agency. However, she ended up living in Los Angeles "at the last minute," once she committed to the idea of pursuing acting. Shortly afterwards, she obtained the starring role inScary Movie.[13]At 22, she lived in a studio apartment atThe RavenswoodinHancock Park.[13]
Encouraged by her parents to pursue acting when she was young,[14]Faris gave her first professional performance at age nine in a three-month run ofArthur Miller's playDanger: Memory!at theSeattle Repertory Theater. She made US$250 for the role, which was "huge" for her at the time. "I felt like I was rolling in the dough," she recalled.[15]She went on to playScoutin a production ofTo Kill a Mockingbirdat theVillage TheatreinIssaquah, Washington, the title character inHeidi,  and Rebecca inOur Town. Her theater credits during that period included productions ofRain,Some Fish,No Elephants, andLife Under Water.[16]

It marked her first starring credit, as she had appeared only in small and supporting parts in theater plays and low-budget features. She found the experience a "great boot camp" for her, as she told UK'sThe Guardianin 2009, explaining that she "hadn't done much before that. With those movies, you have to be so exact with your props and the physical comedy and everything, so it was a great training ground."[23]Scary Moviewas a major commercial success, ranking atop the box office charts with a US$42 million opening weekend gross. It went on to earn US$278 million worldwide.[24]For her performance, Faris received nominations for theBreakthrough Female PerformanceandBest KissAwards at the2001 MTV Movie Awards.

Budgeted at US$3 million, it made US$18.6 million,[36]but aView Londonreviewer, remarking that the director had "assembled a decent comic cast," felt that "he gives them practically nothing to do. Reynolds and [...] Faris were hilarious together inJust Friends, so it's a shame that their talents are so wasted here."[37]InJust Friends, Faris portrayed Samantha James,[38]an emerging, self-obsessed pop singer landing in New Jersey with a formerly overweight nerd (played by co-star Reynolds), now a successful record producer. It grossed US$50.9 million around the globe,[39]and earned Faris nominations for anMTV Movie Awardand twoTeen Choice Awards.[40]

She appeared oppositeDiane KeatonandJon Hederin the independent comedyMama's Boy, playing an aspiring singer and the love interest of a self-absorbed 29-year-old (Heder).

In theblack comedyObserve and Report(2009), Faris co-starred oppositeSeth Rogen, portraying a vulgar, hard-partying cosmetic counter employee on whom Rogen has a crush. She was drawn to appear in the movie, as it gave Faris the opportunity to play an "awful character" rather than the usual "roles where you have to win the audience over or win the guy over, and be charming."[58]Controversy arose regarding a scene where Rogen has sex with Faris's intoxicated character, with various advocacy groups commenting that it constituteddate rape.[59][60][61]Budgeted at US$18 million,Observe and Reportmade US$26 million.[62]Faris voiced a weather intern and the love interest of a wannabe scientist in the animatedCloudy with a Chance of Meatballsas well as Jeanette Miller (one ofthe Chipettes) in the live-action hybridAlvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, both of which were box office successes.[63][64]

It garnered generally mediocre reviews, who concluded that the "comic timing" of Faris was "sharp as always," but felt it was wasted in "this predictable, boilerplate comedy."[73]It was released on September 30, 2011, and made US$30 million worldwide.[74]She also reprised her voice-over role inAlvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, released on December 16, 2011.
Her next film role was that of a human rights activist befriending a childish autocrat in the political satireThe Dictator(2012), co-starringSacha Baron Cohen.[75]Faris, who was eager to work with Baron Cohen as she had been his fan "for years,"[76]stated that "90 percent" of the acting in the film was improvised.[76]Critics gave it decent reviews, with Faris's role garnering a similar reception;Los Angeles Timescalled her "the film's standout" and stated that when "she opens her mouth, that rasp that has made her so much fun to watch (theScary Moviefranchise most memorably) takes hold and turns the dialogue inside out. The kind of true-believer purity she brings to Zoey's eco-terrorizing rants comes close to stealing Baron Cohen's comic thunder."[77]The picture was a box office success, grossing US$179 million globally,[78]and earned Faris the Star of the Year Award at theNational Association of Theatre Owners.[79]
In 2013, Faris acted for the third time with then-husbandChris Pratt, followingTake Me Home TonightandWhat's Your Number?in a segment ofMovie 43, anindependentanthologyblack comedy that featured 14 different storylines, with each segment having a different director.[80]The film was universally panned by critics, with theChicago Sun-Timescalling it "theCitizen Kaneof awful."[81][82]In the British romantic comedyI Give It a Year(2013), Faris played an old flame of a writer (Rafe Spall) who hastily tied the knot.

Perigard wrote in his verdict: "This is dark material, yet Faris balances it with a genuine winsomeness, able to wring laughs out of the most innocuous lines."[93][94]She has been nominated for one Prism Award and twoPeople's Choice Awards. In 2020, Faris left the show after seven seasons.[95]
Faris reprised her voice-role in the animated science-fiction comedy sequelCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, released in theaters four days afterMompremiered on television.[96][97]Likethe first film,Meatballs 2was a commercial success, grossing US$274.3 million worldwide.[98]The following year, she had an uncredited cameo in the closing-credits sequence of theaction-comedy22 Jump Street, appearing in a segment called30 Jump Street: Flight Academy.[99][100][101]

And then I just thought, I kind of want a hobby [...] So I started asking around to some friends, and I asked this technical producer guy what equipment I should buy onAmazon. And I just started recording my friends when they would come over. And then with my dear friend Sim, we started flushing out the whole thing, which clearly there's still a lot more flushing out to do. It started out as a dinky hobby."[105]As of May 2021, 249 episodes have been released.[106]
Faris reprised her voice-over role inAlvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chipin 2015, the fourth installment in theAlvin and the Chipmunksfilm series.[107][108]In 2016, she had a brief appearance as an exaggerated version of herself in the action-comedyKeanu,[109]and starred in the music video for the song "Hold on to Me" byMondo Cozmo.[110]She is also a musician, and knows how to play percussion instruments.

The memoir became one of the "top 20 blockbuster books of autumn," according to Amazon,[112]and received a positive critical response;The New York Timesfound the book to be "goofily self-deprecating, casually profane and occasionally raw, earnest and blunt, like Ms. Faris herself,"[113][114]andThe Ringerremarked: "Unqualifiedis observant, sharp, and startlingly revealing, not only about Faris's romantic history, but of the broader discrepancies between modern male and femaleHollywoodstardom writ large."[115]
InOverboard(2018), a remake of the 1987film of the same namestarringGoldie HawnandKurt Russell, Faris played a single, working-class mother who convinces a spoiled wealthy playboy (Eugenio Derbez) with amnesia that they are married.[116]While publications such asIndieWireandFilm Inquirypraised the chemistry between Derbez and Faris,[117][118]most critics felt that the film made "poor use of the ever-charming" Faris.[119]Her first leading film role since 2011'sWhat's Your Number,[120]Overboardwas a commercial success, grossing over US$91.2 million worldwide.[121]
During her career, Faris has been called one of the "most talented comedic actresses" of her generation by several publications.[93][122][123]Cosmopolitanmagazine named her "theCosmo's Fun Fearless Female of the Year" in 2010,[124]andTad Frienddescribed her inThe New Yorkeras "Hollywood's most original comedic actress."[14]AVulturearticle called Faris "her generation's Goldie Hawn" and she has been often compared to comedianLucille Ball.[125][126]The Wrap, likening her to Ball, asserted the actress "has impeccable timing and isn't afraid to cast dignity aside in pursuit of a hearty laugh,"[127]whileNPRdescribed her as "Hawn's heir apparent—a modern-day Lucille Ball with an up-for-anything mania and a gift for the low arts of slapstick and pulling faces."[128]

Clubonce stated it was a "pleasure to watch" Faris on screen and described her as "a gifted, likeable comedian who tends to be the best element of many terrible movies."[129]Slatemagazine's Dana Stevens wrote in her review for Faris's vehicleWhat's Your Number?: "More than any contemporary comedienne I can think of [...] Faris demonstrates this fearless anything-for-a-laugh quality. It would be wonderful to see her in a movie that tested the limits of that audacity, rather than forcing her to tamp it down."[130]Most critics agree that her 2007 independent comedySmiley Faceremains one of her best films;[131]Los Angeles Timesremarked that this film was "an opportunity for the actress to show that she can carry a movie composed of often hilarious nonstop misadventures. No matter how outrageously or foolishly Faris' Jane behaves, she remains blissfully appealing—such are Faris' fearless comedic skills and the freshness of her radiant blond beauty."[132]

... my father being a Russian Jew ....
My relatives are Scottish, so I think my Scottish audience is important. Some are in Glasgow, but my mum's from Aberdeen. I hear it's grey there—like my mum. The name's Russian, but New York is my home. That's where I'm from.
I like that I look like my father and mother put together—that's aRussian Jewand aScottishLutheran, and I like that it all looks mixed up. ... I'm sure my nose wasn't an asset until I was David Duchovny. Before that, it was, like, "Yeah, that kind of Jewish-looking guy with the kind of big nose."

In addition to her work on stage and screen, Turner has taught acting classes atNew York University.[4][5]
Born June 19, 1954, inSpringfield, Missouri,[6]to Patsy (néeMagee)[7]and Allen Richard Turner, aU.S. Foreign Serviceofficer[7]who grew up in China (where Turner's great-grandfather had been aMethodistmissionary), Turner is the third of four children, and the only one to be born in the United States.[8]She has a sister, Susan, and two brothers.[9][10][11]
Raised in a strictly conservativeChristianhome, Turner's interest in performing was discouraged by both of her parents: "My father was of missionary stock", she later explained, "sotheaterand acting were just one step up from being astreetwalker, you know? So when I was performing in school, he would drive my mom [there] and sit in the car. She'd come out at intermissions and tell him, 'She's doing very well.'"[10][12]
Owing to her father's position with the Foreign Service, Turner grew up in Canada, Cuba, Venezuela, and London, England.[13]She attended high school atThe American School in London,[14]graduating in 1972.[9]"The start of real acting for me began during high school in London", she stated in her 2008 memoir. "There were seven of us who were sort of a theater mafia. We produced, directed, acted, chose the plays, got one teacher fired and another one hired."[15]Her father died of acoronary thrombosisone week before her graduation,[16][9]and the family returned to Springfield, Missouri. At the age of 19, Turner began volunteering at a localPlanned Parenthoodoffice.[4]
She attendedSouthwest Missouri State University[17]for two years, studying theater. During this period, directorHerbert Blausaw her performance inThe House of Blue Leaves, and invited her to spend her senior year at theUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County,[18]where she received aBachelor of Fine Artsdegree in 1977.[19]During that period, Turner acted in several productions directed by film and stage directorSteve Yeager.[20]
In 1973, Turner spent the summer with her mother inMidland, Texas. There, at theYucca Theater, Turner made history when she was cast as the first female villain in theSummer Mummers1973melodrama,Plodding Among the Planets.
Several months after moving to New York City in 1977, Turner took over the female lead in Michael Zetter's playMister T, which co-starredJonathan Frakesand played atSoho Repertory Theatre. That production marked heroff-Broadwaydebut. Several months later, Turner made herBroadwaydebut as Judith Hastings inGeminibyAlbert Innaurato, staged at The Little Theatre (now known as theHelen Hayes Theater) and starringDanny Aiello. It opened May 21, 1977, during the time when she was appearing in the soapThe Doctors.[21]
In 1978, Turner made her television debut in theNBCdaytime soapThe Doctorsas the second Nola Dancy Aldrich. She made her film debut in 1981 as the ruthless Matty Walker in the thrillerBody Heat; the role brought her to international prominence.Empirecited the film in 1995 when it named her one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in Film History.[22]The New York Timeswrote in 2005 that, propelled by her "jaw-dropping movie debut [in]Body Heat... she built a career on adventurousness and frank sexuality born of robust physicality".[12]Turner ultimately became one of the top box-office draws, and most sought-after actresses of the 1980s and early 1990s.
Turner stated in 2018, "Body Heatwas a blessing because I went straight to being a leading actor and I didn't have to suffer any of this predatory male behaviour like many young actresses. It doesn't frustrate me that nearly four decades after that film I'm still referred to as a sexual icon. I got over that a long time ago."[23]
Because of her deep, husky voice, Turner was often compared to a youngLauren Bacall. When the two met, Turner reportedly introduced herself by saying, "Hi, I'm the young you."[24]
AfterBody Heat, Turner steered away fromfemme fataleroles to "preventtypecasting" and "becausefemme fataleroles had a shelf-life". Consequently, her first project after this was the 1983 comedyThe Man With Two Brains. Turner co-starred inRomancing the StonewithMichael DouglasandDanny DeVito. Film criticPauline Kaelwrote of her performance as writer Joan Wilder, "Turner knows how to use her dimples amusingly and how to dance like a woman who didn't know she could; her star performance is exhilarating."[25]Romancing the Stonewas a surprise hit: she won aGolden Globefor her role in the film, and it became one of the top-ten-grossing movies of 1984.[26]Turner teamed with Douglas and DeVito again the following year for its sequel,The Jewel of the Nile. Pre-production for the movie was fraught with conflict, because Turner refused to commit to the "terrible" script she had been delivered. When she said no,20th Century Foxthreatened her with a US$25 millionbreach of contractlawsuit. Eventually Douglas, also the film's producer, agreed to undertake rewrites on the script to make it more acceptable to Turner, which led to much back-and-forth between the two as the script was retooled right up to when shooting started inFez, Morocco.[27]
Several months beforeJewel, Turner starred inPrizzi's HonorwithJack Nicholson, winning a secondGolden Globeaward, and later starred inPeggy Sue Got Married, which co-starredNicolas Cage. ForPeggy Sue, she received the award forBest Actressfrom the U.S.National Board of Review of Motion Pictures,[28]as well as anAcademy Awardnomination for Best Actress.
In 1988's toon-noirWho Framed Roger Rabbit, she was the speaking voice of cartoonfemme fataleJessica Rabbit, intoning the famous line, "I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way." Her uncredited, sultry performance was acclaimed as "the kind of sexpot ball-breaker she was made for".[29](Amy Irvingprovided Jessica Rabbit's singing voice in the scene in which the character first appears in the movie.) That same year, Turner also appeared inSwitching Channels, which was a loose remake of the 1940 hit filmHis Girl Friday; this, in turn, was a loose remake of theBen Hecht-Charles MacArthurcomedyThe Front Page.[30]
Turner was the subject of the 1986 song"The Kiss of Kathleen Turner"by Austrian techno-pop singerFalco. In 1989, Turner teamed with Douglas and DeVito for a third time, inThe War of the Roses, but this time as Douglas's disillusioned wife, with DeVito in the role of a divorce attorney who told their shared story.The New York Timespraised the trio, saying that "Mr. Douglas and Ms. Turner have never been more comfortable a team ... each of them is at his or her comic best when being as awful as both are required to be here ... [Kathleen Turner is] evilly enchanting."[31]In that film, Turner played a former gymnast and, as in other roles, did many of her own stunts. (She broke her nose two years later, filming 1991'sV.I. Warshawski.)[32][33]
Turner remained an A-list film star leading lady in the early 1990s, starring inV.I. WarshawskiandUndercover Blues, untilrheumatoid arthritisseriously restricted her activities. She also blamed her age, stating, "when I was 40, the roles started slowing down, I started getting offers to play mothers and grandmothers."
In 1992, during the filming ofSerial Mom, she began experiencing "inexplicable pains and fevers."[34]The rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis was made about a year later. By the time she was diagnosed, she "could hardly turn her head or walk, and was told she would end up in a wheelchair".[12]Of this period, she has said: "My body could respond only with excruciating pain whenever I tried to move at all. The joints in my hands were so swollen, I couldn't hold a pen. Some days I couldn't hold a glass to get a drink of water. I couldn't pick up my child... my feet would blow up so badly that I couldn't get them into any kind of shoes, let alone walk on them."[35]
Turner's appearance changed after the rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis. "The press were merciless," she states in her memoir. "They snipped that I had become fat and unrecognizable because I was an angry, washed-up diva, an out-of-control has-been, when in truth the changes in my physical appearance were caused by drugs and chemotherapy and were not within my control. Still, I did not reveal what was happening to me."[36]
As her rheumatoid arthritis progressed, alcohol consumption became a problem. "I drank consciously at first to kill the pain....Later, after I got the new medicines and the pain began to subside, I kept drinking too much... It didn't damage my work, but it damaged me personally."[37]
Turner has admitted that the drinking made her difficult to be around.[38]In 2005, an article inThe New York Timesstated: "Rumors began circulating that she was drinking too much." In her memoir, she said: "I went on letting others believe anything they wanted to about my behavior and physical changes. Many people bought the assumption that I'd turned into a heavy drinker. I couldn't publicly refute them because I believed it was worse to have people know that I had this terrible illness. They'd hire me if they thought I was a drunk, because they could understand drinking, but they wouldn't hire me if I had a mysterious, scary illness they didn't understand.  We – Jay, my agent, myself – felt it was imperative to keep my rheumatoid arthritis quiet."[37]

While her performance as the seductive Mrs. Robinson was popular with audiences, with sustained high box office for the duration of Turner's run, she received mixed reviews from critics.[41]The play transferred to Broadway in 2002 to similar critical reaction.
In 2005, Turner beat a score of other contenders (includingJessica Lange,Frances McDormand, andBette Midler)[12]for the role of Martha in a 2005 Broadway revival ofEdward Albee'sWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?at theLongacre Theatre. Albee later explained to theNew York Timesthat when Turner read for the part with her eventual co-starBill Irwin, he heard "an echo of the 'revelation' that he had felt years ago when the parts were read by[Uta] HagenandArthur Hill." He added that Turner had "a look of voluptuousness, a woman of appetites, yes ... but a look of having suffered, as well."[12]
Ben Brantleypraised Turner at length, writing:
As the man-eating Martha, Ms. Turner, a movie star whose previous theater work has been variable, finally secures her berth as a first-rate, depth-probing stage actress ... [A]t 50, this actress can look ravishing and ravaged, by turns. In the second act, she is as predatorily sexy as she was in the movieBody Heat. But in the third and last act, she looks old, bereft, stripped of all erotic flourish. I didn't think I would ever be able to seeVirginia Woolfagain without thinking of Ms. Hagen [Uta Hagen]. But watching Ms. Turner in that last act, fully clothed but more naked than she ever was inThe Graduate, I didn't see the specter of Ms. Hagen. All I saw was Ms. Turner. No, let's be fair. All I saw was Martha.[42]
As Martha, Turner received her second Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play, losing toCherry Jones. The production was transferred to London'sApollo Theatrein 2006. She starred in Sandra Ryan Heyward's one-woman show,Tallulah, which she toured across the U.S.

By the late 1980s, Turner had acquired a reputation for being difficult, whatThe New York Timescalled "a certifiable diva". She admitted that she had developed into "not a very kind person", and actressEileen Atkins—with whom she starred in the playIndiscretionson Broadway—referred to her as "an amazing nightmare".[12]In 2018, she commented on her reputation, stating: "The 'difficult' thing was pure gender crap. If a man comes on set and says, 'Here's how I see this being done', people go, 'He's decisive.' If a woman does it, they say, 'Oh, fuck. There she goes.'"[27]Turner has defended herself against Atkins' claims, saying that Atkins harbored animosity towards her because she was having trouble memorizing her lines, which Atkins found very unprofessional. Turner later realized that medication she was taking for her rheumatoid arthritis was making her "fuzzy." She added that, on days when the rheumatoid arthritis in her wrist was especially bad and she warned the other cast members not to touch it, Atkins would intentionally sit on it during a scene where Turner had to play dead, causing Turner extreme pain.[27]
Turner slammed Hollywood over the difference in the quality of roles offered to male actors and female actors as they age, calling the disparity a "terrible double standard".
A few weeks after leaving the production of the playThe Graduatein November 2002, she was admitted into the Geisinger Marworth Treatment Center inWaverly, Pennsylvania, for the treatment ofalcoholism. "I have no problem with alcohol when I'm working", she explained. "It's when I'm home alone that I can't control my drinking ... I was going toward excess. I mean, really! I think I was losing my control over it. So it pulled me back."[12]
