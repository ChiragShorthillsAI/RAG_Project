Honor Societyis a 2022 Americancoming-of-agecomedy filmdirected by Oran Zegman, written byDavid A. Goodman, and starringAngourie Rice,Gaten Matarazzo, andChristopher Mintz-Plasse.
It was released onParamount+on July 29, 2022, to positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of Rice, Matarazzo, and Mintz-Plasse.[1]
Honor Rose is an ambitious senior at George H. W. Bush High School who has dedicated her entire academic career to being accepted intoHarvard University, hoping to escape her mediocre middle-class life. Part of this plan (which also includes feigning several interests) involves earning a letter of recommendation from her guidance counselor, Mr. Calvin.
Calvin, a wannabe musician with an inappropriate crush on Honor, has connections to the university and tells her that he is considering her plus three other students for the recommendation. She quickly deduces who they are: star athlete Travis Biggins, creativeintrovertKennedy Park, and the awkward but academically brilliant nerd Michael Dipnicky. Honor resolves to eliminate all of them from contention with the help from "fake" friends Emma and Talia.
Honor's master plan begins when she joins the theatre club and persuades them to put on a production of Kennedy's play aboutMary I of England, hoping the project will distract Kennedy and cause her grades to sink. Honor also persuades Travis to join the production, hoping to sabotage his athletic prestige and push him into pursuing hisclosetedcrush on one of the actors.
Believing that Michael is interested in her and bad at talking to girls, Honor makes herself his lab partner and accepts his requests to follow her on social media. In her attempts to charm him, Honor invites Michael to her house for study sessions.
During their first study session, Honor tries to distract Michael by dressing scantily and insincerely flirting with him, but Michael ends up charming her instead with his kindness and their mutual interest inThe Handmaid's Tale. Honor eventually proposes studying at Michael's house next time, but he is hesitant. She soon discovers that this is because Michael lives in foster care.
Honor's increasing attraction to Michael is fully realized when they sneak into a fancy house after school. Michael kisses her, and they start a relationship which culminates in Honor publicly kissing him, shocking her classmates. Meanwhile, she begins to genuinely enjoy the theatre club and making real bonds with Kennedy and Travis. Calvin also starts to make stronger sexual advances to Honor, even going as far to sexually proposition her for the Harvard recommendation, an offer she refuses.
Honor eventually decides to let Michael have the recommendation, as she finds herself both feeling sorry for him and happy with her new circle of friends. One day, Michael texts her during lunch, saying he is alone at home. Honor goes to Michael's foster home and discovers he does not live there, but at the fancy house which they had "snuck into" earlier.
Honor discovers that Michael is not only very well off, but just as manipulative as she is. He reveals that he duped her the entire time from when they first started talking, planning to get Honor to fall in love with him so she would concede the Harvard recommendation to him. A shocked and heartbroken Honor breaks up with Michael and leaves.
Kennedy's production is finally put on to huge success, and Honor finds herself as a genuine friend to the whole club, having helped Kennedy come out of her shell and Travis to publicly come out. Deciding to make one last move in the race for the recommendation, she goes to Calvin's office just as Michael is about to receive it.
Playing a recording of one of Calvin's more aggressive advances, Honor blackmails him into giving the recommendation to Kennedy over Michael. She then decides to enjoy the rest of her senior year, unsure of her likely still-bright academic future but happy with her new friends and newly appreciative of her life as a whole.
In January 2022, the film was greenlit, with production taking place inVancouver.[2]

Glenn Kenny ofThe New York Timeswrote, "[Honor Society] comes out of the gate flashing a formal and thematic sophistication so dazzling it might take you a while to realize it’s actually a Young Adult movie."[6]John Anderson ofThe Wall Street Journalwrote, "Reassuringly -- and very entertainingly -- Ms. Rice makes all of Honor’s plotting palatable, even charming, and her jaded worldview is not totally unreasonable."[7]Tomris Laffly ofVarietycalled it, "A surprisingly compelling high school caper conceived with youthful wit, aplomb and a genuinely out-of-left-field  twist."[8]

AwesomenessTV Holdings, LLC, often shortened toAwesomeness, is an Americandigital mediaandentertainmentnetwork company owned byParamount Global. Established in July 2012 byBrian RobbinsandJoe Davola, the company operated a network initially focused on children’s programs, teen dramas, comedies, live events and music videos targeting adolescents and young adults.
AwesomenessTV initially operated an eponymousYouTubechannel andmulti-channel network. The company later expanded into talent,branded content, music, publishing and retail. In 2013,DreamWorks Animation(DWA) acquired AwesomenessTV. In 2014,Hearst Communicationsacquired a 25% minority stake. In 2016,Verizon Communicationsacquired another roughly-quarter stake in the company for $159 million (valuing it at $650 million), while AwesomenessTV entered into a multi-year deal to produce content for Verizon's streaming video servicego90.
In 2018, followingNBCUniversal's acquisition of DWA (which led to conflict due to being owned by Verizon competitorComcast) and the shutdown of the fledgling go90, Viacom acquired AwesomenessTV for around $50 million – a fraction of its 2016 valuation. Since its purchase by Viacom, the studio has focused more on long-form television series and films forover-the-top services, and has referred to itself as targetinggeneration Z.
In July 2012, foundersBrian RobbinsandJoe Davola[3]launched AwesomnessTV as part of theYouTube Original Channel Initiative, producing various web series oriented towards atweenandteenageaudience. Robbins had personally observed his two sons as examples of changing media consumption trends among the demographic, which had increasingly favored short-form internet video over television.[4]
Robbins had been well known for his work on series such asOne Tree Hill,Smallville, and severalNickelodeonseries, such as the sketch comedyAll That. In 2009, Robbins spearheaded the production ofa filmbased on YouTube comedianLucas Cruikshank's characterFred. Robbins and Cruikshank bankrolled it as anindependent filmfor Nickelodeon—where it became the highest-rated basic-cable film of the year among youth in 2010 and spawned alarger franchiseof Nickelodeon content featuring the character.[4]
The channel had an initial slate of 15 series in development, including the talk showIMO;the stunt showsThe Blow-Up Guys, teen dramaThe Runaways, andAwesomeness Sports(a series of videos that would feature professional athletes and showcase youth athletes).[4]Davola compared the channel toMTVupon its launch, explaining that "it was maverick, it was brand new, it was something the young people were getting involved with."[4]
Brett Bouttier joined as a chief operating officer in November 2012.[5]In December 2012, AwesomenessTV launched amulti-channel networktargeting similar demographics.[6]
On May 1, 2013,DreamWorks Animationannounced its intent to acquire AwesomenessTV for $33 million. It was also announced that AwesomenessTV would develop and operate a YouTube channel focusing on content from DWA's franchises.[7]In October 2013, the company partnered with the teen magazineSeventeento operate its YouTube channel.[8]
In April 2014, AwesomenessTV acquired the MCN and talent management company Big Frame for $15 million.[9]That month, the company also hired formerClaire'sCEO James Fielding to lead a new consumer products division.[10]In June 2014, AwesomenessTV launched DreamWorksTV, a YouTube channel that featured shorts and original series relating to DreamWorks franchises (such asShrek, and theDreamWorks Classicslibrary), as well as supplemental content promoting its upcoming films.[11]The following month, therecord labelAwesomeness Music was announced, in partnership withUniversal Music Group.[12]
In September 2014, AwesomenessTV partnered with the department store chainKohl'sto launch a teen fashion line co-branded with its web seriesLife's S.o. R.a.d., as its first consumer product line.[13][14]In October 2014, AwesomenessTV launched the publishing label AwesomenessInk,[15]andNetflixordered a live-actionRichie Richsitcom from AwesomenessTV as part of an ongoing development deal with DWA.[16]In December 2014,SeventeenpublisherHearst Corporationacquired a 25% stake in the company for $81.25 million.[17]
In June 2015, the company hired formerLionsgateexecutiveMatt Kaplanas president of Awesomeness Films.[18]In August 2015, AwesomenessTV announced an output deal with Canadian children's media conglomerateDHX Media, in which the companies would co-develop and license new original content, with DHX handling international distribution and merchandising. DHX also began to acquire the studio's programming to air on its owned television networkFamily Channel.[19][20]
On April 6, 2016,Verizon Communications—which had acquired several series from the studio (such asGuidance) for its ad-supported streaming servicego90—acquired a 24.5% stake in AwesomenessTV for $159 million, valuing the company at $650 million. Alongside the equity stake, the deal included a multi-year, $180 million investment for the studio to produce content for Verizon, for which it would hold exclusive U.S. distribution rights. Verizon and AwesomenessTV also planned to launch a branded, subscription-based video service targeting mobile devices.[21][22]

After a struggled launch and performance below expectations, Verizon shut down go90 in July 2018.Digidayreported that Verizon's content investments with AwesomenessTV had accounted for approximately 40% of the studio's revenue, which led to concerns over how the company would run without this backing.[22]The acquisition of DWA byUniversal Pictures— which itself is owned by Verizon competitorComcast— caused a lot of controversy in industry circles due to Verizon and Comcast being direct competitors.
As NBCUniversal's parent company Comcast competed directly with Verizon, the two companies were unwilling to be in a joint venture with each other. The two companies had also become uninterested in the venture, as the exits of Brian Robbins and DWA CEOJeffrey Katzenberghad lessened the appeal of the venture to Verizon, while Comcast did not think that the company was one of DWA's core assets, or fit alongside its other digital media investments (such asBuzzFeed). The company had planned a downsizing under its new CEOJordan Levin.[22]
On July 25, 2018,Viacomannounced that it was in talks to acquire AwesomenessTV for a fraction of the company's $650 million valuation in 2016.[28][29]Two days later, on July 27, Viacom officially announced the purchase, with a valuation initially reported to be $25 million plus the assumption of debt, but later $50 million.[30]Operations of DreamWorksTV were taken in-house by NBCUniversal Direct-to-Consumer and Digital Enterprises after the purchase.[31][32]Jordan Levin left his position as CEO following the acquisition.[1][2]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
