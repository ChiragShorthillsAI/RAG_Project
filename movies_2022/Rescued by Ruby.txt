Ruby is an extremely hyperactive half-border collie that has been adopted seven times from the shelter she has been in over the last six months, but always later returned due to an inability to train or control her.Rhode Island state trooperDaniel O'Neil has dreamed of joining the K-9 search and rescue team of the state police. However, he has been rejected seven times and he only has one last chance to qualify before he turns 30, as all applicants have to be under 30.
Daniel learns that the K-9 unit has no funds to import any moreGerman Shepherds, the breed usually used in search and rescue teams, and therefore he would not be able to join the program. He finds out his wife Melissa is pregnant with their second child, making him even more determined to go for it because the promotion would also improve his pay and benefits. Pat, an advocate at the shelter, begs her workmate Rick to give Ruby a little more time. He announces that in the evening they will put her down. Dan discovers a K-9 dog does not have to be a German Shepherd, but is curious, agile, and spirited. Then he visits the shelter, and Pat convinces him to adopt Ruby to train her and join the program. The story then follows Dan's attempts to train Ruby, their failures, and their successes. They both are high-energy, enthusiastic, and have to discover how to work together effectively.
Sergeant Zarella explains that after an entry exam, those accepted do six weeks of intensive training. To enter, the dog and the owner must have the right temperament, focus, calmness, and compassion. Ruby does well until finally, impatient, she wiggles free, disturbing a bee's nest. Out of the official training, Mel reminds Dan he got through the police academy withdyslexiaand hyperactivity, so maybe he should try homeschooling Ruby.
At the exam at six weeks, Ruby passes. They wait for months on their junior team, until finally they are needed. Sent to a home where a murder victim is meant to be, Ruby senses human remains, but Dan can't find them. Disappointed, he ignores her, dejected. She runs off during the night, only to have Zarella tell him the remains were found at the scene where Ruby indicated, but buried beneath concrete. Zarella tells Dan it was amazing that Ruby caught the scent, and he should have trusted his K9 partner. Dan frantically searches for Ruby, finally finding her.
Dan and Ruby join the search teams seeking Michael, a boy who got lost while hiking. They find him in the rain and dark, and the boy turns out to be Pat's son. Pat thanks Dan and Ruby and Dan is promoted to full K-9 officer.

Kathleen Ann Shea(born October 9, 1959)[1]is an American actress, film director, and acting teacher. She is best known for directing the erotic thrillerPoison Ivy, which was nominated for the 1992Sundance Grand Jury Prize.
Shea was born inDetroit, Michigan to an artist father and nurse mother.[2]She studied teaching at theUniversity of Michiganfrom which she graduated with honors. After graduating, she spent six months teaching blind children,[3]before taking off at age 19 toHollywood, California where she started her early modeling career and for a short time attendedUniversity of California, Los Angeles.[4]
"I was directing plays I'd written in my back yard when I was twelve", she said later. "I was a total misfit and didn't have any friends, so that's what I did instead. I recruited younger kids from the neighborhood, and their parents paid me to put them in my productions. I made some pretty good money, actually. Helped put me through college. Yay for being a misfit! Yay for not having friends!"[5]
Shea worked as an actor and model for a number of years, including appearing in a small role inScarfaceandPsycho III.[6][7]
"I was never comfortable being an actress", she said in a 1992 interview. "It was the most ridiculous thing; I am like the antithesis of that. I really, truly am very shy. ... I did it for seven years, and I can't believe I lived through that".
In 1986, she was on location in the Philippines when she struck up a friendship with Andy Ruben. The two of them started writing scripts together, and succeeded in gettingThe Patriot(1986) made forRoger Corman. Corman agreed to finance another Ruben-Shea script with Shea directing,Stripped to Kill. The resulting movie was successful and launched her directorial career.[7]
Shea made a number of films for Corman based on scripts by herself and Ruben. Corman later described her as a ""talented director. She's particularly good with actors, having been an actress herself. She's taught herself about the camera and has gotten better with each picture."[8]
In a 1990 review ofStreets, theLos Angeles Timessaid Shea "continues to show that she is a first-rate talent, as terrific at handling hard action with style and dispatch as a drawing the best from her casts."[9]
According to Corman, the films she made for him cost less than $500,000 on average and made between $5–10 million.[10]She was then hired byNew Lineto makePoison Ivywhich was a critical and popular hit.
In 1992, her films were honoured with a four-day retrospective at theMuseum of Modern Artincluding the New York premiere ofPoison Ivy.[11]According to Larry Karidish, a curator of film at the museum:
Katt's work is distinctive for its style, rhythm, the progression of its narrative. Her movies touch something deep in the psyche. They have a consistent and coherent sensibility and I thought it would make sense to show her work as a body.[10]
In 2019, she directed Sophia Lillis and Linda Lavin in the feature film Nancy Drew and The Hidden Staircase for Warner Bros. In 2022, she directedRescued By RubyforNetflix.
Between directing jobs, she works as an acting coach,[12]where her past clients have includedChristina Applegate,Alison Lohman,Sophia Lillis, andDrew Barrymore.[13]
Katt Shea married collaborator Andy Ruben. They divorced in 1992 after 13 years of marriage.[10]
