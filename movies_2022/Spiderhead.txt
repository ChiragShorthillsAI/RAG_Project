Spiderheadis a 2022 Americansci-fipsychological thrillerfilm directed byJoseph Kosinski, with a screenplay byRhett ReeseandPaul Wernick, based on thedystopianshort story "Escape from Spiderhead" byGeorge Saundersand first published inThe New Yorker. The film starsChris Hemsworth,Miles Teller, andJurnee Smollett. The story follows inmates in a luxurious prison who participate in experiments involving mind-altering drugs. Principal photography took place in Australia in 2020.
Spiderheadpremiered inSydneyon June 11, 2022, and was released onNetflixon June 17. The film received mixed reviews from critics.
Spiderhead is astate of the artpenitentiary experimenting with the effects of research chemicals. The test subjects, technically prisoners of the state, are volunteers for the project aiming to reduce their sentence time. The program is overseen by the sympathetic and hospitable Steve Abnesti, along with his assistant Mark. The prisoners have their own rooms, do chores, and are free to roam without guard supervision. The subjects go through daily test runs of various drugs, all of which alter their emotions and their perceptions of their surroundings.
Inmate Jeff, still reeling from having killed his friend whilst drunk driving, is given N-40, a "love drug", which distorts his senses and drives him to have sex with two of his fellow inmates. Steve asks him to choose which one of them to give Darkenfloxx, a drug that induces intense fear and psychological pain. He declines to choose, claiming he feels nothing in particular for either one of them after the effects of the love drug had worn off. Mark helps Steve administer some N-40 to himself.
The next day, Steve brings Jeff into the observation room and tells him that the "higher ups" have decided that the younger of the two women, Heather, must be injected with a dose, though it will only last 5 minutes. Jeff reluctantly agrees, and to his horror, Heather commits suicide while on the Darkenfloxx after she damages her MobiPak, the device that administers the drugs. This causes Mark to doubt their work in the facility. As Steve rushes out of the projection room, he drops his keys. Jeff unlocks Steve's desk compartment, discovering that there are no "higher-ups": the prison is run by Abnesti Pharmaceuticals, Steve's company. The drugs were named from abingocard.
Steve and Jeff get high together on a laughing drug, as Steve also has a MobiPak installed. Steve tells Jeff that his father abandoned him as a child. Jeff confesses to Lizzy, an inmate he is close with, that he not only killed his friend in the car accident but his girlfriend as well. Lizzy hugs him and they kiss. Steve notices Jeff's feelings for Lizzy. Mark becomes doubtful of Steve's motives, and he breaks down when Jeff confronts him.
When Steve asks Jeff to administer Darkenfloxx to Lizzy, Jeff takes control of Steve's MobiPak, reveals that Mark has spiked his Mobipak with Darkenfloxx, and forces him to admit the true goal of the program: testing a compliance drug, B-6. The other drugs are merely side projects being used to put B-6 to the ultimate test: whether or not they would harm their love when commanded to. The entire time inmates had been consenting to the various tests, they had really been under the influence of the obedience drug. In addition, Steve informs Jeff that he had in fact finished his sentence seven months previously, while Lizzy's appeal for release had passed the previous week. Jeff forces Steve to open the door of the main entrance to free Lizzy and then tries to order him to hand over the pocket knife. Steve resists the order (as complying would be killing the project, "the only thing he has ever loved"), and instead takes his phone and enables all four vials of Darkenfloxx in Lizzy's MobiPak, causing her to behave hysterically and attempt suicide. The two fight for control and Jeff is able to disarm Steve, damaging his MobiPak in the process. Jeff rushes to save Lizzy, successfully removes the vials of Darkenfloxx and tells her he loves her, but Steve gets up and orders the other inmates to apprehend Jeff and Lizzy. They are able to escape from Spiderhead after overpowering some of the other inmates and locking the main door behind them. Mark and the police are now approaching the island as Steve escapes on his floatplane, but he joyously crashes into a mountain as he is now high off of his damaged MobiPak.  Meanwhile, Jeff and Lizzy take the remaining motorboat and escape.
In avoice-over, Jeff comments that no drug can bestow self-forgiveness, instead it must be worked on and chosen.

The New Yorkeris an American magazine featuring journalism, commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, satire, cartoons, and poetry. It was founded on February 21, 1925, byHarold Rossand his wifeJane Grant, a reporter forThe New York Times. Together with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann, they established the F-R Publishing Company and set up the magazine's first office inManhattan. Ross remained the editor until his death in 1951, shaping the magazine's editorial tone and standards.The New Yorker'sfact checkingoperation is legendary, intensive, and perhaps the most respected in publishing.[5]
Although its reviews and events listings often focused on thecultural life of New York City,The New Yorkergained a reputation for publishing serious essays,long-form journalism, well-regarded fiction, and humor for a national and international audience, including work by writers such asTruman Capote,Vladimir Nabokov, andAlice Munro. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries,The New Yorkeradapted to thedigital era, maintaining its traditional print operations while expanding its online presence, including making its archives available on the Internet and introducing a digital version of the magazine.David Remnickhas been the editor ofThe New Yorkersince 1998. Since 2004,The New Yorkerhas published endorsements inU.S. presidential elections.
The New Yorkeris published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. It is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers, such asView of the World from 9th Avenue,[6]its commentaries on popular culture and eccentricAmerican culture, its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion ofshort storiesand literaryreviews, its rigorousfact checkingandcopy editing,[7][8]itsinvestigative journalismand reporting on politics andsocial issues, and its single-panelcartoonsreproduced throughout each issue. According to a 2012Pew Research Centerstudy,The New Yorker, along withThe AtlanticandHarper's Magazine, ranked highest incollege-educatedreadership among major American media outlets.[9]It has won eightPulitzer Prizessince 2014, the first year magazines became eligible for the prize.[10]
The New Yorkerwas founded byHarold Ross(1892–1951) and his wifeJane Grant(1892–1972), aNew York Timesreporter, and debuted on February 21, 1925. Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine that would be different from perceivably "corny" humor publications such asJudge, where he had worked, or the oldLife. Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann (who founded the General Baking Company)[11]to establish the F-R Publishing Company. The magazine's first offices were at 25 West 45th Street inManhattan. Ross edited the magazine until his death in 1951. During the early, occasionally precarious years of its existence, the magazine prided itself on its cosmopolitan sophistication. Ross declared in a 1925 prospectus for the magazine: "It has announced that it is not edited for the old lady inDubuque".[12]
Although the magazine never lost its touches of humor, it soon established itself as a preeminent forum for serious fiction, essays and journalism. Shortly after the end ofWorld War II,John Hersey's essayHiroshimafilled an entire issue. The magazine has published short stories by many of the most respected writers of the 20th and 21st centuries, includingAnn Beattie,Sally Benson,Maeve Brennan,Truman Capote,Rachel Carson,John Cheever,Roald Dahl,Mavis Gallant,Geoffrey Hellman,Ernest Hemingway,Stephen King,Ruth McKenney,John McNulty,Joseph Mitchell,Lorrie Moore,Alice Munro,Haruki Murakami,Vladimir Nabokov,John O'Hara,Dorothy Parker,S.J. Perelman,Philip Roth,George Saunders,J. D. Salinger,Irwin Shaw,James Thurber,John Updike,Eudora Welty, andE. B. White. Publication ofShirley Jackson's "The Lottery" drew more mail than any other story in the magazine's history.[13]In its early decades, the magazine sometimes published two or even three short stories in an issue, but in later years the pace has remained steady at one story per issue.[citation needed]
The nonfiction feature articles (usually the bulk of an issue) cover an eclectic array of topics. Subjects have included eccentric evangelistCreflo Dollar,[14]the different ways in which humans perceive the passage of time,[15]andMünchausen syndrome by proxy.[16]
The magazine is known for its editorial traditions. Under the rubricProfiles, it has published articles about prominent people such asErnest Hemingway,Henry R. Luce,Marlon Brando, Hollywood restaurateurMichael Romanoff, magicianRicky Jay, and mathematiciansDavid and Gregory Chudnovsky. Other enduring features have been "Goings on About Town", a listing of cultural and entertainment events in New York, and "The Talk of the Town", afeuilletonor miscellany of brief pieces—frequently humorous, whimsical, or eccentric vignettes of life in New York—in a breezily light style, although latterly the section often begins with a serious commentary. For many years, newspaper snippets containing amusing errors, unintended meanings or badly mixed metaphors ("Block That Metaphor") have been used as filler items, accompanied by a witty retort. There is no masthead listing the editors and staff. Despite some changes, the magazine has kept much of its traditional appearance over the decades in typography, layout, covers, and artwork. The magazine was acquired byAdvance Publications, the media company owned bySamuel Irving Newhouse Jr, in 1985,[17]for $200 million when it was earning less than $6 million a year.[18]
Ross was succeeded as editor byWilliam Shawn(1951–1987), followed byRobert Gottlieb(1987–1992) andTina Brown(1992–1998). The current editor ofThe New YorkerisDavid Remnick, who succeeded Brown in July 1998.[19]
Among the important nonfiction authors who began writing for the magazine during Shawn's editorship wereDwight Macdonald,Kenneth Tynan, andHannah Arendt, whoseEichmann in Jerusalemreportage appeared in the magazine,[20]before it was published as a book.[21]
Brown's tenure attracted more controversy than Gottlieb's or even Shawn's, due to her high profile (Shawn, by contrast, had been an extremely shy, introverted figure), and to the changes she made to a magazine with a similar look for the previous half-century. She introduced color to the editorial pages (several years beforeThe New York Times) and included photography, with less type on each page and a generally more modern layout. More substantively, she increased the coverage of current events and topics such as celebrities and business tycoons, and placed short pieces throughout "Goings on About Town", including a racy column about nightlife in Manhattan. A letters-to-the-editor page was introduced, and authors' bylines were added to their "Talk of the Town" pieces.[citation needed]
Since the late 1990s,The New Yorkerhas used the Internet to publish current and archived material, and maintains a website with some content from the current issue (plus exclusive web-only content). Subscribers have access to the full current issue online and a complete archive of back issues viewable as they were originally printed. In addition,The New Yorker's cartoons are available for purchase online. A digital archive of back issues from 1925 to April 2008 (representing more than 4,000 issues and half a million pages) was also issued on DVD-ROMs and on a small portable hard drive. More recently, an iPad version of the current issue has been released.[citation needed]In 2014,The New Yorkeropened up online access to its archive, expanded its plans to run an ambitious website, and launched a paywalled subscription model. Web editorNicholas Thompsonsaid, "What we're trying to do is to make a website that is to the Internet what the magazine is to all other magazines".[22]
The magazine's editorial staff unionized in 2018 andThe New Yorker Unionsigned its firstcollective bargaining agreementin 2021.[23]
The New Yorkerinfluenced a number of similar magazines, includingThe Brooklynite(1926 to 1930),The Chicagoan(1926 to 1935), and Paris'sThe Boulevardier(1927 to 1932).[24][25][26]
Kurt Vonnegutsaid thatThe New Yorkerhas been an effective instrument for getting a large audience to appreciate modern literature.[27]Tom Wolfewrote of the magazine: "TheNew Yorkerstyle was one of leisurely meandering understatement, droll when in the humorous mode, tautological andlitoticalwhen in the serious mode, constantly amplified, qualified, adumbrated upon, nuanced and renuanced, until the magazine's pale-gray pages became High Baroque triumphs of the relative clause andappositorymodifier".[28]
Joseph Rosenblum, reviewingBen Yagoda'sAbout Town, a history of the magazine from 1925 to 1985, wrote, "The New Yorkerdid create its own universe. As one longtime reader wrote to Yagoda, this was a place 'wherePeter DeVries... [sic] was forever lifting a glass ofPiesporter, whereNiccolò Tucci(in a plum velvet dinner jacket) flirted in Italian withMuriel Spark, where Nabokov sipped tawnyportfrom a prismatic goblet (while aRed Admirableperched on his pinky), and where John Updike tripped over the master's Swiss shoes, excusing himself charmingly'".[29]
New Yorkerarticles have been regular sources for motion pictures. Both fiction and nonfiction pieces have been adapted for the big screen, including the unreleasedCoyote vs. Acme, based onIan Frazier's article of the same name;Spiderhead(2022), based on George Saunders's storyEscape from Spiderhead;Flash of Genius(2008), based on a true account of the invention of the intermittent windshield wiper byJohn Seabrook;Away from Her, adapted from Alice Munro's short story "The Bear Came over the Mountain", which debuted at the 2007Sundance Film Festival;The Namesake(2007), similarly based onJhumpa Lahiri's novel, which originated as a short story in the magazine;The Bridge(2006), based onTad Friend's 2003 nonfiction piece "Jumpers";Brokeback Mountain(2005), an adaptation of the short story byAnnie Proulxthat appeared in the October 13, 1997, issue;Jonathan Safran Foer's 2001 debut inThe New Yorker, which later came to theaters inLiev Schreiber's debut as both screenwriter and director,Everything Is Illuminated(2005);Michael Cunningham'sThe Hours, which appeared inThe New Yorkerbefore becoming the film that garnered the 2002 Best Actress Academy Award forNicole Kidman;Adaptation(2002), whichCharlie Kaufmanbased onSusan Orlean'sThe Orchid Thief, written forThe New Yorker; Frank McCourt'sAngela's Ashes(1999), which also appeared, in part, inThe New Yorkerbefore its film adaptation was released in 1999;The Addams Family(1991) and its sequel,Addams Family Values(1993), both inspired by the work ofNew YorkercartoonistCharles Addams;Brian De Palma'sCasualties of War(1989), which began as aNew Yorkerarticle by Daniel Lang;Boys Don't Cry(1999), starring Hilary Swank, which began as an article in the magazine;Iris(2001), about the life of Iris Murdoch and John Bayley, the article written by Bayley forThe New Yorkerbefore he completed his full memoir, the film starring Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent;The Swimmer(1968), starringBurt Lancaster, based on a John Cheever short story fromThe New Yorker;In Cold Blood(1967), the widely nominated adaptation of the 1965 nonfiction serial written forThe New YorkerbyTruman Capote;Pal Joey(1957), based on a series of stories by John O'Hara;Mister 880(1950), starringEdmund Gwenn, based on a story by longtime editorSt. Clair McKelway;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty(1947), which began as a story by longtimeNew Yorkercontributor James Thurber; andJunior Miss(1941) andMeet Me in St. Louis(1944), both adapted fromSally Benson's short stories.[citation needed]
In its November 1, 2004, issue, the magazine endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, choosing Democratic nomineeJohn Kerryover incumbent RepublicanGeorge W. Bush.[30]
The New Yorkerhas featured cartoons (usuallygag cartoons) since it began publication in 1925. For years, its cartoon editor wasLee Lorenz, who first began cartooning in 1956 and became aNew Yorkercontract contributor in 1958.[37]After serving as the magazine's art editor from 1973 to 1993 (when he was replaced byFrançoise Mouly), he continued in the position of cartoon editor until 1998. His bookThe Art of the New Yorker: 1925–1995(Knopf, 1995) was the first comprehensive survey of all aspects of the magazine's graphics. In 1998,Robert Mankofftook over as cartoon editor and edited at least 14 collections ofNew Yorkercartoons. Mankoff also usually contributed a short article to each book, describing some aspect of the cartooning process or the methods used to select cartoons for the magazine. He left the magazine in 2017.[38]
The New Yorker's stable of cartoonists has included many important talents in American humor, includingCharles Addams,Peter Arno,Charles Barsotti,George Booth,Roz Chast,Tom Cheney,Sam Cobean,Leo Cullum,Richard Decker,Pia Guerra,J. B. Handelsman,Helen E. Hokinson,Pete Holmes,Ed Koren,Reginald Marsh,Mary Petty,George Price,Charles Saxon,Burr Shafer,Otto Soglow,William Steig,Saul Steinberg,James Stevenson,James Thurber, andGahan Wilson.
Many earlyNew Yorkercartoonists did not caption their cartoons. In his bookThe Years with Ross, Thurber describes the newspaper's weekly art meeting, where cartoons submitted over the previous week were brought up from the mail room to be looked over by Ross, the editorial department, and a number of staff writers. Cartoons were often rejected or sent back to artists with requested amendments, while others were accepted and captions were written for them. Some artists hired their own writers; Hokinson hired James Reid Parker in 1931.Brendan Gillrelates in his bookHere at The New Yorkerthat at one point in the early 1940s, the quality of the artwork submitted to the magazine seemed to improve. It later was found out that the office boy (a teenagedTruman Capote) had been acting as a volunteer art editor, dropping pieces he did not like down the far end of his desk.[39]
Several of the magazine's cartoons have reached a higher plateau of fame. One 1928 cartoon drawn byCarl Roseand captioned byE. B. Whiteshows a mother telling her daughter, "It's broccoli, dear". The daughter responds, "I say it's spinach and I say the hell with it". The phrase "I say it's spinach" entered the vernacular, and three years later, the Broadway musicalFace the MusicincludedIrving Berlin's song "I Say It's Spinach (And the Hell with It)".[40]Thecatchphrase"back to the drawing board" originated with the 1941 Peter Arno cartoon showing an engineer walking away from a crashed plane, saying, "Well, back to the old drawing board".[41][42]
The most reprinted isPeter Steiner's 1993 drawing of two dogs at a computer, with one saying, "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog". According to Mankoff, Steiner and the magazine have split more than $100,000 in fees paid for the licensing and reprinting of this single cartoon, with more than half going to Steiner.[43][44]
Over seven decades, many hardcover compilations ofNew Yorkercartoons have been published, and in 2004, Mankoff editedThe Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker, a 656-page collection with 2,004 of the magazine's best cartoons published during 80 years, plus a double CD set with all 68,647 cartoons ever published in the magazine. This features a search function allowing readers to search for cartoons by cartoonist's name or year of publication. The newer group of cartoonists in recent years includesPat Byrnes,J. C. Duffy,Liana Finck,Emily Flake,Robert Leighton,Michael Maslin,Julia Suits, andP. C. Vey. Will McPhail cited his beginnings as "just ripping offCalvin and Hobbes,Bill Watterson, and doing little dot eyes".[45]The notion that someNew Yorkercartoons have punchlines so oblique as to be impenetrable became a subplot in theSeinfeldepisode "The Cartoon",[46]as well as a playful jab inThe Simpsonsepisode "The Sweetest Apu".[citation needed]
In April 2005, the magazine began using the last page of each issue for "The New Yorker CartoonCaption Contest". Captionless cartoons byThe New Yorker's regular cartoonists are printed each week. Captions are submitted by readers, and three are chosen as finalists. Readers then vote on the winner. Anyone age 13 or older can enter or vote. Each contest winner receives a print of the cartoon (with the winning caption) signed by the artist who drew the cartoon.[47]In 2017, afterBob Mankoffleft the magazine,Emma Allenbecame the youngest and first female cartoon editor in the magazine's history.[48]
Since 1993, the magazine has published occasional stories ofcomics journalism(alternately called "sketchbook reports")[49]by such cartoonists asMarisa Acocella Marchetto,Barry Blitt,Sue Coe,Robert CrumbandAline Kominsky-Crumb,Jules Feiffer,Ben Katchor,Carol Lay,Gary Panter,Art Spiegelman,Mark Alan Stamaty, andRonald Wimberly.[50]
In April 2018,The New Yorkerlaunched a crossword puzzle series with a weekday crossword published every Monday. Subsequently, it launched a second, weekend crossword that appears on Fridays and relaunched cryptic puzzles that were run in the magazine in the late 1990s. In June 2021, it began publishing new cryptics weekly.[51]In July 2021,The New Yorkerintroduced Name Drop, a trivia game, which is posted online weekdays.[52]In March 2022,The New Yorkermoved to publishing online crosswords every weekday, with decreasing difficulty Monday through Thursday and themed puzzles on Fridays.[53]The puzzles are written by a rotating stable of 13 constructors. They integrate cartoons into the solving experience. The Christmas 2019 issue featured a crossword puzzle byPatrick Berrythat had cartoons as clues, with the answers being captions for the cartoons. In December 2019, Liz Maynes-Aminzade was namedThe New Yorker'sfirst puzzles and games editor.[citation needed]
The magazine's first cover illustration, adandypeering at a butterfly through amonocle, was drawn byRea Irvin, the magazine's first art editor, based on an 1834 caricature of theCount d'Orsaythat appeared as an illustration in the 11th edition of theEncyclopædia Britannica.[54]The gentleman on the original cover, now known as Eustace Tilley, is a character created forThe New YorkerbyCorey Ford. The hero of a series titled "The Making of a Magazine", which began on the inside front cover of the August 8 issue that first summer, Tilley was a younger man than the figure on the original cover. Histop hatwas of a newer style, without the curved brim. He wore amorning coatand stripedformal trousers. Ford borrowed Eustace Tilley's last name from an aunt—he had always found it vaguely humorous. "Eustace" was selected by Ford foreuphony.[55]
The character has become a kind of mascot forThe New Yorker, frequently appearing in its pages and on promotional materials. Traditionally, Irvin's original Tilley cover illustration is used every year on the issue closest to the anniversary date of February 21, though on several occasions a newly drawn variation has been substituted.[56]
The magazine is known for its illustrated and often topical covers.
Saul Steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and illustrations for the magazine. His most famous work is probably its March 29, 1976, cover,[57]an illustration most often called "View of the World from9th Avenue" and sometimes called "A Parochial New Yorker's View of the World" or "A New Yorker's View of the World", which depicts a map of the world as seen by self-absorbed New Yorkers.
The illustration is split in two, with the bottom half of the image showing Manhattan's 9th Avenue, 10th Avenue, and theHudson River(appropriately labeled), and the top half depicting the rest of the world. The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a square, with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing "Jersey", the names of five cities (Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.;Las Vegas;Kansas City; and Chicago) and three states (Texas,Utah, andNebraska) scattered among a few rocks for the U.S. beyond New Jersey. The Pacific Ocean, perhaps half again as wide as the Hudson, separates the U.S. from three flattened land masses labeled China, Japan and Russia.
The illustration—humorously depicting New Yorkers' self-image of their place in the world, or perhaps outsiders' view of New Yorkers' self-image—inspired many similar works, including the poster for the 1984 filmMoscow on the Hudson; that movie poster led to a lawsuit,Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 663 F. Supp. 706 (S.D.N.Y.1987), which held thatColumbia Picturesviolated thecopyrightthat Steinberg held on his work.
The cover was later satirized byBarry Blittfor the cover ofThe New Yorkeron October 6, 2008. The cover featuredSarah Palinlooking out of her window seeing only Alaska, with Russia in the far background.[58]
The March 21, 2009, cover ofThe Economist, "How China sees the World", is also an homage to the original image, depicting the viewpoint from Beijing'sChang'an Avenueinstead of Manhattan.[59]
Hired by Tina Brown in 1992,Art Spiegelmanworked forThe New Yorkerfor ten years but resigned a few months after theSeptember 11 terrorist attacks. The cover created by Spiegelman and Françoise Mouly for the September 24, 2001, issue ofThe New Yorkerreceived wide acclaim and was voted as being among the top ten magazine covers of the past 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors, which commented:
New YorkerCovers Editor Françoise Mouly repositioned Art Spiegelman's silhouettes, inspired byAd Reinhardt's black-on-black paintings, so that the North Tower's antenna breaks the "W" of the magazine's logo. Spiegelman wanted to see the emptiness, and find the awful/awe-filled image of all that disappeared on 9/11. The silhouetted Twin Towers were printed in a fifth, black ink, on a field of black made up of the standard four color printing inks. An overprinted clear varnish helps create the ghost images that linger, insisting on their presence through the blackness.
At first glance, the cover appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of theWorld Trade Centertowers in a slightly darker shade of black. In some situations, the ghost images become visible only when the magazine is tilted toward a light source.[60]In September 2004, Spiegelman reprised the image on the cover of his bookIn the Shadow of No Towers, in which he relates his experience of the Twin Towers attack and its psychological aftereffects.
In the December 2001 issue, the magazine printed a cover byMaira KalmanandRick Meyerowitzshowing a map of New York in which various neighborhoods were labeled with humorous names reminiscent of Middle Eastern and Central Asian place names and referencing the neighborhood's real name or characteristics (e.g., "Fuhgeddabouditstan", "Botoxia"). The cover had some cultural resonance in the wake of September 11, and became a popular print and poster.[61][62]
For the 1993Valentine's Dayissue, the magazine cover byArt Spiegelmandepicted a black woman and aHasidic Jewishman kissing, referencing theCrown Heights riotof 1991.[63][64]The cover was criticized by both black and Jewish observers.[65]Jack Salzman andCornel Westcalled the reaction to the cover the magazine's "first national controversy".[66]
"The Politics of Fear", a cartoon byBarry Blittfeatured on the cover of the July 21, 2008, issue, depicts then presumptive DemocraticpresidentialnomineeBarack Obamain theturbanandshalwar kameeztypical of manyMuslims,fist bumpingwith his wife,Michelle, portrayed with anAfroand wearingcamouflagetrousers with anassault rifleslung over her back. They are standing in theOval Office, with a portrait ofOsama bin Ladenhanging on the wall and an Americanflag burningin the fireplace in the background.[67]
ManyNew Yorkerreaders saw the image as a lampoon of "The Politics of Fear", as was its title. Some Obama supporters, as well as his presumptive Republican opponent,John McCain, accused the magazine of publishing an incendiary cartoon whose irony could be lost on some readers. Editor David Remnick felt the image's obvious excesses rebuffed the concern that it could be misunderstood, even by those unfamiliar with the magazine.[68][69]"The intent of the cover", he said, "is to satirize the vicious and racist attacks and rumors and misconceptions about the Obamas that have been floating around in theblogosphereand are reflected in public opinion polls. What we set out to do was to throw all these images together, which are all over the top and to shine a kind of harsh light on them, to satirize them."[70]
In an interview onLarry King Liveshortly after the magazine issue began circulating, Obama said, "Well, I know it wasThe New Yorker's attempt at satire... I don't think they were entirely successful with it". Obama also pointed to his own efforts to debunk the allegations the cover depicted through a website his campaign set up, saying that the allegations were "actually an insult against Muslim-Americans".[71][72]
Later that week,The Daily Show'sJon StewartcontinuedThe New Yorkercover's argument about Obama stereotypes with a piece showcasing a montage of clips containing such stereotypes culled from various legitimate news sources.[73]Stewart andStephen ColbertparodiedThe New Yorker'sObama cover on the October 3, 2008, cover ofEntertainment Weeklymagazine, with Stewart as Barack and Colbert as Michelle, photographed for the magazine in New York City on September 18.[74]
New Yorkercovers are sometimes unrelated to the contents of the magazine or only tangentially related. The article about Obama in the July 21, 2008, issue did not discuss the attacks and rumors but rather Obama's political career. The magazine later endorsed Obama for president.
This parody was most likely inspired byFox NewshostE. D. Hill's paraphrasing of an anonymous internet comment in asking whether a gesture made by Obama and his wife Michelle was a "terrorist fist jab".[75][76]Later, Hill's contract was not renewed.[77]
The New Yorkerchose an image ofBert and Ernieby artist Jack Hunter, titled "Moment of Joy", as the cover of the July 8, 2013, issue, which covered the Supreme Court decisions on theDefense of Marriage ActandCalifornia Proposition 8.[78]TheSesame Streetcharacters have long been rumored in urban legend to be homosexual partners, thoughSesame Workshophas repeatedly denied this, saying they are merely "puppets" and have no sexual orientation.[79]Reaction was mixed. Online magazineSlatecriticized the cover, which shows Ernie leaning on Bert's shoulder as they watch a television with the Supreme Court justices on the screen, saying, "it's a terrible way to commemorate a major civil-rights victory for gay and lesbian couples".The Huffington Post, meanwhile, said it was "one of [the magazine's] most awesome covers of all time".[80]
The cover of the October 2, 2023, issue, titled "The Race for Office", depicts several top U.S. politicians—Donald Trump,Mitch McConnell,Nancy Pelosi, andJoe Biden—running the titular race for office with walkers. Many have questioned the mental and physical states of these and other older politicians, particularly those who have decided to run for reelection.[81][82][83][84]While many acknowledged the cover as satirizing this issue, others criticized the "ableism and ageism" of mocking older people and people who use walkers.[85][86]The New Yorkersaid the cover "portrays the irony and absurdity of the advanced-age politicians currently vying for our top offices".[87]
The New Yorker's signature display typeface, used for its nameplate and headlines and the masthead above "The Talk of the Town" section, is Irvin, named after its creator, the designer-illustratorRea Irvin.[88]The body text of all articles inThe New Yorkeris set inAdobe Caslon.[89]
One uncommonly formal feature of the magazine's in-housestyleis the placement ofdiaeresis marksin words with repeatingvowels—such asreëlected,preëminent, andcoöperate—in which the two vowel letters indicate separate vowel sounds.[90]The magazine also continues to use a few spellings that are otherwise little used in American English, such asfuelled,focussed,venders,teen-ager,[91]traveller,marvellous,carrousel,[92]andcannister.[93]
The magazine also spells out the names of numerical amounts, such as "two million three hundred thousand dollars" instead of "$2.3 million", even for very large figures.[94]
In 1927,The New Yorkerran an article aboutEdna St. Vincent Millaythat contained multiple factual errors, and her mother threatened to sue the publication for libel.[95]Consequently, the magazine developed extensivefact-checkingprocedures, which became integral to its reputation as early as the 1940s.[96]In 2019, theColumbia Journalism Reviewsaid that "no publication has been more consistently identified with its rigorous fact-checking".[95]As of 2025, about 30 people work in the fact-checking department.[97]
At least two defamation lawsuits have been filed over articles published in the magazine, though neither were won by the plaintiff. Two 1983 articles byJanet MalcolmaboutSigmund Freud's legacy led to a lawsuit from writerJeffrey Moussaieff Masson, who claimed that Malcolm had fabricated quotes attributed to him.[98]After years of proceedings and appeals, a jury found in Malcolm's favor in 1994.[99]In 2010,David Grannwrote an article for the magazine about art expertPeter Paul Birothat scrutinized and expressed skepticism about Biro's stated methods to identify forgeries.[100]Biro suedThe New Yorkerfor defamation, alongside multiple other news outlets that reported on the article, but the case was summarily dismissed.[100][101][102][103]
The New Yorkeris read nationwide, with 53% of its circulation in the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas.
According to a 2005 survey-based estimate of magazine audiences by MediaMark Research, the average age of aNew Yorkerreader was 48.4 years, and their average annual household income was $80,957.[104]The same organization's 2009 estimate was that the average reader was 47.8 years old and their household earned $91,359.[105](In the same periods, United States adults had average household incomes of $51,466[104]and $58,898[105]respectively.)
Politically, the magazine's readership holds generallyliberalviews. According to a 2014Pew Research Centersurvey, 77% ofThe New Yorker's readers have left-of-center political values, and 52% of them hold "consistently liberal" political values.[106]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
