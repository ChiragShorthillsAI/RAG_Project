Sergeant First ClassJames Harper, a decoratedGreen Beret, is involuntarily discharged from the Army due to his use of illegal steroids to treat a debilitating knee injury. Facing financial ruin, he contacts his friend Mike who works with aprivate military companyunder the command of fellow veteran Rusty Jennings.
Harper is receiving lucrative offers from similar firms, but feels a sense of duty to his country. Mike tells him that Rusty runs clandestine operations for theDepartment of Defense. Harper agrees to meet Rusty after seeing Mike's opulent house. Harper signs on with Rusty and the team for an operation in Germany. As a sign of good faith, Rusty gives Harper's family $50,000 to help clear their debts.
Harper spends most of his tour surveilling a Middle Eastern scientist named Salim. After analyzing the data, Rusty informs the team that Salim is working forAl-Qaedaand developing a bio-agent to be used against America. He tells the team they have been given permission to raid Salim's laboratory and retrieve all of his research data and then dispose of Salim. The team easily accesses the lab and acquires the data. Mike orders Harper to finish Salim, who protests that he is just a scientist working on a cure. Harper follows orders and then departs after setting the lab on fire, carrying Salim's laptop containing the research data. The team are confronted by the police and after a prolonged shoot-out, during which the remaining team members are killed, Harper rescues a wounded Mike and they hide in a nearby storm drain.
Mike, believing he is about to die, begs Harper to look after his family and get the data to Rusty. Harper provides a blood transfusion and saves Mike's life. After recuperating, Mike is ready to return to Rusty and the main team, but Harper's knee has given out on him, and he needs to rest up. Mike proceeds alone with Salim's laptop but informs Harper he will be picked up from a specific location after he is sufficiently rested.
Harper makes it to the hotel and finds fresh clothes and a note from Mike saying that he went to hand off the laptop. He tries to treat his injured knee and waits for Mike to return. When Mike doesn't come back Harper leaves the hotel, gets aburner phone, and makes contact with Rusty, who informs him there is a car waiting to exfiltrate him to safety, but Harper senses something is amiss when Rusty tells him that Mike never made it to Berlin. As he delays going to the car, a hit team emerges and they shoot at Harper. Harper evades capture and manages to kill the hit team, who are revealed to be formerRecon Marinesworking for Rusty. Before dying, one of the Marines gives Harper intel on a safe house but advises him that he can never return home.
Harper visits Salim's home, threatening Sylvie, Salim's wife, into providing him with Salim's computer files. Sylvie gives Harper her husband's iPad, and he leaves for the safe house. After Harper meets Virgil, he is tranquilized and awakens in the safe house. Virgil explains that Harper's knee was infected, and that while it has been treated, Harper still cannot return to his family. Harper plays a video on the iPad in which Salim explains that he was indeed working on a successfulH5N1 vaccineformula that he intends to provide for free, rather than sell to a pharmaceutical company. While Virgil shares dinner with Harper, another of Rusty's fire teams attacks. Virgil is killed, but Harper escapes, setting off a booby trap for Rusty's team.
Harper returns to the United States. He tracks down Mike, who explains that Rusty also lied to him and told him Harper had died. Rusty has provided for Harper's family, and Mike advises Harper to disappear; Harper protests.  Winning his old friend over, they set-up a plan to get revenge on Rusty.
Mike gets Harper into Rusty's compound, where they surprise Rusty's guards. While Mike distracts everyone with a frontal attack, Harper infiltrates Rusty's house. Harper manages to terminate Rusty but not before Rusty has mortally wounded Mike. Mike shares his last moments with his best friend before succumbing to his wounds and Harper burns his body with his car. Harper is finally able to return to his family after all of these adventures.

In December 2021,Jahm Najafiannounced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1]
In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014 (the "S" standing for Simonds, the company's founder; the "T" standing forTPG Growth, whose managing partner McGlashan helped launch the company; and the "X" standing for "secret project"),[2]with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[3][4]Investors in the company includedHony Capital,Tencent,PCCW, TPG Growth,RTL GroupandLiberty Global. Individual investors includeGigi Pritzker,Beau Wrigley, andDominic Ng.[5][6][7]
In September 2017, it was reported that STX was considering aninitial public offeringon theHong Kong Stock Exchange(SEHK). It was reported that a listing on the SEHK could bring STX closer to Chinese investors and audiences.[8]TheWall Street Journalstated that the company could be valued at $3.5 billion, after raising an additional $500 million following the IPO.[8][9]In April 2018, the company filed for an IPO on theHong Kong Stock Exchange.[10]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
