David Stem andDavid N. Weiss. Co-produced byWalt Disney Pictures,Josephson Entertainment, andRight Coast Productions, it is the sequel to the 2007 filmEnchanted.

Adams also served as a producer of the film alongsideBarry JosephsonandBarry Sonnenfeld.
Talks of anEnchantedsequel began in early 2010, but the project languished indevelopment hellfor several years. By 2017, it was announced Adams had signed on to reprise her role and filming was set to begin that summer, but it never came to fruition. The film was officially announced in December 2020, with the cast joining in spring 2021 and filming taking place in Ireland between May and July that year.
Disenchantedpremiered at theEl Capitan Theatrein Los Angeles on November 16, 2022, and was released in the United States viaDisney+on November 18. Unlike its predecessor, the film received generally mixed reviews from critics, who mostly praised Adams's performance but felt it lacked the charm of the original.
10 years afterthe first film,Giselle, Robert, and Morgan Philip are living happily together with their baby Sofia. However, life inManhattanis starting to drag on them, so Giselle plans to move the family to the suburban town of Monroeville. The moving brings poor first experiences for them: their new house needs renovations, Robert has to commute to continue his job, and Morgan feels like an outcast at her new school.
King Edward and Queen Nancy visit from Andalasia via a well from the house's backyard. As Sofia's godparents, they present her with a wish-granting wand. Giselle meets Malvina Monroe, the arrogant head of the town council, and learns that she is hosting a fairy tale-themed ball where Malvina's son Tyson is the ball's elected prince. To help Morgan fit in, Giselle tries to get her elected as the ball's princess but ends up unintentionally embarrassing her, resulting in a falling out between them.
After consulting with her chipmunk friend Pip, Giselle decides to use the wand to wish her family's life to be a "perfect fairy tale". By the next day, the town has transformed into a fantasy kingdom called Monrolasia. Morgan is happy with their new life, and Robert believes himself to be a brave adventurer. Malvina is now the town's evil queen with magical powers. Giselle also discovers uncharacteristically haughty behavior and finds pleasure in mistreating Morgan. Realizing she is slowly turning into a wicked stepmother, she asks for help from the magic wand's instruction scroll. The scroll reveals Giselle's wish is using up Andalasia's magic to change the real world into a fairy tale and that it will become permanent after midnight.
Malvina learns about the magic wand and enlists her two servants Rosaleen and Ruby to steal it. However, the scroll tells her that the wand can only be used by a "true Andalasian". Giselle realizes that without the wand, she will lose herself to her wicked side, so she convinces Morgan to save them before sending her to Andalasia through the well.
There, Morgan learns that the kingdom's magic is transported to Monrolasia through a vortex and once the spell becomes permanent, Andalasia will be gone forever. Nancy and Edward suggest she use the magic of their memories to remind Giselle of her true self. Morgan lets the magic imbue itself onto her childhood drawing of their family tree with pictures of their shared memories, then heads back to the real world with Nancy.
Now under the influence of her evil personality, Giselle challenges Malvina for the royal title of Monrolasia. She sends Pip, who has been turned into a tabby cat, to steal back the wand while also sending Robert on an assumed futile search for Morgan. At the ball, Giselle and Malvina engage in a magic duel with the former easily overpowering the latter due to possessing the wand. Morgan and Nancy meet up with Robert and Tyson before rushing into the town hall to stop the duel. Morgan tosses her drawing to Giselle who rips it, but the magic within brings the memories to life, restoring Giselle to normal.
Not wanting the spell to be broken, Malvina takes Morgan hostage and demands the wand in exchange which Giselle surrenders. As midnight approaches, everything from Andalasia begins to disappear including Giselle herself. While Robert and Tyson head to the top of the clock tower to delay the final chime, Giselle tells Morgan that by being her daughter, she is a true Andalasian, therefore capable of using the wand. Morgan wishes she were home with her mother just as Malvina attempts to make the clock tower chime before it is destroyed.
Morgan awakens in their house and finds everything normal again. Only she and Giselle are aware of the events, while everyone else believes it to be a dream. Giselle apologizes to Malvina for stepping over her plans and Malvina allows her to join the town council. Some time later, Robert has started his own practice in Monroeville, Morgan and Tyson have started dating, and Nancy and Edward arrive for another visit to the Philips in their now happy life.

On January 12, 2011, composerAlan Menkenwas asked about the sequel in an interview, to which he replied:[23]
"I've heard things but there's nothing yet. I don't know much about what's happening with that. Honestly, I don't know what the studio wants to do next. I presume there will be some future projects for me to work on. I love doing that, I really do. But I'm not frustrated that it isn't one of them. At the moment I have a lot of stage things happening and I'm busy enough with that, so I really don't need more on my plate."
Later that year, on March 28, 2011,James Marsden, who played Prince Edward inEnchanted, was asked about the sequel.[24]
"I don't know. I think that the clock is ticking on that one.Amy Adamsand I are both saying, 'If there's going to be a sequel, we're not getting any younger.' Since we play sort of ageless animated characters. Hopefully we do. That was something really special and I'd love to come back and do another. I've heard the same things you've heard. There's a script out there somewhere and there's talk of it, but I never believe it until I see the script and learn we're making that film. So I don't know. Too many eggs in that basket."
By July 2014, Disney had hired screenwriters J. David Stem andDavid N. Weissto write a script for a sequel and also hired Fletcher to direct the film.[25]In October 2016,The Hollywood Reporterannounced thatAdam Shankman, who is a good friend of Fletcher, entered negotiations to direct the sequel, titledDisenchanted; that Amy Adams would reprise her role; and that filming was scheduled to begin in summer 2017.[26][27]In January 2018, Shankman stated that the sequel's script would be finished within a couple of weeks and the next step would be to get the music written.[28]He also went on to say that the film would feature more songs than the original but the same amount of animation.[28]

Amy Nicholson ofThe New York Times, gave the film a negative review, writing: "In execution, “Disenchanted” feels more like a photo hunt where you earn points for spotting the onscreen Disney references."[72]Owen GleibermanofVariety, also gave the film a negative review, writing: "Giselle turns into a wicked stepmother, which only makes us miss the comedy of her niceness."[73]John Nugent ofEmpire Magazine, gave the film three stars out of four, writing: "If you liked Enchanted, this is a dependably familiar serving. In an era where Disney is constantly raiding its archives for intellectual property to remake, this is a sequel that feels unusually original by comparison."[74]
Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardian, also gave the film three stars out of four, writing: "A follow-up to 2007’s charming fish-out-of-water musical fantasy can’t quite recapture the magic."[75]Marya E. Gates ofRogerEbert.com, gave the film two stars out of four, writing: "'Disenchanted fails to truly rekindle the magic or the biting wit of its predecessor. Like most things stamped Disney these days, the film feels just like the mass-produced bobbles for sale at the Disney store."[76]Lovia Gyarke ofThe Hollywood Reporter, gave the film a negative review, writing: "When Disenchanted isn’t trying to create a portrait of suburbia or examining its protagonist, it becomes a predictably plotted and humdrum battle to restore order."[77]Jessie Thompson ofThe Independent, also gave the film two stars out of four, writing: "The follow-up to 2007 sleeper hit ‘Enchanted’, starring Amy Adams, abandons everything that made the first film work so well."[78]Erik Kain ofForbes, also gave the film a negative review, writing: "Disenchanted is a little bit less than Enchanted in just about every way imaginable."[79]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle.

Menzel sang "Let it Go" at the86th Academy Awardsin March 2014, where the song eventually won theAcademy Award for Best Original Song. While introducing her performance, actorJohn Travoltamispronounced her name as "Adele Dazeem"; the mispronunciation was widely ridiculed by fans and the media, and subsequently became a viralInternet meme.[121]Although initially thrown off by the incident,[122]Menzel was not upset about the mishap, and credits it with introducing her to a wider audience.[123][122]To promote her then-current role in Broadway'sIf/Then, the production printed satiricalplaybillsthat credited Menzel as Adele Dazeem, and referenced her previous credits inNert(Rent),Wicked-ly(Wicked), andFarfignugen(Frozen).[124][125]Shortly after the ceremony, Travolta publicly apologized to Menzel.[124]At the87th Academy Awardsthe following year, Menzel presented Best Original Song with Travolta and jokingly introduced him as "Glom Gazingo", who finally pronounced her name correctly upon joining her on stage.[126]
Although Menzel had already been well known within the Broadway community prior to working with Disney, she was not as recognized outside of her stage credits.[76]The success ofFrozen, "Let it Go", and the Oscars incident are credited with establishing Menzel as an international superstar,[76][127][128]helping bolster her film and music careers beyond musical theatre.[76][127][128]She considers Travolta mispronouncing her name to be "one of the best things that happened for my career".[122]

Following the success ofFrozen, Menzel continued to pursue more prominent roles in film and television projects. She starred as CC Bloom, a role originated by one of her idolsBette Midler,[130]inLifetime's2017 remakeof the 1988 filmBeaches.[131][132]Themelodramafollows the decades-long friendship and rivalry between a brassy singer (Menzel) and a reserved lawyer, played byNia Long.[133][134]Due to her typical avoidance ofrevivalsand fondness for the original film, Menzel was initially hesitant to star in the project, but ultimately embraced the remake as an opportunity to introduce a classic story about female friendship to a younger generation.[135]The remake was conceived around Menzel's singing career in a similar manner to how the original incorporated Midler's,[136]whose songs she covered for the film's soundtrack.[130]Premiering to mixed reviews,[75][137]several critics found the remake inferior to the original, but praised Menzel's musical contributions.[138][139]CNN's Brian Lowry said "the lure of providing Menzel an opportunity to let loose on these familiar tunes is more than enough to qualify as a win for Lifetime, even if the movie itself ... never achieves liftoff".[140]Katie Rife ofThe A.V. Club, Linda Holmes ofNPR, and MaryAnn Sleasman ofTV Guideeach found Menzel's acting adequate but lacking the conviction and humor Midler brought to the role, resulting in a less compelling version of the same character.[136][139][141]
In 2019, she starred oppositeAdam Sandlerin the crime thrillerUncut Gems, playing his character's estranged and frustrated wife Dinah Ratner.[142]The role was considered a stark departure for Menzel, who longed to be involved in a project that differed from thefamily-friendlymaterial she had become synonymous with.[143]DirectorsJosh and Benny Safdiecast her based on her performance as a similar character inSkintight, and Menzel drew upon personal experience for the role, having grown up around confident women like Dinah in New York.[143]She described Dinah as "the voice for how the audience feels as they're going through this roller-coaster ride" and avoided devolving her into merely a stereotype.[144]The film and Menzel's performance drew critical acclaim.[145][144]Writing forThe Post and Courier, Jocelyn Noveck found Menzel "compelling in the rare role that doesn't make use of her famous singing voice",[146]while Johnny Oleksinski of theNew York Postcalled her "delightfully abrasive".[147]
In 2021, Menzel co-starred alongsideCamila Cabello,Billy Porter, andJames CordeninKay Cannon'sjukebox musicaladaptationof theCinderellafairy tale, playing Cinderella's (Cabello) unkind stepmother Vivian.[148]Despite admiring actresses who had played the villainous role prior, Menzel wanted to eschew "the archetypal kind of idea of the straight-ahead evil nemesis" in order to uncover the trauma behind the character's cruel nature.[149]In addition to performing several covers for the film,[150]Menzel wrote and recorded an original song for her character entitled "Dream Girl",[151]which was shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.[152]Cinderellareceived mixed reviews,[153]but Menzel's performance was praised:IndieWire's Kristen Lopez said she played the character "deliciously",[154]whileRichard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesdescribed Menzel as "her usual spectacular self" and "arguably the most nuanced and empathetic 'evil' stepmother in 'Cinderella' history".[155]Michael Calleri of theNiagara Gazettesaid Menzel delivers the film's best performance.[156]
In 2022, Menzel reprised her role as Nancy in theEnchantedsequelDisenchanted.[157]Now the Queen of Anadalasia as Edward's (James Marsden) wife,[158]Menzel's character sings for the first time,[159][160]in addition to serving as the film's "voice of reason".[161]A pop version of Menzel's song, "Love Power", was released as thesoundtrack's lead single in November 2022.Disenchantedreceived mixed reviews; most critics appreciated hearing Menzel sing,[161][162][163]while others found her role brief and her song unmemorable.[164][165]Marya E. Gates ofRogerEbert.comcalled Menzel's performance "one of the few that manages to transcend beyond the subpar trappings of" the film, lamenting that she is "relegated to only a handful of scenes".[166]She also starred in an episode of theHGTVshowCelebrity I.O.U.with theProperty BrothersDrewandJonathan Scott.[167]In this episode, she helped the brothers renovate a garage for her friend James.[168][169]

V. Clubsaid the duo make "a wonderful (and wonderfully grumpy) couple".[175]Abhishek Srivastava ofThe Times of Indiasaid Menzel "comes across as extremely authentic and hits all the right notes".[176]
She also starred inAmerican Murdererdirected by Matthew Gentile.[177]During the ongoing time of the COVID-19 pandemic, Menzel created and launched a brand new YouTube web series for children entitledIdina's Treehouse. The series featured Menzel from her treehouse out in her Los Angeles home that originally was built for her son Walker Nathaniel Diggs. It features a full set of songs, stories, and appearances from Menzel's family and friends.[178]In 2024, alongside Chenoweth, Menzel made a cameo appearance during the "One Short Day" sequence in thefilm adaptationofWicked.[179]
Menzel possesses amezzo-sopranovocal range that spans approximately three octaves.[114][106][183][184][150]For thePittsburgh Post-Gazette, Sharon Eberson wrote that Menzel's voice "could be categorized ascoquettishto flat-outbelterand everything in between—and with a stage presence to match—she usually is labeled a mezzo-soprano. But whypigeonholesomeone so intriguingly offbeat?"[185]Eberson observed that she "interprets songs as much as an actress as a singer," believing, "therein lies her connection to the music and her fans."[185]Describing Menzel as a loud soprano similar to Broadway actressEthel Merman,Stephen HoldenofThe New York Timeswrote "The sound she creates when she belts ... is a primal cry embedded in her being that insists that we listen and pay attention."[185]Holden observed that her voice can alternate between "babyish and demanding, or it can sound grand and imperial" depending on the song choice.[186]According to Andrew Gans ofPlaybill, Menzel has "one of the most unique voices of her generation, a pliablealtothat can be sweet and girlish in its middle register and then easily soar to pop-influenced top notes way abovehigh C."[23]FrozensongwriterKristen Anderson-Lopezdescribed Menzel's voice as "a warm hug" with "this warmth and this vulnerability down low. And then, as you bring her higher and higher, she gets stronger and stronger, and more powerful. She just reaches into your soul when she's singing these big, giant songs."[105]
Menzel is known for her signature high belting style; theKennedy Centerwebsite cites Menzel as a prime example of a "Broadway Belter" who uses the technique to her advantage.[187]Theater criticCharles Isherwoodsaid the singer "has a voice that is very much her own," describing it as "totally distinctive" with "a great belt and a great range."[188]Describing Menzel's voice as "husky ... which sometimes veers toward shrieking until she effortlessly reins herself in or, amazingly, kicks it up another notch," Melissa Ruggieri ofThe Atlanta Journal-Constitutionbelieves she possesses "a superior instrument" both live and in-studio.[189]Explaining her own technique, Menzel said she avoids moving her shoulders while singing and prefers "to take a smaller breath for a bigger, longer note because there's less air that will come pummeling out."[190]She also maintains her voice by constantly steaming and practicingvocal warm ups,[188]describing her routine as "very ritualistic" and "disciplined".[191]Despite her live vocals earning consistent acclaim,[180][192]some critics have criticized Menzel's belting for sounding "screechy".[193]Schuyler Velasco ofThe Christian Science Monitorobserved that the singer "made a career out of belting notes that would fry the vocal chords of mere mortals", but felt the emotion of her performances sometimes suffers at the hands of her vocal proficiency.[65]Velasco cited her rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" atSuper Bowl XLIXas an example of Menzel sacrificing excitement and inspiration for technique, yet delivering an adequate performance nonetheless.[65]Menzel addressed such criticisms during a 2014 concert, explaining that she wishes to sing loud, proud and "from the heart" like her idols Merman and Aretha Franklin.[193]Tim Smith ofThe Baltimore Sunwrote that Menzel's "high-wattage vocal cords and intense phrasing ... [make] a mark whenever she sings."[188]Menzel admits that she finds some of her most famous songs challenging, namely songs from theFrozenfilms, which "push her to vocal extremes" and require constant warming up and sometimes lowering the key for live performances.[105]The term "powerhouse" has often been used in the media to describe Menzel's vocal ability.[194][195][196][197][198]
Menzel's vocal style has drawn comparisons to singerBarbra Streisand, whose song "Don't Rain on My Parade" she often covers, including in tribute to her at the 2008 Kennedy Center Honors.[180][199]Menzel said she had long aspired to have a career as successful as Streisand to whose Jewish upbringing Menzel has also been compared, with fans deeming her "the next big Jewish icon in music".[180]Menzel was particularly inspired by Streisand's performance in the filmA Star is Born(1976),[200]and cites singers Franklin,Billie Holiday,Etta James,Chaka KhanandSarah Vaughanamong her vocal idols.[20][201][202]Despite emulating her inspirations, Menzel claims she maintains the importance of "finding [her] own voice."[20]Some critics have dubbed Menzel "the Streisand of her generation".[181][182][203]Similar comparisons have been drawn between Menzel and singerBette Midler.[180]
Professionally trained as a classical singer from age eight, Menzel decided to pursue different genres such asR&Bandjazzonce she began high school.[204]Upon becoming a wedding singer, Menzel was eventually exposed to a wide variety of musical genres, ranging from jazz to rock andMotown,[204]and would often experiment with new arrangements of traditional songs.[191]She credits her wedding singer background with training her to improvise new vocal arrangements, which in turn helps herad-libalternative versions of songs when she is feeling unwell or her voice is tired.[191]Her set lists tend to incorporate an eclectic combination of original material and covers of popular pop, rock, musical theatre and film songs,[205]selecting an assortment of songs she expects fans want to hear and feels inspired to attempt new interpretations of.[206]Jay Handelman of theSarasota Herald-Tribuneopined that Menzel's song choices "reinforce her own offbeat personality."[205]According to Menzel, her song selections usually indicate a milestone, choosing to convey a stories and memories about her life using music.[195]Menzel often opts to perform barefoot in concert, which has become a trademark of her live performances.[193]She also enjoys conversing with audience members in-between musical performances.[182]In addition to her vocal prowess, Menzel has been noted for her charming and witty banter;[182][127]Smith described her as "a pro at delivering stage banter and as quick on the draw with one-liners as seasoned stand-up comedians."[188]On her stage presence,The Denver Postcritic Ray Mark Rinaldi wrote that Menzel delivers "the kind of self-assurance that can only come from beating out Kristin Chenoweth for a Tony. She comes out on stage, dressed like she doesn't care, acting a little dizzy, but knowing all along she's gonna hit the right notes."[207]
Menzel has become closely associated with songs about self-empowerment,[206][208]specifically herSignature Songs"Defying Gravity" and "Let it Go".[209]Discussing Disneyauthor Amy M. Davis believes Menzel's voice "has become associated with rebellion for Broadway fans."[209]However, the artist claims such themes have made her feel fraudulent at times because she herself does not always feel empowered.[20]Subsequently, she began incorporating more emotional material into her sets, such asRadiohead's "Creep".[20][206]Although Menzel co-writes most of her own material as a singer-songwriter,[151][210][211][212]she considers herself a collaborator rather than a songwriter, explaining that she prefers working with professional songwriters or producers: "They start playing some music, and I like to sing… I can sing melodies, I come up with titles and lyrical ideas, but I'm really not good at making decisions."[191]She has frequently collaborated with songwriter and producerGlen Ballard, and tends to draw upon lyrics from her personal diary and melodies from a tape recorder.[201]Menzel claims she has never completed writing a song entirely on her own, finding the process to be too stressful: "I never had a good song that I wrote, so to ... act like I'm this great songwriter, I would be just a fraud. But, I'm good at bringing myself to it—being a good collaborator in the room."[191]She citesJoni MitchellandAnnie Lennoxamong her musical influences, describing them as "singer-songwriters who had these amazing voices but also were incredible storytellers and lyricists", while expressing admiration for musiciansBono,StingandSeal.[201]The Ithacan's Preston Arment observed that "what Menzel may lack in songwriting ability, she makes up for with stunning vocals that remind us why listeners will never stop loving her."[213]AllMusicbiographer Marcy Donelson described Menzel's studio albums as a combination ofAdult Alternative,vocal, andcontemporary popmusic.[214]Menzel's fifth studio album, which she considers to be her most personal to-date, contains a combination of ballads and upbeat tracks that explore themes about home, personal loss, empowerment,[213]relationships and starting over, much of which was inspired by her divorce from Taye Diggs.[211][197]Bailey Flynn ofThe Heightsbelieves the album demonstrates several trademarks for which Menzel has become known: "power balladsthat give her huge vocal range and mind-blowing control all the chance they need to show off."[197]
Menzel described performing her own songs live as "scarier" than singing covers or songs from established shows because "You're a little bit more transparent. There's no costume or character I'm hiding behind ... yet sometimes it's more rewarding because of that", describing the feeling of hearing fans sing songs she has written herself as "incredible".[201]
Menzel has been called one of Broadway's greatest performers.[20][215][216][217][218][219]Tim Beedle ofDC.comdeclared her "arguably the most widely recognized Broadway star in the country".[220]Several media publications havenicknamedher the "Queen of Broadway" due to her success and impact on the genre.[221][222][223][224][225][226][227][228]Often described as one of the defining singing voices of her generation,[229][230]Apple Musicreferred to her as "one of the 21st century's premier vocalists".[231]Jenny Singer ofGlamourdeclared Menzel one of history's greatest musical theatre vocalists,[232]while Valerie Complex ofDeadline Hollywoodcalled her an influential performer who has "left an indelible mark on the industry".[233]TheToronto Sun's Jim Slotek dubbed her "this generation's Broadway icon".[234]In a 2020retrospective,Cleveland.com's Troy L. Smith named Menzel the best vocalist of 2013, claiming the success of that year's "Let it Go" only cemented her legacy as "one of Broadway's greatest stars of all time".[215]The previous year,BroadwayWorldrecognized Menzel as one of the decade's 10 most influential Broadway stars.[235]Time Outranked Menzel the 19th greatest female Broadway actress of all time, observing that she established a "stratospheric reputation" largely based on the popularity of only two roles:RentandWicked.[236]Vulture's Jackson McHenry attributed the popularity and endurance of "Defying Gravity" to Menzel, believing few singers can service the song as successfully as she has.[237]In 2018,NPRnamed "Let it Go" one of the 200 greatest female-performed songs of the 21st century, at number 182.[238]
Menzel's successfulcrossoverfrom stage actor to television, film, and music star have been discussed at length,[128]withRedbookdubbing her "One of [Broadway's] biggest crossover success stories".[239]Menzel's biography onStarzdescribed her as the kind of stage-to-screen star Broadway seldom produces anymore.[184]Marty Hughley ofThe Oregonianshared a similar sentiment, writing in 2012 that although Broadway does not guarantee global superstardom as often as it used to, Menzel is "a notable exception to the rule of Broadway’s declining clout".[240]Original Broadway cast recordings ofRentandIf/Then, both albums prominently featuring Menzel as a soloist, debuted within the top-20 of theBillboard 200.[110]In a 2014 article,Billboardtheorized that Menzel's crossover success "bodes well for Broadway's would-be stars", believing "Let it Go" "kicked open the door for future composers of stage and screen".[241]When Menzel returned to Broadway in 2014 shortly after the success ofFrozen, Suzy Evans ofBillboardobserved that audience reception was more akin to that of a "rock star" than a musical theatre performer.[242]Menzel's fanbase has nicknamed themselves "Fanzels".[242]In addition to her perceived authenticity, Isherwood attributes the artist's large following to the successes ofRentandWicked: "two era-defying, hugely successful Broadway musicals".[188]Toronto Startheatre criticRichard Ouzouniancredits the same two shows with solidifying her reputation as one of the industry's "most dynamic musical theatre stars".[243]She has been described as "Broadway royalty", due to a combination of her successful stage career and playing royalty in several Disney projects.[244][245]
According to Akiva Gottlieb of theLos Angeles Times, Menzel's public persona is largely defined by her performances inFrozenandWicked, and recording Christmas albums.[143]As an actress, Menzel has earned a reputation for playing misunderstood characters both on stage and in film,[151]admitting she gravitates towards complex roles.[149][246]She cited power and vulnerability as common traits among characters she has played.[247]According to theIrish Independent, Menzel has become "a go-to actress for producers looking for a feisty female lead",[248]whileThe Globe and Mail's Courtney Shea said she "forged her career playing strong and sensational females".[247]Menzel believes Broadway has always offered compelling roles for women of all ages, whereas she considers Hollywood to be more susceptible toageismandsexism.[248]Menzel is revered as arole modelfor young women, particularly due to her role as Elsa which has contributed her a large following among predominantly femaleFrozenfans.[249]Although she takes her responsibility as a role model seriously,[249]she has stated that she does not always feel like a role model in her personal life and feels uncomfortable bearing the responsibility at times.[248][250]Menzel has a prominent gay following,[251][252]dating back to the 1990s when she starred inRent.[228][253]Rentwas also one of the first Broadway shows to show a lesbian relationship.[227]The performer attributes this to playing several repressed characters who are "hiding something within them that they’re afraid to let people see, and then finally they embrace it".[253]Michael Heaton, a critic forThe Plain Dealer, noted that some parents have expressed concerns about the "blue humor" Menzel uses in her typical concerts in an attempt to appeal to both her adult gay and young fans.[252]
Diana Bunici ofEvoke.iedubbed Menzel "the voice of the new generation".[194]In 2014, Menzel was awarded "Breakthrough Artist" byBillboard.[202]In 2019, Menzel and actressKristen Bell, who plays her sister inFrozen, received neighboring stars—Menzel's was the 2682nd and Bell's was the 2681st—on theHollywood Walk of Fame.[254][255]Menzel was inducted into the live theatre category.[256]Menzel is also among the wealthiest Broadway performers, due in part to her television, film and music careers.[257]In 2022, Menzel was announced as a recipient of aDisney Legends Awardfor her outstanding contributions tothe Walt Disney Company,[258]with herD23entry reading "Whether on stage or screen, Idina Menzel’s unequivocal signature talents have shone through countless projects across her almost 30-year career".[259]In October 2024, PresidentJoe Bidenawarded Menzel with theNational Medal of Arts.[260]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
