Nash reconsidered his options and instead moved toEurope, where he played basketball professionally for various teams.[2]His career ended just one year later in 1981 in Germany (while playing for theGießen 46ers) when he tore hisanterior cruciate ligament.[16]With his basketball career over, Nash enlisted in the U.S. Army and was assigned to the202nd Military Police CompanyinGiessen,West Germany.

On September 22, Nash's partner Master Blaster Iron was replaced by "Blade".[6]
The reconstituted Master Blasters continued their undefeated streak in October. Meanwhile, Steel had his firstsingles matchon September 28 by defeatingTom Zenk.[19]AtHalloween Havocon October 27, 1990, the Blasters upendedthe Southern Boysand began to move up the WCWtag teamratings. Their winning streak ended on November 22, when Tom Zenk andBrian Pillmanhanded them their first defeat with PillmanpinningBlade. They rebounded to go on another undefeated streak by defeating the Southern Boys as well as Alan Iron Eagle and Tim Horner, and earning aNWA United States Tag Team Championshiptitle shot against then champions theSteiner Brothers, but were defeated in two occasions.[19]They weresquashedon television in 52 seconds by the Steiners in a match that aired onWorldwideon February 2, 1991. Following this loss, their momentum dissipated as they lost to the Southern Boys andRicky MortonandTommy Rich, and they disbanded at the end of the month.

His final match in this guise was against Pillman at a house show on May 12.

Nash wrestled as Oz throughout the remainder of 1991 and went on a lengthy losing streak, suffering defeats by Kazmaier,Rick Steiner,Dustin Rhodes, andArachnaman.

In June 1993, Nash left WCW, signing a contract with the WWF at the request ofShawn Michaels.[25]He was given the stage name of "Big Daddy Cool Diesel" ("Diesel" or "Big Daddy Cool" for short), with analpha-malegimmick. For the role, he grew long hair, taking on the appearance and demeanor of a cocky thug fromDetroit, sporting black sunglasses and leather garments. The name of Diesel, suggested byShane McMahon, was a play on the fact that Nash was from Detroit, known famously as the "Motor City". His initialentrance musicwas a series of truck engine and horn noises.
Diesel started out as thebodyguard/best friend of Shawn Michaels, with the two being known asTwo Dudes with Attitudes. He made his WWF debut at a house show on June 6, 1993, by assisting Michaels in defeatingMarty Jannettyfor theWWF Intercontinental Championship.[8]He first appeared on television the next night onRaw, June 7, as he was introduced as Michaels's bodyguard. In January 1994, Diesel appeared at theRoyal Rumble, first as one of the many wrestlers who assisted WWF ChampionYokozunain defeatingThe Undertakerin their casket match and then in the Royal Rumble match, eliminating seven men in under 18 minutes of in-ring time. Diesel won the Intercontinental Championship fromRazor Ramon, following interference from Michaels on the April 30, 1994 episode (taped April 13, 1994) ofSuperstars.[8][26]The duo of Diesel and Michaels defeatedThe Headshrinkersto win theWWF Tag Team Championshipon August 28, making Nash a double champion.[8][27]However, Diesel lost the Intercontinental Championship back to Ramon the following night atSummerSlam.[8]The alliance between Diesel and Michaels dissolved afterSurvivor Series, when Michaels accidentally performed asuperkickon Diesel. Diesel then chased Michaels, and despite failing to catch him, the reaction from the crowdturnedhimbabyface. However, Nash was no longer a tag team champion, as Michaels' actions resulted in the team being forced tovacatethe titles.
On November 26, 1994, Diesel facedBob Backlundfor theWWF Championshiphe had won fromBret Hartthree days prior atSurvivor Series. In the match atMadison Square Garden, Diesel defeated Backlund in the first ten seconds of the bout.[28]Diesel then promised Hart a match for his title, which they had the next month at theRoyal Rumble. The match ended in adrawdue to interference from several wrestlers, including Shawn Michaels. Michaels was irate about his former bodyguard having beaten him to the WWF Championship and was sufficiently motivated to win theRoyal Rumble matchlater that evening, earning himself a title shot atWrestleMania XI.
At WrestleMania XI on April 2, Nash, accompanied to ringside by actressPamela Anderson(who was supposed to valet for Michaels), defeated Michaels to retain the title. After the match, he left the ring with both Anderson and Michaels' replacement for her,Jenny McCarthy. The next night onMonday Night Raw,Michaels was betrayed by his new bodyguard,Sycho Sid, prompting Diesel to come to his rescue and thus reunited the tag team. Diesel successfully defended the WWF Championship against Sycho Sid at theinauguralIn Your Housepay-per-viewon May 14, and atIn Your House 2: The Lumberjackson July 23. AtSummerSlam, Diesel retained the WWF Championship by defeatingKing Mabel, who had won theKing of the Ringtournament.
On September 24 atIn Your House 3inSaginaw, Michigan, Diesel and Michaels challenged the reigning WWF Tag Team ChampionsOwen Hart and Yokozuna. The match had a winner-take-all stipulation, as in addition to the tag belts, Diesel's WWF Championship and Michaels' recently won Intercontinental Championship were also on the line. When Hart did not show up at the event, he was replaced byDavey Boy Smith. In the course of the match, Hart arrived at ringside, entered the ring and was pinned by Diesel for the win and the title, making him and Michaels holders of all three major WWF championships.[27]The reign did not last long, however, as Hart and Yokozuna had the titles returned to them the next night onRawdue to Hart not being an official part of the match when he was pinned.
Diesel's WWF Championship reign continued until November 19, when he was defeated byBret HartatSurvivor Series.[8]Following the loss, Diesel attacked Hart and began atweener turn.
AtIn Your House 5in December 1995, Diesel defeatedOwen Hart, who had injured Diesel's ally Shawn Michaels in a match the prior month. In January 1996, Diesel competed in theRoyal Rumble, entering at number 22. Diesel was the last man to be eliminated from the Royal Rumble, beingsuperkickedover the top rope by the winner, Shawn Michaels. Following the match, Diesel teased attacking Michaels before instead giving him ahigh five. Diesel went on to interfere in the main event betweenThe Undertakerand WWF ChampionBret Hart, costing The Undertaker the title. AtIn Your House 6on February 18, Diesel attempted to regain the WWF Championship from Hart in asteel cage match, losing after The Undertaker attacked him in retaliation for his actions at the Royal Rumble.[8]
Shortly beforeWrestleMania XII, Nash's contract status was in a state of flux. At the time, WCW was offering large amounts of money to the WWF's talent byEric Bischoff, WCW Executive Vice President, to jump ship. In fact, Bischoff had succeeded in convincing several high-profile WWF stars to sign with WCW over the previous two years, including five-time former WWF ChampionHulk Hoganand his on-again, off-again friend and two-time former WWF ChampionRandy Savage, and was in the process at the time of talking to Nash's friend Scott "Razor Ramon" Hall about a contract as Hall's too was set to expire. Nash explained on theWWE Classics on Demandexclusive seriesLegends of Wrestlingthat Hall had been the first to sign with the company and was offered a contract that paid him "aboveStingmoney" (at the time, Sting was one of the highest paid wrestlers in the company and althoughRic Flair,Hulk Hogan, andRandy Savagehad been making more, Sting's contract was used as a measuring stick). Hall also informed Nash that he had been given "most favored nation" status, which meant that if someone new was hired for more money, Hall's contract would increase to match that contract. Bischoff ended up offering Nash a three-year guaranteed contract with a $1.2 million annual salary. Nash said toVince McMahonthat he did not want to leave the WWF and that if McMahon was willing to match the offer, he would stay. McMahon said no because, according to Nash, he would have had to offer matching contracts to other wrestlers and with thepromotionin a bad financial situation, he simply could not afford it. Nash signed his contract shortly thereafter.
Diesel lost to The Undertaker at WrestleMania XII on March 31, after which he finally turned heel and went on to feud with Shawn Michaels once again after he turned on him at a Madison Square Garden live event. In his last televised WWF appearance until 2002, Diesel challenged Michaels for the WWF Championship (which he had won from Hart at WrestleMania XII) atIn Your House: Good Friends, Better Enemieson April 28. He wrestled Michaels for the title once again in a steel cage match at a house show on May 19, but was again defeated.[29]After the match, Diesel, Michaels, Razor Ramon, andHunter Hearst Helmsley, a group of off-screen friends known collectively as "The Kliq", hugged one another in the ring and wished each other farewell.[29]This incident, later referred to as the "Curtain Call" or "MSG Incident", was a serious breach of character, as it showed heels and babyfaces consorting with one another.[30]Shortly thereafter, with his obligations to the WWF now completely fulfilled, Nash left for WCW.[29]
After two weeks ofScott Hallreturning on WCW programming and taunting announcers, wrestlers, and the company, Nash also returned alongside his friend on June 10, 1996, after Hall interrupted Eric Bischoff. The duo were known as The Outsiders, and the storyline originally pushed them as "invaders" from the WWF (which WCW eventually had to scale back due to legal concerns from the WWF). AtBash at the Beach, Hall and Nash fought the team ofLex Luger,Sting, andRandy Savageand promised to add one more man to their entourage. After Luger was taken out of the match, Hulk Hogan came out to make the save, only to turn on Savage and reveal himself as Nash and Hall's third man. Immediately after this, they began cutting promos calling themselves theNew World Order (nWo). During his return, he had dyed his hair blonde. Through late 1996 and into 1997, Nash normally teamed with Hall as the Outsiders, and they held theWCW World Tag Team Championship.[8]Nash also began to show his leadership qualities in the nWo, and became a sort of "second in command" alongside Hogan. Nash, Hall, andSean Waltmandistinguished themselves from the rest of the nWo, calling themselves the "Wolfpac" in 1997.[8]
After a while, however, the nWo began to fight within its ranks, with Hogan and Nash battling for control. The situation came to a head on April 20, 1998, during a match between Hogan and recent nWo inductee (and rival) Randy Savage for Savage's recently wonWCW World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Nash interfered on Savage's behalf and jackknifed Hogan to the mat, signaling the breakup of the nWo into two separate factions (Nash's interference was not enough to prevent Hogan from regaining his championship, thanks toBret Hart's interference shortly thereafter). Nash became the leader ofnWo Wolfpac, alongside Savage,Curt Hennig, andKonnan. Hennig, however, shortly thereafter defected over to Hogan'snWo Hollywoodfaction. Then, during a match between Hall, Nash, Sting andThe Giant(who had recently rejoined the nWo after being kicked out two years prior), Hallturnedon Nash by hitting him with his tag team title belt and leaving the ring. The Wolfpac, however, was not down for long as Lex Luger joined Nash's team. Sting would eventually become a member as well, after being recruited heavily by both sides towards the middle of 1998. After Sting won Giant's half of the tag team title at theGreat American Bashthat June, Nash became Sting's partner.[8]They defended the championship until July 20, when they were defeated by Hall and The Giant. Nash then set his sights on his former partner, and the rivalry came to a head atHalloween Havocon October 25. During the course of the match, Nash jackknifed Hall twice but, instead of pinning him, left the ring and lost via countout. In November 1998, Nash and Diamond Dallas Page became a part of a loosely organised "creative team" which also included Dusty Rhodes and Kevin Sullivan.[31]
The following month atWorld War 3, Nash entered the 60-man, three ring battle royal that was a staple of the pay-per-view, with the winner getting a shot at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Starrcade the following month. Nash survived to the end after literally clearing his ring out andbig bootingLex Luger, who had Scott Hall in theTorture Rack, over the top rope, and earned his shot at the title. AtStarrcade, Nash won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship fromGoldberg(who had an officially given 173–0 win–loss record before the match) after Hall shocked Goldberg with astun gun.[8][32]In doing so, Nash broke Goldberg's long running undefeated streak.[8]On January 4, 1999, Nash and Goldberg were set to meet in a rematch, but the match did not happen because of Goldberg being arrested for stalkingMiss Elizabeth. That night also marked the return of Hulk Hogan after his "retirement" two months prior. With Goldberg unable to wrestle, Nash challenged Hogan instead. Hogan simplypoked Nash in the chest, who proceeded to fall down and willingly allow Hogan to pin him for the title.[8]The gesture marked the reunion of the feuding nWo factions into one.[8]The return, however, was short-lived, and by May 1999, the nWo reunion was over due to injuries to Hogan, Hall, Luger and Steiner.[8]Meanwhile, backstage, Nash became WCW's head booker in February 1999 and helped write some of the lateranglesfor WCW.
In May 1999, Nash won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship for the second time by defeating Diamond Dallas Page atSlamboree.[8][32]He then appeared onThe Tonight Showand put up a $250,000 challenge to Bret Hart for its May 24 program. However, Bret's brother,Owen, died in awrestling stuntjust as Bret was flying toLos Angeles; this immediately canceled their match and the feud. Nash then entered a feud with the returning Randy Savage, who was later joined by a returningSid ViciousatThe Great American Bashin June when he powerbombed Nash during the match, thus giving Nash adisqualificationvictory (as the signature move of both men, the Jackknife Powerbomb, had been ruled an "illegal" move by WCW leadership due to its high potential for injury). This rivalry culminated in a tag team match atBash at the Beachin July 1999 which pitted Nash and Sting against Savage and Sid. A stipulation was added that whoever got the pin in the match would become WCW World Heavyweight Champion. Nash was pinned by Savage and lost his championship, but would get his revenge the next night onNitroin a title match between Savage and a returning Hulk Hogan, and in a similar situation to Savage's first title defense from the previous year, he used a Jackknife Powerbomb on Savage, preserving the victory for Hogan. The following week, however, Nash attacked Hogan during a match pitting Hogan against Vicious. Nash, Sid, and Rick Steiner then feuded with Hogan, Sting, and a returning Goldberg untilRoad Wild, where Hogan defeated Nash in a "retirement" match.[8]
On October 4, 1999, Nash returned to WCW along with Scott Hall, which was later revealed to be a new version of the nWo involving Nash, Hall, Bret Hart, andJeff Jarrettcalled 'nWo 2000'. This would not last long either due to the injury of Hart, and Nash spent most of 2000 feuding with the likes ofTerry Funk,Mike Awesome,Scott Steiner, andBooker T.
Nash won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship again from Booker T on the August 28, 2000 episode of Monday Nitro inLas Cruces, New Mexico.[32]He eventually lost it to Booker T later on atFall Brawl. He even had a stint asWCW Commissioner,[8]and he served as a coach/mentor to theNatural Born Thrillers, who would eventually turn on Nash. Nash aligned himself with Diamond Dallas Page, reuniting the Vegas Connection, but renamed theInsiders. Theyfeudedwith thePerfect Event(Shawn StasiakandChuck Palumbo) and won theWCW World Tag Team ChampionshipatMayhemon November 26, 2000.[33][34]Shortly after, they were stripped of the title by CommissionerMike Sandersin mid-December. Weeks later, they won the title back atStarrcade.[35][36]In 2001 (WCW's final months), the Insiders continued their feud with the Natural Born Thrillers. Nash lost another "retirement" match to Scott Steiner atSuperBrawl Revenge,[8]but it would not be long before WCW announced the sale of the company to the World Wrestling Federation. As he had a guaranteed contract withAOL Time Warner, Nash elected to wait out the remainder of his contract, which expired on December 31, 2001.
Following the expiration of his AOL Time Warner contract, Nash, along with Scott Hall and Hulk Hogan, were rehired by the WWF.[8]Their rehiring was announced several weeks before their debut, withVince McMahonclaiming to have hired the nWo in order to destroy the WWF – of whichRic Flairwas now a co-owner, which McMahon could not tolerate. Billed as the original nWo, Nash, Hall, and Hogan returned to the WWF atNo Way Outon February 17, 2002. In the course of the evening, the nWo delivered aninterviewin which they claimed to have reformed, gave asix packofbeertoStone Cold Steve Austin(which he refused), and traded insults withThe Rock. They interfered in the main event of the evening, helpingChris Jerichoretain hisUndisputed WWF Championshipagainst Austin. AtWrestleMania X8on March 17, Nash continually interfered in the match between Hall and Austin to the point where he was forced to return backstage. Later that night, he and Hall turned on Hogan after he had offered congratulations to The Rock for defeating him. In March, Nash suffered a biceps injury that put him out of action for several months and almost immediately upon returning, suffered a quadriceps tear in a tag match on the July 8 episode ofRaw.[8]On the July 15 episode ofRaw, the nWo was officially disbanded by Vince McMahon as Eric Bischoff became Raw general manager.
After a nine-month injury, Nash returned as a face on the April 7, 2003 episode ofRaw, much to the delight of both Shawn Michaels and Triple H, who were feuding with each other when Nash returned. As part of the storyline, Nash was given a choice to remain friends with either Michaels or Triple H. After Nash would not make the decision, Triple H made the decision for him and turned on him with alow blow. This led to Nash and Triple H feuding with one another. Nash teamed up with Michaels and Booker T against Triple H,Ric Flairand Chris Jericho in asix-man tag team matchatBacklashon April 27 which ended with Triple H picking up the win for his team, pinning Nash after hitting him with asledgehammer. Following Backlash, Nash was granted a shot at Triple H'sWorld Heavyweight Championship, and the two squared off atJudgment Dayon May 18 with Michaels and Flair in their respective corners. Triple H would get himselfdisqualifiedand kept the title as a result, but this did not stop Nash from attacking Triple H following the match, putting him through the announcer's table with a Jackknife Powerbomb. The next month, they fought again in aHell in a Cellmatch atBad Bloodon June 15 withMick Foleyas the special guest referee, but Nash lost the match.[8]
In August, Nash feuded with Chris Jericho and was forced to cut his hair after losing ahair vs. hair matchagainst Jericho on the August 18 episode ofRaw. This was made to cover Nash having to cut his hair for his role asThe Russianfor the 2004Punisherfilm. His last match in WWE was atSummerSlamon August 24 in anElimination Chambermatch for the World Heavyweight Championship against Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Goldberg, Chris Jericho, andRandy Orton.[8]He was the first to be eliminated after Jericho pinned him followingSweet Chin Musicfrom Michaels. Before leaving, however, he executed a Jackknife Powerbomb on Jericho and Orton. Nash then stepped away from in-ring action and underwent neck surgery.[8]
Nash debuted inTotal Nonstop Action Wrestling(TNA) alongside the returning Scott Hall on November 7, 2004, at the inaugural monthly TNApay-per-view,Victory Road, with the duo helpingNWA World Heavyweight ChampionJeff Jarrett retain his title in aladder matchwithJeff Hardy.[8]In subsequent weeks, the trio identified themselves as theKings of Wrestlingand beganfeudingwith Hardy andA.J. Styles. AtTurning Pointon December 5, the Kings of Wrestling were defeated by Hardy, Styles, and Randy Savage.
Hall left TNA in early 2005, and Nash and Jarrett separated after Nash made clear his desire to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Nash received a title shot against Jarrett on February 13, 2005, atAgainst All Odds, but lost following interference from the debutingOutlaw.[8]Following the defeat, Nash joined forces withSean Waltmanand began feuding with the newly formedPlanet Jarrett. AtDestination Xon March 13, Nash lost to The Outlaw in aFirst Blood matchfollowing interference from Jarrett, who struck Nash with his title belt. The rivalry between Planet Jarrett and Nash and his allies culminated in a scheduledLethal Lockdown matchatLockdownon April 24 pitting Nash, Waltman, andDiamond Dallas Pageagainst Jarrett, The Outlaw, and "The Alpha Male"Monty Brown. Nash, however, was removed from the card and replaced withB.G. Jamesafter contracting astaph infection, which left him sidelined for much of 2005.
Nash returned to TNA on October 1 for the first episode ofImpact!onSpike TV,[8]attacking andpowerbombingJarrett. Nash went on to challenge Jarrett to a match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship atBound for Gloryon October 23. In the weeks preceding the event, Nash and Jarrett had several heated confrontations, on one occasion brawling with one another and with guest refereeTito Ortiz. On October 22, one day before Bound for Glory, Nash was hospitalized withchest pains. At Bound for Glory, abattle royalwas held to determine the number one contender;Rhinowon and then defeated Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Nash was later discharged from the hospital, having suffered a mild cardiac episode. He made a partial return to the ring in December 2005, wrestling several matches on a tour ofSouth Africa.
Nash returned to TNA once more on the April 27, 2006 episode ofImpact!, announcing in a pre-taped segment that he would give a private interview toAlex Shelleyone week later. The interview saw Nash claim to be the mostprofitableWWF World Heavyweight Champion of all time and describe theX Divisionas "basically filler". Nash went on to announce that he intended to destroy the X Division in order to reassert his position within TNA. He began his campaign atSacrificeon May 14, powerbombingPumaand continued his campaign on the May 19 episode ofImpact!by attackingChris Sabinshortly after he had defeatedPetey Williamsto win theTNA 2006 World X Cup TournamentforTeam USA. Nash continued to attack X Division wrestlers over subsequent weeks, leading to Sabin challenging him to a match atSlammiversary. Nash's attacks were also coupled with pre-taped segments with Shelley (some appearing only on the internet websiteYouTube) and his "X Division debut" on the June 15 episode ofImpact!, where Nash wrestled a comedy match against a midget Shelley dubbed a "Sabin-type wrestler". Nash defeated Sabin at Slammiversary in his second televised match in almost a year, albeit with the assistance of Shelley.
Around this time, Nash and Shelley formed a stable known as Paparazzi Productions, withJohnny Devineas a cameraman. Nash then decided to go for the X Division championship. He got penciled into a Number One Contendership match for the title against Sabin atHard Justice. He claimed that he had developed an 840° somersault splash that he would unveil in the match. However, over the weekend, he suffered a mysterious neck injury, supposedly while practicing it withTito Ortiz, and named Alex Shelley as his replacement in the match. From awheelchair, Nash was helpless as he watched Shelley lose the match to Sabin. Nash remained out of action due to the injury, but returned prior toBound for Glory, and announcedThe Kevin Nash Open Invitational X Division Gauntlet Battle Royal.Austin Starrwon the match. Nash took an interest in Starr, which seemed to be at the behest of Shelley. Nash then worked with the X Division stars in a weekly segment known as the Paparazzi Championship Series (a play on the "Bowl Championship Series"). He also began continuing these skits along withSonjay DuttandJay Lethal, in a segment called "Paparazzi Idol". Nash became a manager of sorts for Lethal, helping him adopt agimmickwhere he impersonated "Macho Man" Randy Savage. AtSacrifice, Lethal and Dutt had an altercation. Nash broke it up, but Sonjay kicked him. Sonjay apologized, and Nash forgave him. Dutt then became the Guru with Nash humming mantras backstage.
He then began managingThe Motor City Machine Guns, but this was short-lived before he next appeared in the role of Dr. Nash, psychiatrist and adviser toKurtandKaren Angle. Nash then engaged in a brief program with TNA Heavyweight Champion Kurt Angle, which eventually culminated in Nash aiding Angle. Nash warned the Angles about how dangerous Sting can be based on Nash's experience feuding with Sting in WCW. AtBound for Glory, Nash interfered on Angle's behalf during his World Title defense against Sting. However, it was for naught, as Sting captured the title from Angle viaScorpion Death Dropafter fending off Nash and Angle's wife, Karen. The following Thursday onImpact!, Nash and Angle had an altercation because Angle blamed Nash for him losing the World Title. Angle eventually attacked Nash, who retaliated by Jackknife Powerbombing Angle in the middle of the ring. The following week, Sting defended the TNA World Title against Angle in a rematch from Bound for Glory, and Nash had a ringside seat. After the match went on a bit, Angle and Sting were out of the ring and when Angle pushed Sting onto Nash, Sting turned around and hit Nash in the face with a right hand shot, leading to Nash interfering on Angle's behalf, even though earlier he said he was not going to help Angle. Following the match, which Angle won, Nash offered a hand shake to Angle only to be "flipped off" by the new champ. An enraged Nash demanded a match with Angle, butTNA Management's public face,Jim Cornette, instead booked Nash into a tag team match as Angle's partner against Sting and a partner of his choosing, with the stipulation being that the person gaining the pinfall or submission would be crowned the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. After ared herringthat Scott Hall was the mystery partner, it was revealed to be Booker T.
AtFinal Resolutionon January 6, 2008, Nash and his partnerSamoa Joelost in a title match toTNA World Tag Team ChampionsA.J. Styles and Tomkoafter Nash abandoned and seemingly betrayed Joe. Yet on the followingImpact!, when Joe stormed into Nash's locker room looking for a fight, Nash was actually able to persuade Joe into accepting hisMachiavellianmentorship. Nash lost to Kurt Angle in a one-on-one match onImpact!with the winner qualifying for the Three Ways to Glory match atNo Surrenderon September 14. On the September 11 episode ofImpact, prior to No Surrender, he seemingly parted ways with Joe on good terms. One month later, Nash returned atBound for Glory IVon October 12 and in aswerve, struck Joe in the back with Sting's bat, helping Sting win theTNA World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel once again in the process. On the October 23 episode ofImpact!, he formally joined Sting, Booker T, Scott Steiner, and Kurt Angle to create a villainous stable calledThe Main Event Mafia. He explained that he never forgave Joe for his scathing comments directed at his best friend Scott Hall's no-show almost a year prior, and befriending him was all part of a long-term plan to screw him out of the title. He then went on to defeat Joe atTurning Pointon November 9. Nash, however, was removed from the card forGenesison January 11, 2009 due to astaph infection, and was replaced byCute Kip. Nash returned on the January 29 episode ofImpact!when the Main Event Mafia took over the show.

Further suspicion was aroused to Hall's return when Nash said that he was getting "the band" back together, hinting at an nWo return.[45]AtFinal Resolutionon December 20, Nash took part in the "Feast or Fired" match and won the briefcase containing a shot at theTNA World Tag Team Championship.[46]
On the January 4, 2010, special live, three-hour Monday night edition ofImpact!Hogan made his debut in TNA, and Scott Hall and Sean Waltman made their return to the company to greet him.

Young refused the offer and in the main event of the evening, teamed up withRob Van DamandJeff Hardyto defeat the Band in a six-man tag team steel cage match.[51]Nash gained a measure of revenge on Young by defeating him in a steel cage match atLockdownon April 18.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
