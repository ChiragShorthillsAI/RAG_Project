AstronomerMichael E. Brownnicknamed his newly discovereddwarf planet"Xena" in 2003,[58]its then-provisional designation being2003 UB313.[58]When this object was initially determined to be larger thanPluto, it gained international attention and forced a year-long debate among astronomers as to thedefinition of a planet. Observations made byNew Horizonssubsequently found Pluto to be marginally larger than the object, which was ultimately namedEris. The object's nickname "Xena" was used in the press.New Scientistmagazine polled the public on their preferred final name for the so-called tenth planet; "Xena" ranked number 4.[59]Lawless called Brown in December 2005 to thank him for his "senseless act of beauty", and claimed that she "never dared hope [the name] would stick".[60]Eventually, Xena and Pluto were deemed not to be true planets, and were instead classified as dwarf planets. In 2006, the dwarf planet nicknamed Xena was officially named Eris.[58]However, Brown made an indirect tribute to Lawless by naming Eris's moonDysnomiaafterthe Greek goddess of lawlessness.[61]

Hans Lundgren was born inSpånga,Stockholm County,Swedento Sigrid Birgitta (néeTjerneld; 1932–1992), a language teacher, and Karl Hugo Johan Lundgren (1923–2000), anengineer(M.Sc.)[citation needed]andeconomist(MBA)[citation needed]for the Swedish government. He lived inSpångauntil the age of 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland,Ångermanland.[1][2][3]Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth,[4][5]but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957.[6][7][8]He has two sisters, Katarina and Annika and an elder brother Johan.[3]Lundgren claims his father was physically abusive and took out his own personal frustrations on his wife and son. He has stated that, during his tirades, his father would call him a "loser", which motivated him later as he grew more ambitious to prove himself. But he also said, "I still love my father, no matter what happened. There are many things about him I still admire. As a child, I was probably too much like him, very stubborn—perhaps that's what he couldn't deal with."[3]He has cited his troubled relationship with his father as the reason he developed a desire to participate in heavy contact sports such as boxing and karate.[3]
Lundgren has said that, as a child, he was insecure and suffered from allergies, describing himself as a "runt".[3][9]He showed a keen interest in drumming and had aspirations to become a rock star.[3]At age seven, he triedjudoandGōjū-ryū. He took upKyokushinkarateat the age of 10, and beganlifting weightsas a teenager.[9]Lundgren stated that "My dad always told me that if I wanted to make something special with my life, I had to go to America."[3]After graduating from high school with straight A's, he spent time in the United States in the 1970s on various academic scholarships, studying chemical engineering atWashington State University1976–1977,[10]andClemson University[11]prior to serving his mandatory one year in theSwedish Coastal Artilleryat theCoastal Ranger School. In the late 1970s, he enrolled at theRoyal Institute of Technologyin Stockholm and graduated in the early 1980s with a degree inchemical engineering.[3][12]
Amidst his years of studying, Lundgren honed hiskarateskills by training in a dojo for five years, and attained ablack beltinKyokushinby the late 1970s. He captained the Swedish Kyokushin karate team, and was a challenger at the 1979 World Open Tournament (arranged by the Kyokushin Karate Organization).[13]He won the European championships in 1980 and 1981, and a full-contact karate tournament in Australia in 1982.[14]In 1982, Lundgren graduated with amaster's degreein chemical engineering from theUniversity of Sydney.[15]During his time inSydney, he earned a living as abouncerin a nightclub in the notoriousKing's Crossarea.[16]
Lundgren was awarded aFulbright ScholarshiptoMITin 1983.[17]However, while preparing for the move toBoston, he was spotted in the nightclub where he worked in Sydney and was hired byGrace Jonesas a bodyguard, and the two became lovers.[18]He moved with Jones to New York City, where he dabbled in modeling at theZoli Agencybut was described as "a bit too tall and muscular for a model's size 40".[3]He earned a living as a bouncer at the Manhattan nightclubThe Limelight, which was housed in the formerEpiscopalChurch of the Holy Communion, working withChazz Palminteri.[3]In the daytime, he studied drama at the Warren Robertson Theatre Workshop and has said that "my time in New York City opened up my adolescent Swedish eyes to a multitude of different people and lifestyles, mostly in the arts. I hung out withAndy Warhol,Keith Haring,Iman, andSteve Rubell, danced atStudio 54, and studied acting withAndie MacDowellandTom Hulce."[3]Friends told him he should be in movies.[3]He quit studying at MIT after two weeks to pursue acting.[17][19]Lundgren said after being exposed to the entertainment business, he found it more attractive and rewarding than chemical engineering, so he decided to pursue a career in acting.[18]
Lundgren made his film debut in the 1985James BondfilmA View to a Kill,Roger Moore's final film as 007, in the minor role of Venz, aKGBassassin.[20][21]His former loverGrace Jones, who portrayed the villainMay Day, personally recommended him.[22]According to Lundgren, Moore said of him, "Dolph is larger than Denmark."[23]
Upon learning thatSylvester Stallonewas seeking an imposing fighter to play Soviet boxerIvan DragoinRocky IV(1985), Lundgren sent videos and pictures of himself to a distant contact of Stallone, eventually reaching him. Lundgren tried out for the role, but as he himself has stated, he was initially turned down because he was too tall.[24]Lundgren eventually beat 5,000 other hopefuls to land his breakout role opposite Stallone,Carl Weathers, andBrigitte Nielsen. To improve his physique and athletic abilities, he trained intensely inbodybuildingandboxingfor five months before the film was shot. Lundgren said: "We trained six days a week—weights in the morning for about an hour, then boxing in the afternoon. We did a split of chest and back one day and then shoulders, legs, and arms the next. We boxed for an hour and a half, practiced the fight choreography, and did bag work and abs."[25]He weighed 240 pounds during filming,[25]but in the film he was billed at 260 pounds, one shipping above of Drago, "He's a exceptional 250 pounds of merciless fighting machine, Drago is listed come to behold 270 pounds, the best that Soviet science & medicine can create".[26]His character's lines "If he dies, he dies" and "I must break you" are amongst the best known of theRockyseries, and have often been cited in popular culture.[27][28]Lundgren hit Stallone so hard during the filming of a fight scene that Stallone was in intensive care in the St. John's Hospital for nine days with a blood pressure of 290, due to swelling of thepericardial sacaround his heart.[29]Lundgren later fought in a real boxing match against formerUFCfighterOleg Taktarov, and lost via decision.[30]Lundgren has highlighted the premiere ofRocky IVat theMann Village Theatre,[31][32][33]inWestwood, Los Angeles, as the moment which changed his life, remarking: "I walked in to a Westwood movie theater as Grace Jones' boyfriend and walked out ninety minutes later as the movie star Dolph Lundgren. I was shell-shocked for years from the mind-boggling and daunting experience of being a student-athlete from tiny Sweden suddenly having to live up a new action-star persona."[3]
In 1987, Lundgren released on home media a workout video calledMaximum Potential,[34]and he also got his first lead role asHe-ManinMasters of the Universe, based on thepopular children's toyline and cartoon, directed byGary Goddard.[35]Lundgren weighed his all-time heaviest during the filming at 280 pounds.[25]The film was a critical failure and viewed as far too violent for a family picture.[36][37]It is referred to as a "flop" byVarietymagazine,[38]and has a 13% "rotten" rating atRotten Tomatoes.[39]Lundgren was criticized for being too wooden as a leading man, and it was dismissed as "a glossy fantasy starring monosyllabic Dolph Lundgren".[40]
In 1988, he starred inJoseph Zito'sRed Scorpion. Lundgren plays a SovietKGBagent who is sent to an African country to assassinate the leader of ananti-communistrebel movement, but eventually switches sides.[41]The film was poorly received and has an 17% "rotten" rating at Rotten Tomatoes.[42]Stephen HoldenofThe New York Timessaid: "Dolph Lundgren's pectorals are the real stars ofRed Scorpion,an action-adventure movie set in the fictional African country of Mombaka. Filmed from below so that one has the sense of peering up at a massive kinetic sculpture, his glistening torso, which over the course of the film is subjected to assorted tortures, is the movie's primary visual focus whenever the action slows down. And since Mr. Lundgren remains stone-faced, rarely speaking except to issue commands in a surprisingly hesitant monotone, his heaving chest actually communicates more emotion than his mumbling lips."[43]
In 1989, Lundgren then starred asMarvel ComicsadaptationThe Punisherplaying the title role. Directed byMark Goldblatt, the film changes some details of the character's origin, and eliminates the signature skull logo. These elements troubled fans of the comic book upon its release and were dismissive. Also initial reviews found it to be a trashy comic book film. The film had a troubled release as the studios who made it were changed ownership. While the film was theatrically released internationally, the film went direct-to-video in the US. However over the years the film developed a cult with some who think it's the best adaptation of the comic. The film was re-evaluated with a much more positive outlook who find Lundgren's performance solid as a ghostly and soul depraved vigilante.[44]
In 1990, Lundgren starred inCraig R. Baxley's sci-fi thrillerI Come in Peace(also known asDark Angel) oppositeBrian Benben,Betsy Brantley, Matthias Hues, andJay Bilas. Lundgren plays a toughHoustoncop with an inner sensitivity,[45]who does not let the rules of police procedure prevent him pursuing his mission to wipe out a gang of drug dealers who killed his partner. Lundgren said of his role: "What attracted me to Dark Angel is that I get to do more than just action. There's some romance, some comedy, some drama. I actually have some clever dialogue in this one. I get to act."[46]
In 1991, Lundgren starred inManny Coto's action filmCover UpoppositeLouis Gossett Jr.Lundgren portrays a US Marine veteran turned reporter, who finds his own life in jeopardy after stumbling across a political cover-up.[47]InMark L. Lester's martial arts action filmShowdown in Little Tokyo, he andBrandon Leeplay police officers investigating theyakuza.[48][49]The film received a mainly negative reception from critics and was criticized for its violence;Vincent CanbyofThe New York Timesdescribed it as "violent, but spiritless."[50]Varietywrote: "Lundgren can hold his own with other action leads as an actor and could easily be Van Damme-marketable if only he'd devote as much attention to quality control as he does to pectoral development."[51]David J. Fox of theLos Angeles Times, however, described the film as a "class act", and some retrospective critics find it to be entertaining for its genre.[52][53][54][55]
In 1992, Lundgren starred in the sci-fi action pictureUniversal Soldierdirected byRoland Emmerich. Lundgren (as Sergeant Andrew Scott) andJean-Claude Van Damme(asLuc Deveraux) play U.S. soldiers who died during theVietnam War,[56]only to be laterreanimatedin a secret Army project to be sent on missions as GR operatives. At the1992 Cannes Film Festival, Van Damme and Lundgren were involved in a verbal altercation that almost turned physical, but it was believed to have only been a publicity stunt.[57][58]Universal Soldieropened in theatres on 10 July 1992, a moderate success domestically with $36,299,898 in US ticket sales, but a major blockbuster worldwide, making over $65 million overseas, which earned the film a total of $102 million worldwide, on a $23 million budget.[59]Despite being a box office hit, it was not well-received; mainstream critics dismissed the movie as aTerminator 2rip-off.[57][60][61][62]Film criticRoger Ebertsaid: "it must be fairly thankless to play lunks who have to fight for the entire length of a movie while exchanging monosyllabic idiocies", and includedUniversal Soldierin his bookI Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie.[57][58]
In 1993, Lundgren starred oppositeKristian AlfonsoandGeorge SegalinVic Armstrong'sJoshua Tree.[63]Lundgren plays Wellman Anthony Santee, a former racecar driver who is framed by police officer Frank Severance (Segal) for the murder of a highway patrolman.

In 1994, Lundgren starred inBruce Malmuth'sPentathlonas an East GermanOlympicgold medalistpentathleteon the run from an abusive coach.[65]Lundgren trained with the U.S. pentathlon team in preparation for the role,[66]which later led to him being selected to serve as the (non-competing) Team Leader of the 1996 U.S. OlympicModern Pentathlonteam during theAtlanta Games, to promote the image of the sport and to coordinate planning and other details between the team and theUnited States Olympic Committee.[67]The film was seen negatively by most critics;Film Reviewsaid it was "appallingly acted and monotonous"[68]and Video Movie Guide 2002 described it as a "sillyCold Warthriller".[69]
Later in 1994, Lundgren appeared inPerry Lang'sMen of War(scripted byJohn Sayles) alongsideCharlotte LewisandBD Wong, as Nick Gunar, a former Special Ops soldier who leads a group of mercenaries to a treasure island in theSouth China Sea. The film was well received by some critics. One author said "Men of Warinvokes the most vividly remembered fighting in a foreign land of recent Western history. This innovation, associating the muscle image with the Vietnam experience, is carried over into other contemporary muscle films."[70]Another said, "fine performances by an all-star Dolph Lundgren as a mercenary assigned to 'convince' a cast in this offbeat and disturbing film."[71]
In 1995, Lundgren appeared inRobert Longo'sJohnny Mnemonic, co-starringKeanu Reeves. The film portrays screenwriterWilliam Gibson'sdystopiancyberpunkview of the future with the world dominated bymegacorporationsand with strongEast Asianinfluences.[72]Reeves plays the title character, a man with acyberneticbrain implant designed to store information. Lundgren plays Karl Honig, aJesus-obsessed hitman and street preacher who wears a robe and carries a shepherd's staff.[72][73]Critical response was negative overall; Roger Ebert said, "Johnny Mnemonic is one of the great gestures of recent cinema, a movie which doesn't deserve one nanosecond of serious analysis."[74]The film was a financial disappointment, grossing $19,075,720 in the domestic American market against its $26m budget. The cloak worn by Lundgren in the film is now located in the lobby of the Famous Players Coliseum inMississauga, Ontario, it was his last theatrical release film until 2010.[75]Later in 1995, Lundgren appeared inTed Kotcheff'sThe Shooter, an action drama in which he plays Michael Dane, a U.S. Marshall who gets caught up in politics when he is hired to solve the assassination of a Cuban ambassador.
In 1996, Lundgren starred inRussell Mulcahy'sSilent Trigger, playing a formerSpecial Forcesagent who joins a secretive government agency as an assassin.[76][77]The Motion Picture Guide to the films of 1997 said, "this stylish but empty thriller gives square-jawed Dolph Lundgren another shot at straight-to-video immortality".[76]

The film co-starredMichael Sarrazin,Montel Williams,Roy ScheiderandChristopher Heyerdahl, and was shot on location in Montreal.[78]The film was praised for its exciting action sequences.[79]Doug Pratt described the first half of the film as "excellent" and described Lundgren's character as "tenacious",[80]although Robert Cettl wrote "the Peacekeeper trades on the presence of B-movie action star Dolph Lundgren, an actor who never became as popular as his action contemporaries Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal."[81]
In 1998, he appeared in Jean-Marc Piché's action/supernatural horror filmThe MinionalongsideFrançoise RobertsonLundgren portrays Lukas Sadorov, a middle eastern templar and member of an order who are charged with guarding the gateway to Hell that, if opened, will unleash all evil.[77]The DVD and Video Guide of 2005 described the film as being "possibly one of the worst films ever".[71]Later in 1998, Lundgren appeared alongsideBruce PayneandClaire StansfieldinSweepersas Christian Erickson, a leading demolition expert and head of an elite team of specialists, trained to disarm mine fields in a humanitarianminesweepingoperation inAngola.[82]The Video Guide to 2002 said, "that noise you hear isn't the numerous on-screen explosions but action star Lundgren's career hitting rock bottom."[83]He also featured in theTV pilotBlackjack(directed byJohn Woo) as a former US Marshal who becomes the bodyguard and detective of a young supermodel (Kam Heskin), who becomes the target of a psychotic assassin (Phillip MacKenzie).[84][85]One review described  the narrative as "laughably stupid", while the DVD and Video Guide to 2005 said, "dull, lightweight, made-for-TV action fully to a satisfying climax".[71][86]
In 1999, Lundgren played a mercenary inIsaac Florentine'sBridge of Dragons,[87]a military pilot inAnthony Hickox'sStorm Catcher,[77][88]and a cop who's a former boxer inJill Rips, also directed by Hickox, based on a 1987novel by ScottishwriterFrederic Lindsay.[89]

This subpar effort sinks to the bottom of the ocean in a tidal wave of cliche."[92]During an interview onThe Tonight ShowwithJay Lenoin May 2008,GladiatordirectorRidley Scottsaid Lundgren had been considered for the part of undefeated fighter Tigris of Gaul in 2000, but was eventually rejected because "as an actor, he just didn't fit in with what we were trying to achieve".[93]

Although Lundgren has never competed as a professional bodybuilder, he has been closely associated with bodybuilding and fitness since his role as Drago in the mid-1980s.Bodybuilding.comsaid, "Looking like a man in his 30s rather than his 50s, Lundgren is the poster boy of precise nutrition, supplementation and exercise application that he has practiced for over 35 years".[146]In an interview with them, he claimed to often train up to six days a week, usually one-hour sessions completed in the morning, saying that "it's just one hour a day, and then you can enjoy the other 23 hours".[147]Although he had begun lifting weights as a teenager, he cites co-starSylvester Stalloneas the man who got him into serious bodybuilding for a period in the 1980s after he arrived in the U.S.[147]Stallone had a lasting influence on his fitness regimen and diet, ensuring that he ate a much higher percentage of protein and split his food intake between five or six smaller meals a day.[146]In 2023, he said in an interview that he took anabolic steroids off and on from the mid-'80s to the mid-'90s.[148]Lundgren has professed never to have been "super strong", saying that, "I'm too tall and my arms are long.

Lundgren splits his time betweenStockholmandLos Angeles. He speaks Swedish and English fluently, as well as smaller amounts of French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, but is not fluent in those five languages as has often been reported.[153][154]

During the 1980s, Lundgren had relationships with Jamaican singerGrace Jonesand American model Paula Barbieri.[156]While Lundgren was completing a master's degree in chemical engineering on an exchange program with theUniversity of Sydneyin Australia, Jones spotted him at a dance club and hired him as a bodyguard. Lundgren was whisked off to the United States, where he completed his final thesis.[157]
In 1994, he married Anette Qviberg (b. 1966), a jewellery designer and fashion stylist, inMarbella.[152]The couple decided they liked Marbella so much that they rented accommodations there for years, before eventually buying a family home there.[152]They have two daughters: Ida Sigrid Lundgren (b. 1996) and Greta Eveline Lundgren (b. 2001), both born inStockholm.[113]Lundgren and Qviberg cited the reason for living outside Hollywood was to give their children as normal a childhood as possible.[3]In early May 2009, three masked burglars reportedly broke into Lundgren's Marbella home. The burglars tied up and threatened his wife, but fled when they found a family photo and realized that the house was owned by Lundgren. Lundgren later stated he believed the intruders to be Eastern European and had asked contacts in Bulgaria to investigate them, but to no avail.[158]After the incident, Lundgren's elder daughter, Ida, suffered fromPTSD.

Danny Trejo(/ˈtreɪhoʊ/,Spanish:[ˈtɾexo]; born May 16, 1944) is an American actor. A native of Los Angeles, Trejo's film career began in 1985, when he landed a role inRunaway Train(1985). The first film in which he was given a proper credited role was as Art Sanella inDeath Wish 4: The Crackdown(1987).[1]He went on to star in a multitude of other films, many of which were small parts as inmates, gangsters, or other criminals,[2]appearing inDesperado,Heat(both 1995),From Dusk till Dawn(1996),Con Air(1997),The Replacement Killers(1998),Reindeer Games(2000), andOnce Upon a Time in Mexico(2003), among others.
From 2001 to 2003, Trejo appeared in theRobert Rodriguez-directedSpy KidsfranchiseasIsador "Machete" Cortez. Subsequently, in 2010, Trejo reprised his role as Machete in the spin-off exploitation action filmMacheteas theprotagonist. With the success ofMachete(2010), Trejo once again reprised his role in a direct sequel,Machete Kills(2013).
His voice acting work includes the characters Umberto Robina for the video gamesGrand Theft Auto: Vice CityandGrand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, himself inDef Jam: Fight for NY(2004), Raul Tejada inFallout: New Vegas, Trainer Duke inThe Fight: Lights Out, himself inCall of Duty: Black OpsandCall of The DeadandCall of Duty Black Ops 4: Blackoutand also himself inFar Cry 6: Danny and Dani vs. Everybody, andSCUM, among others.[3]
Danny Trejo was born on May 16, 1944, inMaywood, California.[4][5][6]He was raised onTemple Streetin theEcho Parkneighborhood of Los Angeles, California, the son ofMexican-Americanparents.[7][8][9]He is the son of Delores Rivera King[10]and Dionisio "Dan" Trejo (1922–1981),[11]a construction worker. Trejo was the result of an extramarital affair; Delores's husband was away fighting inWorld War II.[12]His parents met at a dance hall in Highland Park, Los Angeles in 1943.[13]He had a maternal half-sister, Dyhan, but saw neither her nor Delores from 1949 until 1965; his father banned his mother from seeing him after Trejo sprained his arm in her care.[12]
Trejo was oftenabusedby his father. Shortly after his birth, Trejo and his family briefly lived inSan Antonio, Texas; they fled Los Angeles because Dionisio was wanted by police for stabbing another man. After a year, they returned to Los Angeles and Trejo's father turned himself in.[13]By 1949, Trejo shared a room with his cousins at their grandmother's house.[14]His stepmother was Alice Mendias, "his only source of comfort" when he lived with his father.[15][16][17]
Trejo was usingmarijuana,heroin, andcocaineby ages 8, 12, and 18, respectively.[18][19][20]Trejo's uncle Gilbert introduced him to all three and was responsible for Trejo overdosing on his first heroin fix.[13]When he was 13, he moved to the majority Hispanic neighborhood ofPacoima, Los Angeles, where he said he did not experience racism growing up. Years later, he purchased his childhood home and often lived in it.[21]
At age seven, Trejo participated in his first drug deal.[22]He was first arrested at the age of 10,[23]but experienced his first incarceration at Eastlake Juvenile Hall in 1956.[23]
Throughout the 1960s, Trejo's life consisted predominantly of intermittent jail stints in theCalifornia prison system.[23][24]The accounts of his prison chronology, though, are notably conflicting; by one account, his final term in custody is said to have ended in 1972.[9]However, Trejo did time in various juvenile offenders' camps,[25]including three years at Camp Glenn Rockey,San Dimas, for maiming a sailor (stabbing him in the face with broken glass),[26][27]followed by numerous California prisons between 1959 and 1969; "I was in San Quentin, Folsom, Soledad, Vacaville, Susanville, Sierra".[18]
While doing a stint inLos Angeles Countyjail in 1961, he metCharles Manson, whom he described as a "dirty, greasy, scrawny white boy" who was allegedly a talentedhypnotist.[28]
Trejo arrived atSan Quentin State Prisonin 1966, and his heroin use was exacerbated shortly thereafter.[29]He was a debt collector and drug dealer, often participating in or witnessing acts of serious violence, including murder.[30][31]Simultaneously while  imprisoned, Trejo focused on boxing[29]and became a champion in San Quentin'slightweightandwelterweightdivisions.[9]
Regarding himself, Trejo has suggested his physical appearance contributed to his constantly getting into trouble.[18][32]In 1968, a prison riot broke out duringCinco De Mayoat Soledad. From that fracas, Trejo ended up in solitary confinement, facing capital charges and, potentially, the death penalty, after hitting a guard with a rock.  While in solitary, Trejo found faith[33][11]and became a member of a12-step program, having first attended one "by accident" aged 15.  He successfully overcame his drug addictions, recalling in 2011 that he had been sober for the previous 42 years. Also while incarcerated, he earned his high-school diploma.[34][18]
In July 1969, Trejo was released from custody and returned to Pacoima, Los Angeles, having served five years of a 10-year prison sentence.[35][11]
Prior to his film career, Trejo worked as a labor foreman for developer Saul Pick, and contributed toward the construction of theCinerama Dome.[36]He was also a gardener, salesperson, part owner of a lawn care company, and became a substance abuse counselor since 1973.[37][38][39]
Trejo worked with Western Pacific Med Corp in the 1980s, assisting them with the establishing and operating of sober living houses within theSan Fernando Valley.[41]He met a "good looking tattooed kid" during a meeting in one such house, who explained that he worked as a film extra and was paid $50 per day to stand there. Intrigued, Trejo considered becoming a film extra, initially due to the easy money and publicity it could afford his work with Western Pacific Med Corp. Trejo signed with an agent and would hand out his details while working on film sets, in the hopes of finding more opportunities to help those in need. Late one night, Trejo received a call from a teenaged patient, asking for his assistance in dealing with cocaine problems on the set ofRunaway Train(1985).[42][9][43]
While there, Trejo was offered a job as an extra in the film's prison scenes.Edward Bunker, a former convict turned published crime author who was writing the screenplay for the film, recognized Trejo from their time together at San Quentin.[9][43]Remembering Trejo's boxing skills, Bunker played a pivotal role in securing Trejo asEric Roberts' personal trainer and boxing advisor. Trejo was paid between $320 and $350 per day. Trejo recalled: "When I got my first paycheck, I thought they made a mistake!"[44][45]Bunker also convinced directorAndrei Konchalovskyto offer Trejo a small acting role, asserting that Trejo's personal experiences of incarceration would provide authenticity to the prison drama.[46]Following his acting debut, Trejo was oblivious to being typecast as a prisoner in similar roles for years to follow; "I [did not] know I was being stereotyped. I just knew I was working."[47]
Penitentiary IIIwas his first billed role. While filming he met Anthony Gambino of theGambino crime family; Gambino allegedly had financial interests invested and was there to meet the leading man,Leon Isaac Kennedy. Trejo was paid $120 cash each day, but the project often went into overtime; "We were stacked with cash."[48]On a good month, Trejo was taking home as much as $700 by 1989 from being an extra alone; yet, people often assumed he was far wealthier after a few appearances on television. Trejo says this worked to his advantage as a drug counselor, though, because clients would recognize him as an actor, therefore appreciating his presence and the humility of his work all the more.[49]
Trejo had made a dozen films by 1990, includingDeath Wish 4: The Crackdown, andMarked for Death. He enjoyed the making ofGuns,[50]yet allegesErik Estradatook issue with the cast and crew being more familiar with Trejo than himself. Trejo says Estrada's ego got the better of him; he believes Estrada arranged for Trejo and a number of others to fly coach instead of first class on the way to Hawaii for filming.[51]
In 1991,Edward James Olmosoriginally offered him the role of Pedro Santana inAmerican Me.[52]Trejo was unimpressed by the script and his initial meeting with Olmos. Trejo claims rumors began circulating within theMexican Mafiathat the script was taking narrative liberties. Before Trejo had the chance to attend a second meeting with Olmos, he received a call fromJoe "Pegleg" Morgan, the then-don of the Mexican Mafia; Morgan approved of his choosing a role inBlood In, Blood Outinstead ofAmerican Me.[53]In 2021, Trejo stated that he believes Olmos has yet to accept him as a serious actor.[47]
Of his experiences ofBlood In, Blood Out, Trejo recalls feeling uncomfortable around many of the other actors during rehearsals, as they were more established.[54]During production at San Quentin, Trejo often had flashbacks to his time there; filming scenes in C550, his former cell, merely exacerbated such feelings.[55]Though his previous works brought him opportunities, Trejo creditsBlood In, Blood Outas having brought him "legitimate, worldwide fame."[56]
Trejo found a new talent agent with the help ofRaymond Cruz. He was first cast in an episode ofBaywatch, followed by a part in 1993'sLast Light,Kiefer Sutherland's directorial debut.[57]
Heatwent through two script revisions while Trejo read for the part. He ultimately secured the role, which reunited him withMichael Mann, who had directed him in the television miniseriesDrug Wars: The Camarena Storya few years prior. Mann initially mistook Trejo for his uncle Gilbert; he found the resemblance uncanny, having met Gilbert while shootingThe Jericho Mileat Folsom in the late 1970s; production required the co-operation of the inmates, and Gilbert happened to be one of the shot-callers. Trejo's character in the film was initially called 'Vince' but renamed 'Trejo' in honor of Gilbert.  Filming could be upward of 17 hours per day, but Trejo said he was grateful for how much he learned; "watchingDe Niro,Kilmer, andVoight, I learned a lot about how they saved [their performances] for when it mattered." He recalls being mentored by Robert De Niro, who was a patient and instructive scene partner. Trejo and De Niro improvised the former's death scene.[58]
In 1996, Trejo was cast in the French productionLe Jaguar(which was French for The Jaguar) and reunited with Voight forAnaconda, both of which were filmed in Manaus, Brazil. When production forAnacondamoved to Venezuela, Trejo would go out socializing on his days off. The producers were worried given a possible coup d'état had made parts of the country unsafe to travel; a group of teenagers brandished AK47's on one occasion, demanding Trejo's combat boots. Because of this, Trejo says he negotiated a higher salary to remain within the confines of his hotel.[59]
Trejo described 1997'sCon Airas a "macho fest from the start" and the cast were often pulling pranks on one another. He remembersNicolas Cageas being "cool as hell" andJohn Cusackas a "kickboxing badass". Trejo met many of his longtime friends on set, including:John Malkovich,Ving Rhames,Steve Buscemi, andDave Chappelle.[60]
After concludingAnimal Factoryin 1999, he contractedHepatitis Cand "had to drag [his] ass" from Canada to Austin, Texas, to begin filming ofSpy Kidsin 2000.Spy Kidsmarked Trejo's debut as the fictional characterIsador "Machete" Cortez. Having already madeDesperadoandFrom Dusk till Dawntogether, the opportunity to collaborate withRobert Rodriguez,Antonio Banderas, andCheech Marinonce again "felt like [a] family reunion."[61]Spy Kidsprovided Trejo with worldwide recognition and for the first time he was "instantly recognizable" among children around the globe.[62]
By the time ofBubble Boyin 2001, his illness had progressed to the point that much of the cast had noticed his weight loss; Trejo states that his past drug use had caught up with him. He described himself as having been pale and weak throughout production, and pre-occupied with keeping his diagnosis a secret within Hollywood for fear of reprisal. Trejo was "out of it" and struggling to remember his lines due to prescription medication. By the timeSpy Kidspremiered in September 2002, Trejo had fully recovered.[61][62]
Throughout the 2000s, Trejo appeared in productions including:XXX;Once Upon a Time in Mexico;Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy;The Devil's Rejects;Snoop Dogg's Hood of Horror;Delta Farce;Grindhouse;Rob Zombie's Halloween;Urban Justice(alongsideSteven Seagal); andValley of Angels. He also made a number of television appearances, including:Monk,Desperate Housewives,Stargate: Atlantis, andBreaking Bad. Trejo also voiced the characters Enrique and Octavio onKing of the Hill. His life is documented in the independent biographical film,Champion, featuring some of Trejo's close friends:Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Steve Buscemi, and Robert Rodriguez.[63]Trejo also shared his tumultuous journey from convict to film star withKTTVin Los Angeles, 2013, in a segment filmed in Trejo's home.[64]
Regarding his continued growth as a professional actor, Trejo has remarked, "I'm so blessed. I'm still scared that somebody's going to wake me up and say, 'Hey, we're still in prison. Let's go to chow’".[65]Trejo also played 'Machete' in a trailer made for Rodriguez's film collaboration withQuentin Tarantino,Grindhouse.

Andrews has co-authored numerous children's books with her daughter and two autobiographies,Home: A Memoir of My Early Years(2008) andHome Work: A Memoir of My Hollywood Years(2019).
Julia Elizabeth Wells[8]was born on 1 October 1935 inWalton-on-Thames,Surrey, England.[9][10]Her mother, Barbara Ward Wells (née Morris; 25 July 1910[11]–1984) was born inChertsey[12]and married Edward Charles "Ted" Wells (1908–1990), a teacher ofmetalworkandwoodwork, in 1932.[13]Andrews was conceived as a result of an affair her mother had with a family friend. Andrews learned of her true parentage from her mother in 1950,[14][15]although it was not publicly disclosed until her 2008 autobiography.[16]
With the outbreak ofWorld War II, her parents went their separate ways and were soon divorced. Each remarried: Barbara to Ted Andrews, in 1943,[17]and Ted Wells in 1944[18]to Winifred Maud (Hyde) Birkhead, a war widow and former hairstylist at a war work factory that employed them both inHinchley Wood, Surrey.[14][15][19]Wells assisted with evacuating children toSurreyduringthe Blitz, while Andrews's mother joined her husband in entertaining the troops through theEntertainments National Service Association. Andrews lived briefly with Wells and her brother, John,[20]in Surrey.
In 1940, Wells sent her to live with her mother and stepfather, who Wells thought would be better able to provide for his talented daughter's artistic training. While Andrews had been used to calling her stepfather "Uncle Ted", her mother suggested it would be more appropriate to refer to her stepfather as "Pop", while her father remained "Dad" or "Daddy" to her, a change which she disliked.[21]The Andrews family was "very poor" and "lived in a badslumarea of London" at the time, stating that the war "was a very black period in my life". According to Andrews, her stepfather was violent and an alcoholic.[16]He twice tried to get into bed with his stepdaughter while drunk, resulting in Andrews fitting a lock on her door.[16]
As the stage career of her mother and stepfather improved, they were able to afford better surroundings, first toBeckenhamand then, as the war ended, back to the Andrews' hometown ofHersham. The family took up residence at the Old Meuse, in West Grove, Hersham, a house (since demolished) where Andrews's maternal grandmother had served as a maid.[15]Andrews's stepfather sponsored lessons for her, first at the independent arts educational school Cone-Ripman School (previouslyArtsEd, nowTring Park School for the Performing Arts) and thereafter with concert soprano and voice instructor MadameLilian Stiles-Allen.
Andrews said of Stiles-Allen, "She had an enormous influence on me", adding, "She was my third mother – I've got more mothers and fathers than anyone in the world". In her memoirJulie Andrews – My Star Pupil, Stiles-Allen records, "The range, accuracy and tone of Julie's voice amazed me ... she had possessed the rare gift ofabsolute pitch",[22]though Andrews herself refutes this in her 2008 autobiographyHome.[14][23]According to Andrews, "Madame was sure that I could doMozartandRossini, but, to be honest, I never was".[22]: 24Of her own voice, she says, "I had a very pure, white, thin voice, a four-octave range – dogs would come from miles around."[22]: 24After Cone-Ripman School, Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby Woodbrook School, a local state school in Beckenham.[24]
Beginning in 1945, and for the next two years, Andrews performed spontaneously and unbilled on stage with her parents. "Then came the day when I was told I must go to bed in the afternoon because I was going to be allowed to sing with Mummy and Pop in the evening", Andrews explained. During her initial shows, Andrews stood on a beer crate to sing into the microphone, performing a solo or a duet with her stepfather, while her mother played piano. She later stated that "it must have been ghastly, but it seemed to go down all right".[25][26]Fellow child entertainerPetula Clark, three years her senior, recalled touring around the UK by train to sing for the troops alongside Andrews; they slept in the luggage racks. Clark later said "It was fun—and not a lot of kids were having fun".[27]
Andrews had her career breakthrough when her stepfather introduced her to managing directorVal Parnell, whoseMoss Empirescontrolled prominent performance venues in London. At the age of 12, Andrews made her professional solo debut at theLondon Hippodrome, singing the difficult aria "Je suis Titania" fromMignonas part of a musicalrevue, called "Starlight Roof", on 22 October 1947. She played at the Hippodrome for one year.[14][28]Of her role in "Starlight Roof", Andrews recalled: "There was this wonderful American person and comedian,Wally Boag, who made balloon animals. He would say, 'Is there any little girl or boy in the audience who would like one of these?' And I would rush up onstage and say, 'I'd like one, please.' And then he would chat to me and I'd tell him I sang. ... I was fortunate in that I absolutely stopped the show cold. I mean, the audience went crazy."[29]
On 1 November 1948, a thirteen-year-old Andrews became the youngest solo performer ever to be seen in aRoyal Variety PerformancebeforeKing George VIandQueen Elizabethat theLondon Palladium. Andrews performed alongside singerDanny Kaye, dancers theNicholas Brothers, and the comedy teamGeorge and Bert Bernard.[30][31]
Andrews subsequently followed her parents into radio and television.[32]She performed in musical interludes of theBBC Light Programmecomedy showUp the Poleand was a cast member inEducating Archie, from 1950 to 1952.[31]She reportedly made her television début on the BBC programmeRadiOlympia Showtimeon 8 October 1949.[33]Andrews appeared onWest End theatreat theLondon Casino, where she played one year each as PrincessBadroulbadourinAladdinand the egg inHumpty Dumpty. Andrews also appeared on provincial stages inJack and the BeanstalkandLittle Red Riding Hood, as well as starring as the lead role inCinderella.[32]In 1952, she voiced Princess Zeila in the English dub of the Italian animated movieLa Rosa di Bagdad(renamedThe Singing Princess), in her first film and first venture into voice-over work.[34]
On 30 September 1954, the eve of her 19th birthday, Andrews made herBroadwaydebut as Polly Browne in the London musicalThe Boy Friend.[1]Andrews was recommended to directorVida Hopefor the part by actressHattie Jacques, whom Andrews regards as a "catalyst" for her career.[35]Eve Benda recognised her special talent and predicted her stardom. Andrews was anxious about moving to New York; at the time, she was both breadwinner and caretaker for her family, and took the part upon her father's encouragement.[35]
Andrews stated that at the time, she had "no idea" how to research a role or study a script, and citesCy Feuer's direction as being "phenomenal".[35]The Boy Friendbecame a hit, with Andrews receiving praise; critics called her the stand-out of the show.[36][35]In 1955, Andrews signed to appear withBing Crosbyin thetelevision film,High Tor. It filmed in November 1955 in Los Angeles and was Andrews's first screen project, which she described as "daunting".[35]High Torwas televised the following March before a live audience for theFord Star Jubilee, receiving lukewarm reviews.[37][35]
Near the end of her one-year run withThe Boy Friend, Andrews was approached to audition toAlan Jay LernerandFrederick Loewefor the role ofEliza DoolittleinMy Fair Lady.[35][38]She was offered the part during her third reading.[35]She later wrote that she felt she could "be Eliza, could find and understand her" if only someone were to "gently unravel the knotted ... string inside my stomach".[35]
During rehearsals, directorMoss Hartspent forty-eight consecutive hours solely with Andrews, where they "hammered through each scene"; Andrews later stated that "the good man had stripped [her] feelings bare ... moulded, kneaded, and helped [her] become the character of Eliza ... [and made] her part of [her] soul".[35]Andrews referred it as the best acting lesson she had ever received, later cementing the role with her "own touches and flourishes" and continuing to work on the character throughout her two-year run.[35]On 15 March 1956,My Fair Ladyopened on Broadway at theMark Hellinger Theatre. The play was a huge success with both the audience and critics, though soon after opening she learned she needed to tone down her learnedcockneyaccent so that the American audience could understand her, a change which was reversed at the West End performance a year later.[39]Andrews describes her performances as Eliza as "the great learning period" of her life.[35]
Richard Rodgerswas so impressed with Andrews's talent that concurrent with her run inMy Fair Ladyshe was featured in theRodgers and Hammersteintelevision musicalCinderella, which was written especially for her.[36][35]Cinderellawas broadcast live onCBSon 31 March 1957 under the musical direction ofAlfredo Antoniniand had an estimated 107 million viewers.[40][41]The show was broadcast live in colour from CBS Studio 72, at Broadway and 81st Street in New York: CBS' only East Coast colour studio.[35]Andrews was nominated for anEmmy Awardfor her role. She described the performance as "incredibly hard" and stated it took her "years to realise the enormity" of the production.[35][42]In 1957, Andrews released her debut solo album,The Lass with the Delicate Air, which harked back to her British music hall days.[43]The album includes performances of English folk songs as well as the World War II anthem, "London Pride", a patriotic song written byNoël Cowardin 1941 duringthe Blitz, which Andrews herself had survived.[43][44]
Between 1956 and 1962, Andrews guest-starred onThe Ed Sullivan Show(15 July 1956), and also appeared onThe Dinah Shore Chevy Show,What's My Line?,The Jack Benny Program,The Bell Telephone Hour, andThe Garry Moore Show. In June 1962, Andrews co-starred inJulie and Carol at Carnegie Hall, a CBS special withCarol Burnett. In 1960, Lerner and Loewe again cast her in a period musical as QueenGuinevereinCamelot, along withRichard Burton(asKing Arthur) and newcomerRobert Goulet. Andrews called the work "monumental" due to the heavy set costuming and detailed literary themes.[35]Camelot premiered at theMajestic Theatreto "adequate" reviews, which Andrews credited to off-set production issues and comparisons toMy Fair Lady.[35]The musical was substantially revised both before and during the show's Broadway run.[35]
Casting for thefilm adaptationofMy Fair Ladybegan in 1962; Alan Jay Lerner hoped for Andrews to reprise her role, butWarner Brothersstudio headJack Warnerdecided Andrews lacked sufficient name recognition; the part was played by the established film actressAudrey Hepburn, with the bulk of the singing dubbed byMarni Nixon. As Warner later recalled that the decision was made for financial purposes, stating, "In my business, I have to know who brings people and their money to a cinema box office. Audrey Hepburn had never made a financial flop."[45]Andrews later reflected that she understood her experience on Broadway "was within a very small pond" but wished she had been able to record her performance for posterity.[35]
In 1963, Andrews began work in thetitular roleofDisney's musical filmMary Poppins.Walt Disneyhad seen her performance inCamelotand subsequently offered her the role; Andrews initially declined because of pregnancy, returning to London to give birth, but Disney firmly insisted, saying, "We'll wait for you."[46]After the birth of her daughter, she received a call fromP. L. Travers, author of theMary Poppinsbook series, who told her, "Well, you're much too pretty of course. But you've got the nose for it."[35]Disney rented a house inToluca Lake, Los Angeles, for her family to reside in during production. Andrews relied largely on instinct for her portrayal, conceptualising her background and giving the character a "particular walk" and a turned-out stance to suit her ladylike sensibility.[35]Andrews referred to production as "unrelenting" given the physical exertion and technical details, saying that she "could not have asked" for a better introduction to film.[35]
Mary Poppinsbecame the biggest box-office draw in Disney history.Varietylauded Andrews's performance as a "signal triumph. ... She performs as easily as she sings, displaying a fresh type of beauty".[47]The film was nominated for thirteenAcademy Awardsand won five, including theAcademy Award for Best Actressfor Andrews's performance.[48]She also received theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, while Andrews and her co-stars won the 1965Grammy Award for Best Album for Children. As a measure of "sweet revenge", asPoppinssongwriterRichard M. Shermanput it, Andrews closed her acceptance speech at the Golden Globes by saying, "And, finally, my thanks to a man who made a wonderful movie and who made all this possible in the first place, Mr. Jack Warner."[46][49]My Fair Ladywas in direct competition for the awards.
Andrews starred oppositeJames Garnerin the comedy-drama war filmThe Americanization of Emily(1964).[35]Andrews took the role partly to avoid typecasting as a nanny.[35]Bosley CrowtherofThe New York Timescalled Andrews "irresistible ... with a brush of sentiment" in both her comedic and emotional scenes.[50]Andrews was nominated for theBAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. Andrews later described it as her favourite film, a sentiment shared by her co-star Garner.[51]Andrews starred inThe Sound of Music(1965), which was the highest-grossing film of its year.[52]Andrews later said she was "ashamed" to admit that she thought the musical "rather saccharine" before being cast.[35]Rehearsals took place in London before filming commenced inSalzburg, Austria, in 1964.[35]Filming was rather slow; because of weather conditions in Salzburg, the cast were "lucky" if they got a single shot's worth of scenes.[35]
Andrews stated she relied on lyrics to anchor her to the film's songs and utilised vocal interpretation to "convey" Maria's character by "[hanging] onto words and the images they conjured".[35]Andrews wrote that her senses were "suffused" with Austria, saying that the music "still" and "always lives in her soul".[35]The film received mixed reviews, though critics highlighted Andrews's performance; Crowther again praised her for her "air of radiant vigour ... plain-Jane wholesomeness and her ability to make her dialogue as vivid ... as she makes her songs".[53]For her performance asMaria von Trapp, Andrews won her secondGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. She was nominated a second time for theAcademy Award for Best Actressand theBAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role.[54]Andrews later wrote that the "gift" and "privilege" of portraying her first three film roles would have been "enough to satisfy" her for a lifetime.[35]
After completingThe Sound of Music, Andrews appeared as a guest star on the NBC-TV variety seriesThe Andy Williams Show. She followed this television appearance with an Emmy Award-winning special,The Julie Andrews Show, which featuredGene Kellyandthe New Christy Minstrelsas guests. It aired on NBC-TV in November 1965. In 1966, Andrews starred inHawaii, the highest-grossing film ofits year. Also in 1966, she starred oppositePaul NewmaninTorn Curtain, which was directed byAlfred Hitchcockand shot atUniversal Studios Hollywood.[35]Hitchcock gave Newman and Andrews relative free rein in dialogue during production.[35]She credits the director with teaching her extensively about lenses and camera-work.[35]During a press interview, she "made the mistake" of expressing her unhappiness with her performance and subsequently received a "terse" letter from Hitchcock, which Andrews later cited as an "important lesson".[35]The film received mixed reviews upon release.[55]
The following year, Andrews played the titular character inThoroughly Modern Millie(1967). Andrews described work on the film as a "pleasant distraction" for "allowing her to be something of a clown", as her stepfather died shortly before filming.[35]The film was a box office success; critics described Andrews as "very much the leading lady" and "absolutely darling" as well as "deliciously spirited and dry".[56][57]The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and Andrews scored a Golden Globe nomination for her performance.[58]At the time,Thoroughly Modern MillieandTorn Curtainwere the biggest and second-biggest hits inUniversal Pictureshistory, respectively.[59]
Andrews next appeared in two of Hollywood's most expensive flops:Star!(1968), a biopic ofGertrude Lawrence; andDarling Lili(1970), co-starringRock Hudsonand directed by her second husband,Blake Edwards. Andrews "went through her usual period of insecurity" during the production ofStar!, intensely analysing her choices for the character.[35]ChoreographerMichael Kiddworked closely with Andrews during the complicated musical numbers, which Andrews regarded as physically and mentally gruelling, coupled with her divorce from her first husband,Tony Walton.[35]TheNew York Timessingled out the film as "not one of [Andrews]'s best", whileVarietywrote her "carefully built-up" performance "sagged" with "overdone hoydenishness".[60][61]Despite reviews, her performance was once again nominated forGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.[62]Andrews regards her friendships with Kidd and directorRobert Wiseas her "greatest gifts" from the film.[35]
Edwards pitched the concept ofDarling Lilito Andrews two years prior to the start of production in 1968.[35]She prerecorded original songs for the film withHenry ManciniandJohnny Mercer.[35]Andrews citedDarling Lili's tepid reviews as being caused by studio marketing and postproduction issues.[35]While the film was a commercial bomb, theNew York Timespraised Andrews's performance, calling her an "unmitigated delight" and "perfect centerpiece" of the film, praising "her coolness and precision as a comedienne and a singer".[63]She was nominated for theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, while the film won both theGolden GlobeandAcademy Awardsfor Best Original Song.[64]Of these films, Andrews later wrote that "nonstop success in a career is impossible [...] but nobody sets out to make a failure, either".[35]
Andrews was the first choice to play the English witch Eglantine Price in Disney'sBedknobs and Broomsticks(1971);Angela Lansburywas cast.[65]Andrews continued working in television. In 1969, she shared the spotlight with singerHarry Belafontefor an NBC-TV special,An Evening with Julie Andrews and Harry Belafonte.

She guest-starred onThe Muppet Showin 1977,[66]and the following year, she appeared again with the Muppets on a CBS television variety special. The programme,Julie Andrews: One Step Into Spring, aired in March 1978, to mixed reviews and mediocre ratings. She made only two other films in the 1970s,The Tamarind Seed(1974) and10(1979), both successful at the box office and by critics' reviews.
In February 1980, Andrews headlined "Because We Care", a CBS-TV special with 30 major stars raising funds for Cambodian Famine victims through Operation California (now Operation USA, on whose Board she serves).

When she was the onlyTony Awardnominee for the production, she declined the nomination saying that she could not accept because she felt the entire production was snubbed.[71]
A botched vocal surgery in 1997 led to the loss of Andrews's singing voice, occasioning her refusal to sing on camera for several years.[72]Despite this, Andrews kept busy with many projects. In 1998, she appeared in a stage production ofDr. Dolittlein London. As recounted on the Julie Andrews website, she performed the voice of Polynesia the parrot and "recorded some 700 sentences and sounds, which were placed on a computer chip that sat in the mechanical bird's mouth.

Andrews marriedset designerTony Waltonon 10 May 1959 inWeybridge, Surrey.Maggie Smithwas a guest. Andrews and Walton first met in 1948 when Andrews was appearing at theLondon Casinoin the showHumpty Dumpty. In 1962, their daughter,Emma Walton Hamilton, was born.[125]They divorced in 1968.[126]
In November 1969, Andrews married directorBlake Edwards, who had been her companion for at least two years,[127][128]becoming stepmother to his children,Jenniferand Geoffrey.[129]In the 1970s, Edwards and Andrews adopted twoVietnamesedaughters, Amy (later known as Amelia) Leigh and Joanna Lynne.[130][131][132]They were married for 41 years, until Edwards's death at the age of 88 on 15 December 2010 at theSaint John's Health CenterinSanta Monica, California, due to complications ofpneumonia. Andrews was by her husband's side when he died.[133][134][135]Andrews is a grandmother to nine[136]and a great-grandmother to three.[137]
Andrews lives inSag Harbor, New York, where the Bay Street Theater was co-founded by her daughter Emma.[138]
Once termed "Britain's youngestprima donna",[139][140]Andrews's classically trainedsopranovoice,[141]lauded for its "pure and clear" sound,[142]has been described as light, bright and operatic in tone. When she was young, Andrews was taken by her parents to be examined by athroat specialist, the doctor concluded that she had "an almost adultlarynx".[143]Despite the continual encouragement to pursue opera by her voice teacher, English sopranoLilian Stiles-Allen, Andrews herself felt that her voice was unsuited for the genre and "too big a stretch". At the time, Andrews described her own voice as "extremely high and thin", feeling that it lacked "the necessary guts and weight for opera", preferring musical theatre instead.[144]
As Andrews aged, so did her voice, which began to deepen naturally. Losing her vast upper register, her "top notes" became increasingly difficult to sing while "her middle register matured into the warm golden tone" for which she has become known, according to Tim Wong ofThe Daily Telegraph.[143]Musically, she had always preferred singing music that was "bright and sunny", choosing to avoid songs that were sad or otherwise written in a minor key, for fear of losing her voice "in a mess of emotion". She cited this as another reason for avoiding opera.[143]
Andrews was forced to quit theVictor/Victoriastage production towards the end of the Broadway run in 1997 when she developed hoarseness in her voice.Liza Minnelliwas the replacement. She subsequently underwent surgery at New York'sMount Sinai Hospital, reportedly to remove non-cancerousnodulesfrom her throat,[1]though she later stated the hoarseness was due to "a certain kind of muscular striation [that] happens on the vocal cords"—itself the result of a strain fromVictor/Victoria(she added "I didn't have cancer, I didn't have nodules, I didn't have anything").[145]
Andrews emerged from the surgery with permanent damage that destroyed the purity of her singing and made her speaking voice raspy. In 1999, she filed a malpractice suit against the doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital, including Scott Kessler and Jeffrey Libin, who had operated on her throat. Originally, the doctors assured Andrews that she should regain her voice within six weeks, but Andrews's stepdaughter,Jennifer Edwards, said in 1999, "It's been two years, and it [her singing voice] still hasn't returned."[146]The lawsuit was settled in September 2000 for an undisclosed amount.[147]
Andrews admits that she has never recovered from the botched attempt to remove nodules from her vocal cords back in 1997. Her famous, four-octave soprano was then reduced to a fragile alto – she was quoted at the time as saying "I can sing the hell out of 'Old Man River.'"[108]
Subsequently, from 2000 onwards,Steven M. Zeitels, director of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Center for Laryngeal Surgery and Voice Rehabilitation, operated on her four times and, while able to improve her speaking voice, was unable to restore her singing.[72]
Over her career Andrews received numerous accolades including anAcademy Award, aBAFTA Award, sixGolden Globe Awards, threeGrammy Awards, and twoEmmy Awards. Despite being nominated for threeTony Awards, Andrews never won. In June 2022, Andrews was awarded theAFI Life Achievement Awardat a ceremony in Los Angeles after a two-year delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[148]In 2002, Andrews was ranked No. 59 in the BBC's poll of the100 Greatest Britons.[77]
Andrews published several books (mainly children's books and autobiographies) under her name, as well as her married names Julie Andrews Edwards and Julie Edwards.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
