Tárpremiered at the79th Venice International Film Festivalin September 2022, where Blanchett won theVolpi Cup for Best Actress. Following a three-weeklimited theatrical release, it received awide releaseon October 28, 2022 throughFocus Features.Tárreceived critical acclaim, especially for Blanchett's performance and Field's screenplay and direction. At the95th Academy Awards,Tárwas nominated for 6 awards, includingBest Picture. Blanchett won Best Actress at theBAFTAs,Golden Globes, andCritics' Choice Awards.
Lydia Tár ischief conductorof a Berlin orchestra. Lydia heavily relies on Francesca, her personal assistant and confidant. While being interviewed byAdam GopnikatThe New YorkerFestival, Lydia promotes her upcoming live recording ofMahler's Fifth Symphonyand memoirTár on Tár. She meets with Eliot Kaplan, an investment banker and amateur conductor who co-founded the Accordion Foundation with Lydia to support aspiring female conductors. They discuss technique, replacing Lydia's assistant conductor Sebastian, and filling a vacant cello position in Berlin.
As a guest lecturer, Lydia holds a masterclass atJuilliard. When a student expresses their reluctance to studyJ. S. Bach's works due to his race and gender, she encourages the class to focus on the music, rather than the composer's identity. The debate escalates and Lydia and the student exchange insults. Later that night Lydia anonymously receives a first edition ofVita Sackville-West's novelChallenge. The title page has been embellished with a handdrawnkenépattern, a personal reminder of her trip to Perú. She tears up the page and then throws it away, along with the book.
Lydia flies back to Berlin, where she lives with her wife Sharon (who isconcertmasterof the orchestra) and their adopted daughter Petra. Before ablind auditionfor the cello position, Lydia spots a young Russian candidate, Olga Metkina, in the bathroom. Lydia changes her scorecard to ensure Olga a spot in the orchestra and grants her a soloist position in the companion piece,Elgar's Cello Concerto. Lydia's attraction to Olga causes her relationships with Francesca and Sharon to grow strained.
Krista Taylor is a promising young musician who has beenblacklistedafter getting on the bad side of her former mentor, Lydia. After sending desperate emails to Francesca, Krista kills herself, and Krista's parents plan to sue. Lydia instructs Francesca to delete the emails and retain a lawyer. Lydia informs Sebastian of his replacement. Incensed, he indicates the orchestra is aware of her favoritism and that it suggests inappropriate behavior. Due to Sebastian's accusations, Lydia decides to not promote Francesca to assistant conductor.
Lydia is haunted by an increasingsensitivity to sound, vivid surreal nightmares, daytime hallucinations, chronic pain, and enigmatic patterned scribbles resembling those Krista once made. While jogging in the park, Lydia hears a screaming woman in the distance. While trying to complete a composition "For Petra", she is disturbed by the sound of a medical device next door, where her neighbor is caring for her dying mother. A manipulatively edited cellphone video of Lydia's Juilliard class goes viral and an article accusing her of sexual predation appears in theNew York Post. Lydia urgently tries to reach Francesca who has resigned from her position and is now working with Krista's lawyers on their deposition. Furious, Lydia breaks into Francesca's home to find that it is completely empty and abandoned. Lydia takes the front page of the proofs toTár on Tár, which Francesca renamedRat on Rat. Lydia, accompanied by Olga, returns to New York City to attend the deposition in the lawsuit of Krista's parents and to promote her book; they are met by protestors. During the deposition, the plaintiffs ask Lydia about incriminating emails between Lydia and Krista which Francesca provided.
In Berlin, Lydia is removed as conductor due to the controversy. Furious over the allegations and Lydia's lack of communication, Sharon bars her from seeing their daughter. Lydia retreats to her old studio and grows increasingly depressed and deranged. She sneaks into the live recording she was supposed to conduct and tackles her replacement, Eliot. Advised to lie low by her management agency, she returns to her modest childhood home onStaten Island, where certificates of achievement bearing her birth name, Linda Tarr, hang on the wall. She tears up watching an oldVHSofYoung People's Concertsin whichLeonard Bernsteindiscusses the meaning of music. Her brother Tony arrives and admonishes her for forgetting her roots.
Sometime in the future, Lydia finds work conducting in the Philippines. Seeking a massage, the hotel concierge sends her to a brothel fronting as a massage parlor; the young women sit in a semicircle with numbers on their robes. Number 5 looks directly at Lydia, and Lydia rushes outside to vomit. Later on, she conducts a live performance of the score for the video game seriesMonster Hunterin front of an audience ofcosplayers.
It was announced in April 2021 that Blanchett would star in and executive-produce the film, which would be written and directed byTodd Field.[12][13]In a statement accompanying the teaser trailer in August 2022, Field said that he wrote the script for Blanchett, and that he would not have made the film if she had declined it.[14]In September 2021,Nina HossandNoémie Merlantjoined the cast, andHildur Guðnadóttirbecame the film's composer.[15]
Filming began in August 2021 inBerlin.[16]In an interview withThe Guardianin October,Mark Strongrevealed that he had finished filming scenes for the film.[17]In November, it was reported thatSophie Kauer,Julian Glover,Allan Cordunerand Sylvia Flote had joined the cast.[18](Kauer is a British-German classical cellist who studied at theRoyal Academy of Music.)[19]Alldiegetic musicwas recorded live on-set, including Blanchett's piano playing, Kauer's cello, and theDresden Philharmonic's performances.[20][21]
Tárhad its world premiere at the79th Venice International Film Festivalon September 1, 2022,[22]and had its first North American screening at the49th Telluride Film Festivalon September 3, 2022.[23]It had a limited theatrical release on October 7, 2022, then expanded to wide release on October 28.[24][18]
The film was released forVODon November 15, 2022, followed by aBlu-ray,DVD, and4K UHDrelease on December 20.[25]By March 9, 2023, according toSamba TV, the film had been streamed onPeacockin 458,000 households in the US since the Oscar nomination announcement on January 24. JustWatch also reported it to be, by February 21, the third most-streamed Best Picture nominee in Canada.[26][27]
Aconcept albumwas released on October 21, 2022, featuring Guðnadóttir's score with theLondon Contemporary Orchestraconducted byRobert Ames, and a rehearsal of Gustav Mahler'sFifth Symphonywith Blanchett conducting the Dresden Philharmonic. Cellist Sophie Kauer plays Elgar's Cello Concerto on the album, backed by theLondon Symphony Orchestraconducted by Natalie Murray Beale.[28]For the week ending November 5, 2022, theTárconcept album toppedBillboardmagazine'sTraditional Classical Albumsat number one.[29]
John Mauceriserved as consultant on Field's script, helping inform the tenor and accuracy of Lydia Tár's comments on classical music and musicians.[30]
Tárgrossed $6.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $22.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $29.2 million.[5][4]
In the United States and Canada, it made $158,620 from four theaters in its opening weekend. The $39,655 per-screen average was the second highest of 2022 for a limited release. In its second weekend the film made $330,030 from 36 theaters. In its third weekend it made $500,035 from 141 theaters, and there was speculation in the trades thatTárwas an example that there was still a place for "adult-minded fare".[31][32][33]However, onceTárexpanded to 1,087 theaters in its fourth weekend, leaving the limited specialty house run for the multiplex, it made only $1.02 million, finishing 10th. Audiences surveyed byPostTrakover the weekend gave the film a 72% positive score, with 42% saying they would definitely recommend it.[34]In its second week of wide release, it made $729,605 (marking a drop of 30%).[35]
Some commentators attributed the poor US domestic box office performance to the film's subject matter alienating a general audience.[36]Others noted a larger trend in US art houses, 40% of which had permanently shuttered during theCOVID-19 pandemic, struggling to regain their core 40–70 year-old audience, an audience more prone to health concerns and still hesitant to return to the cinema.[37][38]The New York Timesreported thatTár"cost at least $35 million including marketing," and that it and similarhighbrowfilms from established filmmakers such asPaul Thomas Anderson'sLicorice Pizza,Guillermo del Toro'sNightmare Alley, andSteven Spielberg'sThe Fabelmanshad "failed to find an audience big enough to justify their costs".[39]78% of the film's box office takings were overseas.[40]
OnRotten Tomatoes, 91% of 356 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's consensus reads, "Led by the soaring melody of Cate Blanchett's note-perfect performance,Tárriffs brilliantly on the discordant side of fame-fueled power."[41]Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 93 out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[42]
Owen Gleibermanin his Venice Film FestivalDaily Varietyreview wrote:
Let me say right up front: It's the work of a master filmmaker ... Field's script is dazzling in its conversational flow, its insider dexterity, its perception of how power in the world actually works ...Táris not a judgement so much as a statement you can make your own judgment about. The statement is: We're in a new world.[43]
A. O. ScottofThe New York Timeswriting from theTelluride Film Festivaland later from theNew York Film Festivalstated:
I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie quite likeTár. Field balances Apollonian restraint with Dionysian frenzy.Táris meticulously controlled and also scarily wild. Field finds a new way of posing the perennial question about separating the artist from the art, a question that he suggests can only be answered by another question: are you crazy? We don't care about Tár because she's an artist. We care about her because she's art.[44][45]
Justin Changfor theLos Angeles Timesregarded the film as:
"Both a superb character study and a highly persuasive piece of world building", stating that the director's "storytelling draws no artificial distinction between the big and the small, the important and the mundane; everything we see and hear matters.[46]Táris irreducible, and it is great."[47]
Alissa Wilkinson, writing forVox, observed:
"Not to be hyperbolic, but it might be perfect. Todd Field  has tuned his themes so brilliantly. You can’t just half-watchTár,it demands your full attention. That’s the mark of good art, but it’s a discipline so many contemporary films aren’t willing to demand from audiences. And if you’re honest with yourself, you don’t just watchTár;it watches you, too.”[48]
Reviewing the film forThe Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney wrote:
Tármarks yet another career peak for Blanchett—many are likely to argue her greatest—and a fervent reason to hope it's not sixteen more years before Field gives us another feature. It's a work of genius.[49]
Anthony LaneofThe New Yorkerstated:
To what extent she is a proven predator; how much she deserves to be preyed upon, in turn, by the gluttons of public indignation; and why, despite everything, she should enjoy our lingering sympathy in a way that a middle-aged man in her position would not: such issues will, no doubt, be aired and contested in due course. Field is wise enough to reserve judgment. It would be dead wrong, though, to considerTáras a kind of op-ed made flesh.[50]
Lane's colleagueRichard Brodydisagreed and argued in his capsule review thatTárwas:
"a regressive film that takes bitter aim at so-calledcancel cultureand lampoons so-calledidentity politics"[51]
and laments Field's "absence of style" in filming the music. He accuses the film of "conservative button-pushing" with a narrow aesthetic, failing to achieve dramatic unity.
Martin Scorsesepresenting Field with the2022 New York Film Critics Circle AwardsBest Film of the Year, said,
For so long now, so many of us see films that pretty much let us know where they're going ... I mean, they take us by the hand and, even if it's disturbing at times, sort of comfort us along the way that it will be all okay by the end. Now this is insidious, as one can get lulled into this and ultimately get used to it, leading those of us who've experienced cinema in the past – as much more than that – to become despairing of the future of the art form, especially for younger generations. But that's on dark days. The clouds lifted when I experienced Todd's film,Tár. What you've done, Todd – is that the very fabric of the movie you created doesn't allow this. All the aspects of cinema and the film that you've used, attest to this ... conveyed through a masterful mise-en-scène, as controlled, precise, dangerous, precipitous angles and edges geometrically kind of chiseled into wonderful frame compositions. The limits of the frame itself, and the provocation of measured long takes all reflecting the brutal architecture of her soul – Tár's soul.[52]
Paul Thomas Andersonpresenting Field with the Director Medallion at the 75th annual DGA Awards said,
Every detail matters in this film. Nothing is not deliberate or full of intention. It's directed with such perfectly controlled mayhem and glee by Todd, it's really hard not to drool as another director. He made a film which for some years was considered a very dirty word, he made anartfilm. But it's art that's not fussy or pretentious. Just razor-sharp, pitch black, and hilarious. A very focused mirror held up to some of the worst of our human behaviors. It's also a blast.[53]
In an interview withThe Sunday Times, conductorMarin Alsopshared her dislike of the film, calling it "anti-woman", saying "I was offended: I was offended as a woman, I was offended as a conductor, I was offended as a lesbian. To have an opportunity to portray a woman in that role and to make her an abuser – for me that was heartbreaking."[54]In response, Blanchett toldBBC Radio 4, the film was a "meditation on power, and power is genderless", and that while her character shares similarities with Alsop, it is a complete work of fiction.[55]
Writing inThe Guardian, conductor Alice Farnham thanked Blanchett, Field, and the film for "taking up the baton for female conductors", and for normalising their image.[56]Critic Emily Bootle also defended the film in theinewspaperwriting: "This is a film about power [but] sometimes we have to tolerate grey areas."[57]Film criticsMark KermodeandSimon Mayoalso disagreed with the interpretation thatTáris "anti-woman."[58]
Writing forTime,Stephanie Zacharekwent further: "Tárdoesn't offer anything as comfortable as redemption, and it asks us to fall in love, at least a little, with a tyrant. ... Lydia Tár ... knows that the power of a question is greater than that of a slogan."[59]
Music professorIan Pacediscussed the issue inThe Conversation: "It would be rash to assume that such a figure could never act in a predatory and exploitative manner. This is not just an issue of identity, but power and the opportunities it provides for the reckless."[60]Conductor Don Baton (a pen name) inCity Journalagreed.[61]
Film critic John McDonald for theAustralian Financial Reviewwrote: "Had it been a male conductor, the story would have been a cliché. Had it been a celebration of female power, it would have been no less superficial ... Field has taken the 'Maestro myth' that portrays the conductor as a kind of hypermale and shown that the same issues may apply to a woman."[62][63]Several other conductors and musicians wrote in defense of the film.[64]
Yo Yo Matoldindiewire"Todd has created such a striking film. Cate Blanchett’s Lydia Tár demands that we wrestle with two of art’s most difficult questions: what gives art its power and what role does power play in art?"[65]
In her critique forThe New York Review of Bookstitled "The Instrumentalist", prize-winning novelist and professorZadie Smithcommended Cate Blanchett's performance,[66]and the classroom scene at theJuilliard Schoolwas described byA. O. Scottas "a mini-course in the dos and don'ts of contemporary pedagogy."[67][68]
CriticAmanda Hesswrote inThe New York Times, "The online cancellation of an artistic giant can be a tedious subject, but inTár, it acquires sneaky complications ...Tároffers up a work into which we can sublimate our ownSchadenfreudeand sympathy for abusers. Thanks to Blanchett's luminous performance and Field's puzzle-box storytelling, we are freed to obsess."[69]
Film critic Howie Movshovitz,[70]critic and essayist Philippa Snow (ArtReview),[71]Murielle Joudet (Le Monde)[72]and Guillaume Orignac (Cahiers du Cinéma) draw attention to the film's creative open-endedness, allowing audiences to draw their own conclusions about its significance and meaning.[73]
The New York TimescolumnistMichelle Goldbergargued thatTáris "a film aboutcancel culture, making it the rare piece of art that looks squarely at this social phenomenon that has roiled so many of America's meaning-making institutions ...Tárdemonstrates that all this flux and uncertainty is very fertile territory for art. Hopefully its success – many are predicting it will win a Best Picture Oscar – will encourage others to take on similarly thorny and unsettled issues. Hysteria about cancel culture can encourage artistic timidity by overstating the cost of probing taboos. In truth, there's a hunger out there for work that takes the strangeness of this time and turns it into something that transcends polemic."[74]Similarly, Ara Osterweil inArt Forumwrote, "Todd Field's brilliant character study (...) suggest(s) that the ritual excommunications of cancel culture may be as exaggerated as the generic fantasies enacted by Tár’s gamer audience."[75]
Austrian musicologist and anthropologist Bernd Brabec alleged that part of Lydia Tár's biography read aloud byAdam Gopnikmines hisCV.[76][77]In response, Brabec wrote an open letter[78]to director Todd Field. In the letter, Brabec takes offence at the film mirroring particulars of his academic background and criticizes what he characterized as unfortunately minimal and shallow treatment of theShipibo-Konibopeople in the plot of the film. However, Amanda M. Smith, associate professor of Latin American and Culture at theUniversity of Californiawrote inReVista, theHarvard Reviewof Latin America, "Shipibo-Konibo cosmovision is not merely decorative in the film. It organizes the narrative's internal conflicts and revealsTáras a tale of shamanic justice in a world where theGlobal Northcontinues to take from the Global South."[79]
Because the film was released in the United Kingdom in January 2023,Tárwas included inSight and Sound's Best Films of 2023,[80]and sat atop the polls ofNew Statesman[81]andTime Out, with Phil de Semlyen ofTime Outwriting "Blanchett's Oscar-nominated performance has rightly earned the lion's share of plaudits, but the superb acting is buoyed by Field's subtly off-kilter visual style, lending the 'ripped from the headlines' narrative a hint ofKubrickianuncanniness."[82]The Guardianalso choseTáras best film of the year, with critic Wendy Ide writing, “Todd Field's creation of the magnificent, monstrous fictional conductor Lydia Tár, inhabited down to the last shred of cruelty and ambition by the remarkable Cate Blanchett, is exceptional: a savage, slippery account of rampant narcissism brought down to earth.”[83]In April 2024 the historianSimon Heffer, expressing his opinion inThe Sunday Telegraph, wroteTáris "the finest American film of the century."[84]
The March 2023 issue ofNew Yorkmagazine listedTáralongsideCitizen Kane,Sunset Boulevard,Dr. Strangelove,Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,The Conversation,Nashville,Taxi Driver,The Elephant Man,Pulp Fiction,There Will Be Blood,Roma, andIn the Bedroom, also directed by Field, as "The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars".[85]
The March 2024 issue ofindiewirelistedTár, andIn the Bedroom, also directed by Field, as "Best Picture Nominees that Deserved to win the Oscar", stating, "Todd Field's portrait of the talent and ego of a world-renowned conductor is some of the most riveting and ambitious filmmaking in recent memory.Tárfeels like a movie people will be talking about and debating long after the ceremony where it lost fades from memory."[86]
Among other accolades,Tárreceived sixAcademy Awardnominations, includingBest Director,Best Actressfor Blanchett,Best Original Screenplay,Best Cinematography, andBest Film Editing.[87]

Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

William Todd Field(born February 24, 1964) is an American filmmaker and actor. He is known for directingIn the Bedroom(2001),Little Children(2006), andTár(2022), which were nominated for a combined fourteenAcademy Awards. Field has personally received sixAcademy Awardnominations for his films; two forBest Picture, two forBest Adapted Screenplay, one forBest Director, and one forBest Original Screenplay.[1]
Before establishing himself as a filmmaker, Field appeared as an actor in such films asVictor Nuñez'sRuby in Paradise(1993),Nicole Holofcener'sWalking and Talking(1996), andStanley Kubrick'sEyes Wide Shut(1999). He also co-created the concept forbubble gumbrandBig League Chew.
Field was born inPomona, California, where his family ran a poultry farm.[2]When Field turned two, his family moved toPortland, Oregon, where his father went to work as a salesman, and his mother became a school librarian. At an early age, he became interested in performing sleight-of-hand and later music.[3][4]
As a child in Portland, Field was abatboyfor thePortland Mavericks, a single A independentminor league baseballteam owned by Hollywood actorBing Russell.Kurt Russell, Bing's son and later an actor in his own right, also played for the Portland Mavericks during this time.[5]Field and Mavericks pitching coach Rob Nelson created the first batch ofBig League Chewin the Field family kitchen. In 1980, Nelson and formerNew York Yankeesall-starJim Boutonsold the idea to theWrigley Company. Since that time more than a billion pouches have been sold worldwide.[6][7][8][9]
A budding jazz musician, at the age of sixteen Field became a member of the Lab Band atMount Hood Community Collegein Gresham, Oregon. Headed by Larry McVey, the band had become a proving-ground and regular stop forStan KentonandMel Torméwhen they were looking for new players. It was here Field played trombone along with his friend, trumpeter and future Grammy Award WinnerChris Botti. During this same time he also worked as a non-union projectionist at a second-run movie theater. Field graduated with his class fromCentennial High Schoolon Portland's east side and briefly attended Southern Oregon State College (nowSouthern Oregon University) inAshlandon a music scholarship, but left after his freshman year favoring a move to New York to study acting with Robert X. Modica at his renownedCarnegie HallStudio.[10]Soon after, Field began performing with the Ark Theatre Company as both an actor and musician.[11]
Field first appeared in motion pictures afterWoody Allencast him inRadio Days(1987), and went on to work with filmmakers such asStanley Kubrick,Victor Nuñez, andCarl Franklin.[12]
Kevin Thomasof theLos Angeles Timessummarized Field's acting career in his review ofBroken Vessels(1999):
"Field has a deceptive facade of all-American clean-cut looks that allows him to suggest a wide range of emotions and thoughts behind such a regular-guy appearance; inRuby in Paradisehe expressed such uncommon decency and intelligence you had to wonder howAshley Judd's hardscrabble Ruby could ever have considered letting him get away. InEyes Wide Shuthe's the likable med school dropout turned saloon piano player, and here he's an increasingly raging sociopath. In all these roles Field has the precious gift of being able to surprise you and to command your attention on screen."[13]
Franklin and Nuñez, bothAFIalumni, encouraged Field to enroll as a Directing Fellow at theAFI Conservatory, which he did in 1992.[4]His thesis film,Nonnie & Alex, received a Jury Prize at the 1995Sundance Film Festival.[14]Other short films he made outside of school were exhibited at venues overseas and domestically at theMuseum of Modern Art.[15]
Field began his filmmaking career in 2001 when he wrote and directedIn the Bedroom, a film based onAndre Dubus's short story "Killings". (Kubrick and Dubus were among Field's mentors; both died right before the production ofIn the Bedroom.)In the Bedroomwas nominated for fiveAcademy AwardsincludingBest Picture,Best Actor(Tom Wilkinson, his first nomination),Best Actress(Sissy Spacek, her sixth),Supporting Actress(Marisa Tomei, her second), andBest Adapted Screenplay. The film was shot inRockland, Maine, a New England town where Field resides. The house where he, his wife (Serena Rathbun), and their four children live was even used as the setting for one sequence.[16]Rathbun and Spacek did some of the set design and Field handled the camera himself on many of the shots.
In the Bedroommade its debut at the 2001Sundance Film Festival.Dennis Limwrote in theVillage Voice:
"Todd Field's debut feature,In the Bedroom, alighted on the snowy peaks of Sundance last January as if from another universe. Here was a small miracle of patience and composure, so starkly removed from everything the festival had come to represent that it seemed almost to herald the overdue coming-of-age of American independent film."[17]
Upon the film's releaseDavid AnsenofNewsweekwrote:
"Todd Field exhibits a mastery of his craft many filmmakers never acquire in a lifetime. With one film he's guaranteed his future as a director. He has the magnificent obsession of the natural-born filmmaker."[18][19]
Anthony Quinn ofThe Independentstated,
"Field has pulled off something here I thought no American filmmaker would ever manage again: he makes violence feel genuinely shocking."[20]
For his work onIn the Bedroom, Field was named Director of the Year by theNational Board of Review, and his script was awardedBest Original Screenplay. The film was namedBest Pictureof the Year by theLos Angeles Film Critics Association, and theNew York Film Critics Circleawarded Field Best First Film.In the Bedroomreceived sixAmerican Film Institute Awards, including Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay, threeGolden Globenominations, and fiveAcademy Awardnominations, includingBest Picture, Actor, Actress, Supporting Actress, and two individually for Field as screenwriter and producer. TheAmerican Film Institutehonored Field with theFranklin SchaffnerAlumni Medal.

After years spent doing research for abiopicof 19th-century stage actorEdwin BoothtitledTime Between Trains, Field resurfaced withLittle Childrenin 2006.[22][23]The film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including two for the actors:Kate Winslet(her fifth nomination, and with it a record for the youngest actor to be nominated for five Academy Awards) andJackie Earle Haley(his first nomination and first major role in over 15 years). With just two films, Field had garnered five Academy Award nominations for his actors and three for himself. Initially conceived as a miniseries,[24]the film, based onTom Perrotta'snovel of the same name, made its premiere at the 2006 New York Film Festival. In his roundup "Best of 2006",A.O. ScottofThe New York Timeswrote:
"The first time you see Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel, you may remark on the director's impressive control over the unruly source material and the emotional agility of the cast, Kate Winslet in particular. The second time, the film's lurid, crazy side is more apparent, and the intensity of the supporting performances—Noah Emmerich, Jackie Earle Haley,Phyllis Somerville—creep into the foreground. This movie, Mr. Field's second feature...is a complicated blend of gothic, melodrama and sexual comedy, unerringly attuned to the varieties of human failure."[25]
International Cinephile Society's Matt Mazur called the film "subversive" and designed to disorient the viewer with "seemingly non-connected imagery to suggest a tone and a mood of disquiet." Mazur compared Field's technique with that ofSergei Eisenstein,D. W. Griffith,Georges Méliès, andEdwin S. Porter.[26]
Many members of Field's creative team onIn the Bedroomreturned to work with him on the film, including Serena Rathbun. In a 2006 interview withThe Hollywood Reporter'sAnne Thompson, Field said he quit acting and began making his own films after Rathbun told him, "Do what you want to do. Don't get distracted."[27]Later that year, Field spoke extensively about the importance of Rathbun as his creative partner, describing a conversation he had with her where she gave him the most pivotal scene: "for me, the film is unthinkable without it."[28]
AfterLittle Children, Field went fifteen years without directing another film, which various journalists lamented.[29]In his 2015Ioncinemapiece "Top 10 American Indie Filmmakers Missing in Action", Nicholas Bell wrote, "It is definitely time for Field to throw one down the middle. In the meantime, we'll just have to watchIn the Bedroomfor the umpteenth time."[30]
However, during this period Field did write a number of film and television projects that never came to fruition, including adaptations of the novelsBlood Meridian,[31][32]Beautiful Ruins[33]andPurity.[34]He also worked for almost a decade on a film adaptation of the 2010Boston TerannovelThe Creed of Violence, set during theMexican Revolution, which at different times was set to starLeonardo DiCaprio,[35]Christian Bale[36]andDaniel Craig.[37]It had also been reported that Field might direct acoming-of-agescript set in the 1970s Northwest based on his experiences with theMinor League Baseballteam thePortland Mavericks, thatKurt Russellwas involved in.[7][38]
Speaking publicly for the first time in sixteen years, Field toldThe New York Timesin 2022, "I set my sights in a very particular way on certain material that was probably very tough to get made."[39]Later, when asked if he would ever consider reviving any of his past projects, Field replied "[They're] kind of like a family plot. You have these littleheadstones, and you have a passing acquaintance with and occasionally drop flowers on, but I don't want to dig any of them up."[40]
Over those same years Field worked in advertising, directing spots for such brands asXbox,[41]Captain Morgan,[42]Corona,[43]BMW,[44]NASCAR[45]andGE.[46]Reflecting on his advertising work over these years he stated "I've been directing constantly, I feel much stronger as a director than I ever felt with those previous films."[47]
Field's third film,Tár, starringCate Blanchettas the fictional conductor/composer Lydia Tár, premiered at the79th Venice International Film Festival, where it competed for theGolden LionandQueer Lion, with Blanchett winning theVolpi Cup for Best Actress.[48]The film had alimited theatrical releasein the United States on October 7, 2022, before itswide releaseon October 28, 2022, and International theatrical release that began first in the UK on 13 January 2023.[49]Tárreceived six nominations for the95th Academy Awards, includingBest Picture,Best DirectorandBest Original Screenplayfor Field, andBest Actressfor Blanchett, and five nominations from the76th British Academy Film Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Sound, and Best Screenplay of the Year.[50][51]
For his work onTár, Field was nominated by theDirectors Guild of Americafor Best Director, theProducers Guild of Americafor Best Film, and theWriters Guild of Americafor Best Original Screenplay.[52][53][54]He was named Best Director of the Year by theLondon Film Critics' CircleandLos Angeles Film Critics Association, and his script named Best Original Screenplay.[55][56]
Táris the fourth film in history to be named Best of the Year by theNew York Film Critics Circle, theLos Angeles Film Critics Association, theLondon Film Critics' Circleas well as theNational Society of Film Critics.[57]More critics listed the film Best of the Year than any other released in 2022, includingThe Atlantic,Entertainment Weekly,The Guardian,The Hollywood Reporter,Screen Daily,Vanity Fair, andVariety; plus,IndieWire's annual poll of 165 critics worldwide who also named Field "Best Director of the Year" and his script "Best Screenplay."[58][59][60]
Owen Gleibermanin his Venice Film FestivalDaily Varietyreview wrote:
"Let me say right up front: It's the work of a master filmmaker...Táris not a judgement so much as a statement you can make your own judgment about. The statement is: We're in a new world."[61]
A. O. ScottofThe New York Timeswriting from theTelluride Film Festivaland later from theNew York Film Festivalstated,
"I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie quite likeTár. Field balancesApollonian restraint with Dionysian frenzy.Táris meticulously controlled and also scarily wild. Field finds a new way of posing the perennial question about separating the artist from the art, a question that he suggests can only be answered by another question: are you crazy? We don't care about Tár because she's an artist. We care about her because she's art."[62][63]
Robbie Collin, ofThe Daily Telegraph, wrote:
"Field himself was a protégé of Stanley Kubrick, andTárfeels Kubrickian in many respects: its formal mastery, its exceptional acting, its atmosphere that clings like mist. But like Kubrick’s own projects, it’s something you really never have seen before.”[64]
Martin Scorsesepresenting Best Film of the Year to Field at the2022 New York Film Critics Circle Awards, praised his filmmaking saying,
"For so long now, so many of us see films that pretty much let us know where they're going... but that's on dark days. The clouds lifted when I experienced Todd's film,Tár."[65]
Paul Thomas Andersonpraised Field when presenting him with his Director Medallion at the75th annual DGA Awardssaying,
"Every detail matters in this film. Nothing is not deliberate or full of intention. It's directed with such perfectly controlled mayhem and glee by Todd, it's really hard not to drool as another director."[66]
OnJosh OlsonandJoe Dante'sThe Movies That Made Mepodcast, Field listed ten of his favorite films, which includedMan with a Movie Camera(1929),The Big Parade(1925),The Servant(1963),I Am Cuba(1964),Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors(1965),Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid(1969),Murmur of the Heart(1971),Opening Night(1977),The Meetings of Anna(1978) andNo End(1985).[67]
Field has citedGeorge Roy Hill,Alan J. Pakula,John Ford,Stanley KubrickandSteven Spielbergas the directors who inspired him when he was a young person.[68]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
