The film was premiered at theOutfestfilm festival on July 24, 2022, and was released via streaming onPeacockon August 5, 2022. It received mixed reviews from critics, who complimented its inclusive cast and subject matter but found the execution of the story lacking.
At night, a mysterious figure kills a person driving to aconversion campknown as Whistler Camp. In the morning, a group ofLGBTQyouth arrive at Whistler Camp, run by Owen Whistler. He introduces the camp as an inclusive safe space and promises that they will not try to forcibly convert them. Owen separates the campers into cabins for boys and girls, but Jordan, who isnon-binary, is not comfortable going to either. Owen assigns Jordan to the boys' cabin. The group comes together in a circle and shares why they came to Whistler Camp. Jordan says they made a deal with their religious family to attend for a week so they couldlegally emancipatethemself. The next morning, Owen criticizes andoutsanother member, Alexandra, for not sharing that she istrans. He makes her go to the boys' cabin for dishonesty. Alexandra later convinces the camp's new nurse, Molly, to give herestradiol, anestrogen hormone.
The group partakes in activities overseen by former member and athletics director Zane and his fiancée, activities director Sarah. One night, Owen splits the group into pairs, handcuffing them together, and instructs them to walk into the woods alone. The group is hesitant, but Owen promises that they will regroup in the morning. Jordan and Alexandra see a mysterious person in the woods. The next day, the camp'stherapist, Dr. Cora Whistler, belittles members of the group for their sexualities and gender identities, including Jordan. Affected by Dr. Cora's words, Jordan returns to the boy's cabin upset but is cheered up when the group hosts a dance party to "Perfect" byPink. That night, Jordan sneaks into the main office and discovers photographs that show the history of Whistler Camp, including the torturing of children. Jordan is caught by Molly, who says she did not know and promises to protect the group. The camp's groundskeeper, Balthazar, is killed by the mysterious figure while observing the girls showering through a spy cam.
The next day, the group is divided by gender. Owen takes the boys to ashooting rangewhile the girls makepiesfor the boys. Jordan defeats Zane in a shooting competition. Owen reverts to calling Jordan "he" instead of "they". Owen instructs Toby, agay man, to shoot Owen's dog, Duke, because Duke hascancer. If he refuses to do so, Zane will start to torture Duke by breaking the dog's legs. Jordan kills Duke instead and storms off. Jordan, Alexandra, and Toby agree to leave Whistler Camp in the morning. Gabriel seduces Stu and they have sex before Gabriel calls Owen and Zane, revealing he secretly works for Whistler Camp. They punish Stu withaversion therapy, a form ofelectroshocktorture that Owen says will make Stuheterosexual. Upon finding Stu unconscious, Molly quits and says she will go to the police. Owen threatens her to stay. The mysterious figure butchers Zane and Sarah and fatally electrocutes Gabriel.
Every person at Whistler Camp comes together after finding the dead bodies. The murderer kills Cora. Alexandra leads the younger members out of the camp. The murderer reveals herself to be Molly. Her real name is Angie Phelps. She murdered the real Molly to take her place as the camp nurse. Angie attended Whistler Camp and was tortured there by Owen. She made it her mission to close every conversion camp in existence by killing the complicit employees. Angie attacks Owen but is unable to gain the upper hand. Jordan takes Owen's gun but does not shoot, giving Angie the opportunity to kill Owen herself. Angie tries talking Jordan into helping her, but Jordan refuses. The police arrest Angie. The group agrees to live their lives to the fullest.

It was released as a digital release byUniversal Picturesin the United Kingdom in December 2022.
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 34% of 71 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Although it deserves credit for its strong cast and inclusive premise,They/Themis too tonally messy to cut more than skin deep."[13]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[14]
Writing for theNew York Times, Calum Marsh said: "Logan, who also wrote the screenplay, feels so averse to engaging with the thorny political implications inherent in this material—of having to negotiate a cast of gay, transgender and nonbinary characters in a horror context—that the whole thing winds up seeming rather tame."[15]Peter Debruge ofVarietywrote: "It's so committed to affirmational messages about queer identity not being a choice, a condition or a legitimate motive to get axed by a deranged serial killer that the movie all but forgets to be scary—although enlisting Kevin Bacon as too-genial-to-be-trusted camp overseer Owen Whistler nearly makes it work."[16]
Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying: "As a director, Logan knows how to put us through the horror genre paces, from jump scares and mysterious sounds in the woods, to the obligatory gruesome kills. Time and again, though, we're reminded that real monster inThey/Themis bigotry and intolerance."[17]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
