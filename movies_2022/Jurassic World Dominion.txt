Jurassic World Dominionis a 2022 Americanscience fictionaction filmdirected byColin Trevorrow, who co-wrote the screenplay withEmily Carmichaelfrom a story byDerek Connollyand Trevorrow. ThesequeltoJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom(2018), it is the third installment in theJurassic Worldseriesand the sixth installment overall in theJurassic Parkfilm series, concluding the original storyline that began withJurassic Park(1993).Chris Pratt,Bryce Dallas Howard,BD Wong, andOmar Syreprise their roles from the previous films, along withLaura Dern,Jeff Goldblum, andSam Neill, who appear together for the first time since the originalJurassic Park. Also joining the cast wereDeWanda WiseandMamoudou Athie.
The film is set four years after the events ofFallen Kingdom, with dinosaurs now living alongside humans around the world. It followsOwen GradyandClaire Dearingas they embark on a rescue mission, whileAlan Grant,Ellie SattlerandIan Malcolmwork to expose a conspiracy by the genomics corporationBiosyn. Planning for the film began in 2014, before the release of the firstJurassic Worldfilm. Filming took place from February to November 2020 inCanada,England, andMalta. With an estimated budget of $265 million, it isone of the most expensive films ever made. Because of theCOVID-19 pandemic, filming was suspended for several months and the release was delayed by a year.
Jurassic World Dominionpremiered in Mexico City on May 23, 2022, and was released in the United States byUniversal Pictureson June 10. It received generally negative reviews from critics, although an extended edition, included with the home media release, was met more positively. Like its predecessors, the film was a financial success and grossed $1 billion worldwide, becoming thethird-highest-grossing film of 2022. A standalone sequel,Jurassic World Rebirth, is scheduled for release in 2025.
Four years after the Lockwood Estate incident that followed the volcanic eruption ofIsla Nublar,[b]once-extinctdinosaurs freely roam the Earth. Amid global efforts to control them,Biosyn Geneticsestablishes a dinosaur preserve inItaly'sDolomiteswhich conductsgenomicsresearch, ostensibly forpharmacologicalapplications.
Claire Dearing,Zia Rodriguez, andFranklin Webbinvestigate illegal dinosaur breeding sites. Claire's partner,Owen Grady, helps relocate stray dinosaurs. At their remote cabin in theSierra Nevadamountains, Claire and Owen secretly raise 14-year-oldMaisie Lockwood(Benjamin Lockwood'sbiogeneticgranddaughter) and protect her from groups seeking to exploit her unique genetic makeup.
When Blue, theVelociraptorOwen raised, arrives at the cabin with anasexually-reproducedhatchling, Maisie names it Beta. Increasingly frustrated living in seclusion, Maisie sneaks away to explore. Mercenaries searching for Maisie find and kidnap her and capture Beta.
Meanwhile, swarms of giantlocustsare decimatingU.S. crops.Dr. Ellie Sattlerobserves that crops grown with Biosyn seeds are left uneaten, raising suspicions that Biosyn created the insects. She takes a captured locust to her former romantic partner,paleontologistDr. Alan Grant. They determine the locust was genetically engineered withCretaceous-periodand contemporary DNA. Alan also learns that Ellie is now divorced from her husbandMark.
Franklin, now with theCIA's dangerous-species division, believes Maisie may have been taken toMalta. Upon arrival there, Claire and Owen infiltrate a dinosaur black market with Owen's former Jurassic World colleagueBarry Sembène, who is leading a French Intelligence raid. Carnivorous dinosaurs are unleashed during the foray, wreaking havoc. When Claire and Owen learn that Maisie and Beta were transported to the Biosyn facility, sympathetic cargo pilotKayla Wattsagrees to fly them there.
ChaoticianDr. Ian Malcolmnow works for Biosyn. He sought Ellie's help to exposeCEODr. Lewis Dodgsonafter communications directorRamsay Colewarned him of Dodgson's illegal activities. Dodgson is exploiting dinosaurs and coerces former InGengeneticistDr. Henry Wuto modify thetransgeniclocust to let Biosyn corner the world's food supply. Wu denounces the plan, warning it will cause anecological collapseas the locusts spread unchecked.
Wu meets Maisie and explains that his former colleague, Dr. Charlotte Lockwood (Benjamin Lockwood's deceased daughter), used her own DNA to replicate and give birth to the genetically identical Maisie. She also altered Maisie's DNA to prevent her from inheriting thefatal diseasewhich she had. Wu believes that Maisie and Beta's asexual conception and DNA are key to creating apathogento halt the locust outbreak.
AQuetzalcoatlusattacks Kayla's plane in Biosyn's airspace, forcing Owen and Kayla to crash land while Claire is ejected. After separate dinosaur encounters, the three regroup. Inside Biosyn, Ian and Ramsay covertly advise Ellie and Alan on where to obtain a locust DNA sample. While searching for the lab, they encounter Maisie. Discovering the breach, Dodgson attempts to incinerate the locusts to destroy evidence; some locusts escape through an air vent while ablaze, sparking a wildfire around the preserve.
Alan, Ellie, and Maisie barely escape the facility before finding Ian. They meet Owen, Claire and Kayla, with Ramsay later joining them. Dodgson flees with dinosaurembryos[c]via ahyperloop, but becomes trapped after Claire and Ellie reroute the power and is then killed by a trio ofDilophosaurus. As the group works together, Owen, with Alan and Maisie's help, captures Beta. They and Wu escape in a Biosyn helicopter amidst a fight between aGiganotosaurusand Isla Nublar's former residentTyrannosaurus,[d]the latter assisted by aTherizinosaurus.
Ellie and Alan rekindle their romantic relationship before testifying with Ian and Ramsay against Biosyn. Owen, Claire, and Maisie return home and reunite Beta and Blue. Wu releases ahostlocust carrying the pathogen, gradually eradicating the swarms. Dinosaurs and humans adapt to a new co-existence, and theUnited Nationsdeclares Biosyn Valley an international dinosaur sanctuary.

During early conversations aboutJurassic World(2015), executive producerSteven Spielbergtold directorColin Trevorrowthat he was interested in having more films made.[30]In April 2014, Trevorrow announced that sequels toJurassic Worldhad been discussed. He said that they wanted to create something "less arbitrary and episodic", which could "potentially arc into a series that would feel like a complete story".[31]Later, when Trevorrow was asked how much planning he had put into a trilogy while he was filmingJurassic Worldin 2014, he replied that he knew where the story would end.[32]He said that planning the beginning, middle and end of the trilogy "is crucial to a franchise like this if you really want to bring people along with you and make sure they stay interested. It needs to be thought through on that level. It can't be arbitrary [...] The earlierJurassic Parkmovies had pretty clear definitive endings. They were much more episodic."[33]
In May 2015, Trevorrow expressed his desire to have other directors work on future films, believing they could bring different qualities to the series:[34]"I think this is one of those franchises—likeMission: Impossible, and like what they're currently doing withStar Wars—that is going to really benefit from new voices and new points of view. […] Down the line, looking at the way that franchises have been working, I'm pretty confident this is the right answer for this one. We need to keep it new and keep it changing and constantly let it evolve."[35]He said that the series would not always be about a dinosaur theme park, and future films could explore the concept of dinosaurs and humans coexisting.[30]
Jurassic WorldproducerFrank Marshallconfirmed plans for a thirdJurassic Worldfilm later in 2015,[36]andUniversal PictureschairDonna Langleysaid that Trevorrow and Spielberg had a story idea for the film.[37]Chris Pratt, who played Owen inJurassic World, was signed for future films in the series.[38]Trevorrow said that the friendship inJurassic Worldbetween Owen and Barry (played byOmar Sy) could continue into the sequels.[31]He also said thatBryce Dallas Howard's character, Claire, would evolve the most during theJurassic Worldtrilogy.[39]
Universal announced in February 2018 that the untitled film, known then asJurassic World 3, would be released on June 11, 2021.[40][41]It was also announced that Trevorrow would write the script withEmily Carmichael, based on a story by Trevorrow and writing partner,Derek Connolly(who worked with him on the scripts for the previousJurassic Worldfilms). Like the previous films, Marshall and Patrick Crowley would be producers and Trevorrow and Spielberg would return as executive producers.[42][43][40]
A month after the announcement, Trevorrow was also confirmed as director.[44]J. A. Bayonahad directed the previous installment,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom; Trevorrow was inspired by Bayona's work on the film, saying that it "made me want to finish what we started."[45]Spielberg had also asked Trevorrow to return as director.[46][10]
Trevorrow had been set to directStar Wars: Episode IXbefore leaving the project in September 2017.Episode IXwas the finale of theStar Warssequel trilogy, and Trevorrow described it as a "practice run" forJurassic World Dominion, also considered a finale film. He utilized his experience from theStar Warsproject and was also joined by several of its crew members.[47]Legendary Entertainmentco-financed the two previous films but was not involved with the third, since its five-year contract with Universal expired in 2018.[48]
Trevorrow met Carmichael in 2015,[49]after seeing a short film of hers.[50]Impressed with Carmichael's writing onPacific Rim Uprising(2018) and a remake ofThe Black Hole, he chose her to co-writeJurassic World 3.[50][51]Trevorrow and Carmichael were writing the script in April 2018. Trevorrow said that the third film would be a "science thriller", describing it as theJurassic Worldfilm which would most closely match the tone ofJurassic Park(1993).[10]He said about the third film and its predecessors, "I have a dinosaur movie that I've always wanted to see, and it took two movies to earn it."[52]Trevorrow later described the film as a "celebration of everything that has existed in the franchise up until now",[53]and compared it to theJason BourneandJames Bond films.[54]
During the development ofJurassic World: Fallen Kingdomin 2015, Trevorrow said that that film's storyline could involve dinosaurs becomingopen-source: a number of entities around the world could create their own dinosaurs for a variety of purposes.[55][56]Scenes and concepts about the integration of dinosaurs into the world were removed from theFallen Kingdomscript to be saved for the third film and to keep the second film's story focused.[57]According to Bayona, "There were moments that we thought, this is more like aJurassic [World] 3scene so we took them out from the script. Some of those scenes we thought were better seen in a world where dinosaurs had spread all over the world. Colin, from time to time, came to me and said, 'I want this character to say that line because this is a moment that's referencing something I want to use inJurassic 3'."[52]
Trevorrow did not want to depict dinosaurs terrorizing cities, which he considered unrealistic.[58]He wanted to honorMichael Crichton's novelsJurassic Park(1990) andThe Lost World(1995), believing that humans and dinosaurs "battling it out in the city streets is a different kind of film than what he would've done".[46]Trevorrow described a world where "a dinosaur might run out in front of your car on a foggy backroad, or invade your campground looking for food. A world where dinosaur interaction is unlikely but possible—the same way we watch out for bears or sharks. We hunt animals, we traffic them, we herd them, we breed them, we invade their territory and pay the price, but we don't go to war with them."[58]
About the film's realism, Trevorrow said that dinosaurs would not be "everywhere all the time. I think any kind of global acceptance that they are just around doesn't feel real to me because, even now when you think of animals, when was the last time you saw a tiger walking down the street? We know there are tigers. We know they're out there. But to me, it's very important that we keep this grounded in the context of our relationship with wild animals today."[59]For inspiration, he watched episodes ofPlanet Earthand alien-invasion films with a realistic perspective.[60][61]Trevorrow said that his goal for theJurassic Worldtrilogy was to have a line from Claire in the first film ("No one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore") disproved in the final film.[59]
With input from Carmichael and cast members, the film's storyline evolved from Trevorrow's initial vision.[46][62]During production of the previousJurassic Worldfilms, Howard kept a list of possible ideas for the final film (including a baby raptor and an underground dinosaur market in Malta). Trevorrow consulted the list while writing the script with Carmichael.[63]He considered the Malta black market a departure from the dinosaur-auction scene inFallen Kingdom: "I felt that what would really happen is a hive of scum and villainy. I wanted to see that".[64]
The writers wantedDr. Ellie Sattler, apaleobotanistin theJurassic Parktrilogy, to lead the story inDominion.[65][66]Trevorrow consulted scientists for story ideas, seeking to depict a global ecological crisis caused by genetic tampering which would be first noticed by a paleobotanist. He learned aboutInsect Allies(aDARPAprogram in which insects spread pesticides to crops), which inspired the film's locust plot.[67]Trevorrow and Carmichael also consulted with screenwritersMichael ArndtandKrysty Wilson-Cairns, as well asDavid Koepp, who wrote the first twoJurassic Parkfilms.[66]Koepp and Wilson-Cairns each spent several weeks performing uncredited work on the script.[68]
Trevorrow wanted the film to explore the idea of dinosaurs created by people other thanDr. Henry Wu.[69][57][52]He said that Wu as the only person who knew how to create a dinosaur was far-fetched "after 30 years of this technology existing" in the films' universe.[57]Biosyn, which appears in Crichton's novels but is absent from their film adaptations, debuts inDominion. Trevorrow also wanted to see the return ofLewis Dodgson, a prominent character in the novels who appeared only briefly in the firstJurassic Parkfilm.[17][70]
Other returning characters from the original trilogy includedDr. Alan GrantandDr. Ian Malcolm, rejoining Sattler.[71]According to Trevorrow, striking a balance of screen time for the trio and the newer characters was the most difficult aspect of developing the script,[72]with the convergence of storylines for the two character groups undergoing many revisions.[73]Wu, who also appeared in the first film and theJurassic Worldfilms, returned as well. Other characters from the series – includingLexandTim MurphyandKelly Curtis– were considered, but Trevorrow felt that the film had enough returning characters.[74][75]Spielberg advised Trevorrow to remember the importance of the film's characters: "Don't forget that these are humans. These are real people, scientists, parents going through something spectacular, something fantastic".[76]
In 2017,Laura Dern(who played Sattler in theJurassic Parktrilogy) expressed an interest in reprising her role,[77][78]and was already in discussions by that time with the filmmakers.[79]Trevorrow announced in April 2018 that Pratt and Howard would reprise their roles, along with other actors introduced inFallen Kingdom.[10]Later that year, Howard said her main desire for the film was to include more characters from theJurassic Parktrilogy,[80]including Sattler and Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).[81][82]Trevorrow also suggested thatSam Neillcould reprise his role as Grant.[52][69]
In September 2019, Neill, Dern, and Goldblum were confirmed as returning in major roles.[83][11][84]The film marks Neill and Dern's first appearances in the series sinceJurassic Park III(2001). It is also the trio's first film appearance together since the originalJurassic Parkfilm, although Goldblum briefly reprised his role inFallen Kingdom.[85][86]Goldblum and Neill had each starred in their ownJurassic Parksequel, but Trevorrow consideredDominionas Dern's film because its plot is partially driven by her character.[72]Trevorrow collaborated with the three actors to ensure that their character portrayals would be consistent with previous films.[87]He said that the film would answer questions about the characters: "Who are these people now? What do they make of the new world they're living in, and how do they feel about being part of its history?"[86]Trevorrow, Dern and Neill agreed about having Grant and Sattler reunite romantically.[88]Neill said that he would get into shape for his role by running.[89][90]
Mamoudou AthieandDeWanda Wisewere cast in lead roles in October 2019,[91][92]without auditioning.[93][94]Trevorrow was impressed by Athie's performance inThe Front Runner(2018),[93][95]and Wise was cast after Trevorrow saw her in the television seriesShe's Gotta Have It.[96]BD Wongwould reprise his role as Wu from previous films,[18]andFallen KingdomactorsJustice Smith,Daniella Pinedaand Isabella Sermon would also return.[21][15]
In early 2020,Jurassic WorldactorsJake JohnsonandOmar Sywere also set to return as their respective characters,Loweryand Barry,[19]whileDichen LachmanandScott Hazewere cast as new characters.[24][22]Campbell Scottwas announced in June 2020 as Dodgson; the role, played byCameron Thorin the originalJurassic Park, was recast forJurassic World Dominionafter Thor's imprisonment for sexual assault.[17]Pratt comparedJurassic World DominiontoAvengers: Endgame(2019), another film in which he appeared; a number of characters returned to both from previous films.[97]Andy Buckley(Scott MitchellinJurassic World) said that he had been signed to reprise his role, but his character was dropped in a rewrite.[98]
On February 19, 2020, a production unit used drones to film aerial scenes atCathedral Groveon Canada'sVancouver Island.[99][100]Principal photographybegan inBritish Columbiaon February 24, and the film's title was announced the following day asJurassic World Dominion.[101][102]Canadian filming ended in early March 2020.[103][104]Production moved to England, where a major location wasPinewood Studios(the facility used forFallen Kingdom).[105][106]Filming was also done in Malta.[107]
With a budget of $265 million,[6]Jurassic World Dominionisone of the most expensive films ever made.[108]John Schwartzmanwas its cinematographer, returning to the position after working with Trevorrow on the firstJurassic Worldfilm and in the process, becoming the first person to serve as director of photography on twoJurassic Parkfilms.[109]Schwartzman had finished filmingThe Little Thingsin December 2019, leaving him only nine weeks to prepare forJurassic World Dominion.[110]He shot the film with35mm film,65mm film, andVistaVision.[75][111]Some night scenes were shot digitally to aid the visual effects team during post-production.[107]For the majority of filming, Trevorrow preferred to avoid using multiple cameras simultaneously,[110]and tried to avoid shooting scenes using standardcamera coverage, instead having scenes play out in completemaster shots.[112]Second unitfilming was directed byDan Bradley.[113]
Jurassic World Dominionwas shot under the working title ofArcadia, the name of the ship which transported dinosaurs to the U.S. mainland in the previous film.[114][115]
Filming went on hiatus in March 2020 as a safety precaution due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, and a decision about resuming production was originally expected within several weeks.[116][117]During the delay, the filmmakers saved time by doingpost-productionwork on footage already shot.[118][119]Most of these scenes included dinosaurs, allowing thevisual effectsteam to get started on the creatures.[119]
Universal eventually confirmed that filming would resume in July 2020 at Pinewood Studios. The company planned to spend about $5 million on safety protocols, including thousands ofCOVID-19 testsfor each cast and crew member (who would be tested before production resumed and several times during filming). A medical facility would be commissioned to perform the tests, and doctors and nurses would be on site during filming. The cast and crew would receiveCOVID-19training, and the Pinewood set would include 150 hand-sanitizer stations and 1,800 safety signs to remind them of safety precautions such associal distancing. Walk-through temperature-testing stations would be built. All members of the production team would be required to wear masks, except for the actors during filming.[120]The cast received a 109-page document outlining the safety protocols.[121]The 750-person production team was divided into two groups, with the larger group consisting of crew members involved in construction, props, and other pre-filming activities. The smaller group consisted of Trevorrow, the cast, and essential crew members.[122]
Filming resumed on July 6, 2020.[123]An English hotel was rented by Universal for the remainder of the shoot,[122]serving as a protective "bubble" for the cast and crew.[124][125][126]Both groups quarantined at the hotel for two weeks before filming resumed, and afterwards were allowed to roam the hotel without social distancing or mask-wearing. The actors and hotel employees were tested three times a week. Renting the hotel, combined with the COVID-19 precautions, convinced the cast that it would be safe to resume filming.[122]Trevorrow encouraged the actors to make suggestions regarding their characters.[127][128]He and the cast formed a close relationship while they lived together for four months, allowing them to create the characters "in a way that I never would have had the opportunity to do" if not for the pandemic protocols.[129]The safety measures cost approximately $9 million, including the hotel.Jurassic World Dominionwas one of the first major films to resume production during the pandemic and was an example to other major productions on how to resume. Universal considered the film ideal to resume; it required few real locations outside of the studio sets and had a relatively small cast and few extras. The earlier start of filming in England also made it easier to resume.[122]
Neill, Dern and Goldblum began filming in early August.[130][131][132]By that time, four crew members in England had tested positive for COVID-19; another four tested positive in Malta after arriving there before production.[122][133]The main crew was scheduled to shoot in Malta with Pratt, Howard and Neill, although these plans were canceled after an increase in COVID-19 cases. As a result of the increase, the United Kingdom added Malta to its list of countries from which arrivals must quarantine for 14 days.[134]Scenes set in Malta were rewritten by Trevorrow, and sets were reconfigured to continue the filming.[135]The actors were no longer part of the Malta shoot, which was handled by a second unit directed by Bradley.[134]Filming in Malta began at the end of August,[136][137]and continued into September.[134][138]After Malta, filming continued at Pinewood Studios.[122][139]
Because of the rescheduling caused by the pandemic, Trevorrow and Johnson struggled to find an ideal time in the actor's schedule for filming.[140][141]Johnson ultimately had to drop out of the project because of quarantine and travel restrictions which prevented him from reaching the set.[142]Pineda appears early in the film, and was meant to film a later scene as well, but quarantine restrictions interfered.Varada Sethuwas signed to replace her in the later scene as a different character.[143]
Filming was slowed on October 7,[139]after several people tested positive for COVID-19. Although the individuals later tested negative, the film's safety protocols required a two-week quarantine.[144]During the partial shutdown, the main cast members continued to film secondary scenes before full production resumed later in the month.[139]Shooting ended on November 7, after nearly 100 days.[124]Like the previous films, Spielberg was minimally involved during filming; COVID-19 protocols would have prevented him from visiting the set.[75]
Trevorrow wanted the film to take place in locations not previously featured in the series, including Malta and the Dolomites.Location shootingwas preferred to sets, andblue screenswere rarely used.[107]Jurassic World Dominionis the first film in the franchise with dinosaurs in a snowy environment.[15][145]Some scenes, set in theSierra Nevada, were filmed in British Columbia during a snowy winter.[107]Merrittwas among the British Columbia locations,[114][146][147]which included its downtown[148]and a lumber yard.[149][150]In an early scene, Owen and others ride horses to herd a group ofParasaurolophus. For years, Trevorrow had wanted to introduce such a scene (also filmed in British Columbia).[151]It was influenced by the 1969 filmThe Valley of Gwangiand 1960s and 1970sWesternfilms set in snowy landscapes.[107]
Filming at Pinewood Studios included the007 Stage, where large sets were assembled.[152]A total of 112 sets were built for the film, including the black market.[107]Another set was the interior of Kayla'sC-119cargo plane,[107]and a miniature plane was used for exterior shots.[113]
Other filming locations in England includedHawley Common, where part of the previous film was shot. Filming in Hawley Common andMinley Woodswas done over three nights, with helicopter filming on the final night.[115][153]These locations were used for a drive-in-theater scene with aT. rexwhich was cut from the film's theatrical version.[154]Winterfold Forestwas used for some scenes set in the Sierra Nevada, including Owen and Claire's cabin.[107]Another scene was shot at a farm nearAylesbury, used as a Texas farm where Ellie Sattler investigates the locust outbreak.[154]
Several locations were used for Biosyn headquarters,[155]includingBlavatnik School of GovernmentandWolfson College(both part of theUniversity of Oxford). A lecture hall at Wolfson was used for a scene introducing Malcolm as he makes a speech.[107][156]Black Park, adjacent to Pinewood Studios, was used for Biosyn's exterior[154][157]along with two British Columbia locations: Cathedral Grove and the town ofSquamish.[155]Switzerland'sGrande Dixence Damand its surrounding mountains were digitally scanned during wintertime and recreated in the film as a frozen Biosyn dam.[155]Kayla's crashed plane in the frozen lake was an exterior set at Pinewood,[158][159]and the distant mountains in the background were added with blue screens.[159]The Dolomites mountains were also scanned and added into the film.[155]Biosyn's locust lab was a set, which Dodgson eventually sets afire. Trevorrow had planned to use special effects for the fire but agreed to burn down the set at the suggestion of special-effects supervisorPaul Corbould. Eight or nine cameras filmed the set as it burned.[160]
Filming in Malta includedValletta, its capital.[161]Malta was chosen as a location after the country's film commission presented financial incentives in April 2019 in the hope of attracting the project to the area.[162]Trevorrow also chose it because he wanted to see "dinosaurs around old stones, around something that's ancient to us, just to illustrate how much more ancient these things are".[163]Because Pratt and Howard could not travel to Malta, they were filmed with stunt doubles and their faces were added digitally during post-production.[107][1]Valletta's streets were scanned withlidar, allowing Pratt and Howard to act against a blue screen of the city.[164][165]
In a Valletta chase sequence, anAtrociraptorpack pursues Claire across rooftops while Owen flees the dinosaurs on motorcycle.[107]Trevorrow's inspiration for this came from a car chase sequence in the 1998 filmRonin.[166]Shooting the Valletta chase was complicated, and required up to nine cameras filming simultaneously.[107]Trevorrow and Bradley had worked closely to design the sequence.[166]Pratt filmed his part of the chase in a UK blue-screen studio, riding a stationary bike on a treadmill.[165]A car-crash scene was filmed in the town ofFloriana.[138]Malta is portrayed as itself in the film except forMellieħa, which depicted part of Grant's dig site in Utah.[107]
Jurassic World Dominionfeatures 35 dinosaur species.[167]The film used 18animatronicdinosaurs of various sizes,[168]more than the previousJurassic Worldfilms.[169]They were created by designer John Nolan.[170][171]Partial animatronics and puppetry were also used.[172]Like the previous films,Industrial Light & Magic(ILM) worked onCGIversions of the animals.[173]Animatronics and puppets were used for close-ups with humans, and CGI was used for certain movements.[174][175]ILM scanned miniature claymaquettesof each dinosaur to create a digital version, which was then given to Nolan's team to create the dinosaurs.[176][177]
PaleontologistJack Horner, a longtime advisor for the series, returned forDominion.[178]PaleontologistSteve Brusattewas also a consultant.[179][180]Trevorrow wanted to strike a balance between realism and "awesome-movie-scary".[145]Jurassic Park IIIhad featuredVelociraptorswith quills along the head, butDominion(anda five-minute prologue) introducesfeathered dinosaursto the series.[181][182][183]Within the previous films' storyline, the dinosaurs were created byInGenand partially engineered with frog DNA to explain inaccuracies in their appearance. InDominion, feathered dinosaurs are introduced with advanced methods by Biosyn.[145]PyroraptorandTherizinosaurusare among the feathered dinosaurs introduced in the film, as well as a featheredT. rexin the prologue.[175][184]Nolan and ILM researched to accurately simulate feathers.[176]Trevorrow intended theTherizinosaurusencounter with Claire to be a "quiet and still and suspenseful" scene, more similar to the originalJurassic Parkthan the action scenes in theJurassic Worldtrilogy.[151][185]He noted that Claire "never really had even one sequence where it was just her alone with a dinosaur".[185]
The film's dinosaur antagonist is aGiganotosaurus, which Trevorrow saved for the trilogy's final installment, setting up a rivalry withaT. rexfrom previous films.[186][187]He said about theGiganotosaurus, "I wanted something that felt likethe Joker. It just wants to watch the world burn".[14][188]The showdown between the dinosaurs was written by Trevorrow;[189]he filmed it primarily from the humans' perspective,[190]hoping it would "make it feel like it was actually happening to you".[87]An animatronicGiganotosauruswas created, which Nolan said was "probably the biggest challenge" for his team. The dinosaur was expected to take six months to build, but his team only had about four months to finish it.[191]Trevorrow wanted to reuse an animatronic created forFallen Kingdomfor theT. rex, but it had deteriorated (common with animatronics).[174]
Dimetrodon, asynapsidwhich existed before the dinosaurs, also appears in the film. Although the creature had appeared in franchise merchandise over the years,Dominionwas its film debut.[192]Another new creature is theAtrociraptor, which Trevorrow described as brutish compared toVelociraptors.[193]Hybrid dinosaurs had prominent roles in the earlierJurassic Worldfilms, but none appear inDominion[194]because Trevorrow felt that the concept had "narratively run its course".[195]Among the returning dinosaurs isDilophosaurus, appearing for the first time since the originalJurassic Parkfilm.[e]Like the first film, no CGI was used to create theDilophosaurus(the only dinosaur in the film without a digital model).[198]Nolan created animatronic locusts 30 inches (76 centimetres) in length.[107]
ILM's special effects supervisor,David Vickery, praised Bradley's second-unit work in Malta, calling it "very fast, very shaky, very frenetic, a lot of energy", but said also that such a style "goes against everything you're trying to do in visual effects." Speaking further about the Malta sequence, he noted that "creatures in broad daylight and direct sunlight is a very difficult thing to do."[113]
After filming ended, Trevorrow worked onpost-productionin a converted barn behind his UK home.[199]The film's release had been delayed for a year due to the pandemic, allowing Trevorrow time to work on visual effects, sound mixing, and scoring as separate processes (unlike most films).[200]When the visual effects were almost done, he screened the nearly-finished film for friends andJurassic Parkfans to obtain feedback and make improvements. Trevorrow said that it was a "much more involved process with the audience this time".[201]
The film was completed on November 6, 2021.[202]With a runtime of two hours and 26 minutes, it is the longest film in theJurassic Parkseries.[5]It was initially two hours and 40 minutes, prompting concern from the studio about whether moviegoers would watch such a long film during a pandemic.

About 14 minutes were removed from the theatrical cut,[75][174]including five minutes which were released online asa prologue.[204]Other deleted scenes include a fight between anOviraptorand aLystrosaurusin the black market and a two-minute confrontation between Ramsay and Dodgson.[174]The home-media release includes an extended cut with the deleted scenes restored; Trevorrow preferred the extended version, his original vision of the film.[205][206]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 29% of 405 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.80/10. The website's consensus reads: "Jurassic World Dominionmight be a bit of an improvement over its immediate predecessors in some respects, but this franchise has lumbered a long way down from its classic start."[276]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 38 out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[277]It is the lowest-rated film of the series on both websites.[278][279]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakreported that filmgoers gave it a 73% overall positive score, with 57% saying that they would definitely recommend it.[265]
Michael Phillips of theChicago Tribunegave the film two out of four stars, describingDominionas the franchise's weakest entry, criticizing its dialogue and calling Owen and Claire "thinly conceived".[280]ForRolling Stone, David Fear wrote that compared to the originalJurassic Park, "Dominionfeels like a contractual obligation at best, and a D.O.A. attempt to wring one last drop out of an already depleted brand at worst."[281]According to aVarietyreview, "Of the threeJurassic Worldmovies,Dominionis the least silly and most entertaining. But that's not saying much. This 'stop to ask if they should' cycle's human characters were never especially interesting, and why should we trust Trevorrow to suddenly make them so?"[282]The Jewish Chroniclecritic Linda Marric gave the film two out of five stars and wrote, "Overall, and bar a few good performances,Dominionfails on almost all accounts by delivering a story that is too preposterous even for a franchise that has demanded that we suspend disbelief for the last 3 decades."[283]
Mark Feeney ofThe Boston Globewrote, "The movie has its moments, and the CGI really is fabulous, but this go-round feels fairly tired. It's also too long, and much of it is paced in a somewhat ... leisurely? ... fashion."[284]ForTribune News Service, Katie Walsh praised the performances of newcomers DeWanda Wise and Mamoudou Athie and called the motorcycle chase scene "the film's best, and most innovative, set piece" but calledDominion"not exactly satisfying, lacking in true suspense, tension and the kind of thrilling spectacle that Spielberg so effortlessly mastered in the firstJurassic Park, a cinematic high that we'll be chasing forever".[285]
Reactions to Grant, Malcolm, and Sattler's returns were particularly polarized.Bilge EbiriofVulture.comwrote, "While it's certainly nice to see Dern, Neill, and Goldblum play these people again, it'd be nicer if the script gave them well-written dialogue or placed them in interesting situations".[286]Maggie Boccella ofColliderpraised their acting but was also critical of the writing. She stated that the trio "feel like aimless last-minute additions, like their presence only serves to remind audiences of how good things used to be".[287]Ian Freer ofEmpirepraised their return, stating that it "provides a sharp contrast" to Owen and Claire, the "relatively colourless heroes of the later trilogy".[288]Mashable's Kristy Puchko felt that the trio were given little to do in the film.[289]According to Johnny Oleksinski of theNew York Post, "You'd think it would be nostalgic to see Dern, Neill and Jeff Goldblum together again, but they all act like old fogies, and they're written to sound like morons".[290]Zoe Jordan ofScreen Rantopined that the film "undermines the unique characteristics that define" the trio.[291]David Crow, writing forDen of Geek, praised the romantic reunion between Grant and Sattler.[292]
Several reviewers were also critical of the locust subplot. Chase Hutchinson ofColliderwrote, "If you were expecting a story that actually grappled with what the impact of the dinosaurs would be on the world, then you are in for a big letdown".[293]John Squires ofBloody Disgustingstated thatDominion"makes the bizarre decision to skirt around the issue presented in the final moments ofFallen Kingdom, instead jumping four years" and picking up in a world where dinosaurs are "little more than a minor nuisance" to humans.[294]In contrast, Kimberly Terasaki ofThe Mary Suestated that "the biggest threat to the world has never been the dinosaurs, but the technology and corporations that created them".[295]Explaining his decision to feature the locusts, Trevorrow said that he "wanted to make a film about genetic power and its consequences".[296]
The extended edition was met with slightly more positive reviews. Samantha Coley ofColliderpraised it for adding story depth and fixing "some clunky editing issues".[297]John Orquiola ofScreen Rantpraised the extended edition for restoring the prologue sequence and more character moments.[298]Jesse Hassenger ofPolygonrecommended the extended edition but stated that the additional scenes "play to the movie's strengths and weaknesses — which is to say the dinosaur stuff is fun, and the human stuff is a bit half-assed".[299]
About the negative critical reception, Goldblum said: "I had such a good time on it. I enjoyed working on it and enjoyed trying to make it good. I think it sold a bunch of tickets. But, you know… [laughs] Everybody's got an opinion about it. It's tough to make a good movie."[300]
Jurassic World Dominionconcludes the second film trilogy and the storyline which began in the original trilogy,[309][310]although Marshall did not rule out the possibility of future films.[311]In January 2022, he said: "We're going to sit down, and we're going to see what the future is."[310]
A new installment,Jurassic World Rebirth, was in development by 2024.David Koepp, screenwriter of the first twoJurassic Parkfilms, wrote the screenplay with Marshall, Crowley, and Spielberg returning as producers.[312]Gareth Edwardsis directing the film, which is scheduled for release on July 2, 2025. It features an entirely new cast, as the studio opted for a fresh take on the franchise.[313]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
