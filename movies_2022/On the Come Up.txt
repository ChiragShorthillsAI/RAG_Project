Brianna "Bri" Jackson is a 16 year-old that has decided to take on the legacy of her late father, Lawless Jackson, who was a local rapper from the Garden Heights neighbourhood. Bri is encouraged to pursued her dreams of rapping by her Aunt Pooh who manages her. She navigates the life of who she wants to be, who she is and who everyone sees her as. This is a struggle for her, especially at her current school. 
After Bri runs from the "Ring" (a place where all the local MCs go to battle), she heads home and realizes that she needs to stop being scared and go for what she wants and what she deserves. Her mom Jay is struggling to manage her life after losing her job. They both start to figure out ways to come up with the money to pay bills. This is on top of trying to rebuild the family's relationship after Jay left Bri and her older brother Trey with their grandparents while she was in active addiction. Clean for 3 years now, Jay tries continually to reassure Bri that everything will be okay.
At school, Bri goes to sell candy to help out at home. While saying bye to her best friends Sonny and Malik, she starts heading to class. A male security officer becomes aggressive with her, demanding that she give him her bag full of candy. She is then thrown to the ground, handcuffed and taken to the principal's office. Jay is called to the school to pick up Bri and expresses her concerns on how Bri is cared for and protected at the school. Even after the principal mentions this isn't the first time she has been in trouble. Bri's behavior results in her getting suspended; it isn't anything compared to what is mentioned so Jay and Bri leave the school and head home.
Bri is convinced to try the battle at the Ring again by her Aunt Pooh and her friends, where she beats Milez, an up-and-coming artist who is the son of Supreme (a major producer, who worked with Bri's father before he died). In the midst of celebrating the win, Aunt Pooh gets into a disagreement with the Kings Crown. This disagreement resulted in everyone rushing home. Bri and Aunt Pooh, excited about the battle go home after getting a few groceries. Jay meets them at the door and is upset about them getting home late. Bri gives her mom her battle winnings and tells her Aunt Pooh and her are doing good. 
Since the win against Milez, Bri and Aunt Pooh decide to go back up to the Ring and battle again. However, the bouncer disregards their entry because of the beef that happened between Aunt Pooh and some of the gang King's Crown. Therefore, Bri goes to start an outside battle instead with another MC named Ms Tique and wins. This gets the attention of Supreme. 
Bri agrees to go to Atlanta along with Sonny and Malik to work with Supreme on a new hit. After creating the hit, Malik and her get in an argument about her portraying someone she's not in the song. This makes them no longer talk to each other. Bri's song creates issues with the parents of the kids at her school as well as with the gang King's Crown. Arriving home, Aunt Pooh gets angry with Bri because of the lyrics as well. 
Jay and Bri have a heart to heart about the pass. They agree to start fresh and try to move on. They then head to her school where the superintendent is speaking on what the concerns the other parents have about her lyrics and how fast the song is getting around the community. Jay holds him accountable on never calling her back regarding Bri's suspension and how she was assaulted by the security officers at her school. 
Malik reconciles with Bri; then decides to walk home where they are approached by two of the Kings Crown that assault Malik and steals Lawless' chain from Bri because of what she said in the song. Aunt Pooh drives up to Bri and Malik demanding that they tell her what's wrong. She then goes to retaliates and ends up in the hospital. At the hospital, a doctor states that once Pooh wakes up from her coma she will be taken into custody by the police. 
Aunt Pooh wakes up and tells Bri that she has always known she was set for greatness. That she needs to go battle Infamous Millz Supreme's artist at the ring. After Infamous talks about Bri's mom and their situation. Bri battles Infamous based on all the pain and growth she has experience and ends up winning the battle.

The album reached platinum status quickly, both in the U.S. and Canada, fueled by "Da Rockwilder", "Cereal Killa", "1, 2, 1, 2", "Tear It Off" and "Y.O.U." This album also featured three previously released tracks on which the two collaborated.
Their success would lead the duo on to star in movies and TV shows, become product spokespersons and household names, but also associated them with marijuana use in the media.

In 2003, Method Man criticizedOli "Power" Grantand Mitchell "Divine" Diggs, the managers of the Wu-Tang Clan business.[31][failed verification]"Number 1 on my shit list right now is Divine from Wu-Tang management.  He took something major from me that he had no intention of giving back."[32]
Aside from the financial issues, Method Man was unhappy with the decision to bring Wu-Tang into the fashion world for a brief period of time with Wu-Wear, despite the brand being a major money-maker for the group. "When Wu-Wear started making shoes and sneakers and pants, it was shoddy material. I never rocked that shit."[32]

P. Diddy was one of the executive producers for the album, although Meth later voiced his displeasure with the final product. "On the third LP, it was suggested (by Def Jam) to bring in Harve Pierre and P. Diddy. Who am I to argue? Puff knows how to sell some records. But that wasn't the direction to go in, and I know that."[33]
Method Man's fourth album, entitled4:21: The Day Afterwas released in August 2006 with a star lineup of producers featuringHavoc,Erick Sermon,Scott Storch,Allah Mathematics,Mr. Porter, and fellow Wu-Tang Clan member, RZA. This time around, a more focused Method Man went back to his hip hop roots and both hip hop fans and the media took notice. He did an interview on the ItsHipHop.Tv.[34]Despite this being one of Meth's strongest solo efforts to date, the album failed to do well commercially due to it having no single or video, which Method Man has held discontent towards his own label for. However, he toured strongly all over the world to promote the album, and appeared onstage with fellow Wu-Tang memberInspectah Deck, as well as New York up and comersSaigon, and Gat Murdah. Meth cited various reasons for the problems between him and his label, Def Jam. While he puts most of the blame on personal agendas in the Def Jam offices, Meth did take some blame, himself, for giving in to his record label.

However, the album was postponed again.
In an April 2011 interview withThe Come Up Show, following a performance in Canada, Method Man replied to a question regarding his "weed-loving" image: "When you get older and you've got kids and your kids are going to school and you know [their] teachers...and they see how active you are and concerned [you are] with your kids' education or well being, it's hard to sit there and be taken seriously if people are always talking about he's always high...which is totally not the case", he said. "When I first came out, I was young, we were doing our thing, we smoked a lot...and we didn't care if the world knew. Now, I have to use more discretion because of my kids. This is not for me; everything I do is for them now, so I use a bit more discretion and I don't put weed as a forefront any more."[44]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
