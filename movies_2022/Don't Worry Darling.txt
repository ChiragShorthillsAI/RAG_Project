Alice and Jack Chambers live in Victory,California, an idealistic 1950s desertcompany town. Every day, the men leave for work at Victory Headquarters in the surrounding desert, while their housewives are expected to obediently stay. The women enjoy luxuries and leisure while the men are gone.
Alice spends her days with other wives, including her best friend Bunny. Fellow resident Margaret has become estranged from the community. An unauthorized desert visit resulted in her son's apparent death which caused her mental breakdown. Margaret insists Victory took him as punishment for breaking the rules.
Victory's founder Frank hosts a party, where Alice sees Margaret's husband attempt to medicate her after an outburst. Alice and Jack then have sex in Frank's bedroom, as Frank secretly watches.
From the trolley, Alice sees a plane crash in the desert, so rushes to help. Stumbling onto Headquarters she touches one of its mirror-like windows, experiencing surreal hallucinations about another life, waking up at home that night.
Alice continues to have increasingly strange experiences, then receives a phone call from Margaret, who claims to have seen the same things. Soon after, she sees Margaret slit her own throat and fall from her roof. Men in red jumpsuits drag her away, preventing her from reaching Margaret's body.
Jack dismisses Alice's claims, insisting Margaret is simply recovering from a household accident. When Alice asks him what is really happening at the Victory Project, he becomes angry and refuses to answer. The town physician, Dr. Collins, prescribes Alice medication, which she and Jack decline. She steals Margaret's medical file from his briefcase and finds it heavily redacted.
Becoming increasingly paranoid during a company celebration promoting Jack, Alice breaks down in the bathroom. Confronted by Bunny, she attempts to explain her suspicions. Bunny reacts angrily when Alice tells her she went to Headquarters, accusing her of jeopardizing their livelihood in Victory like Margaret.
Alice and Jack invite neighbors to dinner, including Frank and his wife Shelley. Frank privately confirms her suspicions and dares her to challenge him. So, Alice attempts to expose him, but he makes her appear delusional to everyone, causing Jack grief.
Afterwards, Alice tries to tell Jack what Frank said, but he rebukes her. Desperate, she begs him to leave Victory with her. He feigns agreement, then lets Frank's men take her away. Dr. Collins gives Aliceelectroshock therapy, during which she sees herself in the 21st century, as surgical resident Alice Warren and living with the unemployed Jack.
After treatment, Alice resumes her life in Victory, but eventually deduces the visions are actually memories. Confronted by Alice, Jack confesses the truth: Victory is a simulated world created by Frank, where he and the other men lead their version of perfect lives; the women they have forced into the simulation are unaware that everything in Victory, including their children, is artificial.
When the men leave for work each day, they actually log out of the simulation for real jobs to pay for their captive wives to stay there. Jack argues that Alice was miserable in the real world, while here they can finally be happy. However, she is livid that she is being held there non-consensually. Jack begs Alice to stay, forcefully grabbing her, prompting her to smash awhiskey glassover his head, killing him in both the simulation and reality.
Frank immediately hears of Jack's death. Bunny finds Alice and admits she has always known about the simulation, but chose to stay to be with her children, who died in real life. She warns Alice she will be killed if she does not get to Headquarters, the simulation's exit portal. Alice silently confronts the neighborhood, and as small explosions begin, the husbands panic.
Fleeing by car, Alice is chased by Dr. Collins and Frank's men. She maneuvers them into fatally crashing into each other. Meanwhile, Shelley fatally stabs Frank to take control of Victory. Arriving at Headquarters, Alice has a final vision of Jack, then puts her hands on Headquarters before Frank's men can reach her. Various romantic scenes mixed with memories and visions of herself in the real world flash, then the screen cuts to black as Alice gasps for air.

Varietyinitially put the budget at about $20 million, whileForbesestimated the production budget was in the range of $20-$30 million.[15][16]VarietyandDeadline Hollywoodlater said the film cost $35 million to produce.[17][18]
In April 2020,Florence Pugh,Shia LaBeoufandChris Pinewere added to the cast of the film,[19]withDakota Johnsonjoining the next month.[20][21]Wilde was originally set to play Pugh's part and Pugh was to play Wilde's, but they traded roles when Wilde decided she wanted a younger couple at the center of the film.[15]In September 2020,Harry Stylesjoined the cast,[22]replacing LaBeouf.
In October 2020,Gemma ChanandKiKi Laynejoined the cast, with Layne replacing Johnson, who dropped out due to a scheduling conflict withThe Lost Daughter.[23]That month,Sydney Chandler,Nick Kroll,Douglas Smith,Kate Berlant,Asif Ali,Timothy SimonsandAri'el Stacheljoined the cast.[24][25]
Principal photographybegan in Los Angeles on October 26, 2020.[26]It was temporarily halted for two weeks on November 4 after a crew member tested positive forCOVID-19, which resulted in stars Pugh, Styles and Pine being quarantined.[27]Filming wrapped on February 13, 2021.[28][29]The film's original score is byJohn Powell.[30]Arianne Phillipsserved ascostume designer.[31]
The opening sequence was filmed at theKaufmann House. It was the first film to be shot there. Wilde was inspired by its architecture, and hung a photograph of it on her wall while working on the script. She toldVariety, "To be there was huge. To direct the first shot there felt like this really auspicious beginning to this movie which was this love letter not only to film, but to architecture, to design, to this era."[32]
Other filming locations include theCicada ClubinDowntown Los Angelesduring the Victory party sequence and theVolcano House, inNewberry Springs, which served as Victory Headquarters and was once owned by TV hostHuell Howser.[33]
In 2021, it was reported that Wilde had fired LaBeouf for poor behavior and clashing with the cast and crew.[34]LaBeouf denied these claims in August 2022, saying he quit the film despite Wilde's efforts to keep him on board. He providedVarietywith leaked texts and a video recording from Wilde addressed to him, in which she says: "I feel like I'm not ready to give up on this yet, and I, too, am heartbroken and I want to figure this out. You know, I think this might be a bit of a wake-up call for Miss Flo, and I want to know if you're open to giving this a shot with me, with us."[35]
Following LaBeouf's statements, Wilde denied his claims and again said that she fired him, tellingVanity Fairthat she did so after Pugh said she was uncomfortable with LaBeouf's behavior.[36]When asked about this in an interview withThe Hollywood Reporter, LaBeouf replied, "It is what it is."[37]
Rumors alleged that Wilde and Pugh clashed on set, leading to tensions during both production and promotion for the film.[38][39]An anonymous source reported toVulturethat Pugh and Wilde had a "screaming match" on set, and the former Warner Bros. executiveToby Emmerichoversaw a "long negotiation process" between Wilde, Pugh, and the studio to figure out how much Pugh would continue to be involved in the film.[40]Warner Bros. co-chairs and CEOs Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy denied any tension between themselves and Wilde, saying, "We are so proud of the work that Olivia Wilde has done making this incredibly beautiful and entertaining film and look forward to collaborating with her again."[41]On September 25, 2022, 40 members of the film's crew issued a statement disputing the allegations and dismissing rumors of unprofessional behavior on the set as "completely untrue".[42]The allegations have also been dismissed by cinematographer Matthew Libatique, who called the set "one of the most harmonious sets I've ever been on", and by Wilde herself, who called the rumors "baseless".[36]
At theCinemaCon2022 for the stage atCaesars Palace, Wilde confirmed that the idea of the film was inspired byInception,The Matrix, andThe Truman Show.[43][44]The trailer, which was also shown at CinemaCon, was released online on May 2, 2022.[45]A teaser poster was released on June 16, and a second trailer was released on July 21.
David Christopherson ofMovieWebcalled the poster "unsettling," and based on the trailer, Valerie Ettenhofer of/FilmsaidDon't Worry Darlinglooks like a "full-blown horror movie", noting the mystery surrounding its plot andThe Stepford Wivesovertones.[46][47]The official release poster was released on August 11, 2022. An edited version of the second trailer was shown in theaters and was released online on September 21.[48]
Don't Worry Darlinghad its world premiere at the79th Venice International Film Festivalon September 5, 2022.[49]Claims of Styles spitting on Pine during the Venice premiere based on videos recorded from inside the theatre (and thereby adding to the already rocky press tour mired by allegations of a falling-out between Wilde and Pugh) were dismissed as "a ridiculous story" and "a complete fabrication" by Pine's representative.[50]The film also screened at the 48thDeauville American Film Festivaland the70th San Sebastián International Film Festival.[51]It was theatrically released on September 23, 2022.[52][53]

In the U.S. and Canada, it was projected to gross $17–20 million from 4,113 theaters in its opening weekend, with some estimates as high as $25 million.[57][58]It made $9.4 million on its first day, including a combined $3.1 million from preview screenings on Monday and Thursday.[17]It went on to debut to $19.4 million, topping the box office; 66% of the audience was female, with nearly 70% aged 18–34. Several publications noted the film was front-loaded to Friday and previews, attributing it likely to younger women going to see Styles.[59][60]In its sophomore weekend the film fell 64.6% to $6.8 million, finishing second behind newcomerSmile.[61]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 38% based on 353 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Despite an intriguing array of talent on either side of the camera,Don't Worry Darlingis a mostly muddled rehash of overly familiar themes."[62]Metacriticgave the film aweighted average scoreof 48 out of 100 based on 62 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[63]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B−" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave the film a 67% overall positive score, with 53% saying they would definitely recommend it.[59]
Critics praised Pugh's performance, the cinematography, and the visual style, but found the film unsatisfying overall. Rotten Tomatoes reported that Styles had "a debatably entertaining turn" and that reaction to the third act was divided.[64]Reviewing the film after its Venice premiere, Kate Erbland ofIndieWirepraised thescenographyand cast performances, particularly Pugh's, but found fault with the screenplay, summarizing: "Pugh's outstanding performance and the extraordinary below-the-line craftsmanship are all impeccably rendered, but they can't overcome the film's rotten core concept."[65]In a mixed review forThe A.V. Club, Tomris Laffly commended Pugh's performance and also praised Pine's performance and the film's visuals, but called Styles "outmatched", criticized the direction, and found its handling of themes and ideas heavy-handed, writing, "Perhaps the chief deficit ofDon't Worry Darlingisn't even predictability, but a discernible lack of new ideas of its own."[66]
The Guardian'sPeter Bradshawcalled it a "movie marooned in a desert of unoriginality", criticizing the screenplay and direction.[67]Vulture.com'sBilge Ebiricalled the film "smooth, competent, (mostly) well acted, and merely tedious", writing that the plot "can get boring and repetitive after a little while". Complimenting the performances of Pugh, Wilde, and Pine, he called Styles "the weak link ... who is not without talent but who fails to give Jack the dimensionality or inner conflict the character clearly needs."[68]Phil de Semlyn ofTime Outwrote, "Pugh saves this stylish but inert horror-thriller from disaster";Richard LawsonofVanity Fairechoed this, calling Pugh "a commanding and centered actor who makes the most of the hash she's served".[69][70]Writing for the independent online publicationClapper, Ewan Gleadow praised Pugh's performance but concluded that the film "just isn't up to scratch".[71]
Anthony LaneofThe New Yorkercalled Pine "the best thing in the film" and Styles "utterly and helplessly adrift" while reading lines of dialogue.[72]Geoffrey Macnab ofThe Independentwrote, "Styles gives a surprisingly dull and low-wattage performance as Jack", adding that the film "is beautifully shot by cinematographer Matthew Libatique" and complimenting the visuals.[73]Steph Green wrote forBBCthat the film is "full of half-baked ideas" and "an empty shell" while also noting the film's repetitive nature. She wrote that "Pugh does her best with the material" but that "Styles doesn't feel up to the material here, with leaden line delivery and a lack of light and shade making his scenes opposite Pugh fall flat."[74]
ForTimemagazine,Stephanie Zacharekwrote that "the plot is cleverly worked out" and complimented Pugh's performance, but disliked the film's ending and wrote that "Styles is cute, but a dud. Everything he does on-screen practically evaporates from one scene to the next."[75]Scott MendelsonofForbesnamed Pugh's performance "as good as you'd expect", complimented Pine as he "relishes the chance to play a smarmy villain", and argued that "Styles is as good as he needs to be" and that "some of the criticism of his performance has been more about the character than the actor."[76]
Michael Shindler ofThe American Spectator, while noting the film does not suffer on account of cast performances, argued that based on Wilde's statements and reports of on-set developments, rather than being "a mere swing and a miss", the film could be construed as an exercise in unintentionalself-criticism.[77]Helen O'Hara ofEmpirecomplimented the cinematography and called Styles's performance "solid" while particularly praising Pugh, calling her performance "flawless", adding, "this is her film, and everyone else is just there for support."[78]Pete Hammond of Deadline wrote that the film is "quite entertaining" and "kinda fun", adding that Styles "shows he is the real deal as an actor and has great promise" while also complimenting the performances of Pugh and Pine.[79]Owen GleibermanofVarietycomplimented the production design and wrote that Pugh "holds downs the center of the movie" and that Jack is "played by Styles with a wholesome cunning that marks him as a natural screen actor" and that "with his popping eyes, floppy shock of hair, and saturnine suaveness, he recalls the youngFrank Sinatraas an actor."[80]
Don’t Worry Darlingreceived a nomination forBest Thriller Filmat the51st Saturn Awards.[81]John Powell's musical score won theIvor Novello Awardfor Best Original Film Score in May 2023.[82]

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
