Save Your Soul.is a 2022 Americanmockumentarycomedy filmwritten, directed, and produced by Adamma Ebo, in her feature directorial debut, and is a feature-length adaptation of Ebo's 2018 short film of the same name.

Hall and Brown are also producers on the film alongsideDaniel Kaluuya, who produced under his 59% Productions banner, withJordan Peelecredited as executive producer under hisMonkeypaw Productionsbanner.
The film had its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 23, 2022, and was
released theatrically and streaming onPeacockon September 2, 2022, byFocus Features. It received generally positive reviews from critics.
Pastor Lee-Curtis Childs and his wife, First Lady Trinitie Childs, ran theSouthern Baptistmegachurch, Wander to Greater Paths, with a large following, and raked in a substantial amount of money. However, a recent scandal involving Lee-Curtis seducing vulnerable young men, despite his previous preaching against same-sex relationships, forced the Childs to close their church after severe backlash and a mass exodus of congregants. One year later, they hire a documentary crew to document their comeback and reopening of their church on Easter Sunday. While Lee-Curtis and Trinitie try to show that they are decent people, the documentary crew captures them indulging in expenses, including their wardrobe full of designer brands and a fountain in the church.
A pastoral couple, Keon and Shakura Sumpter, are planning to open their own church, Heaven's Home, on Easter Sunday as well. They cite the Childs as their inspiration but have also gathered many of their former congregants to attend their sermons. The Childs' "devout five" congregants believe Lee-Curtis is not guilty of the allegations and are more than happy to abide by his words, attending their Wednesday sermon despite a mishap during their baptism.
During a shopping spree, Trinitie runs into a former congregant who makes subtly condescending remarks and lets Trinitie know she will be joining Heaven's Home on Easter along with other former congregants. Later, the couple is informed by their lawyer that they have to make settlements to the young men, although one of them won't accept a settlement. The next day, Lee-Curtis attempts to give Basil, the documentary's sound recorder, an opportunity to do audio-visual work for their church, while also making a sexual advance towards him. However, Basil states that he currently has a boyfriend.
The Childs visit the Sumpters in an attempt to get them to move their opening date away from Easter. While they try to be friendly with one another, the Sumpters are adamant about sticking to that date. Lee-Curtis then plans to reopen Greater Paths within the next few days, two weeks before Easter, in order to beat the Sumpters. Lee-Curtis has Trinitie wave a sign in the street to advertise their return, telling her to "shake it for the Lord" to get more people in cars to honk and acknowledge them. While standing outside, Trinitie is harassed by a woman who criticizes her and her husband for their actions. Meanwhile, Lee-Curtis has a reunion with a young former congregant, revealed by the documentary to have been in a penitentiary.
Lee-Curtis has Trinitie paint her face with white mime make-up so she can do "worship miming" to attract more honks on the street. A car stops in the middle of the street and causes a traffic jam. The car's passenger is revealed to be Khalil, the victim who won't accept the settlement. He initially seems distraught but soon breaks character by bursting into laughter, mocking Lee-Curtis for his attempts to overcome the scandal. Trinitie storms back to the church and confesses her grievances over her marriage and how their congregants have all turned on them because of the scandal. The documentary director, Anita Bonet, asks Trinitie why she won't leave Lee-Curtis. Trinitie rejects her question and dismisses Anita's true goal for the documentary to "understand" her, Lee-Curtis, and the town's church culture.
The church reopens per the revised plan, two weeks before Easter, where Lee-Curtis and Trinitie stand outside waiting for people to show up with no luck except the "devout five". A Mustang drives up to the front only to whirl around in the lot. It is revealed that the Sumpters had also moved up the opening of their Heaven's Home church to two weeks before Easter, their intention to give Easter opening to the Childs, earning great success and gaining many congregants.

Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

She received critical acclaim, and became the firstAfrican Americanto win theNew York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actressfor the comedy filmSupport the Girls(2018).
Hall was born the daughter of a contractor andelectricianfather, Odie Hall, and a teacher mother, Ruby.[3][4]After graduating fromImmaculata High School, Hall enrolled atFordham Universityinthe Bronx, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in English in 1992.[5][6]She later enrolled atNew York University, where she earned amaster's degreeinjournalismin 1997.[7]Reflecting on college, Hall said: "I loved being a student. I could've gone to school until I was 75 years old as long as somebody would've paid my rent. I would've been a professional student."[5]
She wanted a career with impact and envisioned a career in writing or journalism, but Hall's first semester of graduate school changed drastically when her father died of astroke.[8]"It was sudden. And I think when sudden events that are painful happen in your life, you know, they redirect your course," Hall reflected. "When you're young, you don't grasp the gravity of life. But when you lose someone that you spend most of your life with, and you're young, you do. And so I think that started me thinking about what I really wanted to do in life. And I know my father would have wanted me to finish school. So I did that."[9]She began a career in the entertainment industry, starting off with a guest appearance onSadat X's 1996 albumWild Cowboyson the track, "The Interview".
In 1997, Hall appeared in her firsttelevision commercialat the age of 26.

She left a lasting impression on viewers with her portrayal of the character Candace "Candy" Sparks. Hall reflected: "It was my very first movie. I metSanaa Lathanon it, and we didLove and Basketballtogether, which was my second film. And then, at that point, I was visiting L.A. to stay and it led to a third film and a fourth film. And it was really a big deal because I'd never been on a set before."[10]
Hall gained more recognition with her role in the comedy-horror-spoofScary Movie(and the sequelsScary Movie 2,Scary Movie 3, andScary Movie 4) portraying the sex-crazed Brenda Meeks, and the TV movieDisappearing Acts.

Hall felt the first film had "the joy of the wedding" and in the sequel "they come together for the holidays, but it's deeper than that. This one's definitely different, but we still laughed. There was so much laughter behind the scenes."[10]Hall joked about how all of the male members of the cast were married while all of the women were not, stating thatMorris Chestnutwas happily married while walking around "with his shirt off!"[15]

All of the cast was seen as having a "perfect mix of charisma and likability".[18]Jessica Herndon of theAssociated Pressstated "Hart and Hall are the best part of this film. They play the couple you know all too well: fiery, able to press one another's buttons and always caught in the makeup to breakup game." Negative reviews of the film also praised the pairing of Hall with Kevin Hart. Mick LaSalle ofThe San Francisco Chronicleexpressed that Hart was "well paired for Hall, who matches him for comedy."[19]At the time of the film's release, both Hall and Hart expressed interest in working on other projects together.[20]About Last Nightwas her third ensemble film and Hall reflected that she learned from actors she worked with in ensembles.[21]
Hall reprised her role as Candace Hall inThink Like a Man Too. She revealed what members of the cast partied the most in the film shortly before the movie's release. "Everyone kind of had their fun, I'm not gonna lie. We went out, we gambled. Kevin [Hart] parties. There were parties, and we all went. It was good fun".[22]In July 2014, it was announced Hall would star in a Lifetime film, entitledWith This Ring, withEveandJill Scott.[23][24]

"When my mom was diagnosed, I didn't know much about the condition. ButDana Delany, who is an actress and now a friend of mine, put me in touch withBob Saget. Bob had made a television movie about scleroderma years ago because his sister had died from it. That was back when they didn't even know what it was. Anyway, Bob had a group called theScleroderma Research Foundation, so I donated to that and my mother even went to the doctor Bob had suggested, who happened to be over atJohns Hopkins."[31]Hall announced in November 2010 that she would be writing forAbility.[32]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
