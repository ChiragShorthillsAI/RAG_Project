This was Selick's first feature film sinceCoraline(2009).
Selick began developing his stop-motion animation feature with Key and Peele set to star in November 2015. The distribution rights were picked up by Netflix in March 2018. Other voice cast were confirmed in March 2022. Production was done remotely during theCOVID-19 pandemic, with filming taking place inPortland, Oregon.

It received generally positive reviews from critics who welcomed Selick's return and praised its stop-motion animation and characters, but criticized its screenplay. The film is dedicated to Mark Musumeci, an electricity consultant who worked on almost all of Selick's previous stop-motion features sinceThe Nightmare Before Christmas, who died during production.
8-year-old Katherine "Kat" Koniqua Elliot lives with her parents Delroy and Wilma, who own aroot beerbreweryin the town of Rust Bank. While driving home, both her parents are killed in a car crash. Meanwhile, in theunderworld, demon brothers Wendell and Wild spend their days putting rejuvenating hair cream on their balding father,Buffalo Belzer, while dreaming of a new amusement park to rival that of their father's. The two have a taste of Belzer's hair cream, causing them tohave a visionof Kat. They also discover that his hair cream canbring dead organisms back to life.
Five years later, Kat is a thirteen-year-old juvenile delinquent who blames herself for her parents' deaths. Kat is enrolled in Rust Bank's all-girlsCatholicschool, headed by Father Bests. Siobhan Klaxon, whose parents Lane and Irmgard'sprivate prisoncompany Klaxon "Klax" Korp has taken over the town, earns the respect for Kat after she saves her from a falling brick throughpremonition. Marianna Cocolotl is investigating the burning of the brewery and is convinced the Klaxonscaused the fire on purpose, killing all of its workers. Meanwhile, Father Bests is killed as last witness to the factory fire by the Klaxons, while trying to negotiate with them to fund the school.
During a class taught by Sister Helley, Kat receives a marking on her hand resembling a skull when she approached Helley's desk, which Helley tells her she must hide and tell no one. The mark alerts Wendell and Wild, identifying Kat as their "hell maiden", and they appear to herin a dreamand make an empty promise to revive her parents if shesummons themto the world of the living. Kat steals a teddy bear named Bearzebub from Helley's desk and goes to her parents' grave, along with Raúl Cocolotl, Marianna's child and atransboy, to serve as her witness. However, by the taking the wrong way, Wendell and Wild appear in a different part of the cemetery, and Kat believes she has been stood up.
Upon arrival, Wendell and Wild test the cream on Bests, who comes back to life and convinces the Klaxons to pay him and the brothers to revive the deceased members of the town council to give the Klaxons the votes they need to demolish Rust Bank and expand their prisons, on the condition that no one else is revived. Kat and Raúl eventually find the brothers, who force Kat to serve them forever in exchange for the false promise of her parents' resurrection. Forced to dig up the council members, whom Wendell and Wild revive, Raúl steals the cream and revives Delroy and Wilma himself. Reunited with her parents, Kat helps Raúl escape the brothers.
After thezombiecouncil approves the Klaxons' plans and pays Bests, Wendell, and Wild with a bag full of money, Siobhan discovers her parents' lies about theconditions of their prisons. Helley and Manberg make Kat undergo a ritual called "soul binding", confronting her memories and severing her allegiance with Wendell and Wild, resulting in her acknowledging that her parents' death was not her fault. The ritual further gives Kat the control of her precognitive powers, which Helley reveals are a consequence of her status as a hell maiden.
After learning of their resurrection, Bests, Wendell, and Wild kidnap Delroy and Wilma and take them to the cemetery to kill them until Kat, Raúl, Helley, and Manberg stop them. Siobhan, who followed her petpygmy goatGabby Goat to the cemetery, reveals to the group that her parents paid Bests, Wendell, and Wild worthlesscompany money. Buffalo Belzer appears, having discovered Wendell and Wild's deception, but amuralby Raúl painted part-by-part on every house's roof in Rust Bank convinces him to make up with his sons. Manberg releases his collection of jarred demons after learning they are Belzer's children in exchange for Kat and the others. Belzer apologizes to Wendell and Wild, approving their plans for their Dream Fair. Bests dies again, and Belzer explains that the cream's effects "don't last."
Kat worries that Rust Bank cannot be saved, but Sister Helley tells her that her power to see into the future can help her change it. Recalling that Raúl said there needs to be a witness to prove the Klaxons are guilty, Kat tells him to use the very last bit of cream to revive as many dead brew workers as he can. The group fends off the bulldozers conducted by the zombie council set to demolish the town while Raúl revives three dead factory workers to testify to the Klaxons' crimes, resulting in their arrest. The cream's effect begin to wear off on Delroy and Wilma, but before they die, Kat uses herprecognitionto give them a glimpse of the future where Rust Bank is revived, and Wendell and Wild offer them VIP passes to their afterlife fair. Kat makes peace with her life, considering everyone her friends, even Wendell and Wild themselves.
On November 3, 2015, it was reported thatHenry Selickwas developingWendell & Wild, a new stop-motion feature withKeegan-Michael KeyandJordan Peele, based on an original story by Selick.[8]On March 14, 2018, the film was picked up byNetflix.[9]In a July 2019 interview, Key described the voice acting process, where "Jordan and I came in and did a session against static at recording booths, sitting looking across at Jordan and it's lots of ideas flowing, cutting each other off to keep that organic feeling. That usually ends up on the cutting room floor as you find the voices and you want a little refinement–some rhythm. We spent a good deal of time with an initial scene that Henry wrote discovering the characters and the framework of the scene. And then he uses that as inspiration to keep writing".[10]Pablo Lobato served as lead designer on the stop-motion puppets.[11]On March 14, 2022, the cast was revealed by Netflix on YouTube.[12]
As of June 15, 2020,productionwas being done remotely during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Lead writer and voice actor Peele stated that he "had an absolute blast working with Henry Selick and the crew forWendell & Wild. I cannot wait for you to discover this film".[13]In an October 8, 2020 interview withThe Hollywood Reporter, the film's producer,Gotham GroupCEOEllen Goldsmith-Vein, elaborated on the project: "We're mid-production inPortland, Oregon, where the crew has suffered throughfires, most recently,COVIDand a lot ofpolitical and social unrest. It's been a very challenging movie."[14]Editing was done by Robert Anich, and Peter Sorg was cinematographer.[15][16][better source needed]By February 2021, production was ongoing in Portland.[17]
AfterCoraline, Selick felt stop-motion animation had become so smooth it had become indistinguishable from computer animation, defeating some of the purpose of stop-motion. He decided to allow flaws, such as keeping the seam lines on replacement faces visible, and shooting fewer frames per second in some scenes. Except for a stop-motion software  called Dragonframe, he used more or less the same types of tools and techniques he used inCoralinemore than a decade earlier.[18]
Part of the film was done ascutout animationto make the puppets look more two-dimensional. They were made of tin coated with silicone. Inspired by the shadow-puppet animation inHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1, and an idea originally intended for Selick's yet-to-be-made stop-motion filmThe Shadow King, some ofWendell & Wildwas done assilhouette animation, utilizing a combination of physical cutouts and CGI, with CGI used when cutouts were too limiting.[19]
On June 4, 2020,Bruno Coulaiswas confirmed as the composer.[20][21][22]Its soundtrack has been noted for its emphasis onAfro-punkbands,[23][24]and includes the songs "Ma and Pa" byFishbone;[22][24]"Germfree Adolescents" and "I Am a Poseur" byX-Ray Spex;[22][24]"Ghost Town" bythe Specials;[22][25]"River" byIbeyi;[22]"The Wolf" bythe Brat;[22]"You Sexy Thing" byHot Chocolate;[22][25]"Young, Gifted, Black, in Leather" bySpecial Interest;[22]"Freakin' Out" byDeath;[22][24]"Fall Asleep" byBig Joanie;[22][24]"Cult of Personality" byLiving Colour;[22][25]"Wolf Like Me" byTV on the Radio;[22][24]"Boot" byTamar-kali;[22][24]and "Raising the Dead" and "Scream Faire" by Coulais.[22]
Speaking about the film's soundtrack, Selick stated:[23]
Before Afro-punk, there was Fishbone. There was actually several black punk bands. Fishbone was punk,ska,funk. But I ended up meeting those guys, who are still performing, and we have one of their songs in the film. They're still performing now, but I met them in the 1980s. And I wrote and directed a music video of one of their songs called "Party at Ground Zero"... And then there's all these other pioneers of the time that, some are forgotten, some are remembered, especially with the Afro-punk movement, they're remembered. But there was bands, you know, Death,Pure Hell. The Brat, which was aChicanoband, actually, in L.A.Poly Styreneof X-Ray Spex.Bad Brains. Fishbone.
ProducerWin Rosenfeldsuggested the use of Fishbone's "Ma and Pa" as a means of "building that bridge, sonically" between the characters of Kat and her parents.[23]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 80% of 122 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Boasting visual marvels to match its ambitious and inclusive story,Wendell & Wildis a spooky treat for budding horror fans."[32]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[33]
Chase Hutchinson ofCollider, gave a positive review, saying, "when it all comes together,Wendell & Wildends up feeling liberating, both artistically and thematically, with top work from all involved."[34]Sarah Bea Milner, of/Film, also gave a positive review, writing, "move overThe Nightmare Before Christmas— there's a new stop-motion horror flick in town."[35]Michael Rechtshaffen, ofThe Hollywood Reporter, further praised the film for being "a fresh, highly original concoction of playfulGrand Guignolproportions."[36]Radheyan Simonpillai, ofThe Guardian, wrote "the more characters Selick has to work with, the more room there is for his deliciously strange and comic visual craft."[37]In a positive review, forRogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico wrote "there's no denying that this is a world that animation fans will just want to explore, to live in, to savor. It's been too long since we got a window into Henry Selick's brain and it's still an amazing view."[38]
Meagan Navarro, ofBloody Disgusting, gave a lukewarm review, writing, "it's an entertaining, if a bit overstuffed, romp through hell and back, with memorable characters and amusingly macabre hijinks."[39]Esther Zuckerman, writing forVanity Fair, said the film "is slightly too convoluted with some world-building short-changed, but it twists and turns to a place of genuine emotion and a rousing call to take down the ghouls of the real world rather than the demons of the underworld."[40]The Playlist's Jason Bailey praised the characters and stop-motion animation, assigning the film a grade of "B-" but ultimately concluding: "If it were a might tighter (it runs a rather flabby 105 minutes), or more rapidly paced, they might've really had something here; the highs are high, but Selick struggles to keep its narrative momentum going".[41]

Bassett said the pregnancy "only made things harder", leading her parents to send her to her father's sister, Golden, inWinston-Salem, North Carolina. While her aunt did not have any children of her own, she "loved children, and she was good with them."[8]
At the age of four, Bassett was picked up by her mother after her parents divorced; her mother took her and her sister toSt. Petersburg, Florida.[9]
Bassett did not see her father again for several years, until she attended her grandmother's funeral. There, Bassett met her father's daughter Jean, from his first marriage, who was twelve years old, and several years older than Bassett.[10]
After graduating from Jordan Park Elementary School, Bassett wasbusedto attend Disston Middle School for seventh grade. She began at that school in 1970, a year before the city of St. Petersburg formally established busing to integrate its public schools. After completing seventh grade, Bassett was bused to Azalea Middle School for eighth and ninth grades. Bassett's mother became more involved in her daughters' studies and told the two that they would go to college.[11]
In her younger years, Bassett was "in love" with theJackson 5, and dreamed of marrying a member of the family group. She said her choice would probably be "whoever had the cutest, roundest Afro at the time. In my imagination we would have children and live in a real house."[10]As her interest in entertainment developed, Angela and her sister would often put on shows, reading poems or performing popular music for their family.[12]
AtBoca Ciega High School, Bassett was a cheerleader and a member of theUpward Boundcollege prep program, the debate team, student government, drama club and choir. An "A" and "B" student for the most part, Bassett got her first "C" in physical education. She tried to convince her mother not to be disappointed by the grade. Bassett called the grade the "average," leading her mother to say she did not have "average kids." As Bassett described, she developed a "sense of pride"  and did not get another "C" until college.[13]During high school, Bassett became the first African American in that school to be admitted to theNational Honor Society. The Upward Bound program is an academic and cultural enrichment program for underprivileged students. Bassett says she and the other participants did not see themselves as underprivileged.[12]
Bassett studied atYale Universityand graduated with aBachelor of ArtsinAfrican American Studiesin 1980.[14]She studied acting at theYale School of Dramaand obtained aMaster of Fine Artsin 1983. Her paternal aunt had warned her not to "waste" her "Yale education on theater." She was the only member of Bassett's family to have gone to both college and graduate school.[13]
At Yale, Bassett met her future husbandCourtney B. Vance, a 1986 graduate of the drama school. Bassett was also classmates with actorCharles S. Dutton.[15]
After graduation, Bassett worked as a receptionist for a beauty salon and as a photo researcher to support herself while looking for acting work in the New York theater.

Bassett earned industry attention and public recognition for her early performances in the filmsBoyz n the Hood(1991) andMalcolm X(1992). For her portrayal ofBetty Shabazzin the latter, she earned anNAACP Image Award. The movie received a mixed critical reception.  One negative review, for example, judged thatMalcolm Xfailed to "capture" the rage ofMalcolm X's autobiography.[18]During production, directorSpike Leeshowed Bassett a tape of the exact moment when Malcolm X was shot, since they would be filming the scene. Bassett called the recording "haunting," but noted that afterward she was "able to grab hold of the pain and re-create the scene." Bassett felt it was important for her to get the assassination scene correct, and wondered how Betty "found the strength to keep going, to raise her family, to educate, to sustain them."[19]Bassett worried that after her role as Betty Shabazz inMalcolm X, she would not find another role "as satisfying." At the time of the film's release, she expressed her worry that she would not have such a role again. "I think I have been incredibly blessed and it is probably just all downhill from here."[20]

After returning to Los Angeles following completion of her work forMalcolm X, Bassett got a call to audition for a movie aboutTina Turner, based on her memoirI, Tina.[21]Bassett won the lead role overHalle BerryandRobin Givens, but had only one month to prepare before filming began. She met with Tina Turner twice, who advised her on details of her interpretation, from wigs and outfits to dancing styles. Turner also did Bassett's make-up, leading Bassett to call her "supportive" and her "biggest fan."[17]In an interview with theOrlando Sentinel, Bassett described going to one of Turner's concerts and, after realizing that she knew some of Turner's dance moves, she cried and was "almost a river of tears."[22]Bassett's performance as Turner inWhat's Love Got to Do with It(1993) received strong reviews.[23][24]Marc Bernardin ofEntertainment Weeklywrote that Bassett "gave the performance of a lifetime" portraying Turner in the biopic.[25]Bassett won aGolden Globefor her portrayal, and was the first African American to win thisAward for Best Actress.

In revenge she set fire to his entire wardrobe and vehicle, then sold what was left for one dollar. Bassett described the scene and her character in this film to theOrlando Sentinel: She said, "The thing is that my character is thinking about how her husband has left her. I have a cigarette in one hand, and I'm drinking. Basically, the four of us are sitting there talking about men and having some fun."[22]

And to cross the water, to countries where people will never meet people who look like me. So it becomes a bigger thing than me just becoming a movie star, and me just being on TV. So if you're going to show every black woman as 400lb or every black woman as the prostitute on the street ... But I have always maintained that [the roles] I cannot do because of the way I'm made up, or because of the way I think, I don't begrudge that there is someone else who has no issues with that."[127]

Hong was born on February 22, 1929, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Chinese emigrant parents Ng Fok Hong (吳福堂; aka Frank Wu Hong) and Lee Suey Far (李瑞花; aka Lee Shui Fa). His father emigrated from theColony of Hong Kongto Chicago, Illinois, via Canada, and later moved to Minneapolis where he owned a restaurant and was leader of the localHip Sing Tong.[9]Hong's paternal grandfather was fromTaishan.[10]
For his early education, Hong relocated to Hong Kong, residing in Kowloon, before returning to the United States at the age of 10. During his upbringing, Hong mentioned being the only Asian student in a class of 500 children. Consequently, he experienced bullying and racism from classmates who singled him out as a foreigner and due to his limited proficiency in English.[11][12]He graduated fromMinneapolis Central High School. He first developed an interest in performing arts after watchingPeking operaperformers rehearse at his father's shop.[2]
Hong studiedcivil engineeringat theUniversity of Minnesota, where he concentrated the majority of his free time on moving plates and fixing templates for the drill squad.  While at the University of Minnesota, he joined theMinnesota Army National Guard.[13]His university studies were interrupted when his national guard unit was mobilized during theKorean Warand sent toCamp Rucker, Alabama for training.[13]
While in the Minnesota Army National Guard, Hong attended training in Alabama atFort McClellanand Camp Rucker (renamedFort Novoselin 2023) with theSpecial Servicesfor 18 months from 1952 to 1953. After finishing his training for the day, he would entertain soldiers; upon witnessing Hong's performing prowess, the camp general asked Hong to stay and be in charge of the camp's live shows rather than deploy overseas.[13]
Hong reflected on this experience and how it may have saved his life:
I do not know if I would have liked to go to war in Korea but let's admit it that with a G.I. cap and this face charging at the Korean army, the Koreans would try to kill me.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
