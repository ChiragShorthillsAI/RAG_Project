26-year-old Sarah Jo babysits for a family of two parents, Heather and Josh and their son, Zach, who hasDown syndrome. Sarah Jo lives with her single mother, Marilyn, and sister, Treina. Marilyn has had many husbands and one-night stands, and has a somewhat pessimistic view on love (and men in general). During a discussion about love and male attraction, Marilyn advises her daughters to ask a man she admires, "Do you find me beautiful?"
The next day, Sarah Jo and Josh are alone in the family's laundry room when Sarah Jo asks Josh if he finds her beautiful. Josh becomes flustered, and Sarah Jo lifts up her dress to reveal a scar above her vagina. Sarah Jo informs Josh that she had an emergencyradical hysterectomyat age 15 which caused her to go intomenopauseby age 17. Sarah Jo tells Josh that she is a virgin, and Josh responds by saying that she wouldn't want to lose her virginity to him. After some awkward rambling from Sarah Jo, Josh approaches Sarah Jo and asks if he can kiss her. Josh and Sarah Jo kiss, and Josh asks if he can go down on Sarah Jo. Josh performsoral sexon Sarah Jo and takes hervirginity. Josh ejaculates quickly and becomes embarrassed. Sarah Jo reassures Josh, and he fingers Sarah Jo.[2]
The next day, Sarah Jo returns to work and sneaks up on Josh in the attic. Josh tells Sarah Jo that they cannot have sex again. Sarah Jo lifts up her dress to reveal her scar again. This turns Josh on, and the two have sex again.
Sarah Jo and Josh take a road trip to rural New York. The couple stays in a cabin while the two lie about their whereabouts; Josh claims to have a friend commitment, while Sarah Jo blames her absence on a family emergency. During the excursion, Sarah Jo and Josh consumehallucinogenic mushroomsand smokemarijuana. The two have sex repeatedly and watch porn together. Josh gives Sarah Jo a necklace. Sarah Jo goes home and continues to watch porn. She becomes interested in a porn actor named Vance Leroy, who frequently compliments his sexual partners on camera and who Sarah Jo feels is a kindred, spiritual person like Sarah Jo and her family.
When Sarah Jo returns to work, Heather's water breaks and she goes into labor. Sarah Jo calls Josh and leans down to comfort Heather, who notices Sarah Jo's necklace. When Josh arrives, Heather demands that she be taken to the hospital via ambulance. Josh, who has now realized that the affair has been revealed, breaks down and claims that Sarah Jo meant nothing to him. It is revealed that he has cheated many times, even once trying to flee the country with a fling. Josh screams at Sarah Jo, who leaves the house.
Distraught, Sarah Jo writes a letter to Vance Leroy about her sexual exploration, believing that her somewhat awkward, imperfect sex with Josh was the reason Josh betrayed her. She creates an alphabetical checklists of sex acts she wants to try and wants to avoid, including "anal" (try), "blowjob" (try), and "necrophilia" (avoid/not interested). Excited to complete her checklist, she engages in a short series of casual hookups. One fling, Arvin, works in porn and promises to deliver her letter to Vance Leroy. Meanwhile, without her job babysitting for Josh and Heather, Sarah Jo is depressed and anxious about not being able to sexually please her future partners; she believes her imperfect sex skills render her incapable of being loved. Later Vance responds to her letter with a video that Arvin brings to her, and his words reassure her. She takes a job looking after a girl who hascerebral palsy, and invites Arvin back to hang out. They have sex as a montage of all of Sarah Jo's sexual encounters (ranging from awkward, to sweet, to fiery) plays.
In April 2020,Lena Dunhammoved from London toSilver Lake, Los Angeles, in the midst of theCOVID-19 pandemic. She passed the time watching a number of films from the 1970s, includingBelle de Jour,A Woman Under the Influence,Remember My Name, andAn Unmarried Woman. The films, as well as the impact of ahysterectomy, motivated Dunham to write, direct, and star inSharp Stick. She described the film's impact on her by saying, "It was about processing my life. And then, obviously, it becomes about the characters — and not about you at all."[2]Dunham has also stated that she wanted to create a film that depicted a young woman's complicated sexual awakening without chastising or punishing her. In a director's statement to theWashington Post, she noteddouble standardsin on-screen portrayals of men and women's coming-of-age: "Men getAlfie— the freewheeling Brit with atheme songand aremake. Women getRepulsion."[3]Dunham has likenedSharp Stickto a "sexualfable",[4]and many critics have made similar comparisons to fables orfairy tales.[5][6][7]
After receiving the script,Jon BernthalandJennifer Jason Leighwere immediately on board to star.Taylour Paige, however, was initially hesitant with joining the cast: "If I'm being honest. I was like, 'Don't you think this character was written as a white person?" Dunham convinced Paige to star by telling her that she had written the part with her in mind.[2]
With an all-female production crew, filming took place in secret inAtwater VillageandEagle Rock, Los Angeles, in early 2021. According to lead actressKristine Froseth, "There was a good energy all around. We had an amazing intimacy coordinator. Everything was choreographed — no surprises." In March 2021, the film was presented to buyers at the71st Berlin International Film Festival.[8]In August 2021,Tommy Dorfmanwas confirmed to star.[9]Dunham's husbandLuis Felbercomposed the musical score.[2]
Ahead of the film's premiere at Sundance, Amy Gravino, anautisticself-advocateandsex educator, posted aTwitterthread alleging that she was approached to be a consultant onSharp Stick, but was subsequently "ghosted" by Lena Dunham and her team before she could meet with Dunham in person.[10][11]In aVarietyarticle covering the situation, Gravino claimed that, during the film's development process, Kristine Froseth had blindly approached her business manager after coming across aTED TalkGravino gave in 2016. According to Gravino, Froseth had come to the conclusion that, though the script never directly indicated as such, Sarah Jo, her character in the film, showed several characteristics that suggested she was autistic. Gravino, who was grateful to accept a paying job as a consultant, reviewed the script and concurred with Froseth's analysis. Gravino also claimed in theVarietypiece that Lena Dunham had done research on her work and was excited to meet with her. However, according to the film's producers, Dunham rejected Froseth's suggestion to hire Gravino as a consultant, and clarified to Froseth that she had never intended to depict Sarah Jo as autistic.[10]
In the same article, an unnamed spokesperson for the film responded to the claims with a formal statement, which read in part, "Sarah Jo was never written nor imagined as aneurodivergentwoman. Nothing about Sarah Jo wascodedto suggest or convey neurodivergence." However, Gravino countered this response by stating, "You can’t just say the character isn’t going to be neurodiverse; the coding is still there and it comes across that way in the writing and acting choices, even though it’s not explicitly stated." She also criticized the "infantilization" of Sarah Jo in the film, though the film's producers claimed that her childlike characterization was developed to reflect the trauma she endured, rather than to indicate that she was autistic.[10]
The film premiered virtually at the2022 Sundance Film Festivalon January 22. In an interview, Dunham said "There are many greater tragedies than me not getting to see my movie premiere but I was so excited for my cast to get to see it together. We did it on such a small scale, and everyone really brought everything to it. It was such a harkening back to how I started. But we're planning a Zoom party. I guess people Zoomed into my wedding — and they'll Zoom into my premiere."[2]In February 2022,Utopiaacquired the film's distribution rights.[12]It was released in theaters on July 29, 2022.[13]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 49% of 102 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's consensus reads: "A series of promising ideas lost in scattershot execution,Sharp Stickstands as a disappointing setback for writer-director Lena Dunham."[14]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 53 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[15]
In a Sundance review forTimemagazine,Stephanie Zacharekpraised Lena Dunham's willingness to depict a woman's messy, flawed sexual experiences, writing, "This is a film made with tenderness, more an exploration than a definitive statement, and a reminder that awkward sex isn’t necessarily bad sex: if anything, it’s the ultimate proof of our bewildering, imperfect humanness." Zacharek also praised the sincerity of the film in its depiction of finding love in "a world where the Internet is better at providing the illusion of interconnectedness than it is at actually connecting us".[16]ForRogerEbert.com, Tomris Laffly awardedSharp Stickthree out of four stars, writing that Dunham "unearths a refreshing amount of humor, honesty, and sincerity" in the film. Laffly also described Kristine Froseth's lead performance as "extraordinary".[7]
InThe New Yorker,Richard Brodycomplimented the detail and perceptiveness with which Dunham fashioned the film's sex scenes, but complained that "the parts of the film involving Sarah Jo’s quest of sexual experience are rushed, breezed by, diminished—as is the interpersonal, emotional part that inevitably comes into play".[6]For theWashington Post,Ann Hornadaypraised the film's "candor" and sense of humor, but criticized Sarah Jo's characterization, describing her as "a naif so innocent and so unworldly that she feels less like a fully realized human than a symbol".[3]
Hornaday's sentiment was echoed by several negative reviews ofSharp Stick. InThe Hollywood Reporter, Jourdain Searles questioned the reasoning behind Sarah Jo's "troubling" characterization:
What is the significance of Sarah Jo being this way? Yes, she’s sexually repressed, but how can she be this naive considering the sexual openness of her mother and sister? How did she manage to glean nothing from her 26 years on Earth? It doesn’t help matters that Froseth — who was roughly the age of her character at the time of filming — looks much younger than she is, and the costume choices push her uncomfortably intofetishobject territory.[17]
Adrian Horton ofThe Guardiangave the film two out of five stars, stating that the film's more "interesting, immersive material" becomes "torpedoed by Dunham’s decision, refracted by Froseth’s odd performance, to write Sarah Jo as more sexual alien than curious person".[18]InThe New York Times, Amy Nicholson described scenes involving Sarah Jo's sexual experimentation as "too humorless for satire and too artificial to support the film’s eventual, deluded attempt to shift into a somewhat sincere coming-of-age tale".[19]Dana StevensofSlatereferred to such scenes "disturbing", writing, "The wide-eyed enthusiasm with which Sarah Jo approaches this project is meant, I think, to be whimsically endearing; instead, I worried for her safety every time a stranger appeared at the door." Stevens also criticized the film's approach to contrasting Sarah Jo with her adopted sister, the "twerking, boy-crazy" Treina, played by Taylour Paige, calling their dynamic "a pure story contrivance—and one that, given the fact Sarah Jo is white and Treina Black, carries with it racial implications that the script barrels obliviously past".[20]
Additionally, forInsideHook, Charles Bramesco scrutinized the "traditionalism" of Dunham's decision to write a sexually adventurous character who ultimately ends up "back into the arms of the one genuine date she actually made a connection with".[21]

She is the creator, writer, and star of theHBOtelevision seriesGirls(2012–2017), for which she received severalEmmy Awardnominations and twoGolden Globe Awards.[2][3]Dunham also directed several episodes ofGirlsand became the first woman to win theDirectors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series.[4]She started her career writing, directing, and starring in her semi-autobiographicalindependent filmTiny Furniture(2010), for which she won anIndependent Spirit Awardfor Best First Screenplay. She has since written and directed the 2022 filmsSharp StickandCatherine Called Birdy.
In 2013, Dunham was included in the annualTime100 list of the most influential people in the world.[5]In 2014, Dunham released her first book,Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's "Learned".[6]In 2015, along withGirlsshowrunnerJenni Konner, Dunham created thepublicationLenny Letter, afeministonline newsletter.[7][8]The publication ran for three years before its discontinuation in late 2018.[9]
Dunham briefly appeared in films such asSupporting CharactersandThis Is 40(both 2012), andHappy Christmas(2014). She voiced Mary in the 2016 filmMy Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea, which premiered at theToronto International Film Festival. On television, aside fromGirls, she has played guest roles inScandalandThe Simpsons(both 2015). In 2017, she portrayedValerie SolanasinAmerican Horror Story: Cult.[10]
Dunham's work, as well as her outspoken presence onsocial mediaand in interviews, have attracted significant controversy, praise, criticism, and media scrutiny throughout her career.[11][12]
Dunham was born in New York City.[13][14]Her father,Carroll Dunham, is a painter, and her mother,Laurie Simmons, is an artist and photographer, and a member ofThe Pictures Generation, known for her use of dolls and dollhouse furniture in her photographs of setup interior scenes.[15][16]Her father isProtestantof mostlyEnglishancestry;[17]whereas her mother isJewish.[18][19][20][21]Dunham has described herself as feeling "very culturally Jewish, although that's the biggest cliché for a Jewish woman to say." TheModern Hebrew poetryofYehuda Amichaihelped her to connect with herJudaism.[22][23][24]
Dunham attendedFriends Seminarybefore transferring in seventh grade toSaint Ann's SchoolinBrooklyn, where she metTiny Furnitureactress and futureGirlsco-starJemima Kirke.[25][26]As a teen, Dunham also won aScholastic Art and Writing Award.[27]She attendedThe New Schoolfor a year before transferring toOberlin College,[28][16]where she graduated in 2008 with a degree in creative writing.[16]
She has a younger sibling,Cyrus, a 2014 graduate ofBrown University, who appeared in Dunham's first film,Creative Nonfiction, and starred in her second film,Tiny Furniture.[16][29]The siblings were raised in Brooklyn and spent summers inSalisbury, Connecticut.[30]
While a student atOberlin College, Dunham produced several independentshort filmsand uploaded them toYouTube. Many of her early films dealt with themes of sexual enlightenment and were produced in amumblecorefilmmaking style, a dialogue-heavy style in which young people talk about their personal relationships. In 2006, she producedPressure, in which a girl and two friends talk about experiencing an orgasm for the first time, which makes Dunham's character feel pressured to do so as well.[31][32]"I didn't go to film school", Dunham explains. "Instead I went to liberal arts school and self-imposed a curriculum of creating tiny flawed video sketches, brief meditations on comic conundrums, and slapping them on the Internet."[33]
Another early film, entitledThe Fountain, which depicted her in a bikini brushing her teeth in the public fountain at Oberlin College, went viral on YouTube.[34][35]"Her blithe willingness to disrobe without shame caused an outburst of censure from viewers," observedThe New Yorker'sRebecca Mead.[16]Dunham was shocked by the backlash and decided to take the video down:
There were just pages ofYouTubecomments about how fat I was, or how not fat I was," Dunham said. "I didn't want you to Google me and the first thing you see is a debate about whether my breasts are misshapen."[16]
Pressures(2006),Open the Door(2007),Hooker on Campus(2007), andThe Fountain(2007) were released asDVDextras withTiny Furniture.[36]
In 2007, Dunham starred in a ten-episode web series forNerve.comentitledTight Shots,[37][38]described byThe New York Times Magazine'sVirginia Heffernanas "a daffy serial about kids trying to make a movie and be artsy and have tons of sex."[39]
In 2009, Dunham created theIndex Magazineweb series,Delusional Downtown Divas, which satirized the New York City art scene. The production was unpaid, so Dunham and her friends "pooled their money from babysitting and art-assistant gigs and borrowed some camera gear."[40]
Also in 2009, Dunham premieredCreative Nonfiction— a comedy where she plays Ella, a college student struggling to complete a screenplay[41]— at theSouth by SouthwestFestival in Austin, Texas. She was initially rejected by the festival the year before; she re-edited and successfully resubmitted the film.[42]
Dunham had a career breakthrough with her semi-autobiographical 2010 feature filmTiny Furniture; the film won Best Narrative Feature atSouth by Southwest Music and Media Conference, and subsequently screened at such festivals asMaryland Film Festival.[43]Dunham plays the lead role of Aura.[16]Laurie Simmons(Dunham's real-life mother) plays Aura's mother, and Dunham's real-life sibling Cyrus plays Aura's on-screen sibling. For her work onTiny Furniture, Dunham also won anIndependent Spirit Awardfor Best First Screenplay.[44][45][46]
The success ofTiny Furnitureearned Dunham a blind script deal atHBO.[47]The network set Dunham up with veteran showrunnerJennifer Konner. Konner toldVulture'sJada Yuanthat she got involved with Dunham because she was an obsessiveTiny Furniturefan:
I got a copy ofTiny Furniturefrom [HBO president]Sue Naegle. Actually, [New Girlcreator]Liz Meriwethertold me about it and said, 'Oh, there's this great movie. This girl, she's 23, she wrote, directed, and starred in it; she's in her underwear the whole time.' And I was like, 'I really don't want to see that.' And then she was like, 'Oh, trust me, it's great.' So Sue gave it to me just because she had it ... I used to, like, give out copies of the movie. But I'd just broken up with my writing partner and couldn't be less interested in the idea of supervising anybody. I really was like, 'I'm going to find my voice, and be on my own.' And then they called me and they were like, 'Oh, theTiny Furnituregirl is doing a show, do you want to supervise her?' And I was like, 'Yes! One million percent. Sign me up. Totally on board.'[48]
Dunham's star was also raised considerably when she was profiled byDavid CarrinThe New York Times; he was later credited with introducing her toJudd Apatow.[49][50]Apatow watchedTiny Furniture, and was surprised Dunham had also written and directed the film. "I emailed her and told her I thought it was great", Apatow toldThe Hollywood Reporter. "It turned out she was in the middle of negotiating a deal to develop a show for HBO and that her partner was Jenni Konner, whom I had worked with onUndeclaredand a bunch of other projects. They asked me if I wanted to be a part of it, and I was thrilled to jump in."[51]
Dunham's television series,Girls, was greenlit byHBOin early 2011.[52]Three episodes were screened to positive response at the 2012 South by Southwest Festival.[53]
The series follows Hannah Horvath (portrayed by Dunham), a 20-something writer struggling to get by in New York City. Some of the struggles facing Dunham's character Hannah—including being cut off financially from her parents, becoming a writer and making unfortunate decisions—are inspired by Dunham's real-life experiences.[54]
Dunham saidGirlsreflects a part of the population not portrayed in the 1998 HBO seriesSex and the City. "Gossip Girlwas teens duking it out on theUpper East SideandSex and the Citywas women who [had] figured out work and friends and now want to nail romance and family life. There was this 'hole-in-between' space that hadn't really been addressed," she said.[54]The pilot intentionally referencesSex and the City, as producers wanted to make it clear that the driving force behindGirlsis that the characters were inspired by the former HBO series and moved to New York to pursue their dreams.[54]Dunham herself says she "revere[s] that show just as much as any girl of my generation".[54]
The first season premiered on HBO on April 15, 2012, and received critical acclaim.The New York Timesapplauded the series, writing that "Girlsmay be themillennial generation's rebuttal toSex and the City, but the first season was at times as cruelly insightful and bleakly funny asLouieon FX orCurb Your Enthusiasmon HBO."[55]James Poniewozik fromTimereserved high praise for the series, calling it "raw, audacious, nuanced and richly, often excruciatingly funny".[56]
Despite the acclaim, the series also generated significant criticism over its lack of racial representation and Dunham's frequent on-screen nudity.[57][58]
The first season garnered Dunham fourEmmy Awardnominations for her roles in acting, writing, and directing the series, as well as twoGolden Globe AwardsforBest Television Series – Musical or ComedyandBest Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy.[59][60]In February 2013, Dunham became the first woman to win aDirectors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Seriesfor her work onGirls.[61]
Girlswas renewed for a second season in April 2012, before the first season had finished airing.[62]The first season finale drew over one million viewers.[63]
The second season ofGirlscontinued to receive critical acclaim. David Wiegland of theSan Francisco Chroniclesaid: "The entire constellation of impetuous, ambitious, determined and insecure young urbanites inGirlsis realigning in the new season, but at no point in the four episodes sent to critics for review do you feel that any of it is artificial".[64]Verne Gay ofNewsdaysaid: "Sharper, smarter, more richly layered, detailed and acted".[65]Ken Tucker ofEntertainment Weeklyfelt that "As bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as it was in its first season,Girlsmay now be even spunkier, funnier, and riskier".[66]The second season ran on HBO from January 2013 to March 2013, with third and fourth seasons subsequently being renewed. The third season ofGirlspremiered in January 2014 with over one million viewers.[67]The following month, Dunham hosted an episode ofSaturday Night Livewith musical guestThe National.[68]
In late 2012, Dunham signed a $3.5 million deal withRandom Houseto publish her first book.[69]The book, an essay collection calledNot That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's "Learned", was published in September 2014.[70]It reached number two onThe New York Times Best Seller listin October 2014.[71]

In October 2018, Dunham and Konner announced thatLenny Letterwould be shutting down,[9][115]reportedly due to a decline in subscribers and failure to build momentum upon other platforms.[116]
Dunham has received criticism for her production of the filmOrgasm Inc.: The Story of OneTaste. Hundreds of women and men claim that Dunham's production company was responsible for using their image against their consent, filing a lawsuit against Netflix to disallow the film, signing petitions, and creating viral videos protesting the violation.[117][118][119]The film reportedly relies on "personal journals" attorneys have claimed to be fabricated despite the film presenting itself as a documentary.[120]
Dunham claimed in her bookNot That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's "Learned"that she had been sexually assaulted by a person she called "Barry". Other details in the book indicated that "Barry" was a formerOberlin Collegeclassmate.[121][122][123]In the book, Dunham describes "Barry" as a man who wore cowboy boots, sported a mustache, hosted a radio show, worked at a campus library, and graduated from Oberlin in 2005; this description was characterized by the attorney of Dunham's former classmate as detailed enough to point towards his client. Dunham later apologized for the confusion and Random House reprinted the book with a disclaimer, releasing a statement saying: "Random House, on our own behalf and on behalf of our author, regrets the confusion."[124]Other passages in the book recounting interactions of a sexual nature, starting when she was seven years old – with her then one-year-old sibling Grace (nowCyrus) – also attracted significant controversy,[125]and prompted numerouseditorialsaboutchildren's sexualityand personal boundaries.[126][127][128]
Dunham's work and her outspoken presence on social media and in interviews have attracted significant controversy, criticism, and media scrutiny throughout her career.[11][12]On several occasions, Dunham has been accused of making racially insensitive remarks.[129][130]Upon release,Girlswas met with criticism regarding the all-white main cast in the otherwiseculturally diverse setting of New York City.[131][132]Though some pointed out that many Americans are friends with other people of the same race, and adding a "token" African-American or Asian-American friend would be "immature" to reality.[133]Donald Gloverguest starred as Sandy, a black Republican and Hannah's love interest, in the first two episodes of season two, which was criticized astokenismin response to the initial backlash from the first season.[134]
Dunham spoke publicly about the criticism on several occasions; in an interview withIndieWire, she said:
I am a half-Jew, half-WASP, and I wrote two Jews and two WASPs. Something I wanted to avoid was tokenism in casting. If I had one of the four girls, if, for example, she was African-American, I feel like—not that the experience of an African-American girl and a white girl are drastically different, but there has to be specificity to that experience [that] I wasn't able to speak to. I really wrote the show from a gut-level place, and each character was a piece of me or based on someone close to me. And only later did I realize that it was four white girls. As much as I can say it was an accident, it was only later as the criticism came out, I thought, 'I hear this and I want to respond to it.' And this is a hard issue to speak to because all I want to do is sound sensitive and not say anything that will horrify anyone or make them feel more isolated, but I did write something that was super-specific to my experience, and I always want to avoid rendering an experience I can't speak to accurately.[135]
In September 2016, Dunham criticizedNFLplayerOdell Beckham Jr.for his interactions with her at theMet Gala. Dunham said: "I was sitting next to Odell Beckham Jr., and it was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards. He was like, 'That's a marshmallow. That's a child. That's a dog.' It wasn't mean — he just seemed confused. The vibe was very much like, 'Do I want to f--- it? Is it wearing a ... yep, it's wearing a tuxedo. I'm going to go back to my cell phone." She added, "It was like we were forced to be together, and he literally was scrollingInstagramrather than have to look at a woman in a bow tie. I was like, 'This should be called the Metropolitan Museum of Getting Rejected by Athletes'."[136]Dunham was criticized for her comments, which some considered to be an example of "white entitlement".[137][138]She later apologized for her characterization of his interactions and thoughts.[139]
In December 2016, Dunham declared on a podcast that she wished she had had anabortion, explaining that she wanted to better understand women who have. The comment was widely condemned as insensitive.[140][141]Dunham later issued a lengthy apology on her Instagram.[142][143]
In November 2017, Dunham defendedGirlswriterMurray Miller, whom actressAurora Perrineauhad accused of sexually assaulting her in 2012 when she was seventeen. Dunham responded to the accusations by saying: "While our first instinct is to listen to every woman's story, our insider knowledge of Murray's situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3% of assault cases that are misreported every year."[144]After an immediate backlash, Dunham apologized for that statement, saying that it was "absolutely the wrong time to come forward with such a statement" and that "every woman who comes forward deserves to be heard, fully and completely, and our relationship to the accused should not be part of the calculation anyone makes when examining her case."[144]Dunham was described as a "hipster racist" for her defense of Miller, as Perrineau is of mixed race.[145][146]In December 2018, Dunham stated that, contrary to her previous statement, she had no "insider information" that exonerated Murray.[147][148][149]
In October 2018, Dunham was hired to write the screenplay for an untitled film based upon the memoirA Hope More Powerful Than the Sea: One Refugee's Incredible Story of Love, Loss, and Survival, byMelissa Fleming, which follows the true story ofDoaa Al Zamel, who fled Egypt for Europe and became one of few survivors of ashipwrecked refugee boat, surviving days in open water and supporting herself and two orphaned children with only an inflatable water ring.[150]Steven SpielbergandJ. J. Abramsare set to produce the film.[151]Dunham's hiring received backlash from those who felt that, instead of Dunham, a Syrian woman should have been hired.[152][153][154]Daniel Medina, a journalist, wrote: "Lena Dunham constantly talks about representation as crucial to enrich storytelling. Yet, in practice, she has shown a disregard for actually elevating those voices. Now, she's been signed on to write a Syrian refugee's story?".[155]AuthorAlia Malekstated: "The idea that Lena Dunham is better situated to tell the story of a Syrian than somebody else implicit in that is a kind of hierarchy."[156]
In January 2022, ahead of the film'sSundancepremiere,autisticself-advocateandsex educatorAmy Gravino posted a Twitter thread alleging that she was approached to be a consultant on Dunham's filmSharp Stick, but was subsequently "ghosted" before she had a chance to meet with Dunham in person.[157][158]In aVarietyarticle covering the subject, Gravino claimed that the film's star, Kristine Froseth, had approached her business manager while doing research for her character Sarah Jo, whom she concluded displayed characteristics that suggested she was autistic. Gravino also claimed that Dunham had personally done research on her work and was excited to meet with her. However, according to the film's producers, Dunham rejected Froseth's suggestion to approach Gravino, and clarified to Froseth that she had never intended to depict Sarah Jo as autistic.
An unnamed spokesperson also released a statement toVarietythat read, "Sarah Jo was never written nor imagined as aneurodivergentwoman. Nothing about Sarah Jo wascodedto suggest or convey neurodivergence." Gravino responded to this defense by saying, "You can’t just say the character isn’t going to be neurodiverse; the coding is still there and it comes across that way in the writing and acting choices, even though it’s not explicitly stated." She also criticized the film for its "infantilization" of Sarah Jo, though the producers countered this assessment by stating that the character's childlike qualities were included to reflect the trauma she experienced, rather than to suggest that she was autistic.[157]
In 2012, Dunham began datingJack Antonoff, the lead guitarist of the bandfun.and the founder ofBleachers.[159][160]Dunham and Antonoff remained together until December 2017; they subsequently separated announcing that the separation was "amicable".[161][162]

In fall of 2012, Dunham appeared in a video advertisement promoting PresidentBarack Obama's re-election, delivering a monologue, which, according to a blog quoted inThe Atlantic, tried to "get the youth vote by comparing voting for the first time to having sex for the first time".[179]Fox Newsreported criticism from conservatives such asMedia Research Center's Lauren Thompson, public relations professionalRonn Torossian, and media trainer Louise Pennell, who labeled the advertisement as tasteless, inappropriate, and a ploy to lure the younger female vote.[180]It included a comment from Steve Hall of Ad Rants saying that "not everyone was so offended." A friend of Dunham said the actress was not paid for her performance on the spot, and Dunham defended the ad by tweeting "The video may be light but the message is serious: vote for women's rights." InThe Nation,Ari Melberwrote "the ad's style is vintage Lena: edgy and informed, controversial but achingly self-aware, sexually proud and affirmatively feminist."[181]

She left school to star in the film.[5]
In 1982, Leigh played a pregnant teenager inAmy Heckerling's high school filmFast Times at Ridgemont High, which served as a launching pad for several of its young stars. While decrying the writing as sexist and exploitative, film criticRoger Ebertwas enthusiastic about the acting, singling out Leigh and writing, "Don't they know they have a star on their hands?"[15]With the exception ofRidgemont Highand a supporting role in the comedy filmEasy Money(1983) alongsideRodney Dangerfield, Leigh's early film work consisted of playing fragile, damaged orneuroticcharacters in low-budget horror or thriller films. She played a virginal princess kidnapped and raped by mercenaries inFlesh and Blood(1985), an innocent waitress pursued by the psychopathic title character inThe Hitcher(1986) (both films pitting her alongsideRutger Hauer), a mentally-disturbed, child-like young woman on the threshold of sexual awakening in theSouthern GothicfilmSister, Sister(1987), and a young woman on the verge of anervous breakdowninHeart of Midnight(1989).

In his 1991 bookCult Movie Stars,Danny Pearydescribed Leigh as "an interesting, always watchable, and extremely talented young actress," summarizing her appeal "For those who believe that the preacher's angelic-looking daughter is as interested in sex as thefarmer's daughter. This pretty, sweet-looking blonde has played a number of shy and innocent-looking women who are curious about sex; once they learn, they display wicked imaginations."  Peary added, "Leigh seems too gentle and looks too young and innocent to play the parts she has taken. Her females are either hungry for sex and/or have been psychologically affected by past sexual incidents... Her characters are vulnerable and almost always victimised, but usually they gave surprising resilience, and try to use their bad experiences to make themselves stronger."[21]
Leigh was cast in her first mainstream Hollywood studio film, the firefighter dramaBackdraft(1991), in which she played a more conventional role, the girlfriend of lead actorWilliam Baldwin. She found more success in the gritty crime dramaRush(1991), portraying an undercover cop who becomes a junkie and falls in love with her partner, played byJason Patric. ReviewingRush, Roger Ebert noted, "Leigh of course is a veteran by now of grubby characters in sleazy films; she has become one of the best young actresses by accepting roles some of her contemporaries would not even consider... After her extraordinary work as a doomed prostitute inLast Exit to Brooklyn, here she is again, looking sweet and wholesome, and descending into a world of people who have forgotten their better natures."[22]Leigh's next film,Single White Female(1992), was a surprise box-office success, bringing Leigh to her largest mainstream audience yet, portraying a mentally-ill woman who terrorizes roommateBridget Fonda.[23]

They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
