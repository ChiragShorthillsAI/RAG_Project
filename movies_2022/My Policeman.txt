Retirees Marion and Tom live in the English seaside town ofPeacehaven.  After learning that their former friend from decades past, Patrick, has suffered a debilitating stroke, Marion agrees to take him into their home and becomes his caregiver. Tom resents Marion for allowing him back into their lives and refuses to acknowledge Patrick's existence in the house. While sorting through Patrick's belongings, she comes across his journal from the late 1950s, which reflects on his past relationship with Tom.
In 1957Brighton, museum curator Patrick Hazelwood meets policeman Tom Burgess after reporting an accident. Patrick leaves Tom his business card, and Tom visits him at the museum where he works. Patrick invites Tom to his flat one night to draw him. The two have drinks, and Tom initiates physical touch, and they engage in oral sex. Afterwards, a shaken Tom abruptly leaves. Patrick later visits a bar one night and begins having sex with a stranger in an alley before they are caught by the police. Patrick manages to run away and finds Tom waiting for him at his flat. Tom admits his feelings, and the two have sex, resulting in a passionate romance.
Due to laws criminalizing  homosexuality, as well as Tom's fear of jeopardizing his job at the police force, they carry on their relationship in secret. Tom meets schoolteacher Marion Taylor and begins courting her. He introduces her to Patrick, and they become fast friends, bonding over their shared interest in the arts. Soon, the three of them become inseparable. Tom later proposes to Marion, and they marry, but his relationship with Patrick continues. When Patrick visits Tom and Marion at their home, she discovers the two of them behaving affectionately with one another, triggering her underlying suspicions of Tom's sexuality. Marion feels angered and betrayed, which is exacerbated when Patrick invites Tom to accompany him on a business trip toVeniceas his assistant. Shortly after their return, Patrick is arrested by Brighton police due to an anonymous report accusing him of homosexual activities. The case goes to trial, where Marion testifies on his behalf, but Patrick's journal entries, detailing his romantic and sexual relationship with Tom, are brought into evidence, resulting in his conviction. Patrick is sentenced to two years in prison, and Tom is fired from the police force. As Tom and Marion try to move on with their lives, he professes his love for her and vows they never speak of Patrick again.
In the present, Marion confesses to Tom that she was the one who reported Patrick, as a last effort to win him back, and has been living with guilt ever since. She challenges him to realize their marriage has been based on lies and that Patrick has always been his true love. She tells him she is leaving him and asks that he take care of Patrick and love him. After Marion's departure, Tom visits Patrick in his room, and they lovingly embrace each other.

OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 45% based on 148 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Mildly arresting in its best moments,My Policemantends toward the tedious despite the respectable efforts of a capable cast."[13]Metacriticgave the film aweighted average scoreof 50 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[14]
In a review forThe Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney wrote that the adaptation "does little to show that celebrated theater directorMichael Grandagecan translate his stage skills to the screen", that Grandage "gives the material so little edge" and that Nyswaner "never digs deep into his characters' psychology." He wrote that "Corrin is fine" and "as for Styles, he's not terrible, but he leaves a hole in the movie where a more multidimensional character with an inner life is needed most," while complimenting Dawson's performance, writing that the actor "plays the breezy sophisticate more convincingly than the lovelorn man inside."[15]Gregory Ellwood ofThe Playlistgave the film a positive review, writing that Grandage's direction was "sublime" while complimenting the performances of Dawson and Styles, the latter of whom he says is "night and day here compared to his work in that other fall release." He continued by adding that Corrin "steals the show" while complimenting the historical accuracy.[16]Robert Daniels ofRogerEbert.comopined that the film "is surface-level queer representation lacking in visual imagination and begging for better performances", while giving negative opinions regarding the performances of Styles and Corrin.[17]Ryan Lattanzio ofIndieWirewrote that the film is "often very good, but the best scenes involve Dawson's rapier-witted and dandyish Patrick or Corrin's Marion" but felt that Styles' performance was "a blank beyond inscrutable gazes and sappy breakdowns," and that the role "requires levels of complexity and conveying inner turmoil that Styles can't provide." He continued to praise Dawson, writing "the movie is anchored, elevated, and very often knocked completely out of the park by Dawson, who is at turns sexy, mysterious, wise, naive, overflowingly open, vulnerable, and strong."[18]
In a review forVanity Fair, Richard Lawson proclaimed the film is "studied and plodding in its period-piece solemnity, a dirge of a movie about reckless people that is never warmed by their implied inner fire." He complimented the performances of Dawson and Corrin but was more mixed regarding Styles, writing that he "projects a glow of decency throughout the film, which means he’s not unwelcome in any given scene, but you ache for him every time a bit of dialogue thuds."[19]Writing forThe Guardian, Benjamin Lee stated that the film "isn't exactly a washout but it's not exactly much of anything, a disappointingly drab and stridently straightforward love triangle saga ... underpowered by a blank lead performance" and that "Grandage struggles to pull our heartstrings, an easy target easily missed," where Styles is "all construct and no conviction, a performer as unsure of his ability as we are", while also adding that "Corrin and Dawson are easily more effective than Styles but still a little too mannered to pierce through."[20]Writing forVariety, Peter Debruge wrote that Nysaner "shapes this mystery somewhat strangely" while opining that "a more meaningful version of this story would have involved less time reading alone and more talking together." He added that Corrin "could do this role in their sleep, while Styles has "the tricky task of making Tom's betrayal feel tragic for all involved," while also commenting on Styles "fully embracing the ambiguity of his queerbaiting brand."[21]Regarding Styles, David Jenkins ofLittle White Lieswrites that "There's an understatement and simple clarity to his line delivery and body language that works well in the context of a man driven by primal desires."[22]Tom Charity ofThe Timescriticised the film's plot but wrote that Styles "outshines this plodding love triangle".[23]
Leah Greenblatt ofEntertainment Weeklyopined that the film "is fevered, lovely to look at, and at times deeply silly" while writing that Dawson is "quietly affecting" whereas "Styles' style is more remote. His Tom often feels like a cipher, thoughtful and charming one moment and heedlessly cruel and manipulative the next." She added that the film "mostly feels like a movie we've seen many times before: a pleasantly escapist two hours with pretty people in pretty clothes, madly sublimating their feelings until the final, luminous frame."[24]Luke Hearfield of theEvening Standardwrote that "Dawson's nuanced performance is the highlight of this film" and that "Styles tries but neither he nor his co-stars are helped by this plodding script," ending his review by writing "the real crime of this film is how painfully average it is."[25]Nick Schwager ofThe Daily Beastwrote that "Styles and Dawson share no sparks" while criticising the direction of Grandage and Nysanner.[26]Amber Dowling ofConsequencewrote that "Emma Corrin and David Dawson breathe life into an otherwise lengthy sentence of a film" and that "Styles continues to make a name for himself in the acting space," but felt that there was a "lack of depth" throughout the film, specifically in regards to the character of Tom.[27]Tim Grierson ofScreen Internationalfelt that the film "is so reserved as to feel mannered" and that Dawson and Styles "have an elegant rapport" but that "neither character succeeds in being particularly complicated or tormented," adding that "the film's strong point may be Corrin". He ended his review by writing "tragic stories are worth telling, butMy Policemanis ultimately too genteel for the task".[28]
Gary Goldestein of theLos Angeles Timesdubbed the film an "absorbing, resonant, deeply wistful adaptation" and opined that Styles "carries the day here" while also complimenting the musical score and the performances of Dawson, Corrin, McKee, and Everett.[29]Jocelyn Noveck ofAssociated Presscriticised Grandage's and Nyswaner's characteriziation of Tom, writing that "his character is very underdeveloped" and that it appears as if they chose to "mute the confident pop-star magnetism, in service of the story".[30]Writing forHouston Chronicle, A.A. Dowd felt that Styles "isn’t quite up to the acting challenges" and named him the "weak link". He added that Grandage and Nyswaner "handle the helixed relationships of their borrowed material with sensitivity and compassion" but felt like "Grandage mutes the conflicts" while praising Dawson's performance.[31]Wendy Ide ofThe Guardiangave the film a negative review, writing that "the best that can be said about Styles is that his is not the worst performance in Michael Grandage’s uninspired plodder, but that’s not much of an endorsement, given the half-hearted work from most of the cast".[32]Richard RoeperofChicago Sun-Timesnamed the film "a borderline dull affair" and felt as if it "never really resonates".[33]G. Allen Johnson ofSan Francisco Chroniclecalled the film "a simple, well-told story" and complimented Grandage's direction and Styles's performance, writing that "after two films as a leading man, it’s clear that Styles is more than a handsome face."[34]Writing for theBBC, Caryn James opined that Styles "is far more convincing and has a much fuller, more grounded role inMy Policeman" when compared to his performance inDon't Worry Darlingbut criticised the screenplay, feeling that it "could have explored much more".[35]Kimberly Jones ofThe Austin Chroniclewrote that "the plot elements are all there for something emotional wrecking, but Grandage and his cast approach it with such enormous restraint, the oxygen is cut off completely. This is bloodless filmmaking".[36]Thomas Floyd ofThe Washington Postnamed the film an "uninspired depiction of mid-century homophobia, forbidden love and long-simmering resentment" and called Styles's performance "flat" but praised the musical score and Dawson's performance, writing he plays his character with a "blend of yearning and pain".[37]
The main cast members were announced as the collective winners of an acting award at TIFF'sTribute Awards, the first time that an award in that category was ever presented to an ensemble cast rather than an individual.[38]The film received a nomination in the34th GLAAD Media Awardsfor Outstanding Film - Limited Release, losing toThe Inspection.[39]The film also received aQueertyaward nomination for Studio Movie, losing toEverything Everywhere All At Once.[40]

In 2013, Everett worked on the production of a documentary onsex workfor Channel 4 that included the issue of criminalisation. During and after its filming, he contributed to the discourse on prostitution legislation in the UK. In October 2013, he signed an open letter from theEnglish Collective of Prostitutesand Queer Strike—alongside groups such as the Association of Trade Union Councils,Sex Worker Open University, Left Front Art – Radical Progressive Queers, Queer Resistance, and Queers Against the Cuts—to oppose the adoption of the "Swedish model", whereby the clients of sex workers (though not the workers themselves) are criminalised.[56]
Everett continued his participation in the sex-work legislation debate in 2014, writing a long-form piece forThe Guardianand appearing on the BBC One programmeThis Week.[57][58]He also joined protesters in a demonstration outside the offices ofSoho Estates, a major property company that owns properties on Soho's Walkers Court, where many sex workers are based.
In 2012, Everett said in an interview regarding same-sex marriage: "But why do we want to get married in churches? I don't understand that, myself, personally. Iloatheheterosexual weddings; I would never go to a wedding in my life. I loathe the flowers, I loathe the fucking wedding dress, the little bridal tiara. It's grotesque. It's just hideous. The wedding cake, the party, the champagne, the inevitable divorce two years later. It's just a waste of time in the heterosexual world, and in the homosexual world I find it personally beyond tragic that we want to ape this institution that is so clearly a disaster."[59]A few days after the release of the interview, he was criticized[60][61][62]for the following remark: "I can't think of anything worse than being brought up by two gay dads". He went on to explain that "[f]or me, being gay was about wanting to do the opposite of the straight world, so I think that's where my problems in this particular area come from. [...] But that's me, just me. I'm not having a go at gay couples who do. I think if Elton and David want to have babies, that's wonderful. I think we should all do what we want."[63]
Everett has also disclosed that he identified astransgenderduring his childhood and dressed as a girl from age six to 14.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
