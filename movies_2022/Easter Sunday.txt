In addition to Koy, the film starsTia Carrere,Brandon Wardell,Eugene Cordero,Asif Ali, Lydia Gaston,Jimmy O. Yang, andLou Diamond Phillips.Universal Picturestheatrically released the film on August 5, 2022. It received mixed reviews from critics.
Joe Valencia is a comedian and struggling actor inLos Angeles, known for his beer commercial catch-phrase, "Let's Get This Party Started". He is also a single father to his son Junior, though his work schedule often comes first.
Joe's agent Nick obtains a sitcom audition, but when the producer learns he is half-Filipino, the role turns stereotypical. The audition also causes Joe to miss a school meeting with Junior and his teachers. To compensate, Joe resolves to take Junior with him to his family's Easter Sunday celebration inDaly Cityfor the weekend.
Joe and Junior arrive and meet with Joe's mom, Susan, and his sister, Regina, his cousin Eugene, his aunt Yvonne, uncles Arthur and Manny, and aunt Theresa (who is feuding with Susan). The family goes to church, where Joe learns Eugene wasted an investment meant for a taco truck on a "hype truck" selling useless merchandise.
Joe learns Eugene borrowed from a gangster named Dev in order to pay for the hype truck merchandise. They attempt to get money from a wealthy acquaintance Marvin by pawning offManny Pacquiao's boxing gloves from his fight withOscar De La Hoya, which Eugene stole from Dev. Marvin refuses, knowing Dev's ruthless reputation.
Joe and Eugene go to the mall with Junior, who runs into Tala, his crush, at her workplace. They find out Tala's boss is Dev, who spots them and chases them out of the mall. Joe and Eugene go to a mysterious man, "The Jeweler", who can help buy Pacquiao’s gloves. The Jeweler ends up beingLou Diamond Phillips, who agrees to give them the money they seek later.
On Easter Sunday, the family is preparing for dinner, but Nick informs Joe that he booked him a flight back to Los Angeles to meet with a producer for the show, and assures the role is guaranteed if Joe plays to stereotype, but Joe refuses. The flight also happens to be at the same time as the dinner. Junior invites Tala to the dinner, and everyone teases Junior about possibly having a girlfriend. Susan and Theresa keep bickering, which is revealed to have begun when Theresa called Susan a bad mother for supposedly not taking care of Joe. As Joe calms them down, Junior sees Joe's texts from Nick about the show, prompting Junior to call Joe a hypocrite. He storms out, and Tala runs after him. As the dinner grows more tense, Joe gives a speech about family and brings everyone together to sing karaoke, cheering everyone up. Susan and Theresa appear to reconcile, just as Dev and his goons arrive.
Susan and Theresa try to pay Dev back, but Dev takes Junior as a hostage. Arthur distracts Dev while Joe puts on the gloves and runs outside. He punches Dev, knocking him out, and they wait for the police. Vanessa, Joe's ex and now an officer, shows up to arrest Dev. When the family goes back inside, Joe finds that his video chat was on and Nick and the producer were watching. Before Joe can explain himself, he suffers a panic attack and faints.
Joe wakes up in the hospital with the rest of the family at his bedside. The producer tells Joe she wants to create a sitcom centered around Joe and his family rather than the one from the audition. Joe agrees, and the family celebrates. Later, Joe's family is seen giving pointers to the cast of Joe's new show.

DreamWorks Pictures(also known asDreamWorks SKGcommonly referred to asDreamWorks) is an Americanfilm studioanddistributionlabel ofAmblin Partners. It was originally founded on October 12, 1994, as a live-action and animationfilm studiobySteven Spielberg,Jeffrey Katzenberg, andDavid Geffen(which together form the SKG of DreamWorks SKG), of which they owned 72%. The studio formerly distributed its own and third-party films. It has produced or distributed more than ten films with box-office grosses of more than $100 million each.
DreamWorks Pictures was sold toViacom, parent ofParamount Picturesin February 2006 (this version is now named DW Studios). In 2008, DreamWorks announced its intention to end its partnership with Paramount and made a deal to produce films with India'sReliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group,[2]re-creating DreamWorks Pictures as an independent entity. The following year, DreamWorks entered into a distribution agreement withWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, wherein Disney would distribute DreamWorks films through theTouchstone Pictureslabel; the deal continued until August 2016. Since October 2016,Universal Pictureshas distributed most of the films produced by DreamWorks Pictures. Currently, DreamWorks operates out of offices atUniversal Studios Hollywood.
DreamWorks is also distinct from itsformer animation division of the same name, which was spun off in 2004 and became a subsidiary ofNBCUniversalin 2016.[3]Spielberg's company continues to use the original DreamWorks trademarks under license from DreamWorks Animation.[4][5]
The original company was founded followingJeffrey Katzenberg's resignation fromThe Walt Disney Companyin 1994. Katzenberg approachedSteven SpielbergandDavid Geffenabout forming a live-action and animation film studio, which had not been done in decades due to the risk and expense, but all three were very successful. They agreed on three conditions: They would make fewer than nine movies a year, they would be free to work for other studios if they chose, and they would go home in time for dinner. They officially founded DreamWorks SKG on October 12, 1994, with financial backing of $33 million from each of the three partners[6]plus $500 million fromMicrosoftco-founderPaul Allen, and $300 million fromCJ GroupheiressMiky Lee, giving the CJ Group an 11% stake in DreamWorks; the deal was also initially understood to include distribution rights to DreamWorks films across Asia excluding Japan, although CJ ultimately handled rights for only China, South Korea and Hong Kong, with all other international territories handled byUnited International Pictures.[7][8][9]Their new studio was based at offices on theUniversal Studios lot, in the same bungalow asAmblin Entertainment. Despite access tosound stagesandsets, DreamWorks preferred to film motion pictureson location. Usually, however, the company would film in a soundstage or set in amajor studio.
In December 1994,DreamWorks Televisionwas formed after DreamWorks agreed to a $200 million seven-year television production joint venture withCapital Cities/ABC.[10]The company was set up to produce series for broadcast networks, cable channels and first run syndication, with nofirst-lookguarantee forABC, but financial incentives favored the network.[11]Their first show,Champions, was scheduled as a mid-season replacement for ABC. Dan McDermott was named the division's chief executive in June 1995.[12]DreamWorks Television's first success wasSpin Cityon ABC,[11]the parent company of which was bought byThe Walt Disney Companyin February 1996.[13]In 2002, the DreamWorks joint venture agreement with ABC ended. That agreement was replaced by a development agreement withNBC, with a first look clause.[11]In 2013, DreamWorks Television merged withAmblin Television.
In 1995,traditional animationartists fromAmblimationjoined the new studio, which led to DreamWorks buying part ofPacific Data Images, a company specializing in visual effects, and renaming it PDI/DreamWorks in 2000. Both were software divisions and would merge later on. By then, DreamWorks had the traditional animators working for their animation department, and the computer animators worked on CG films.Amblimationwould be shut down in 1997, leading the staff to joinDreamWorks Animation.[citation needed]The same year, DreamWorks Interactive, a computer and video game developer andjoint venturebetween DreamWorks andMicrosoft, was founded. On February 24, 2000,Electronic Artsannounced the acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive and merged it withEA PacificandWestwood Studiosto formEA Los Angeles, laterDanger Close Games.[citation needed]
In June 1995, DreamWorks announced that it had signed a $1 billion deal withMCA Inc.(then parent company ofUniversal Pictures) to distribute its theatrical releases in other countries and its home video releases worldwide over 10 years, while DreamWorks itself would distribute them for the company as a film production label in America.[14][15]MCA also bought a 2% stake in the company for $54 million.[16]
In 1996, the company's record label,DreamWorks Records, was founded, the first project of which wasGeorge Michael's albumOlder. The first band signed to the label waseels, who released their debut albumBeautiful Freakthat year. The record company never lived up to expectations, though, and was sold in October 2003 toUniversal Music Group, which operated the label asDreamWorks Nashville. That label was shut down in 2005 when its flagship artist,Toby Keith, departed to form his own label.[17]
In 1997, DreamWorks Pictures released its first three feature films,The Peacemaker, a film about terrorism;Amistad, Spielberg's first film for the studio about an African slave rebellion and the aftermath of the massacre; andMouse Hunt, the studio's first family film about two brothers trying to fight a mischievous mouse.[citation needed]
In 1998, theUnited States 9th Circuit Court of Appealsupheld a lawsuit against DreamWorks for trademark infringement by Dreamwerks Production Group, Inc.,[18]a company mostly specializing inStar Trekconventions.[19]The same year, DreamWorks Animation produced its first full-length animated features,AntzandThe Prince of Egypt, which were distributed by DreamWorks Pictures. DreamWorks Pictures continued to distribute DreamWorks Animation productions through their distribution name until 2004.
In 2000, DreamWorks was planning on building a studiobacklotafter buying 1,087 acres of land in thePlaya Vistaarea in Los Angeles. It was to be complete with 18sound stages, with many office buildings and a lake. There would also be new homes, schools, churches, and museums. The project was to be completed in 2001, but was cancelled for financial reasons.[20]Starting in 1999, DreamWorks won three consecutiveAcademy AwardsforBest PictureforAmerican Beauty,GladiatorandA Beautiful Mind(the latter two were co-productions with Universal Pictures). DreamWorks became the first new majorHollywoodmotion picture studio sinceRKO Pictureswas founded in 1928.Go Fish Pictures, a division of DreamWorks with the objective to distributeart-house,independentandforeignfilms, was founded in 2000. The division experienced success with theanimefilmsMillennium Actress(2003) andGhost in the Shell 2: Innocence(2004), respectively, which led them to venture into releasing live-action films, with the release ofThe Chumscrubber. However,The Chumscrubberwas a commercial and critical failure, which led DreamWorks to shut down the division in 2007 shortly after the release of the Japanese filmCasshern.[citation needed]In 2002, DreamWorks signed a deal with In Demand.[21]
For the period beginning October 1, 2004, to January 31, 2006, DreamWorks Pictures distributed its films in the North American domestic theatrical and worldwide television market, with international theatrical and worldwide home entertainment distribution by Universal Pictures.[22]On October 27, 2004, DreamWorks Animation was spun off into a separate public company.
David Geffen admitted that DreamWorks came close to bankruptcy twice. Under Katzenberg's watch, the studio suffered a $125 million loss onSinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas,[23]and also overestimated the DVD demand forShrek 2.[24]In 2005, out of their two large budget pictures,War of the Worldswas produced as a joint effort withParamount Pictureswhich was the first to reap a significant amount of profits, whileThe Islandbombed at the domestic box office but turned a profit internationally throughWarner Bros. Pictures.[23]
In December 2005, theoriginal Viacom, the then-parent of Paramount Pictures, agreed to purchase the live-action studio, still keeping the original name and producing/distribution name. The deal was valued at approximately $1.6 billion, an amount that included about $400 million in debt assumptions.[25]The acquisition of the live-action DreamWorks studio was completed by thesecond iteration of Viacom, which had recentlysplitfrom the original at the end of 2005, on February 1, 2006.[26]
On March 17, 2006, Viacom agreed to sell a controlling interest in the DreamWorks Pictures live-action library toSoros Strategic PartnersandDune EntertainmentII.[27]The film library was valued at $900 million. Paramount Pictures retained the worldwide distribution rights to those films, as well as various ancillary rights, including music publishing (the music publishing rights were later licensed toSony/ATV Music Publishingwhen the company acquired Viacom'sFamous Musicsubdivision), sequels and merchandising. The sale was completed on May 8, 2006.[28]On February 8, 2010, Viacom repurchased Soros' controlling stake in the DreamWorks Pictures library for around $400 million.[29]
In June 2008, it was reported that DreamWorks was looking for financing that would allow it to continue operations, but as an independent production company, once its deal with Paramount ended later that year.[30]Several public equity funds were approached for financing, includingBlackstone Group, Fuse Global,TPG Capitaland several others, but all passed on the deal given their understanding of the Hollywood markets. On September 22, 2008, it was announced that DreamWorks closed a deal with Indian investment firmReliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Groupto create a $1.2 billion stand-alone production company and end its ties with Paramount.[2]In January 2009, Spielberg entered a licensing agreement with DreamWorks Animation to use the DreamWorks trademarks, logo, and name for film productions and releases.[31]
On February 9, 2009, DreamWorks Pictures entered into a long-term, 30-picture distribution deal withWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, by which DreamWorks' films would be released through theTouchstone Picturesbanner, with Disney collecting a 10 percent distribution fee.[32]The deal also included co-funding via a $175 million loan byWalt Disney Studiosto DreamWorks for production and access to slots in Disney's pay television agreement, then withStarz.[32]The agreement was reported to have come after negotiations broke off with Universal Pictures just days earlier.[33]DreamWorks raised $325 million from Reliance Entertainment and an additional $325 million in debt in 2009.[1]On August 18, 2009, DreamWorks and Reliance signed a three-year, $825 million pact for up to six films a year.[34]
DreamWorks' slate of films in 2011,I Am Number Four,Cowboys & Aliens, andFright Nightfailed, whileThe Help,Real Steeland Spielberg'sWar Horsehad success at the box office. This left DreamWorks so financially drained that by 2011, DreamWorks was seeking additional funding from Reliance. Reliance gave a $200 million investment on April 10, 2012. Under the deal, DreamWorks Pictures scaled back production to three films per year and sought co-financiers on big budget films, such as20th Century Fox, who co-financed and handled international distribution forLincolnandBridge of Spies. DreamWorks continued to have Disney distribute and market their films.[1]On August 29, 2012, after re-negotiating their agreement with Disney, DreamWorks formed a deal withMister Smith Entertainmentto distribute its films internationally, while Disney would continue to distribute in North America, Latin America, Australia, Russia, and some territories in Asia.[35]
On September 2, 2015, it was reported that DreamWorks and Disney would not renew their distribution deal, which was set to expire in August 2016,[36][37]withThe Light Between Oceansbeing released in September as the final DreamWorks film distributed by Disney under their original distribution agreement.[38]During that time, DreamWorks was in early negotiations with Universal Pictures to distribute its upcoming films.[36][37]The contract allowing Spielberg to license the DreamWorks name and logo from Jeffrey Katzenberg's DreamWorks Animation was set to expire on January 1, 2016, leading to media speculation that Spielberg would not renew the pact.[31]Disney retained the film rights to the fourteen DreamWorks films it released,[39]as well as acquiring the "DreamWorks II Distribution Co. LLC" copyright from DreamWorks and Reliance on December 11, 2015.[40][41]
On December 16, 2015, Spielberg, Reliance,Entertainment OneandParticipant Mediapartnered to launch the content production companyAmblin Partners,[42]relegating DreamWorks to a brand for adult-themed films produced under the new company.[42][43]In addition to DreamWorks, the new company also would produce films under the Amblin Entertainment and Participant banners. On the same day, Amblin Partners announced a five-year distribution deal with Universal, under which the company's films would be distributed and marketed by either the main Universal label or its specialty label,Focus Features.[44][45]The Girl on the Trainwas the first film released under the new agreement,[39]though a few films, likeGhost in the ShellandThe Postwere released by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox respectively.
The original DreamWorks logo features a boy sitting on acrescent moonwith a fishing rod at night. The general idea for the logo was the idea of the company's founder,Steven Spielberg, who wanted aCGIimage. IllustratorRobert Huntwas commissioned to execute the idea as a painting, and he used his son as the model.[46]The logo was then turned into amotion graphicatIndustrial Light & Magic, in collaboration with Kaleidoscope Films, Dave Carson and Clint Goldman.[47]It was animated by ILM animation supervisorWes Takahashi.[48][49]Music accompanying the logo to start in many live-action DreamWorks films was specially composed byJohn Williams.

The logo was composed byHarry Gregson-Williamsand made its debut in 2004, with the release ofShrek 2, a film which Gregson-Williams also composed.

You know, it was a moment that I'll always remember. Hosting is just a tough gig. Yes, I'm a stand-up comic but that hosting position it's a different style. I kind of went in and did the writer's thing. We had 10 days to write this monologue. It was a crash course. I feel bad, but I got to still say I loved what I did."[26]Fellow comedians such asSteve Martin,Whoopi GoldbergandKevin Hart, as well as radio hostHoward Stern, expressed sympathy towards Koy, with many of them arguing that the job of a comedian is not always easy, especially when hosting an awards show.[27][28][29]A week later at the29th Critics' Choice Awards, Koy's ex-girlfriend and fellow comedianChelsea Handlermade a joke about his performance by praising her writers for a joke received well by the audience.[citation needed]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
