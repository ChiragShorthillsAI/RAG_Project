Emancipationis a 2022 Americanhistoricalaction thrillerfilm[3][4][5]directed byAntoine Fuqua, written by William N. Collage, and co-produced byWill Smith, who stars as arunaway slaveheaded forBaton Rouge, Louisianain the 1860s, after PresidentAbraham Lincolnissued theEmancipation Proclamationto end slavery in secessionistConfederatestates,[6]surviving the swamps while being chased byslave catchersand their dogs.Ben Fosterstars as a ruthless slave hunter andCharmaine Bingwaas an enslaved wife and mother.
The film is loosely based on the life of aself-emancipatedslave, known as eitherGordon or "Whipped Peter".[7]That story was made famous by the photograph of a man's bare back heavilyscourgedfrom anoverseer'swhippings, which was published worldwide as magazine illustrations in 1863, and gave theabolitionist movementproof of the cruelty of slavery.[8]ProducerJoey McFarlandbegan researching that story in 2018, and hired Collage to write the script.
The film was officially announced in June 2020, with Fuqua to direct and Smith to star. Filming was in Louisiana between July and August 2021, withApplepayingUS$130 millionto acquire the rights to the film, outbidding several other studios.
It was screened inWashington, D.C., on October 1, 2022, and released inselect cinemason December 2, 2022, then streamed on December 9 onApple TV+. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Smith's performance, but criticized the screenplay and its handling of real-life events.
In a cotton plantation in 1863, Peter is seen sitting on the floor of a house knelt before his wife, Dodienne, alongside their children sitting around him. Suddenly, a group of white men appear at the doorway and snatch a reluctant Peter out of the house, with him putting up a fight until one of the men points a gun at his wife’s head. Peter is then hit in the back of his head, put into a cage at the back of a carriage, and is taken away from his family to a different site. He shouts to his wife and children that he will come back and they should stay together. On his journey, he sees slaves working at the roadside and the heads of killed slaves on poles. Peter is then sent to work on constructing a railroad inClinton, Louisiana.
The slaves are treated with cruelty by white guards and their boss, Fassel. They are whipped, set upon by dogs, branded and dragged by horses if they try to run away or shot if they stop working because of exhaustion. Peter tells the disheartened slaves to just believe in God and pray.
One day, Peter has had enough, and he uses an opportune moment to fight back at the white men along with other slaves. They escape and run away, while being chased by the white men on horseback and vicious dogs. One slave is unable to swim across a river due to fear ofalligatorsand is caught. After revealing the other slaves’ plans, he is ordered to cross the river. Fassel shoots him and he is eaten by the gators. The three remaining men split up and go about their separate ways. Peter has many close encounters with being found, but somehow manages to stay hidden from his enslavers. When Peter is close toBaton Rouge, Fassel catches up to him and is about to shoot him, when he is suddenly shot in the neck by a black member of the1st Louisiana Native Guard.
Peter is taken to a hospital to recover.A photograph of his back is then takenand is vowed to be shown all over the world to aid the end of slavery. Peter then decides to join the army to help free his family. After a victorious battle againstConfederatesoldiers, he returns to various cotton plantations to free the slaves, while also reuniting with Dodienne and their children. In the epilogue, the text states that it is thanks toLincoln'sEmancipation Proclamationthat by 1865, over 4 million slaves have been freed.
On June 15, 2020, it was reported thatAntoine Fuquawould directWill SmithinEmancipation, based on aspec scriptwritten by William N. Collage.[9]ProducerJoey McFarland, who had started researching and developing the film in 2018, recruited Collage to write the script.[10]Fuqua said:
It's almost two years now from when I first read the script. It hit my heart and my soul in so many ways that are impossible to convey but I think you understand. We're watching some of the feeling that I had, in the streets right now. There's sadness, there's anger, there's love, faith and hope ... That's important to see, and the most hopeful thing that I'm seeing, that they're not going to stand for it anymore.[9]
Warner Bros,MGM,Lionsgate, andUniversal Picturesbid on the film beforeAppleultimately won distribution rights for over$130 million.[8][11][12]In August 2021,Ben Foster,Charmaine Bingwa, Gilbert Owuor, andMustafa Shakirjoined the cast.[13]Smith was paid $35 million for his involvement.[14]
Principal photographywas expected to begin on May 3, 2021, inLos Angeles.[15]It was later set to begin on June 21, 2021, inGeorgia,[16]but on April 12, it was announced that the film would be shot elsewhere due to the recently-enactedElection Integrity Act of 2021. Smith and Fuqua said in a joint statement: "We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access."[16][17]The location move was reported to have cost approximately$15 million.[16]Filming was announced to take place inNew Orleansfrom July 12 to August 21, 2021.[18]On August 2, filming paused for five days due to several positiveCOVID-19tests.[19]Additional casting for the film was announced in November and December.[20][21]
The film score is byMarcelo Zarvos, who described the music as "spiritual and untraditional" per Fuqua's suggestions.[22]He employed a 70-piece orchestra, a 40-member choir, and soloists from around the world, for traditional American and African sounds. The soundtrack was released by Lakeshore Records on December 9, 2022.[23]
A screening ofEmancipationwas held at theCongressional Black Caucus Foundation's 51st Annual Legislative Conference inWashington, D.C., on October 1, 2022, with Smith and Fuqua in attendance to give a subsequent Q&A discussion.[24]It was screened inLos Angeles, on October 24, 2022.[25]The film premiered in theaters on December 2, 2022, and was streamed on Apple TV+ on December 9.[26]
While Smith had been attached to the film in 2020,[9]and principal photography had moved forward in the summer of 2021,[18]thecontroversy over Smith slappingChris Rockat the March 202294th Academy Awardswas cited in May 2022, when the film's release was delayed to a tentative 2023 date; production delays and an overcrowded film release schedule from Apple were also cited in the May announcement.[27]It was subsequently moved to its final date.
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 45% of 155 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "Emancipationworks as an action movie – albeit one that's uncomfortably at odds with its awkward handling of the real-life events that inspired its stirring story."[28]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 53 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[29]
Theslapping incidentwas referenced in some reviews;[7]in a positive first-day review fromScreen International's Tim Grierson, before the collective mixed to average reviews had been published, he hoped that enough positive reviews might overcome the possibility that the "scandal may temper audiences' enthusiasm" to see the film.[30]

Apple TV+is an Americansubscriptionover-the-topstreaming serviceowned byApple. The service launched on November 1, 2019, and it offers a selection of original production film and television series calledApple Originals.[9]The service was announced during theApple Special Event of March 2019,[10][11]where entertainers from Apple TV+ projects appeared onstage, includingJennifer Aniston,Oprah Winfrey, andSteven Spielberg.[12][13]The service can be accessed through Apple's website and through theApple TV app, which has gradually become available on manyApple devicesand some major competingdigital media players,[14]including somesmart TVmodels and video-game consoles.
Apple plans to expand the services' availability,[15][16][17][18]and there are workarounds for subscribers whose device is not presently supported.[14]Access is included as part of theApple Onesubscription.[19]Most of the content is available inDolby Visionprofile 5 andDolby Atmos. Upon its debut, Apple TV+ was available in about 100 countries, fewer than the reported target of 150.[20][21]Several countries were excluded from service despite other Apple products being available.[22][23][24]Commentators noted that the fairly wide initial reach of the service offered Apple an advantage over other recently launched services such asDisney+, and that because Apple distributes its own content through the service instead of distributing licensed third-party content (as, for example,Huludoes) it will not be limited by licensing issues during its expansion.[25][26][27]
By early 2020, Apple TV+ had poor growth and low subscriber numbers relative to competing services.[28][29][30][31]In the middle of that year, Apple began to license older television programs and films, attempting to stay competitive with other services, attract and retain a viewership for its original content, and convert into subscribers users who were trialing the service.[29][28]Since then, the service has become the home to critically acclaimed content: between September 2021 and March 2022, Apple TV+ netted aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy SerieswithTed Lassoand theAcademy Award for Best PicturewithCODA, the first Best Picture win for a film distributed by a streaming service.[32]Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston have all signed a multi year look deal with Apple TV+ to develop more television projects under their production companies after their critically acclaimed shows. Apple TV+ (along with the simultaneously announceda-la-cartepremium-videosubscription aggregation serviceApple TV app) is part of a concerted effort by Apple to expand its service revenues.[16][33][34]The service's programming arm isApple Studios.
Apple had long been rumored to have an interest in beginning astreaming televisionservice, and in 2015 entered into negotiations with varioustelevision studiosand programmers to aggregate their content for a live-television streaming bundle.[35][36]Negotiations fell apart over differing views on how to value the content, lack of transparency on details, and the personality of Apple's chief negotiator,Eddy Cue.[35]
In October 2016, Apple CEOTim Cooksaid that television is "of intense interest to me and other people here", and added that Apple has "started focusing on some original content", which he called "a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it's an area we're focused on."[37]
In June 2017, Apple began to take the first major steps to form its new television unit by hiring the co-presidents ofSony Pictures Television, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to oversee all aspects of worldwide video programming.[36][2]In August, Matt Cherniss was hired as Head of Domestic Creative Development, reporting directly to Van Amburg and Erlicht.[3]For the rest of 2017, Apple continued to fill out its executive team for Apple TV+, with Kim Rozenfeld joining as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted,Jay Huntjoining as Creative Director for Europe,Morgan Wandelljoining as Head of International Creative Development, Tara Sorensen joining as Head of Kids Programming, and Max Aronson, Ali Woodruff, Carina Walker, and Michelle Lee joining as development and creative executives.[38][39][4][6][40]
Throughout 2019, Apple continued to build out its unscripted content team, with Molly Thompson hired as Head of Documentaries in April.[5]In November, Rozenfeld stepped down as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted to focus on producing content again with a first-look content production deal with Apple under his Half Full Productions. Cherniss took over Rozenfeld's duties overseeing current scripted programming.[41]
In May 2018, it was reported that Apple was expected to start a sister project to its original content service, and begin selling subscriptions to certain video services directly via itsApple TV appapplication oniOSandtvOS, rather than asking Apple device owners to subscribe to those services through applications individually downloaded from Apple's app store.[42]
In October 2018, it was reported that Apple would distribute its future original content through a still-in-development digital video service within its TV application that is pre-installed in all iOS and tvOS devices. The service was expected to feature both original content, free to owners of Apple devices, as well as subscription "channels" from legacy media companies such asHBOandStarz, which would allow customers to sign up for online-only services.[43]Later that month, it was reported that Apple intended to roll out the service in the U.S. during the first half of 2019 and that it would expand its availability to around 100 countries in the months after its launch.[44]
On March 25, 2019, Apple held a press event to announce Apple TV+. At the event, Apple showed a teaser of its upcoming original content and formally announced some of it, with actors and producers attached to the content appearing on stage. The announced content includedHelpsters, the first series fromSesame Workshop, the producer ofSesame Street, and Oprah Winfrey's first projects for Apple TV+, including a documentary under the working titleToxic Labor[45]about workplace sexual harassment, a documentary series about mental health, and a revival ofOprah's Book Clubas a standalone television series.[46][47]
On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would launch on November 1 at $4.99 per month (with a 1-week free trial) for an account that can be shared with up to six family members. Apple also announced that it would be give away a year of Apple TV+ to anyone who bought a newApple TV,Mac,iPad,iPhone, oriPod Touchbeginning that day.[48]Student subscribers to the monthlyApple Musicservice at a discounted rate also have Apple TV+ bundled in at no additional cost for the time being.[49]
From the start of Apple TV+ on November 1, 2019, Apple offered a free one-year subscription to anyone buying certain of its hardware products (an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod Touch, or Mac).[50]Apple initially extended the free year that was due to end on November 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021,[51]but then announced in mid-January 2021 that it would extend it a second time to July 31, 2021.[52]
In mid-June 2021, Apple added a note to its website advising customers that new users subscribing after June 30, 2021, would receive only three months of free subscription instead of a year.[53]
On October 24, 2022, Apple announced it was to increase pricing of Apple TV+ (along withApple MusicandApple One) subscriptions in many regions. The monthly plan increased $2 to $6.99, and the annual plan increased $20 to $69.[54]
During the announcement of Apple TV+, Apple announced a number of prominent writers, directors, and stars who would be featured in the service. The signing of high-profile talent was intended to attract viewers to the service.[55]
As of March 2019[update], five of the upcoming series had completed production, with six more well into filming.[56]On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would have eight original series (seven scripted and one unscripted) and one original documentary available at launch, with plans to launch new original content every month thereafter. Most series were expected to launch with three episodes, with a new episode released weekly thereafter, although Apple said that not all series would follow that model and that some series might instead launch all at once.[57]
Early critical reaction to the bulk of the service's programming was mixed to poor, but commentators predicted that Apple would have time to grow into its new role as a content provider and to produce well-regarded content, especially as the free year of the service provided with many Apple product purchases enticed users to continue watching, and for some to eventually pay for a subscription, as new series are released.[58][59][15]
On March 13, 2020, Apple suspended all active filming on Apple TV+ shows due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, and all production on series was postponed for an indeterminate period.[60]
Apple's decision in mid-2020 to license large swaths of existing older content for the Apple TV+ service was viewed, in part, as buying time for its original content production during the pandemic by keeping users engaged and in a habit of visiting the service regularly, so that a viewer base would be in place by the time new Apple original content was released.[29][28]
In addition, Apple TV+ endeavored to gain new high-profile content, taking advantage of the pandemic's disruption of theatrical film releases. Among these acquisitions were the 2020 feature filmGreyhoundstarringTom Hanks, which was purchased fromSony Picturesfor $70 million.[61]In July 2020, the service won a heated bidding war forEmancipation, a slavery-based action-thriller starringWill Smithand directed byAntoine Fuqua.[62]Apple paid a record $105 million for the rights.[62]Apple also reportedly considered a $350 to $400 million offer for the rights to stream theJames BondfilmNo Time to Die, which was far short of the $650 to $800 million studioMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(owned byAmazon, which is one of theBig Techcompanies alongside Apple) was willing to accept.[63]

In June 2018, Apple signed theWriters Guild of America's minimum basic agreement andOprah Winfreyto a multi-year content partnership.[67][68]The same month, Apple announced that it had given a multi-series order toSesame Workshopto produce variouslive-actionand animated series as well as a single puppet-based series.[69]
In September 2018, it was reported that Apple had decided to shelveVital Signs, a six-episode biopic television series centering on the life of hip-hop producer and performerDr. Dreand starringIan McShane,Sam Rockwell, andMichael K. Williams, due to concerns about the show's content being too graphic, with moments cited including characters usingcocaine, instances ofgun violence, and an explicitorgyscene. Reports further indicated that Apple CEO Tim Cook was taking a hands-on approach to the company's Worldwide Video Unit, with programming decisions reportedly being aligned to Cook's personal taste, with a preference for family-friendly shows. Various programs in different stages of production apparently had their content altered, including the toning down ofThe Morning Showand the removal of crucifixes from a scene in theM. Night Shyamalandrama series. Additionally, Apple reportedly passed on a television series from comedianWhitney Cummingsabout the #MeToo movement because it was "too sensitive a topic".[70][71][72]Cummings's series was ultimately put into development byAmazon Prime Videoin October 2018.[73]
In November 2018, Apple entered into a multi-year agreement with entertainment companyA24to produce a slate of original films in partnership with its Worldwide Video Unit.[74]The same month, Apple signed a deal with DHX Media (nowWildBrain) and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide to develop and produce original programs, including new series, specials, and shorts based on thePeanutscharacters.

Apple TV+ released its first movie in theaters,Killers of the Flower Moon. Apple has said that its primary goal in releasing the film is to attract more subscribers, not to do well at the box office, but it brought in $145 million.[118]Apple TV+ also released another movie,Napoleon. Apple is seemingly pleased with its box-office returns, which reached $221 million and nearly made back its budget. It is apparent that Apple is attempting to compete with movie production companies.[119][120][121]
In March 2022, Apple announced that it would airFriday Night Baseball, a weekly doubleheader ofMajor League Baseball(MLB) games with live pre- and postgame shows on Apple TV+ in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom starting in the2022 Major League Baseball season.[122]

Apple TV+ subscribers can watch select games at no additional charge, and receive a discount on the MLS Season Pass.[126][127]
In mid-2020, Apple began discussions with film and television studios to license their previously released content as part of an effort to build a back catalog of non-original films and television shows for the streaming service.[30][29]The shift was designed to help the service better compete against the large content libraries competitors likeNetflixhave.[30]This represented a pivot for Apple, which had initially attempted to build the service entirely on original content, avoiding licensing fees to help keep monthly subscription fees low, and relying on its Apple TV Channels content partners to supply other content users wanted.[30][29]
Analysts believed that the addition of older, highly re-watchable content like popular sitcoms and well-liked films would help retain the slowly growing subscriber base while Apple continues to develop original content.[28]The shift was also an acknowledgement of poor growth, especially relative to competing services.[28]The back catalog development was also seen as a move to attempt to persuade free trial users to transition into paid users as the first wave of one-year trials was scheduled to expire in November 2020.[29]
On May 26, 2020, Apple announced its first acquisition of catalogue content would be theFraggle Rockseries.[128]In addition to being the exclusive home of the 1983–1987Jim Henson Companyseries, Apple would develop a new, full-length, rebootedFraggle Rockseries after the success of theFraggle Rock: Rock On!short-form series on Apple TV+.[129]On October 19, 2020, Apple announced the exclusive transmission rights of the various animated productions of thePeanutsfranchise, withdrawing them from broadcast television after 55 years; as part of that agreement, Apple TV+ must make the majorPeanutsspecials available for free in short windows.[130]After an outcry from fans of the specials, Apple sublicensedA Charlie Brown ThanksgivingandA Charlie Brown ChristmastoPBSfor commercial-free airing.[131]In 2021,It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brownalso came to the PBS rotation. The PBS sublicensing arrangement ended before October 2022.[132]
In March 2024, Apple made 51 catalog films available under a "Great Movies special collection" banner.[133]
Apple has announced a number of partnerships, bundles, and initiatives to increase subscriber growth in the service.[when?]

Linked page for 'Antoine Fuqua' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Fuqua):
Antoine Fuqua(/ˈæntwɒnˈfjuːkwə/; born May 30, 1965)[1][2]is an American film director known for his work in the action and thriller genres. He was originally known as a director of music videos, and made his film debut in 1998 withThe Replacement Killers. His critical breakthrough was the 2001 crime thrillerTraining Day, winning theBlack Reel Award for Outstanding Director.
His subsequent films includeTears of the Sun(2003),King Arthur(2004),Shooter(2007),Olympus Has Fallen(2013),Southpaw(2015),The Magnificent Seven(2016) andThe Equalizertrilogy(2014–2023), earning with the first one theNAACP Image Award for Outstanding Directing in a Motion Picture.
He also directed the critically acclaimed documentariesAmerican Dream/American Knightmare(2018),What's My Name: Muhammad Ali(2019), and the 2022Huludocumentary seriesLegacy: The True Story of the LA Lakers, for which he won theSports Emmy Awards for Outstanding Documentary Series.[3]
Fuqua was born inPittsburghtoAfrican-Americanparents Carlos and Mary Fuqua. He graduated fromTaylor Allderdice High Schoolin 1983.[4]Before turning to filmmaking and music videos, Fuqua studied electrical engineering, with the hope of going on to fly jets in the military.[5]
Fuqua pays tribute to screenwriterShinobu Hashimoto, a frequent collaborator ofAkira Kurosawa's, saying his writing "affected a boy from Pittsburgh living in the ghetto."
[Shinobu Hashimoto's writing] was so beautiful and poetic and powerful and heartbreaking. It was all about justice, it was all about sacrifice, and it made me want to be one of those guys. I came from a rough area, and I had my own version of watching poor people getting pushed down – whoever the person was who had the power, they would come in and take from other people.[6]
Fuqua explained how his experience of violence shaped his adolescence, and played a role in his eventual choice of career.
My first big break was when I got shot when I was fifteen. It changed my life and it made me not hang out in the streets as much, and go to the movies more. Those sort of things are wake up calls to have a better appreciation for life, and a better appreciation for the people around you. From that moment in my life I put all my energy into what I believed in, and at that time it was playing basketball and sports. That led me to a scholarship ... after that a professor said that I should take an art class ... I fell in love with an artist by the name ofCaravaggio.[7]
Fuqua began his career directing music videos for popular artists such asToni Braxton,Stevie Wonder, andPrince. He directedMichelle Pfeifferin the videoGangsta's ParadisebyCooliowhich was used to promoteJerry Bruckheimer'ssuccessful filmDangerous Minds.
The movie became a big hit and Jerry Bruckheimer was kind enough to give me a lot of credit for it because they used my music video ... the irony was people thought I was the new French film director. No one had any idea I was this guy from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. So I used to walk in the room and people would literally ask me to get coffee. And I would say, "No, no, I'm the director", and I loved watching their faces. That was fun.[7]
From 1998 onwards, Fuqua began working primarily as a feature film director. In a tribute article forTimemagazine, Fuqua expressed his early respect for Kurosawa as a filmmaker and how Kurosawa influenced his own perspective on filmmaking stating: "[screen writer Hashimoto's] ... working withAkira KurosawaandHideo Oguni, was so beautiful and poetic and powerful and heartbreaking. It was all about justice, it was all about sacrifice, and it made me want to be one of those guys".[6]
His first feature films were theJohn Woo-produced action filmThe Replacement Killers(1998), starringChow Yun Fatand the action comedyBait(2000) starringJamie Foxx. He then directed the crime thrillerTraining Day(2001), for which starDenzel Washingtonwon anAcademy Award for Best Actor. His next films were the action war dramaTears of the Sun(2003), the Arthurian legend filmKing Arthur(2004), the conspiracy action thrillerShooter(2007), the crime filmBrooklyn's Finest(2009), and the action thrillersOlympus Has Fallen(2013) andThe Equalizer(2014), the latter of which again pairs Fuqua with Denzel Washington. In 2011, he directed CIA proceduralFoxpilotExit StrategystarringEthan Hawke.[8][9]
He co-created the comic-book miniseriesAfter DarkwithWesley Snipes, which was written byPeter Milliganand illustrated by Jeff Nentrup.[10]He was slated to directTupac Shakur's official biopic[11]but the project was postponed to allow Fuqua to direct rapperEminem's second feature film,Southpaw(2015).[12]Eminem later leftSouthpawto focus on his music,[13]and was replaced withJake Gyllenhaal.[14]
Fuqua's 2016 film,The Magnificent Seven,was a remake of the classic 1960 Westernof the same namewhich itself was an American remake of Kurosawa's 1954 film,Seven Samurai. Denzel Washington plays the lead role of Sam Chisolm.[15]
In early 2018, Fuqua worked as one of the executive producers on theFoxmedical drama seriesThe Resident. In the summer of 2018, his thriller sequelThe Equalizer 2(2018) was released with Denzel Washington returning in the main role. In June 2021, Fuqua's sci-fi filmInfinite, starringMark WahlbergandChiwetel Ejioforwas released.
In 2021, Fuqua and actorWill Smithannounced that their upcoming film,Emancipation, would not be filmed inGeorgiabecause of the recent passage of Georgia'snew voting law. Smith and Fuqua released a joint statement: "We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access".[16]
On December 3, 2021, he signed a first look deal withNetflixand renamed his production company from Fuqua Films to Hill District Media.[17]He later signed an overall television deal withParamount Television StudiosandMTV Entertainment Studios.[18]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
