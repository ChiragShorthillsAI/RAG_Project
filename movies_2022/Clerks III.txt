Clerks IIIis a 2022 Americanblackcomedy-drama filmwritten, directed, and edited byKevin Smithand starringBrian O'Halloran,Jeff Anderson,Trevor Fehrman,Austin Zajur,Jason Mewes,Rosario Dawsonand Smith. It serves as asequelto the1994and2006Clerksfilms, and is the ninth overall feature film set in theView Askewniverse.  In the film,Randal Graves, after surviving a massiveheart attack, enlists his friends and fellow clerksDante Hicks,Elias Grover, andJay and Silent Bobto make a movie about their lives at the Quick Stop Convenience store that started it all.
The film had its world premiere on September 4, 2022, inRed Bank, New Jersey, before its release on September 13, byLionsgate. With a production cost of $7 million,[1]not including additional marketing costs, the filmunderperformed, making a total of $4.7 million at the box office.[2]
Fifteen years after Dante and Randal bought the Quick Stopconvenience store,[a]the pair's lives continue much as before, including hockey games on the roof and hanging out with Jay and Silent Bob, who have taken over the former RST Video and turned it into a legalmarijuana dispensary. Dante is still grieving over the deaths of Becky and their unborn daughter Grace after they were hit by a drunk driver years prior.[b]
One day, while Elias and his friend Blockchain are trying to sell their newNFTkites, which contain an image of theBuddy Christ, Randal suffers a severeheart attack. Elias disavowsChristianityand decides to become aSatanistafter blaming his faith for Randal's heart attack. After the surgery, Randal's doctor urges Dante to keep Randal happy while he recovers and warns him that he is also at risk. Randal decides he has wasted his life and needs a new purpose, declaring he will make a movie about his and Dante's lives at the Quick Stop.
Becky'sspiritappears to Dante, encouraging him to move on, and Dante briefly reconnects with his ex-girlfriend, Veronica. After a harrowing audition process, Randal decides he will not only write and direct but also star in the film as himself, alongside Dante in a supporting role. Rather than cast actors, they decide to cast their friends and actual customers to play themselves. This includes Jay, Silent Bob, and Veronica, who agrees after a sexual encounter with Dante. Dante takes on theproducerrole and convinces his ex-fiancée Emma to loan the production $30,000, with Dante's half of the Quick Stop as collateral. Silent Bob is made the cinematographer, deciding to shoot the movie in black-and-white, while Elias and Blockchain are hired asproduction assistants.
As the shoot for the tentatively-titledInconveniencecontinues, Dante grows exasperated with Randal's micromanagement, and is especially hurt by the fact that he is only a minor character in the script. After Randal tries to recreate thedonkey showthat took place at Mooby's, Dante has apanic attackand leaves the set because the location reminds him of Becky. Later, adrunkDante finally confronts Randal for never respecting him or acknowledging his support over the years, and for forcing him to relive the loss of his wife and child. Suddenly, he collapses, suffering a heart attack as well.
When Randal decides to leave Dante at the hospital to continue work on the movie, Elias lambastes him for his selfishness and reveals Dante's deal with Emma. Consumed with guilt, Randal finishes editing the movie and sneaks back into the hospital with Jay and Silent Bob's help. He shows Dante the finished film, which he has re-edited so that Dante is the main character, declaring that the story was always about him. Dante watches the film with the spirit of Becky, touched by his friend's effort, before he peacefully dies.
Sometime after Dante's funeral, Emma arrives at the Quick Stop to collect the $30,000 she loaned Dante, lest she assume his half of ownership of the store. Blockchain arrives and excitedly reveals that the NFT kites sold out immediately, yielding a profit of a million dollars. Elias, who has become Randal's best friend in Dante's place, pays Emma back. As Blockchain, Jay, and Silent Bob go outside to fly one of the NFT kites, Randal mourns Dante and is unknowingly joined by his spirit.
During the credits, directorKevin Smiththanks the audience for watching the movie before reading some narration he cut from the final scene, where it is revealed that Randal continued to make movies until the age of 90, while still working at the Quick Stop.

Other View Askew alumni cameos include John Willyung reprising his role as Cohee Lundin fromChasing Amy, as well asScott MosierandEthan Supleeeach reprising their role of Willam Black fromClerksandMallrats. Smith's mother Grace, who played the Milk Maid in previousClerksfilms, appears as an auditioner who is offended by the screenplay and declares the screenwriter's mother should be ashamed of them.Jake Richardsonalso appears as an auditioner, having previously played one of Jay and Silent Bob's customers alongside Suplee inClerks II.
During press forClerks II,Kevin Smithbriefly discussed the possibility of aClerks III. Stating that "if there's ever gonna be aClerks III, it would be somewhere down the road in my 40s or 50s, when it might be interesting to check back in on Dante and Randal. But I don't know about Jay and Bob so much, 'cause at 45, leaning on a wall in front of a convenience store might be a little sad."[4]Smith repeated this sentiment on one of the audio commentary tracks on theClerks IIDVD, to whichJeff Andersonjokingly replied, "Oh, don't get me started", referring to Anderson's well known doubts about makingClerks IIwhen first approached by Smith.
On March 29, 2012, Smith expressed his interest in producingClerks IIIas aBroadwayplay after seeing theTheresa RebeckcomedySeminarstarringAlan Rickman, with whom Smith had previously worked onDogma.[5]
On December 10, 2012, Smith released a specialHollywood Babble-Onepisode,Hollywood Babble-On #000: GIANT SIZED ANNUAL # 1: CLERKS III, AUDIENCE 0, in which he revealed greater details on his plans forClerks III. Smith stated that an ongoing audit over residuals fromClerks IIwithThe Weinstein Company(TWC) was causing a delay in several keyClerks IIIcast and crew members, including Anderson andScott Mosier, from coming on board until the audit was resolved. Smith also revealed that he would like tocrowdfundClerks III, either throughKickstarterorIndiegogo, with contributors receiving anything from DVDs, posters, and even roles as extras in the film.[6]On June 5, 2013, he changed his mind on crowdsourcing, stating "I've got access to money. And worst-case scenario, I can put up my house."[7]
Smith worked on a script forClerks IIIfrom March[8]to May 2013, stating when he completed it that it was "The Empire Strikes Back" of the series.[9]This script featured a story about Randal having a nervous breakdown after the Quick Stop is destroyed duringHurricane Sandy, and trying to manage it by getting in line for a film calledRanger Dangera year before it opens. Randal would have gained a small cult following and set up his own miniature Quick Stop, only for there to be a shooting at the theater.[10][11]In July 2013,Jason Mewesstated that they were now just waiting to hear back from TWC about funding.[12]
On September 26, 2014, Smith stated on hisHollywood Babble-Onpodcast[13]that he was glad that he madeTusk, so he could go on to makeClerks III:
Everything in my life would suck right now if I hadn't made that movie. I'm back in movies now. I've got three lined up, and this is the fucking grand news.Tuskwas the absolute bridge toClerks III. Because ofTusk, I got my financing forClerks III. A year and change ago, I was trying to fucking desperately getClerks IIImade for the 20th anniversary. And that desperation, I must have reeked of it, because I couldn't fucking find money and shit. But it wasTusk, it was people going 'Holy fuck! What else do you have?' And I was like,Clerks III, done. So, everybody that's like, 'He failed, he failed,' thank you - I failed intoClerks III. So, never trust anybody when they tell you how your story goes, man. You know your story. You write your own story.[14]
Filming was initially scheduled for in May 2015, but the production was put on hold to film another sequel,Mallrats 2.[15]However, by June 2016, the plans for aMallratssequel had been turned into plans for aMallratsTV series.[16]
The initial plans to filmClerks IIIcame to a halt in 2017, when Smith announced that one of the four leads, whom he later revealed to be Anderson, opted out of reprising his role despite a completed script. At the time, Smith doubted the film would ever be made.[17]In 2018, Smith suffered a near-fatal heart attack after one of his comedy shows. This experience inspired him to rewrite theClerks IIIscript from scratch, doing away with the original planned storyline.[18]Smith later reflected that the original script strayed too far from the originalClerks, noting it was written by "a guy who didn't know a thing about death" and he was ultimately glad it was never made.[10][11]Smith later reused the original opening scene, featuring Jay and Silent Bob getting arrested (alongside Dante and Randal in the originalClerks IIIscript) forJay and Silent Bob Reboot.[10]
In July 2019, Smith announced that he would do a live reading of the original, now-abortedClerks IIIscript at the First Avenue Playhouse inAtlantic Highlands, New Jersey. The reading was held on August 3, 2019.[19][20]That same month, Smith revealed atSan Diego Comic Conthat he was writing a new script forClerks IIIand promised to make the film.[21]
On October 1, 2019, Smith confirmed onInstagramthatClerks IIIwas happening and that Jeff Anderson agreed to reprise his role as Randal.
It'll be a movie that concludes a saga. It'll be a movie about how you're never too old to completely change your life. It'll be a movie about how a decades-spanning friendship finally confronts the future. It'll be a movie that brings us back to the beginning—a return to the cradle of civilization in the great state of #newjersey. It'll be a movie that stars Jeff and @briancohalloran, with me and Jay in supporting roles. And it'll be a movie called CLERKS III![22]
The new script follows Randal, after surviving a heart attack, and Dante making a movie about their lives at the store, a plot initially conceived as a film adaptation ofClerks: The Animated SeriestitledClerks: Sell Out.[23]
In January 2021, Smith announced the script was complete.[24][25]In July 2021,Lionsgateobtained the rights to produce and distribute the film, while also confirmingRosario DawsonandTrevor Fehrmanwould reprise their roles ofBecky ScottandElias GroverfromClerks IIrespectively.[26]
Principal photographybegan on August 2, 2021, inRed Bank, New Jersey.[27][28]Filming wrapped on August 31, 2021.[29]
Post-productionwas completed on February 13, 2022, with Smith announcing a trailer was slated to debut in May.[30][31]On May 28, 2022, Smith stated he viewed the first cut of the trailer and was set to release it duringSan Diego Comic-Con2022,[32]which would run from July 21–24.[33]On June 29, 2022, Smith announced the trailer would instead drop online on July 6.[34]

While not strictly sequential, the films have crossover plot elements, character references, and a sharedcanonknown as the "View Askewniverse", named after Smith's production companyView Askew Productions, which he co-founded withScott Mosier.
Between 2011 and 2018, Smith mostly made horror films, includingRed State(2011) and the comedy horror filmsTusk(2014) andYoga Hosers(2016). He has served as a director-for-hire for material he did not write, including thebuddy copaction comedyCop Out(2010) and various television series episodes, creatingMasters of the Universe: Revelationin 2021.

He is known for participating in long, humorous Q&A sessions that are often filmed for DVD release, beginning withAn Evening with Kevin Smith.[2]
Kevin Patrick Smith was born on August 2, 1970,[3]inRed Bank, New Jersey,[4]the son of Grace (née Schultz), a homemaker, and Donald E. Smith (1936–2003),[5]apostal worker.[6][7][8]He has two siblings: an older sister, Virginia, and an older brother, Donald Jr. He was raised in aCatholichousehold[9][10]in the nearby clamming town ofHighlands.
Smith's childhood was scheduled around his father's late shifts at the post office. His father grew to despise his job, which greatly influenced Smith, who remembers his father finding it difficult on some days to get up and go to work. Smith vowed never to work at something that he did not enjoy.[6]
Smith attendedHenry Hudson Regional High School,[11]where he was aB and Cstudent, videotaped basketball games, and producedSaturday Night Live-stylesketch comedy. An overweight teen, he developed into a comedic observer of life to socialize with friends and girls.[6]After high school, Smith attendedThe New Schoolin New York City, but did not graduate.[12]Smith metJason Meweswhile working at a youth center; they became friends after discovering a mutual interest in comic books.[13]
On his 21st birthday, Smith sawRichard Linklater's comedySlacker.[14]Impressed that Linklater set and shot the film in his hometown ofAustin, Texas, rather than on a soundstage in a major city, Smith was inspired to become a filmmaker, and to set films where he lived.[6]He has said: "It was the movie that got me off my ass; it was the movie that lit a fire under me, the movie that made me think, 'Hey, I could be a filmmaker.' And I had never seen a movie like that before ever in my life."[15]He assembled a library of independent filmmakers like Linklater,Jim Jarmusch,Spike LeeandHal Hartleyto draw from.[16]
Smith attendedVancouver Film Schoolfor four months, where he met longtime collaboratorsScott MosierandDave Klein. Unlike them, Smith left halfway through the course, figuring he knew enough to proceed and wanting to save money for his first film.[17]
Smith moved back to New Jersey and got his old job back at a convenience store inLeonardo.[6][18]He decided to set his film,Clerks, at the store, borrowing the a-day-in-the-life structure from the Spike Lee filmDo the Right Thing. Smith maxed out more than a dozen credit cards, and sold his much-treasured comic book collection, to raise $27,575 to make the film,[14]while saving money by casting friends and acquaintances in most roles.Clerkswas screened at theSundance Film Festivalin 1994, where it won the Filmmaker's Trophy. At a restaurant following the screening,Miramax FilmsexecutiveHarvey Weinsteininvited Smith to join him at his table, where he offered to buy the film. In May 1994, it went to theCannes International Film Festival, where it won both the Prix de la Jeunesse and the International Critics' Week Prize. Released in October 1994 in two cities, the film went on to play in 50 markets, never playing on more than 50 screens at any given time. Despite the limited release, it was a critical and financial success, earning $3.1 million.[6][19]Initially, the film received anNC-17rating from theMPAAfor sexually graphic language. Miramax hiredAlan Dershowitzto sue the MPAA. At an appeals screening, a jury of members of the National Association of Theatre Owners reversed the MPAA's decision, and the film was given an R rating.[20][21]The movie had a profound effect on the independent film community. According to producer and authorJohn Pierson, it is considered one of the two most influential film debuts in the 1990s, along withThe Brothers McMullen.[6]
Smith's second film,Mallrats,Jason Lee's debut as a leading man, did not fare as well as expected. It received a critical drubbing and earned only $2.2 million at the box office despite playing on more than 500 screens.Mallratswas more successful in the home video market.[6][22]
Widely hailed as Smith's best film, 1997'sChasing Amymarked whatQuentin Tarantinocalled "a quantum leap forward" for Smith.[23]StarringMallratsalumni Jason Lee,Joey Lauren AdamsandBen Affleck, the $250,000 film earned $12 million at the box office,[24][25]wound up on a number of critics' year-end best lists,[26][27]and won twoIndependent Spirit Awards(for Screenplay and Supporting Actor for Lee).[28]The film received some criticism from members of the lesbian community, who felt that it reinforced the perception that lesbians merely need to find the right man. Smith, whose brother Donald isgay, found this accusation frustrating, as he has endeavored to be a pro-LGBTfilmmaker, believing that sexuality is more fluid, with social taboos, not sexual desire, preventing more people from expressingbisexuality.[6]
Smith's fourth film,Dogma(1999), featured an all-star cast and was mired in controversy. A religious-themed comedy that starred a post-Good Will HuntingBen Affleck andMatt Damon, as well asChris Rock,Salma Hayek,George Carlin,Alan Rickman,Linda Fiorentino, and Lee and Mewes, it was criticized by theCatholic League.[29][30][31]The film debuted at the1999 Cannes Film Festival, out of competition. Released on 800 screens in November 1999, the $10 million film earned $30 million.
Smith then focused the spotlight on the two characters who had appeared in supporting roles in his previous four films.Jay and Silent Bob Strike Backfeatured an all-star cast, with many familiar faces returning from those four films. Affleck and Damon appear as themselves filming a mock sequel toGood Will Hunting. The $20 million film earned $30 million at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics.
Jersey Girl, with Affleck,Liv Tyler, George Carlin, andRaquel Castro, Smith's first film outside the View Askewniverse, marked a new direction in Smith's career. The film took a critical beating[32]as it was seen as, in Smith's own words, "Gigli2", because it co-starred Affleck and his then girlfriend,Jennifer Lopez.[33]Smith heavily reedited the film to reduce Lopez's role to just a few scenes, but the film did poorly at the box office. Budgeted at $35 million, it earned $36 million.[34]
In the 2006 sequelClerks II, Smith revisited the Dante and Randal characters from his first film. Roundly criticized before its release, the film won favorable reviews as well as two awards (the Audience Award at theEdinburgh Film Festivaland the Orbit Dirtiest Mouth Award at theMTV Movie Awards).[35]It marked Smith's third trip to the Cannes International Film Festival, where it received an eight-minute standing ovation.[36]The $5 million film, starring Jeff Anderson, Brian O'Halloran,Rosario Dawson, Mewes, Jennifer Schwalbach and Smith reprising his role as Silent Bob, earned $25 million.
Zack and Miri Make a Pornowas originally announced in March 2006 as Smith's second non-Askewniverse film. The film began shooting on January 18, 2008, inMonroeville, Pennsylvania, and wrapped on March 15, 2008. It starsSeth RogenandElizabeth Banksas the title characters who decide to make a low-budget pornographic film to solve their money problems. It was released on October 31, 2008, and ran into many conflicts getting an "R" rating. Rogen said:
It's a really filthy movie. I hear they are having some problems getting an R rating from an NC-17 rating, which is never good. They [fight against] sex stuff. Isn't that weird? It's really crazy to me thatHostelis fine, with people gouging their eyes out and shit like that, but you can't show two people having sex—that's too much.[37]
Smith took the film through the MPAA's appeals process and received an R rating without having to make any edits.[38]Zack and Miri Make a Pornowas considered a box-office "flop".[39][40][41]It was hurt by "tepid media advertising for a movie with the title PORNO".[39]In the aftermath of the film's performance, Smith's and Weinstein's business relationship became "frayed".[42]Zack and Miriopened #2 behindHigh School Musical 3: Senior Yearwith $10,682,000 from 2,735 theaters, an average of $3,906.[43]The "bankable" Rogen[44]experienced his "worst box-office opening ever".[45]In an interview with Katla McGlynn of theHuffington Post, Smith said:
I was depressed, man. I wanted that movie to do so much better. I'm sitting there thinking 'That's it, that's it, I'm gone, I'm out. The movie didn't do well and I killed Seth Rogen's career! This dude was on a roll until he got in with the likes of me. I'm a career killer!Judd [Apatow]'sgoing to be pissed, the whole Internet's going to be pissed because they all like Seth, and the only reason they like me anymore is because I was involved with Seth! And now I fuckin' ruined that. It was like high school. I was like, 'I'm a dead man. I'll be the laughing stock.'[40]
It was announced in 2009 that Smith had signed on to directA Couple of Dicks, a buddy-cop comedy written by the Cullen Brothers and starringBruce WillisandTracy Morgan.[46]Due to controversy surrounding the original title, it was changed toA Couple of Cops,[47]then reverted to its original title due to negative reaction,[48]before finally settling on the titleCop Out.[49]The film, shot from June to August 2009, involves a pair of veteran cops tracking down a stolen vintage baseball card,[50]and was released on February 26, 2010, to poor reviews; it was the first film Smith directed but did not write.Cop Outopened at number two at the box office and was mired in controversy, mostly over reported conflicts on the set between Smith and Willis. It was the last time Smith worked with a major studio, leading him to return to his independent film roots.[40][51]
In September 2010, Smith started work onRed State, an independently financed horror film loosely inspired by theWestboro Baptist Churchand its pastor,Fred Phelps.[52][53][54]Weinstein and his brotherBob, who had been involved in the distribution of Smith's films exceptMallratsandCop Out, declined to supportRed State.[55][56][57][58][59]The film starsMichael Parks,John GoodmanandMelissa Leo. Smith had said he would auction off rights to the $4 million film at a controversial event following its debut screening atSundancebut instead kept the rights to the film himself and self-distributed it under theSModcast Picturesbanner. The January 2011 premiere drew protests from a half-dozen members of the church, along with many more who counter-protested Westboro members.[60]Smith explained his decision as a way to return to an era when marketing a film did not cost four times as much as the film itself, a situation he called "decadent and deadening".[61]Red Statewas a box office bomb, earning just $1,104,682, and opened to poor reviews; the critical consensus (according toRotten Tomatoes) was "Red Stateis an audacious and brash affair that ultimately fails to provide competent scares or thrills."[62][63]In April 2011, Smith said thatRed Statehad made its budget back by making $1 million on the first leg of the tour, $1.5 million from a handful of foreign sales and $3 million from a domestic distribution deal for VOD.[64]
Smith had said beforeRed Statethat he would soon retire from directing, and announced that his last movie would beClerks III.[65]In December 2013, he said he would continue to make films, but only ones that were uniquely his, as opposed to generic ones "anybody could make".[66]
In 2013, Smith directedTusk, a horror film inspired by a story Smith and Mosier read about aGumtreead for a man who rents out a room in his house for free on the condition that the respondent dresses as a walrus for two hours per day.[67]The project began pre-production in September 2013,[68]and was shot in November of that year.[69][70]Released September 19, 2014, it received mixed reviews.[71]
BeforeTusk'srelease, Smith wrote the script for a spin-off of the film, which he titledYoga Hosers. The film began filming in August 2014, and was released in 2016. It stars Smith's daughter,Harley Quinn Smith, andLily-Rose Depp, reprising their two minor characters fromTusk, withJohnny Deppplaying his inspector character from the earlier film.[72][73]
Smith revealed at the 2014San Diego Comic-Conthat he had written the script for a film calledMoose Jaws, which he described as "Jawswith a moose", and which is planned to be the third film in hisTrue Northtrilogy.[74]
Smith wrote and directed one segment,Halloween, of the 2016 horroranthology filmHolidays, in which each segment takes place during a different holiday.[75]
In June 2017, Smith started shootingKillRoy Was Here, a horror film based on thegraffiti phenomenon. Directed by Smith, the script was co-written with Andrew McElfresh, marking the first time he shared writing credit. It represents a retooling of theirAnti-Clausfilm, which was initially canceled after the release ofKrampus, due to the two stories' similarity. The film crew was mostly made up of students of theRingling College of Art and Design, with shooting continuing over every semester break.[76]
In 2017, due to obstacles gettingClerks 3orMallrats 2produced, Smith decided to write and direct aJay and Silent Bob Strike Backsequel instead,Jay and Silent Bob Reboot. It was scheduled to be filmed in September 2017,[77]but shooting was postponed to February and March 2019.[78]The first trailer for the film was released on July 18, 2019. Smith announced a tour to accompany the film.[79]
On October 1, 2019, Smith announced onInstagramthatClerks IIIwas happening and thatJeff Anderson, who had retired, had agreed to reprise his role as Randal.[80]The film released on September 13, 2022.
In 2024, Smith releasedThe 4:30 Movie, focusing on a group of teenagers in the 1980s who spent a day "theatre-hopping", in Monmouth County, New Jersey.[81]
With the exception ofMallrats, all of Smith's films until 2008 were financed and/or distributed byHarvey Weinsteinand his brotherBob, via their companiesMiramax,Dimension Films, andThe Weinstein Company. In 2008 Smith's relationship with Harvey Weinstein soured due to the financial failure ofZack and Miri Make a Porno, which Smith blamed on a lack of marketing.[42]Nonetheless, they continued to discuss potential funding for other Smith projects, and The Weinstein Company co-produced Smith's 2016 talk showGeeking Out. Smith named the independent production company he created for the 2011 filmRed State"The Harvey Boys" in Weinstein's honor.[82]Smith is considered one of the writer-directors whose career Weinstein nurtured, a group that also includesQuentin TarantinoandDavid O. Russell.[83]
Smith severed professional ties with Weinstein when he was informed of his assault on Rose McGowan.[84]Soon afterallegations of rape and sexual assault by Weinsteinpublicly surfaced in October 2017, Smith said on Twitter that he was "ashamed" of his relationship with Weinstein. On hisHollywood Babble-Onpodcast, he said: "My entire career is tied up with the man", adding: "No fucking movie is worth all this." He lamented that in addition to working with Weinstein, "I sat out there talking about this man like he was a hero, like he was my friend, like he was my father." He pledged to donate all his futureresidualsfrom his Weinstein-produced films to the nonprofit organizationWomen in Film, which advocates for the inclusion of more women in film production.[85]Smith later announced that, due to the declining appeal of his earlier films, the residuals from Weinstein-funded films may be lower than expected; he decided that he would instead donate $2,000 a month to Women in Film.[86]

In 1997,New Line Cinemahired Smith to rewriteOvernight Delivery, which was expected to be a blockbuster teen film. Smith's then-girlfriendJoey Lauren Adamsalmost took the role of Ivy in the movie, instead of the female lead inChasing Amy. Eventually, she lost out toReese Witherspoon, andOvernight Deliverywas quietly released directly to video in April 1998. Smith was not credited for his contributions. He has said that the only scene that really used his dialogue was the opening scene, which includes a reference to longtime Smith friendBryan Johnson.[87]

Smith has been a regular contributor toArenamagazine. In 2005,Miramax Booksreleased Smith's first book,Silent Bob Speaks, a collection of previously published essays (most fromArena) dissecting pop culture, the film business, and Smith's personal life.

A lifelong comic book fan, Smith's early forays into comic books dealt with previously established View Askew characters, and were published byOni Press. He wrote a shortJay and Silent Bobstory about Walt Flanagan's dog inOni Double FeatureNo. 1, and followed it with aBluntman and Chronicstory inOni Double Feature#12. He followed these with a series ofClerkscomics. The first wasClerks: The Comic Book, which told of Randal's attempts to corner the market onStar Warstoys. The second wasClerks: Holiday Special, where Dante and Randal discover that Santa Claus lives in an apartment between the Quick Stop and RST Video. Third wasClerks: The Lost Scene, showing what happened inside Poston's Funeral Parlor. This story was later animated in the TV series style and included as an extra on the 10th AnniversaryClerksDVD.
Smith wrote the miniseriesChasing Dogma, which tells the story of Jay and Silent Bob between the filmsChasing AmyandDogma. He has written thetrade paperbackBluntman and Chronic, published byImage, which purports to be a collection of the three issues of the series done by Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards (ofChasing Amy). It includes a color reprinting of the story fromOni Double FeatureNo. 12, purported to be an early appearance by McNeil and Edwards. These stories have been collected inTales From the Clerks(Graphitti Designs,ISBN0-936211-78-4), which includes a newClerksstory tying into theClerks 2material, and the story fromOni Double Feature#1.

Smith returned to Marvel for two miniseries,Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men DoandDaredevil/Bullseye: The Target, both of which debuted in 2002. The former was six issues long, but problems arose when the third issue was published two months after the initially scheduled release date. As a result, the final issues were delayed for at least three years, prompting Marvel to release an "in case you missed it" reprinting of the first three issues as one book before the remaining issues were released. The delay in part was due to Smith's work onJersey GirlandClerks II, causing him to shelve completion of the miniseries until the films were completed. He was announced as the writer of an ongoingBlack Catseries[92]andThe Amazing Spider-Man[93]in 2002, but because of the delays onEvil That Men DoandThe Target, the plan was changed so that Smith would start a third Spider-Man title,[94]launched in 2004 byMark Millarinstead.Spider-Man/Black Catwas completed in 2005, butDaredevil/Bullseye: The Targetremains unfinished, with one issue published.

Two years later, he directedStar Warstoy commercials for Hasbro. He has directed[105]and starred[106]in commercials forPanasonic.

In 1996, Smith worked on a script for a plannedSupermanfilm tentatively titledSuperman Lives. He wrote several drafts but was dropped from the project whenTim Burtonwas hired to direct and brought his own team to write the script; Burton's attempt was later abandoned as well. Smith publicly discussed his experience working on the script at a Q&A session atClark Universityshown on the 2002 DVDAn Evening with Kevin Smith. In the Q&A, he said the experience was positive overall, since he loves Superman and was paid well. But he listed a number of unusual demands that producerJon Petersmade, including that Superman not be shown flying or wearing tights, and that he should battle a giant spider at the end of the film. Smith noted that he went to see the 1999 filmWild Wild West, which Peters produced, and was surprised to see a giant mechanical spider at the end of the film, presumably Peters's handiwork. Smith's description of his experience gained a life of its own, with film criticA.O. ScottofThe New York Timescalling it "extraordinary".[118][119]In the 2007 direct-to-DVD animated filmSuperman: Doomsday, Smith has a cameo as an onlooker in a crowd that alludes to this anecdote: after Superman defeatsThe Toyman's giant mechanical robot, Smith scoffs, "Yeah, like we really needed him to defeat that giant spider. Heh.Lame!"
In the early '00s, Smith was said to be writingFletch Won, a prequel to theChevy ChasefilmFletch, and was set to direct with Jason Lee in the lead role, but the plans ultimately came to nothing. Smith cited Miramax not seeing Lee's box-office appeal (in anEntertainment Weeklyarticle covering the delays, Smith claimed Harvey Weinstein continually refused it personally or suggested he focus more on the disguises of the character in a matter similar toAustin Powers, Smith admitting incredulity that Harvey refused even after Lee was frequently seen in billboards and posters in the city at the time, to promote his new showMy Name is Earl, but admitting that Harvey's vision for the film clearly did not include Lee) as a reason for its abandonment. For a time, Ben Affleck was considered for the role, with Chase framing the action as the narrator, looking back on his early adventures.
In 2004, Smith wrote a screenplay for a film adaptation ofThe Green Hornet, and announced that he intended to direct it.[120]The project died after the poor box office ofJersey Girl; the screenplay was later turned into aGreen Hornetcomic book miniseries.[100](A live-action film adaptation,The Green Hornet, was released in 2011, with no involvement from Smith.)

He purchased the original store in January 1997 for $30,000, using the money he earned fromClerks.[6]The current location is its second. The store was moved to a defunct ice cream parlor on Broad St. after Smith sold the Monmouth St. property. The New Jersey location was managed by Smith's long-time friendWalt Flanagan, who appears frequently in Smith's films. A second Secret Stash in the Westwood section of Los Angeles was opened in September 2004 and was managed by long-time friend and associate Bryan Johnson, who has appeared in Smith's films as Steve-Dave.[162]Smith had announced that he would close after his lease expired and Johnson wanted to resign, but eventually relocated to Laser Blazer, a now-defunct laserdisc and DVD store in Los Angeles.[163]In January 2009, the Los Angeles store closed, leaving the Red Bank store as Smith's only operating store.[164]
After the success of his first films, Smith moved toLos Angeles, though he felt homesick due to being away fromRed Bank, New Jersey. He dated actressJoey Lauren Adams, and declared his desire to marry her inTimemagazine. Smith and Adams' relationship was tested by their working together onChasing Amy, and the two had a heated argument while on the film's set. They broke up in June 1997.[6]

Smith never smoked until his debut film,Clerks, in which he used thecigarettesas a prop, but did not inhale. He quitsmoking cigarettesin 2008, when he took up smokingcannabisafter working withSeth RogenonZack and Miri Make a Porno.[172]
Smith has had a history ofyo-yo dieting. He lost 50 pounds (23 kg) upon meeting his wife. During production ofClerks IIin 2005, he went from 319 pounds (145 kg) to 269 pounds (122 kg). After watchingFed Up, he eliminatedsugarfrom his diet and took up juice fasts in 2014, lowering his weight from 330 pounds (150 kg) to 240 pounds (110 kg).[citation needed]
On February 25, 2018, after performing astand-up comedyshow at theAlex TheatreinGlendale, California, Smith suffered a severeheart attackcaused by a total blockage of theleft anterior descending artery.[173][174][175]An ambulance rushed him to the nearbyGlendale Adventist Medical Centerfor emergency surgery, from which he recovered. Following the episode, his doctor told him he needed to lose another 50 pounds (23 kg). He adopted a vegan diet,[176]also joiningWeight Watchersand becoming a paid spokesperson for the brand.[177]
On the fifth anniversary of his heart attack, Smith confirmed that he had quit using marijuana in early 2023 and had experienced a mental health crisis earlier in the year that led him to reassess his livelihood and identify as aco-dependent.[178]
Though raisedCatholic, Smith began to become disillusioned about his beliefs in his early 20s, and came to seeCatholic Massas "dry and lip-servicey". Seeking out advice, Smith spoke to a priest, who analogized faith to liquid filling a shot glass, and explained that the glass grows in size as a person grows older, and thus the same knowledge that satisfies a person as a child can be insufficient as an adult. Smith researchedChristianitythoroughly, explored other religions, read theBiblical apocrypha, and tried joining a Pentecostal congregation. The thoughts and ideas he explored during this time formed the inspiration for his filmDogma, the beginning of which features characters using the shot glass metaphor used by the priest. Though Smith still regularly attended Mass as late as 1998,[6]he stated on "Back to the Well", a feature on theClerks IIdocumentary, that he only goes to Mass on the day before he starts production of a film, and the day before it premieres. In September 2014, Smith said that he believes inGod, stating: "Proof of God is that I have a career."[179]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
