Grossing $143.4 million worldwide on a $14–25 million production budget, it became A24's highest-grossing film and at the95th Academy Awards, it won seven out of the eleven awards it was nominated for:Best Picture,Best Actress(Yeoh),Best Supporting Actor(Quan),Best Supporting Actress(Curtis),Best DirectorandBest Original Screenplayfor Kwan and Scheinert, andBest Editing. The film also won twoGolden Globe Awards, fiveCritics' Choice Awards(includingBest Picture), aBAFTA Award, and a record fourSAG Awards(includingBest Ensemble).
Evelyn Quan Wang is a middle-agedChineseimmigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband, Waymond. Two decades earlier, they eloped to theUnited Statesand had a daughter, Joy. In the present day, Evelyn is enduring multiple struggles: the laundromat is being audited by theInternal Revenue Service(IRS); Waymond is attempting to serve her withdivorce papersin an effort to spark a discussion about their marriage; her rigorous father (referred to asGong Gong,Cantoneseforgrandfather)[9]is visiting for herChinese New Yearparty; and she has a strained relationship with Joy, who is battling depression[10]and has a non-Chinese girlfriend, Becky, whom Evelyn is reluctant to accept.
At a tense meeting with IRS inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre, Waymond's body is taken over by Alpha-Waymond, a version of Waymond from the "Alphaverse." Alpha-Waymond explains to Evelyn that manyparallel universesexist (the "multiverse") because every life choice creates a new alternative universe. In the Alphaverse, the now-deceased Alpha-Evelyn developed "verse-jumping" technology, which enables people to access the skills, memories, and bodies of their parallel selves by performing bizarre actions that are statistically unlikely. The multiverse is threatened by Jobu Tupaki, the Alpha-Joy whose mind was splintered after Alpha-Evelyn pushed her to verse-jump beyond her endurance. Jobu experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. Jobu has created ablack hole-like "Everything Bagel"[11]that forms atoroidsingularity[12]that could destroy the multiverse.
Evelyn is provided verse-jumping technology to fight Jobu's minions, who are converging on the IRS building. She uncovers other universes in which she made different choices and flourished, such as becoming akung fumaster and film star. She also learns that Waymond intends to file for divorce. Alpha-Waymond believes that Evelyn, as the greatest "failure" of all Evelyns in the multiverse, possesses the untapped potential needed to defeat Jobu. Gong Gong is taken over by Alpha-Gong Gong, who instructs Evelyn to kill Joy to prevent Jobu from using her to access Evelyn's universe. Evelyn refuses and decides to face Jobu by acquiring powers through repeated verse-jumping. Alpha-Gong Gong, convinced that Evelyn's mind has been compromised like Jobu's, sends soldiers after Evelyn. While they fight, Jobu locates and kills Alpha-Waymond in the Alphaverse. As Jobu confronts Evelyn in her universe, Evelyn's mind begins to splinter, causing her to collapse.
Evelyn uncontrollably verse-jumps alongside Jobu across many bizarre and diverse universes. Jobu discloses she does not intend to fight, but that instead, she has been searching for an Evelyn who can see, as she does, that nothing matters. She teleports Evelyn to the Everything Bagel, divulging that she wants to use it to allow herself and Evelyn to truly die. Upon looking into the Bagel, Evelyn is initially persuaded, and behaves cruelly andnihilisticallyin her other universes, hurting those around her.
Just as Evelyn enters the Bagel with Jobu, she pauses to listen to Waymond's pleas in her universe for everybody to stop fighting and to instead practice kindness, even when life is senseless. Evelyn has anexistentialistepiphany and decides to follow Waymond'sabsurdist[13]andhumanitarianadvice, utilizing her multiverse powers to fight withempathy[14]and bring happiness to those around her. In doing so, she repairs her damage in the other universes and neutralizes Alpha-Gong Gong and Jobu's fighters. In her home universe, Evelyn reconciles with Waymond, accepts Joy and Becky's relationship and divulges it to Gong Gong, while Waymond convinces Deirdre to let them redo their taxes. Jobu decides to enter the Bagel alone as, simultaneously in Evelyn's universe, Joy pleads with Evelyn to let her go. Evelyn tells Joy that even when nothing makes sense and even though she could be anywhere else in the multiverse, she will always want to be with Joy. Evelyn and the others save Jobu from the Bagel, and Evelyn and Joy embrace.
Sometime later, with the family's relationships improved, they return to the IRS building to refile their taxes. As Deirdre talks, Evelyn's attention is momentarily drawn to her alternative selves, before she grounds herself back in her home universe.

Co-directorsDaniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, known as the Daniels, began researching the concept ofthe multiverseas early as 2010, after being exposed to the concept ofmodal realismin theRoss McElweedocumentarySherman's March(1986).[12]Kwan described the release of the animated filmSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018), which also deals with a multiversal concept, as "a little upsetting because we were like, 'Oh shit, everyone's going to beat us to this thing we've been working on.'"[12]He also stated "Watching thesecond seasonofRick and Morty(2013–present) was really painful. I was like, 'They've already done all the ideas we thought were original!' It was a really frustrating experience. So I stopped watchingRick and Mortywhile we were writing this project".[12]
In early drafts of the screenplay, the directors planned for the main character to be a professor and have undiagnosedattention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD); through his research for the project, Kwan learned that he had undiagnosed ADHD.[19]
Scenes in which Evelyn trains in martial arts and becomes an action film star were visually and contextually inspired by the films ofWong Kar-wai. Chris Lee ofVulturewrites that they "conjur[e] a mood of exquisite romantic yearning that will be instantly recognizable ... as touchstones" of Wong's works. The universe in which Evelyn and Joy are rocks was influenced by the children's bookSylvester and the Magic Pebble(1969) and the video gameEverything(2017).[12]
Kwan has said the idea of the everything bagel "started as just athrowaway joke", a play on a type of American bagel called an "everything bagel", which is baked with a large variety of toppings. Scheinert said they spent time attempting to develop the religion of bagel followers, but encountered complications: "Jobu Tupaki's a nihilist; should there bedogma? Should there be abook? What should their practices be as a religion? The bagel stuck because it became such a useful, simple symbol that we could point to as filmmakers. And you don't have to explain it much beyond the joke."[12][11]
The script was written forJackie Chanuntil Kwan and Scheinert reconceived the protagonist as a woman, feeling it would make the husband–wife dynamic in the story more relatable.[20]
The new script's lead character was initially named Michelle Wang, after the film's lead actress Michelle Yeoh, who said, "If you ask the Daniels, when they started on this draft, they focused on, 'Well, we are doing this for Michelle Yeoh.'"[21]The character's name was eventually changed to Evelyn. With her resemblance to the version of Evelyn as a martial artist and film star,[22]Yeoh opposed naming the character Michelle. "Evelyn deserves her own story to be told. This is a very ordinary mother [and] housewife who is trying her best to be a good mother to her daughter, a good daughter to her father, a wife that's trying to keep the family together [...] I don't like to integrate me, Michelle Yeoh, into the characters that I play, because they all deserve their own journey and their stories to be told".[22]
It was announced in August 2018 that Yeoh andAwkwafinahad been cast to star in what was described as an "interdimensional action film" from Kwan and Scheinert, withAnthony and Joe Russoattached to produce.[23]Awkwafina left the project in January 2020 due to scheduling conflicts, and was replaced with Stephanie Hsu. James Hong, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis joined the cast. It marked Quan's return to film acting, from which he had retired afterSecond Time Around(2002) due to a lack of casting opportunities.[24][25]Kwan and Scheinert were inspired to cast Quan after seeing amemeof formerNew York mayoralcandidateAndrew Yangbeing shown as a grown-up version ofShort Round, Quan's character fromIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom(1984). They were curious to learn what Quan had been doing, and learned that he was the right age to portray Waymond. Coincidentally, Quan had returned to acting, inspired by the success ofCrazy Rich Asians(2018), soon before he was approached for the role.[26]This is a result of adomino effectwhere the directorJon M. Chuwas inspired to createCrazy Rich Asiansbecause of#StarringJohnCho, a movement about Asian representation in leading roles in Hollywood.[27]Jeff Cohen, Quan's former co-star fromThe Goonies(1985), was his attorney to negotiate his contract.[28]
Kwan talked aboutwhitewashingwith studios, "The casting was probably one of the hardest things of the whole process. They're like, 'Oh, should we try a white actor?'...or 'Should we find other types of people that might actually bring in the money?'" He continued, "We had to have some really hard conversations with people to basically put our foot down and say, 'No, this was written for a Chinese family.'" Scheinert said that while it took a little longer, they ultimately ended up with an ideal cast.[29]
Principal photographybegan in January 2020, withA24announcing that it would finance and distribute the film, whileScott Rudinwas originally going to be an executive producer on  the film, but left because of allegations involving his behavior.[25]Around this time, Kwan and Schneirt were invited byMarvel Studiosto discuss the possibility of them developing thefirst seasonof theDisney+seriesLoki, which also deals with a storyline involving the multiverse, but the duo, already not really interested in the project, declined as they were about to start shooting their own movie about the same concept.[30]Shooting took 38 days,[31]mostly inSimi Valley, California.[32]Much of the film was shotovercrankedat a very high frame rate to accommodate extensive time remapping in post production.[33]The Daniels said the kung-fu fight scenes were shot unusually quickly; for example, thefanny-packfight was shot in a day and a half.[34]Filming wrapped in early March 2020, during the onset of theCOVID-19 pandemic in the United States.[35]The first cut ran around 170 minutes.[33]
Visual effects post-production for the film was done in-house, after the Daniels' negative experience with a dedicated post-production studio for their previous filmSwiss Army Man.[36]Instead, the filmmakers assembled a small team of five artists headed by Zak Stoltz, who produced all visual effects usingAdobe After Effects,Adobe Premiere Pro, and usedResilio Syncto share the large amounts of data once the pandemic hit.[36]
For Deirdre's appearance, Kwan discovered a picture of a real IRS agent he found online, which Curtis liked and wanted to emulate. Curtis wanted the character to be as "real" as possible and used her real belly for the film, as opposed to a prosthetic.[37]
Everything Everywhere All at Onceincorporates elements from a number of genres and film mediums, includingsurreal comedy,science fiction,fantasy,martial arts filmsandanimation.[5][6][7]A. O. ScottofThe New York Timesdescribed the film as a "swirl of genre anarchy", explaining that "while the hectic action sequences and flights of science-fiction mumbo-jumbo are a big part of the fun (and the marketing), they aren't really the point. [It is] a bittersweet domestic drama, a marital comedy, a story of immigrant striving and a hurt-filledballadof mother-daughter love".[7]Laura Zornosa fromThe New York Timeselaborates its addressing ofintergenerational traumathrough healing relationships. Additionally, Emily St. James wrote onVoxthat the film is part of a rising subgenre of "millennial parental apology fantasy", imagining worlds in which parents and children reconcile.[38]
According to Charles Bramesco ofThe Guardian, "The bagel of doom and its tightening grip on Evelyn's daughter lend themselves to the climactic declaration that there's nothing worse than submitting to the nihilism so trendy with the next generation. Our lone hope of recourse is to embrace all the love and beauty surrounding us, if only we're present enough to see it."[39]This nihilism is also incorporated into the film's exploration ofAsian Americanidentity.Anne Anlin Chengwrote inThe Washington Post,"It's not only that the multiverse acts as a metaphor for theimmigrant Asianexperience, or a convenient parable for the dislocations and personality splits suffered by hyphenated (that is, 'Asian-American') citizens, includingLGBT culture. It also becomes a rather heady vehicle for confronting and negotiating Asian-pessimism", a term she uses in reference toAfro-pessimism.[40]
Consequence's Clint Worthington wrote that "for all itsdadaistabsurdismand blink-if-you-miss-it pace, Daniels weaves the chaotic possibilities into the multiverse into a cohesive story about the travails of the road not traveled, and the need to carve out your own meaning in a meaningless universe."[41]Describing Jobu Tupaki'smodus operandi, Worthington notes "the living contradiction that is the everything bagel: if you put everything on a bagel, what more is left? And if you've experienced everything that the multiverse can offer, what's the point of any of it?"[41]Kwan said that the everything bagel concept "did two things. It allowed us to talk about nihilism without being too eye roll-y. And it creates aMacGuffin: a doomsday device. If, in the first half of the movie, people think that the bagel is here to destroy the world, and in the second half you realize it's a depressed person trying to destroy themselves, it just takes everything about action movies and turns it into something more personal."[12]The writer George Gillett argues that the movie is "a coming-of-age film for the internet generation", with the multiverse resembling virtual environments which viewers increasingly exist within.[42]
The philosophical themes of the film, and particularly Waymond's worldview, have been viewed as an expression of the central ideas ofhumanism—in particular, his belief that people should 'be kind, especially when we don't know what's going on'.[43]Other authors have linked the themes to those ofMahayana Buddhism[44]andDaoism,[45]with the recurring images of the bagel and the googly eyes described as "a surprisingly apt and humorous take onyin and yang", contraposing a "smorgasbord of meaningless nothingness" against "value where you want to create it and meaning where you choose to see it".[46]
The film engages textually andmetatextuallywith the "real world" of the viewer.[47][48]Critics have noted that one version of Evelyn—a famous martial arts movie star—is a portrayal of Yeoh,[48][49][50]that Ke Huy Quan's experience as a stunt coordinator is useddiegeticallyin Waymond's fight scenes,[51]and that James Hong's transformation into "a more sinister, English-fluent,Machiavellianstrategist" parallels his character Lo Pan inBig Trouble in Little China(1986).[47][52]
The musical score was composed bySon Lux, whose members areRyan Lott,Ian Chang, andRafiq Bhatia.[53]Daniels asked them to approach the score individually, and not as a band. Lott said, "I think that the complete picture of not only who we are as a band, but also who we are as individuals and what we have accomplished and the places we've gone creatively individually, meant for them that there was a possibility that many of these universes of sound could be within reach with this particular trio."[54]
Son Lux took two to three years to compose the score, which includes more than a hundred musical cues.[55]The soundtrack album consists of 49 tracks and runs for more than two hours. It features several prominent musicians,[56]includingMitski,David Byrne, a flute-playingAndré 3000,Randy Newman,Moses Sumney, Hajnal Pivnick, andyMusic.[17][57][58]Two songs—"This Is a Life" featuring Mitski and Byrne[59]and "Fence" featuring Sumney—were released as singles on March 4 and 14, 2022.[60]The album was released on March 25 to positive critical response.[61][62]
The film features several instances, both in audio and in dialogue, of the 2000Nine Dayssong "Absolutely (Story of a Girl)". When Daniels contacted Nine Days vocalist John Hampson about using the song, Hampson enthusiastically agreed to record three alternate versions of the song for use in the film.[63][64]Claude Debussy'sClair de luneis also prominently featured in the film, as the theme for Deirdre.[65]
The world premiere was at theSouth by Southwestfilm festival on March 11, 2022.[66]Its limited release in theaters was on March 25, 2022,[67]and its nationwide release was on April 8, in the United States byA24.[68]On March 30, 2022, the film was released in selectIMAXtheaters in the U.S. for one night only. Due to its popularity, the film returned to select IMAX theaters for one week starting on April 29, 2022.[69][70]The film was not released in most parts of theMiddle East, includingSaudi ArabiaandKuwait, due tocensorship of LGBT issuesin those countries.[71]The film was released in the United Kingdom on May 13, 2022.[72]The film was re-released in U.S. theaters on July 29, 2022, unchanged but adding an introduction by Daniels and eight minutes of outtakes after the credits.[73][74]It was re-released again in U.S. theaters on January 27, 2023, on 1,400 screens to celebrate its Oscar nominations.[75][76]
The movie release had different titles depending on locale. Chinese audiences approved of aTaiwanesetitle with a double meaning,妈的多重宇宙which translates alternatively to either 'Mother's Multiverse' or 'Fucking Multiverse' with the tagline比媽佛更媽佛('Even More Marvel than Marvel').[77][78]Inmainland China, the film used瞬息全宇宙('In an Instant, the Entire Universe'), while inHong Kongit used奇異女俠玩救宇宙('Weird Woman Warrior Fucks Around and Saves the Universe').[78]Taiwanese audiences disapproved of subtitles during the release for "over-translating" the movie.[79]
The film was released ondigital streamingplatforms on June 7, 2022, and was released onBlu-ray,DVD, andUltra HD Blu-rayon July 5, 2022, byLionsgate Home Entertainment.[80][81]

The film garnered widespread critical acclaim. On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 93% of 410 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Led by an outstanding Michelle Yeoh,Everything Everywhere All at Oncelives up to its title with an expertly calibrated assault on the senses."[95]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 81 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[96]Audiences polled byPostTrakgave it an 89% positive score, with 77% saying that they would definitely recommend it.[87]
David Ehrlich ofIndieWirecalled the film an "orgiastic work of slaphappy genius", praising the direction and performances, particularly Yeoh's, calling it the "greatest performance that Michelle Yeoh has ever given".[97]The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called it a "frenetically plotted serve of stoner heaven [that] is insanely imaginative and often a lot of fun", complimenting the cast and score but found the handling of the story's underlying theme underwhelming.[98]In her review forRogerEbert.com, Marya E. Gates lauded Yeoh's performance, writing, "Yeoh is the anchor of the film, given a role that showcases her wide range of talents, from her fine martial art skills to her superb comic timing to her ability to excavate endless depths of rich human emotion, often just from a glance or a reaction."[99]Bramesco praised the Daniels for constructing a "large, elaborate, polished, and detailed expression of a vision",[39]Amy Nicholson ofThe Wall Street Journalwrote, "Over its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time, the movie's ambitions double, and double again, as though it's aPetri dishteeming with Mr. Kwan and Mr. Scheinert's wildest ideas."[11]
Some reviewers called Yeoh's performance the best of her career.[100][101][102]In her review forVanity Fair,Maureen Ryansaid, "Yeoh imbues Evelyn with moving shades of melancholy, regret, resolve, and growing curiosity" adding that she "makes her embrace of lead-character energy positively gripping."[103]Adam Nayman ofThe Ringerreferred to the film as "a love letter to Yeoh [and] extremely poignant, giving its 59-year-old star a chance to flex unexpected acting muscles while revisiting the high-flying fight choreography that made her a global icon back in the 1990s".[104]In his review for theChicago Sun-Times, Jake Coyle wrote that although it "can verge on overload, it's this liberating sense of limitless possibility that the movie leaves you filled with, both in its freewheeling anything-goes playfulness and in its surprisingly tender portrait ofexistential despair".[105]Tasha Robinson ofPolygonnamed the scene of Evelyn and Joy Wang as rocks with their dialogue appearing as on-screen subtitles, all while trying to find common ground, as one of the best movie scenes of 2022, saying "...it's a perfect moment. Like so manyEEAAOsequences, it turns between emotions on a dime. But the quiet of the moment is essential. Out of context, it's just an odd moment between rocks. But within the context of the film, it's a breather the audience and characters both desperately need, and the emotions are so heightened that just the sight of rock-Joy and rock-Evelyn sharing a companionable laugh is remarkably heartening and hilarious."[106]
Dissenting reviews include that ofRichard BrodyforThe New Yorker, who dismissed it as a "sickly cynical feature-length directorial pitch reel for aMarvel movie",[107]and that ofPeter BradshawforThe Guardianwho described it as "a formless splurge ofNothing Nowhere Over a Long Period of Time".[108]
Armond WhiteofNational Reviewwrote: "UnschooledMarveladdicts who never heard ofKafka,Buñuel, orChuck Joneseasily fall for theentropyfarce. The Daniels refuse narrative convention in order to represent our culture's gradual decline into disorder.... The film's ultimate message: "Be Kind," spoken by two rocks. It's a childish palliative.... Yeoh brings adult stability to the blackout-skit chaos and cast of "stupid human" clowns. But the Daniels reduce life to "just a statistical inevitability, it's nothing special.""[109]
Bertin Huynh wrote inThe Guardianthat the film "distilseast Asian philosophieslike no other before it" and that "its heart ofBuddhistand Daoist thought is what makesEverything Everywheretruly great"; he further criticisedWesternreviews of the film, stating that the message of the film was "often missed by a western audience", and "wholly emblematic ofHollywood's dismissiveness of Asian achievements and stories".[46]
The New York Timesnamed the character Jobu Tupaki, played by Hsu, one of the 93 Most Stylish "People" of 2022.[110]
The film has been regarded as a groundbreaking achievement in the medium of independent cinema for its production values, themes, story and positive on-screen representation of Asian Americans. In 2023,Screen Rantranked it as the "Best Movie of the 2020s (So Far)," calling it the "best, most exciting movie" on the subject matter of the multiverse and a "turning point after the box-office-slumping COVID-19 pandemic and superhero-centric2010s."[111]The site also included it on its list of films from the decade that are "Destined To Become Classics," calling it "both a massively entertaining sci-fi actioner and a deeply affecting family drama."[112]It was ranked number 2 onMovieWeb's list of the "Best LGBTQ+ Movies of the 2020s (So Far)" and number 13 on its list of "20 Movies That Require Your Full Attention From Start to Finish." For the latter list, Taryn Flaherty wrote, "...there is not a second of this 139-minute eccentric film that does not demand your dedicated attention. With the multiverse driving the story's narrative forward, it should come as no surprise that every detail of this film will require its viewer to remain focused."[113][114]Marie Claireincluded it on its list of "The 100 Best Movies of All Time."[115]On January 1, 2024,Rolling Stoneranked it at number 49 on its inaugural list of "The 150 Best Sci-Fi Movies of All Time," writing "As characters leap from universe to universe (including one where humanity evolved to have... hot dog fingers?), and borrow skills from their counterparts, the Daniels never lose sight of the frayed emotions that are still tying the three main characters together, which in turn kept the metaphysical machinations feeling clear and easy to follow."[116]
IndieWireranked it at number 8 on its list of the "50 Best Action Movies of the 21st Century" and number 5 on its list of the "62 Best Science Fiction Films of the 21st Century."[117][118]It toppedCollider's list of the "10 Best Action Movies of the 2020s So Far," with Robert Lee III writing that the film "has become such an iconic and immediately beloved modern-day action movie classic thanks in part to its highly creative and inventive display of action. Being able to combine highly choreographed kung fu with a high-concept sci-fi story and a great deal of quirky comedy makes for a perfect combination that deeply resonates with modern-day audiences. Even more than its excellent filmmaking techniques, the film also has a surprisingly effective emotional core, able to conjure up powerful emotions with its deeply interpersonal story and characters."[119]The A.V. Clubincluded the character of Evelyn Wang on its list of the "15 Best movie moms of all time," with Cindy White writing that the character's "...love for her daughter crosses universes and spans realities. It's so strong, you can feel it coming through the screen, even when the two of them are rocks."[120]

Yeoh was the first Asian Best Actress, the secondwoman of colorafterHalle Berryin 2002, and the firstMalaysianto win any Academy Award.Stephanie Hsu's nomination in the Best Supporting Actress category, alongsideHong Chau's nomination forThe Whale, marked the first time two actresses of Asian ethnicity were nominated in that category in the same year. Ke Huy Quan is the first Vietnam-born actor to win an Academy Award. Jamie Lee Curtis also got the first Oscar of her career for Best Supporting Actress, helping the film win three out of four acting categories.[134]It is also the first science-fiction film to win Best Picture,[135]and the first science-fiction film to win five of thetop six Academy Awards. While no film has ever won in all four acting categories, it was the third to win three out of four, afterA Streetcar Named Desire(1951) andNetwork(1976),[136]and the first to also win Best Picture.[137]It is the first film since 2013'sGravityto win seven Academy Awards, and the most awarded Best Picture winner since 2008'sSlumdog Millionaire.[138][139]
The reaction to the film's Best Picture win was not without criticism, includingJustin Changlamenting in theLos Angeles Timesthatthe academy"chose the wrong best picture," and compared its win to that ofCODAat the previous ceremony:
"Against the unceasing din of the multiverse, what chance was there for the subtler glories of the best picture race — the haunting ambiguities ofTár, the lyrical epiphanies ofThe Fabelmans, the intensely pointed debates ofWomen Talkingor, hell, even the exploding mortar shells ofAll Quiet on the Western Front, which are indeed quiet by comparison? The more I’ve thought aboutEverything Everywhere, for all its undeniable representational significance, the more traditional a best picture winner it seems. Beneath its veneer of impish, form-busting radicalism, it's as epically self-important, broadly sentimental and thematically unambiguous a movie as any the academy has so honored."[140]

Guests on the podcast have includedBo Burnham,Sofia Coppola,Paul Schrader,Martin Scorsese, andAlia Shawkat. Despite lacking any pre-defined structure, episodes generally contain discussions around recent works of the two guests, allowing for branching discussions to other areas. The first two guests wereBarry Jenkins(director of A24'sMoonlight) andGreta Gerwig(director of A24'sLady Bird), who both discussed what it's like to make a movie about the place they grew up.[39]As of October 18, 2023, 38 episodes have been released.[40][41][42]
On March 26, 2018, co-founder John Hodges announced that he was exiting the company.[43]On November 15, 2018, A24 andAppleannounced that they had entered into a multi-year partnership where A24 will produce a slate of original films for Apple. This was not afirst-look deal, meaning that A24 can continue to produce and acquire films to release outside of the deal, and that it would not affect previous deals that A24 had signed with other companies. It is currently unknown if this slate of films will have a theatrical release or be exclusive to Apple's streaming service,Apple TV+.[44]

In May 2023,Leonine Studios, a German independent film distributor, partnered with A24 to set up a joint label called "A24 | Leonine Studios", which will distribute films in Austria and Germany.[55]The next month, it was reported that formerDisney General EntertainmentChairmanPeter Ricesigned a deal with A24 as an independent producer, agreeing to co-finance films for global distribution.[56]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, A24 was approved to continue filming and promotional activities since they do not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP).[57]
In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
