Laura's friend Chloe introduces her to her stepbrother, Harrison, who works at the record store Lost & Found. They immediately connect and attend aJapanese Breakfastshow together. She meets the record store's owner, Cooper. At the beach, Harrison gifts Laura a cassette so they can create amixtape. They celebrate after learning an art-related mentorship has accepted Laura. He mentions his intentions of moving to attend medical school but is interrupted by an earthquake. At her house, she shows him her art. Harrison's parents tell Laura that Harrison is going to a medical school on the other side of the country. Harrison privately tells Laura he does not want to go so he can stay with her. She tells him she does not want to be the reason he gives up on his dreams; he reassures her of his decision to stay. They attend her art exhibition. On his birthday, they finish painting a mural. The next day, Harrison is hit and killed by a car. Laura destroys the mural and leaves behind her mixtape at Lost & Found.
Four years later, Laura attends Chloe's wedding. Cooper gives Laura her mixtape back. She goes home to listen to it. After pressing play, Laura is transported to her first date with Harrison at the Japanese Breakfast concert. After a brief moment, she returns to the present. Every time she presses play, the mixtape sends her back in time. She does it again and appears on their date at the beach. She warns him about his future death and convinces him by predicting the earthquake seconds before it happens. In the present, she learns she is affecting the future after learning Chloe has married a different, obnoxious man instead of her soulmate. She learns Harrison had died the same day from falling off a cliff.
Her next click sends her to the time she showed Harrison her art. She warns him to stay away from the cliffs. This time, after returning, she learns Harrison died from electrocution after stepping on a downed power line. She presses play again and now appears at the party hosted at Lost & Found where they talked about their future, but her time is cut short. Her actions altered their timeline to where Lost & Found burned down with Harrison inside and the mixtape is no longer in her possession. She visits a depressed Cooper, gets the mixtape from this timeline, and tells Cooper about its powers. Cooper mentions the possibility that she is not supposed to save him but she tries anyway. Harrison still died, this time in a car accident with his dad. Once again, Laura presses play. She appears at her art exhibition. She tells Harrison to break up with her and go to medical school. In the present, she tries calling him but the call goes straight to voicemail. She immediately presses play again and appears in their last important moment: the day they finished the mural. She confronts him for not breaking up but Harrison says he would rather risk staying with her than leaving and dying anyway.
In the present, Laura forces herself to accept the fact she cannot be with Harrison. While at Chloe's, she discovers an additional song on the B-side of the cassette. The song sends her back in time to the moment they were going to meet for the first time. She decides to save his life by not stepping inside Lost & Found. In the present, a cheerful Chloe invites Laura to Christmas dinner. Chloe is married to her soulmate as the changes to the timeline have been reverted. Harrison arrives and introduces himself to Laura.

Glover originally worked in city administration working on community development[10]before transitioning to theater. He has said:
I didn't think it was a difficult transition. Acting is a platform that can become a conveyer for ideas. Art is a way of understanding, of confronting issues and confronting your own feelings—all within that realm of the capacity it represents. It may have been a leap of faith for me, given not only my learning disability (dyslexia) but also the fact that I felt awkward. I felt all the things that someone that's 6'3" or 6'4" feels and with my own diminished expectations of who I could be [and] would feel. Whether it's art, acting or theater that I've devoted myself to I put more passion and more energy into it.[11]
His first theater involvement was with theAmerican Conservatory Theater, a regional training program in San Francisco.[12]Glover also trained with Jean Shelton at theShelton Actors Labin San Francisco.

The company is fortuitously named after him and that was the movie that I wanted to do. We've developed a script. We thought we were going to get it done four years ago. We thought we were going to be making it right now. But also there are other kinds of things that intrigue me."[25]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
