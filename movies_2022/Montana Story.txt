It was released in the United States on May 13, 2022, byBleecker Street.
Estranged, twenty-something,half-siblingsCal and Erin return to the vast Montana ranch they once called home after their father has fallen into a coma and is now onlife support. Erin's mother died in childbirth, while Cal's mother died two years ago. The housekeeper and family friend, Valentina, has been holding down the fort.Kenyanimmigrant nurse, Ace (a nickname he uses since people in theUnited Stateshave trouble pronouncing his real name) has been providing life-sustaining care to the siblings' father. Since their father isn't expected to recover, Cal begins selling and donating the ranch's assets. He has conflicted feelings towards his father, due to pastabuse. Erin, who remains angry about the abuse, plans to take the family's elderly horse, Mr. T, back to her home inHudson Valley,New York.
Cal explains to Ace that, seven years ago, his father was a lawyer who helped cover up a toxic incident at the Copperheadopen-pit mine. Erin wrote an article that was published in a local paper, exposing the corruption. Their father violently assaulted her and killed her horse, Pepper. Erin ran away from home that night. Cal tried to track her down, but she actively avoided being found and he eventually stopped looking.
Cal tries to open up to Erin, telling her about his life inCheyenne,Wyoming, and his goal to be acivil engineer. However, she remains closed off. She decides to purchase an old truck andhorse trailerto transport Mr. T, though Cal worries about the reliability of the truck. The seller, Mukki, tells Erin that he'sMohicanand his family fled west over time to avoid violence.
The truck breaks down on the road, and the siblings wait for Valentina's son, Joey, to arrive with atow truck. Erin tells Cal that she's a trained cook who now works in a restaurant that uses every part of the animal. The siblings visit the Copperhead Mine, which Erin compares to the seven circles ofHellinDante'sInferno. She also meditates on the deceptiveness of theAmerican West's mythology.
During a thunderstorm and resulting power outage, Cal struggles to get a back-upgeneratorworking. Since the life support system is down, the siblings' father suffers aheart attack. Ace struggles to keep his patient alive, enlisting Erin to manually pump abag valve maskto keep her father breathing. After the power returns, Erin is upset that she has saved her father's life. She emotionally confronts Cal about him witnessing their father beating and severely injuring her to the point of hospitalization. She berates him for having not helped her in any way. Cal admits he was afraid to intervene and still feels guilty.
Later that night, when Cal thinks he's alone, he talks to his father about the older man's lack of happiness in life. Erin watches from the doorway as her fatherflatlinesand dies. It's not shown, but heavily implied that Cal disconnected his father from life support. Ace covers for Cal, saying the death was due to the heart attack that occurred during the power outage.
As the siblings go their separate ways, Erin asks Cal to keep in touch and he agrees to do so. Instead of taking Mr. T with her, Erin arranges for him to live on Mukki's ranch with a herd of other horses.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
