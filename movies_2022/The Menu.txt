It stars anensemble castconsisting ofRalph Fiennes,Anya Taylor-Joy,Nicholas Hoult,Hong Chau,Janet McTeer,Judith Light, andJohn Leguizamo. It follows a foodie and his date traveling to a remote island to eat at an exclusive restaurant where thechefhas prepared a lavish menu but reveals shocking surprises throughout the meal.
The film had its world premiere at the47th Toronto International Film Festivalon September 10, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 18, 2022, bySearchlight Pictures. It grossed $79.6 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics, who praised the screenplay and performances of the cast. At the80th Golden Globe Awards, Fiennes and Taylor-Joy were nominated forBest ActorandBest Actress – Musical or Comedy, respectively. The film earned five nominations, includingBest Thriller Film, at the51st Saturn Awards.
FoodieTyler Ledford and his date Margot Mills travel by boat to Hawthorn, an exclusive restaurant on aprivate islandoperated bycelebrity chefJulian Slowik. The other guests arefood criticLillian Bloom and her editor Ted; wealthy regulars Richard and Anne Leibrandt; washed-up movie star George Diaz[a]and his personal assistant Felicity Lynn; business partners Soren, Dave, and Bryce; and Slowik's alcoholic mother Linda. The group is given an island tour bymaître d'hotelElsa, who notes that Margot is not Tyler's designated guest.
Dinner begins and Slowik introduces a series of courses, during which he delivers increasingly unsettling monologues. For the third course, uncomfortable truths about each guest are exposed via images laser-printed ontortillas. During the fourth course,sous-chefJeremy kills himself. When Richard tries to leave, the staff cuts off his left ring finger as a warning to stay. Unhappy withangel investorDoug Verrick's attempts to involve himself in Hawthorn's management, Slowik arranges for him to be drowned in front of the guests. The fifth course commences with Slowik allowing himself to be stabbed by Katherine, an employee whom he had sexually harassed. The female guests dine with Katherine while the men are given the chance to escape the island via a game of cat-and-mouse, but Slowik's staff catches them all. When Lillian attempts to gain Katherine's favor by offering assistance in starting her own restaurant, Katherine reveals that she was the one who suggested killing the guests and staff.
Slowik explains that each guest was invited because they contributed to him losing his passion for his craft or because they make a living by exploiting the work of food artisans like him. He announces that everyone will be dead by the end of the night. Since Margot's presence was unplanned, Slowik privately gives her the choice of dying with the staff or the guests. When she hesitates, he chooses the staff. Margot reveals she is an escort named Erin, whose clients included Richard, whom she stopped meeting because he hired her to pretend to be his daughter. Slowik reveals that Tyler was informed the guests would be killed. Despite this, he was so zealous to participate in Slowik's craft that he kept it secret and hired Margot to replace his ex-girlfriend because Hawthorn does not seat lone diners. Slowik invites Tyler to cook and his performance fails to live up to his pretensions. Slowik humiliates him by detailing his culinary mistakes, then whispers in his ear, and a deflated Tyler leaves the kitchen.
Slowik asks Margot to go to thesmokehouseand retrieve a barrel needed for dessert. As she leaves the kitchen, she discovers that Tyler has hanged himself in a closet. En route, Margot sneaks into Slowik's house, where she is attacked by a jealous Elsa. After a scuffle, Margot fatally stabs her. After seeing a framedemployee of the monthaward showing Slowik as a young and happy cook preparing hamburgers at agreasy spoondiner, Margot finds a radio, calls for help, and returns to the restaurant with the barrel. A Coast Guard officer named Dale arrives. After the guests are convinced they have been saved, Dale reveals himself to be aline cookin disguise and returns to the kitchen.
Margot confronts Slowik for his "loveless" cooking and complains that she is still hungry. When he asks what she would like, Margot requests acheeseburgerand French fries prepared without the pretentiousness offine dining. Slowik finds joy in personally attending to her meal. After one bite, Margot praises the food, then requests to take it "to go". Slowik allows her to leave, and Margot escapes on the Coast Guard boat docked nearby.
The dessert is an elevateds'moresdish for which the staff decorates the restaurant with sauces and crushed graham crackers, then dresses the guests in marshmallowstolesand chocolatefezzes. Slowik sets the restaurant ablaze, detonating the barrel and killing the guests, staff, and himself. Margot watches the fire from the boat, eats her cheeseburger, and wipes her mouth with a copy of the menu.

In 1977, her agent phoned Light to have her audition for anunderstudyrole in theABCsoap operaOne Life to Live.

I was afraid to put myself out that much. With the agony of pulling it out piece by piece and having the prosecutor stick the knife in her gut, I couldn't help but let everything spew out of her."[9]Light won another Daytime Emmy Award in the role in 1981.[10]
She appeared in an episode ofSt. Elsewherein its first season, called "Dog Day Hospital", in which she played a housewife who became pregnant for the ninth time even though her husband claimed he had had a vasectomy.

The New York Times said in 1999 of Light's lead performance in the Broadway play Wit, "It is the sort of transformational work that would hint at other future successes, with Shakespeare, maybe, if a full-time career in the theater were truly an option these days. In any event, it gives rise to a wish. Ms. Light, don't touch that dial again, at least not for a while."[16]Nevertheless, it would be another decade before Light returned to a major theatrical role on Broadway.

In an interview with the magazineOut, Light stated:
“It was the LGBTQ community that inspired me to be the kind of person I wanted to be. I wanted to be authentic and courageous, and for so long I wasn't. When I began doing a lot of advocacy work in the early '80s for HIV and AIDS, I saw the community and the way the community was operating against all odds, against a world and a culture and country that gave them nothing and denigrated them. ... I looked at this community and said, 'This is breathtaking. This is the kind of world and people I want to be around. These are the kind of people I want to be working with."[51]
In 2018, Light discussed the similarities between the beginnings of theLGBT rights movementand theMe Too movement.[52]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
