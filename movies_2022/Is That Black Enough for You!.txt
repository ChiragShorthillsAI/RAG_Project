Hudson Street,T. J. Hooker,Murder, She Wrote,Miami Vice,Spenser: For Hire, andThe Cosby Show.
In 1985, Avery played the role of Shug Avery in the period drama filmThe Color Purpledirected bySteven Spielberg. Her performance in thisscreen adaptationofAlice Walker's prize-winning novelThe Color Purplewas nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[11]Avery was the last character to be cast in the film. In herEssenceinterview she said: "I had been singing in Indonesia and came back to find all these messages on my answering service from other actors saying, ‘Hey Margaret, you’ve got to get your agent on The Color Purple.’ My agent at the time had tried to get me an audition but was told that I wasn't right for the role— they wanted a singer, not an actor. I knew Ruben Cannon, who was casting at that time, because he'd cast me in so many television things before, so I wrote him a note. I  had read the book and was drawn to Shug Avery. Ruben allowed me to put my reading for the role on tape. Because of him, I was able to get my work seen by Steven Spielberg. Alice Walker said that she had seen a lot of tapes of other actors, but when my audition came up, she just kind of woke up. She couldn't take her eyes off me. That was like a beautiful introduction to getting the role."[12]
AfterThe Color Purpleand Oscar nomination, Avery did not work on film or television for two years. She said, "The fact that I didn’t work for a couple years afterThe Color Purpleis not unique. It not only happens to White actors sometimes, but with Black actors, too, but more so for women of color. At the time, most women of color who were in the business were limited to Black film; whereas my counterpart like Danny Glover, went on toLethal Weapon One, Two,andThree. He didn’t have to be limited to a Black film; he didn’t have to be married to a family, or related to somebody, like we women have to. I didn’t work for a couple years afterThe Color Purple. What saved me was the college lecture circuit. I kind of got a backlash for two reasons; one, no one would even think of me for a television role because they figured she’s too big to do TV now. That was the pattern."[12]
In 1988, Avery starred in the period drama filmBlueberry Hill, and the following year appeared in action filmRiverbend. In 1990, she appeared inThe Return of Superfly, another blaxploitation film.

Belafonte supported thecivil rights movementin the 1950s and 1960s and was one ofMartin Luther King Jr.'s confidants.[77]After King had been arrested for his involvement in theMontgomery bus boycottin 1955, he began traveling to Northern cities to spread awareness and acquire donations for those struggling with social segregation and oppression in the South.[78]The two met at theAbyssinian Baptist ChurchinHarlem, New York, in March of the following year. This interaction led to years of joint political activism and friendship. Belafonte joined King and his wife,Coretta Scott King, during the 1958 Washington D.C.Youth March for Integrated Schools, and in 1963, he backed King in conversations withRobert F. Kennedy, helping to organize the1963 March on Washington[79]—the site of King's famous "I Have a Dream" Speech.[80]He provided for King's family since King earned only $8,000 ($80,000 in today's money) a year as a preacher. As with many other civil rights activists, Belafonte wasblacklistedduring theMcCarthy era. During the 1963Birmingham campaign, Belafonte bailed King out of theBirmingham, Alabamajail and raised $50,000[81]to release other civil rights protesters. He contributed to the 1961Freedom Rides, and supportedvoter registration drives[79][82]He later recalled, "Paul Robeson had been my first great formative influence; you might say he gave me my backbone. Martin King was the second; he nourished my soul."[83]Throughout his career, Belafonte was an advocate for political and humanitarian causes, such as theAnti-Apartheid MovementandUSA for Africa. From 1987 until his death, he was aUNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.[84]
During theMississippi Freedom Summerof 1964, Belafonte bankrolled theStudent Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, flying toMississippithat August with Sidney Poitier and $60,000 in cash and entertaining crowds inGreenwood. In 1968, Belafonte appeared on aPetula Clarkprimetime television special onNBC. In the middle of a duet ofOn the Path of Glory, Clark smiled and briefly touched Belafonte's arm,[85]which prompted complaints from Doyle Lott, the advertising manager of the show's sponsor,Plymouth Motors.[86]Lott wanted to retape the segment,[87]but Clark, who had ownership of the special, told NBC that the performance would be shown intact or she would not allow it to be aired at all. Newspapers reported the controversy,[88][89]Lott was relieved of his responsibilities,[90]and when the special aired, it attracted high ratings.
Belafonte taped an appearance on an episode ofThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hourto be aired on September 29, 1968, performing a controversialMardi Grasnumber intercut with footage from the1968 Democratic National Conventionriots.CBScensors deleted the segment. The full unedited content was broadcast in 1993 as part of a completeSmothers Brothers Comedy Hoursyndication package.[citation needed]
In the1960 electionbetweenJohn F. KennedyandRichard Nixon, notable Black athleteJackie Robinsonadvocated his support for the Nixon campaign. His reasoning for doing so was his perception of Kennedy's championing of theCivil Rights movementas disingenuous.[91]Because of Robinson's social impact on Black Americans, theDemocratic Partywas determined to find a comparable Black endorser for Kennedy's campaign.[92]Fresh off of his win as the first Black man to receive anEmmy Awardfor his work onTonight with Belafonte, Belafonte was Kennedy's pick to fill the endorsement position.[80]
The two met in Belafonte's apartment, where Kennedy had hoped to convince Belafonte to mobilize support for his campaign. He thought to accomplish this by having Belafonte mobilize his influence amongst other Black entertainers of the era, persuading them to rally for Kennedy's presidential nomination. Unexpectedly, Belafonte was not so impressed by the candidate, sharing the same sentiments as Robinson about Kennedy's role (or lack thereof) in maintaining civil rights as an essential part of his campaign. To improve his engagement with Black America, Belafonte suggested to Kennedy that he contactMartin Luther King, making a connection to a viable source of leadership within the movement. Kennedy, though, was hesitant with this suggestion, questioning the social impact the preacher could make on the campaign. After much convincing–as Kennedy and King would later meet in June 1960–the two men negotiated a deal that if Nixon became the nominee for theRepublican party, Belafonte would support Kennedy's presidential pursuits.[80]Belafonte's endorsement of the campaign was further substantiated after both Kennedy brothers had worked to bail King out of jail inAtlantaafter a sit-in, engaging with aGeorgiajudge.[92]
Joining the Hollywood for Kennedy committee,[80]Belafonte appeared in a 1960 campaign commercial for Democratic presidential candidateJohn F. Kennedy.[93]Unfortunately, the commercial was shown on television for one broadcasting.[78]Belafonte also attended and performed at Kennedy'sinaugural ball.[92]Kennedy later named Belafonte cultural advisor to thePeace Corps. AfterKennedy's assassination, Belafonte supportedLyndon B. Johnsonfor the1964 United States presidential election.[94]
Renowned authorJames Baldwincontacted Belafonte three years after John F. Kennedy's election. The purpose of the call was to invite Belafonte to a meeting to speak withAttorney GeneralRobert Kennedyabout the continued plight of the Black people in America. This event was known as theBaldwin-Kennedy Meeting. Belafonte met with fifteen others, including Kennedy and Baldwin, in Kennedy'sCentral Park Southapartment on May 24, 1963.[92]
The other members included were Thais Aubrey, David Baldwin, Edwin Berry,Kenneth Clark, Eddie Fales,Lorraine Hansberry, Lena Horne,Clarence Jones,Burke Marshall,Henry Morgenthau III,June Shagaloff, Jerome Smith, andRip Torn.[95]
The guests engaged in cordial political and social conversation. Later, the talk led to an investigation of the position of Black people in theVietnam War. Offended by Kennedy's implication that Black men should serve in the war, Jerome Smith scolded the young Attorney General. Smith, a Black man and Civil Rights advocate had been severely beaten while fighting for the movement's cause, which enforced his strong resistance to Kennedy's assertion, frustrated that he should fight for a country that did not seem to want to fight for him.[92]
A short time after the confrontation, Belafonte spoke with Kennedy. Belafonte then told him that even with the meeting's tension, he needed to be in the presence of a man like Smith to understand Black people's frustration withpatriotismthat Kennedy and other leaders could not understand.[92]

In 2011, Belafonte commented on theObama administrationand the role that popular opinion played in shaping its policies. "I think [Obama] plays the game that he plays because he sees no threat from evidencing concerns for the poor."[97]
On December 9, 2012, in an interview withAl SharptononMSNBC, Belafonte expressed dismay that many political leaders in the United States continue to oppose Obama's policies even after his reelection: "The only thing left for Barack Obama to do is to work like a third-world dictator and just put all of these guys in jail. You're violating the American desire."[98]
On February 1, 2013, Belafonte received theNAACP'sSpingarn Medal, and in the televised ceremony, he countedConstance L. Riceamong those previous recipients of the award whom he regarded highly for speaking up "to remedy the ills of the nation."[99]

Belafonte was a longtime critic ofU.S. foreign policy. He began making controversial political statements on the subject in the early 1980s. At various times, he made statements opposing the U.S. embargo onCuba; praising Soviet peace initiatives; attacking theU.S. invasion of Grenada; praising theAbraham Lincoln Brigade; honoringEthel and Julius Rosenberg; and praisingFidel Castro.[62][113]Belafonte is also known for his visit to Cuba that helped ensurehip-hop's place in Cuban society. According to Geoffrey Baker's article "Hip hop, Revolucion! Nationalizing Rap in Cuba", in 1999, Belafonte met with representatives of the rap community immediately before meeting with Castro. This meeting resulted in Castro's personal approval of, and hence the government's involvement in, the incorporation of rap into his country's culture.[114]In a 2003 interview, Belafonte reflected upon this meeting's influence:
"When I went back toHavanaa couple years later, the people in the hip-hop community came to see me and we hung out for a bit. They thanked me profusely and I said, 'Why?' and they said, 'Because your little conversation with Fidel and the Minister of Culture on hip-hop led to there being a special division within the ministry and we've got our own studio.'."[115]
Belafonte was active in theAnti-Apartheid Movement. In 1987, he was the master of ceremonies at a reception honoringAfrican National CongressPresidentOliver Tamboat Roosevelt House,Hunter College, in New York City. The reception was held by the American Committee on Africa (ACOA) and The Africa Fund.[116]He was a board member of theTransAfrica Forumand theInstitute for Policy Studies.[117]
Belafonte achieved widespread attention for his political views in 2002 when he began making a series of comments about PresidentGeorge W. Bush, his administration and theIraq War. During an interview withTed LeitnerforSan Diego's 760 KFMB, on October 10, 2002, Belafonte referred toMalcolm X.[118]Belafonte said:
There is an old saying, in the days ofslavery. There were those slaves who lived on the plantation, and there were thoseslaves who lived in the house. You got the privilege of living in the house if you served the master, do exactly the way the master intended to have you serve him. That gave you privilege.Colin Powellis permitted to come into the house of the master, as long as he would serve the master, according to the master's dictates. And when Colin Powell dares to suggest something other than what the master wants to hear, he will be turned back out to pasture. And you don't hear much from those who live in the pasture.[119]
Belafonte used the quotation to characterize formerUnited States Secretaries of StateColin Powell andCondoleezza Rice. Powell and Rice both responded, with Powell calling the remarks "unfortunate"[118]and Rice saying: "I don't need Harry Belafonte to tell me what it means to be black."[120]
The comment resurfaced in an interview withAmy GoodmanforDemocracy Now!in 2006.[121]In January 2006, Belafonte led a delegation of activists including actorDanny Gloverand activist/professorCornel Westto meet withVenezuelan presidentHugo Chávez. In 2005, Chávez, an outspoken Bush critic, initiated a program to provide cheaperheating oilfor poor people in several areas of the United States. Belafonte supported this initiative.[122]He was quoted as saying, during the meeting with Chávez: "No matter what the greatest tyrant in the world, the greatestterroristin the world, George W. Bush says, we're here to tell you: Not hundreds, not thousands, but millions of the American people support your revolution."[123]Belafonte and Glover met again with Chávez in 2006.[124]The comment ignited a great deal of controversy.Hillary Clintonrefused to acknowledge Belafonte's presence at an awards ceremony that featured both of them.[125]AARP, which had just named him one of its 10 Impact Award honorees 2006, released this statement following the remarks: "AARP does not condone the manner and tone which he has chosen and finds his comments completely unacceptable."[126]
During aMartin Luther King Jr. Dayspeech atDuke Universityin 2006, Belafonte compared the American government to thehijackersof theSeptember 11 attacks, saying: "What is the difference between that terrorist and other terrorists?"[127]In response to criticism about his remarks, Belafonte asked: "What do you call Bush when the war he put us in to date has killed almost as many Americans as died on 9/11 and the number of Americans wounded in war is almost triple? ... By most definitions Bush can be considered a terrorist." When he was asked about his expectation of criticism for his remarks on the war in Iraq, Belafonte responded: "Bring it on.Dissentis central to any democracy."[128]
In another interview, Belafonte remarked that while his comments may have been "hasty", he felt that the Bush administration suffered from "arrogance wedded to ignorance" and its policies around the world were "morally bankrupt."[129]In a January 2006 speech to the annual meeting of the Arts Presenters Members Conference, Belafonte referred to "the newGestapoofHomeland Security", saying: "You can be arrested and have noright to counsel!"[130]During a Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech atDuke UniversityinDurham, North Carolinain January 2006, Belafonte said that if he could choose hisepitaph, it would read "Harry Belafonte, Patriot."[131]

Linked page for 'Charles Burnett' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Burnett_(director)):
Charles Burnett(/bɜːrˈnɛt/; born April 13, 1944) is an American film director, film producer, writer, editor, actor, photographer, and cinematographer. His most popular films includeKiller of Sheep(1978),My Brother's Wedding(1983),To Sleep with Anger(1990),The Glass Shield(1994), andNamibia: The Struggle for Liberation(2007). He has also directed several short films and documentary films.
Burnett has been named as "one of America's very best filmmakers" by theChicago Tribuneand "the nation's least-known great filmmaker and most gifted black director" byThe New York Times.[1]He received anAcademy Honorary Awardfrom theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciencesfor being an "influential film pioneer who has chronicled the lives of black Americans with eloquence and insight" in 2017.
Burnett was born on April 13, 1944, inVicksburg, Mississippi, to a nurse's aide and a military father.[2]According to a DNA analysis, he is mainly descended from people fromSierra Leone.[3]In 1947, Charles's family moved toWatts, a largely black neighborhood in South Los Angeles.[1]Burnett was interested in expressing himself through art from a young age, but the economic pressure to maintain a stable job kept him from pursuing film or art in college.[2]
Watts had a significant effect on Burnett's life and work. The community, which gained notoriety in 1965 when violent riots in the area caused the deaths of 34 people and injured more than 1,000, again made the news in 1992 when protestors turned to looting and arson following the acquittal of police officers tried for the beating ofRodney King.[2]Burnett has said that the neighborhood had a strong Southern influence due to the large number of Southerners living in the area.[1]Watts strongly influences his movies' subject matter, which often revolves around southern folklore mixed with modern themes.[2]His filmKiller of Sheepwas set in Watts.[4]
Burnett first enrolled atLos Angeles City College[2][5]to study electronics in preparation for a career as an electrician.[1]Dissatisfied, he took a writing class and decided that his earlier artistic ambitions needed to be explored and tested. He went on to earn a BA in writing and languages at theUniversity of California, Los Angeles.[6]
In an interview forCahiers du Cinéma,Burnett speculated that "a serious speech impediment" may have led him to become a filmmaker:
I always felt like an outside – an observer – who wasn't able to participate because I couldn't speak very well. So this inability to communicate must have led me...to find some other means to express myself...I really liked a lot of the kids I grew up with. I felt an obligation to write something about them, to explain what went wrong with them. I think that's the reason I started to make these movies.[7]
Burnett continued his education at the UCLA film school, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree in theater arts and film.[6]His experiences at UCLA had a profound influence on his work, and the students and faculty he worked with became his mentors and friends. Some fellow students include filmmaking greats likeLarry Clark,Julie Dash,Haile Gerima, andBilly Woodberry.[6]The students' involvement in each other's films is highlighted by Burnett's work as a cinematographer forHaile Gerima's 1979 movieBush Mama, as a crew member forJulie Dash's 1982Illusions, and as a writer and cameraman for Billy Woodberry'sBless Their Little Hearts.[8]His professors Elyseo Taylor, who created the department of Ethno-Communications, andBasil Wright, a British documentarian, also had a significant influence on his work.[1]
The turbulent social events of 1967 and 1968 were vital in establishing the UCLA filmmaking movement known as the "Black Independent Movement”, in which Burnett was highly involved.[5][9]The films of this group of African and African American filmmakers had strong relevance to the politics and culture of the 1960s, yet stayed true to the history of their people.[9]Their characters shifted from the middle class to the working class to highlight the tension caused by class conflict within African American families.[9]The independent writers and directors strayed away from the mainstream and won critical approval for remaining faithful to African American history.[10]Another accomplishment of the Black Independent Movement and Burnett was the creation of the Third World Film Club. The club joined with other organizations in a successful campaign to break the American boycott banning all forms of cultural exchange withCuba.[11]Many critics have compared the films of the Black Independent Movement to Italian neorealist films of the 1940s, Third World Cinema films of the late 1960s and 1970s, and the 1990s Iranian New Wave.[8]At the time the movement flourished, many countries in the Third World were involved in a struggle for revolution, inspiring them to create films expressing their own indigenous views of their history and culture.[9]In addition to staying true to history, many Black Independent Movement films have been considered a response to Hollywood andBlaxploitationfilms that were popular at the time.[8]
Burnett's earliest works include his UCLA student films made with friends,Several Friends(1969) andThe Horse(1973), for which he was the director, producer, and editor.[12]Burnett was involved in many shorts that includeSeveral Friends(1969),The Horse(1973),When It Rains(1995),Olivia's Story(2000), andQuiet as Kept(2007).When It Rainsfollows the story about a musician that tries to assist his friend with paying her rent.Quiet as Keptis a story about a relocated family afterHurricane Katrina.
Burnett's first full-length feature film,Killer of Sheep, was his UCLA master's thesis.[2]It took Burnett five years to finish, apparently due to the imprisonment of one of the film's actors,[2]and was released to the public in 1978.[1]The cast consisted mainly of his friends and film colleagues and it was filmed primarily with a handheld camera, seemingly in documentary style.[8]The main character was played by Henry G. Sanders, a Vietnam veteran who had studied cinema at Los Angeles City College and was enrolled in several classes at UCLA.[8]Sanders went on to a career in films and TV, including roles inRocky Balboa,ER,Miami Vice, andThe West Wing.[8]The lead female character inKiller of Sheepwas played byKaycee Moore, who went on to act in former UCLA classmate Julie Dash's filmDaughters of the Dust.[8]The story follows the protagonist Stan, a slaughterhouse worker, who struggles to make enough money to support his family.[13]According to the film's website, the movie “offers no solutions; it merely presents life”.[13]Killer of Sheeprevolves around rituals, in the family, childhood, oppression, and resistance to oppression.[14]The soundtrack of ballads, jazz, and blues includes artistsFaye Adams,[15]Dinah Washington, Gershwin, Rachmaninov,Paul Robeson, andEarth Wind & Fire. The film was only screened occasionally because of its poor 16mm print quality[8]and failed to find widespread distribution due to the cost and complexity of securing music rights.[8]It was restored by the UCLA Film & Television archive in a new 35mm print of much higher quality.[8]The re-released film won an array of awards including the critics' award at theBerlin International Film Festival, first place at theSundance Film Festivalin the 1980s, then called the USA Film Festival,[16]and a Special Critics' Award from the 2007 New York Film Critics Circle.[17]It was an inductee of the 1990National Film Registrylist.[18][8]In addition, it was chosen as one of the 100 Essential Films of All Time by the National Society of Film Critics in 2002.[8]Burnett was awarded aGuggenheim FoundationFellowship in 1981, following the film's completion.
Burnett served as the director, producer, director of photography, and screenwriter forMy Brother's Wedding.My Brother's Weddingwas his second full-length film, but was not released because of a mixed review inThe New York Timesafter playing at theNew Directors/New Films Festivalin 1983.[19]As inKiller of Sheep, many of the film's actors were amateurs, including the costume designer's wife.[1]The role of Pierce Mundy, the protagonist, was played by Everett Silas. Mundy struggles to choose between his brother's middle-class existence and his best friend's working-class world.[14]The movie was the first feature Burnett shot on 35mm color film.[2]Its cost was estimated at $80,000.[2]The movie was acquired by Milestone Films, restored by the Pacific Film Archive at theUniversity of California, Berkeley, and digitally reedited by Burnett.[19]
To Sleep with Angerwas Burnett's first higher-budget film, with an estimated cost of $1.4 million.[2]The grant he received from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation helped Burnett support his family while working on the film.[2]The $250,000 grant spread over the course of five years is awarded to gifted individuals to pursue personal projects.[2]The movie was set in South Central LA and followed the same themes of family and southern folklore as most of his films.[2]The story concerns a lower middle class Los Angeles family that welcomes a guest from the South who overstays his welcome and causes a major disturbance in the family.[20]The family's instability seems to reflect the larger community's volatility.[20]To Sleep with Angerwas Burnett's first film to feature professional actors.[2]The lead actors includeDanny Glover,Paul Butler, Mary Alice,Carl Lumbly, andVonetta McGee.[12]Glover, who plays Harry Mention, agreed to a reduced fee and went on to invest in the production.[2]A box-office favorite known for his role in theLethal Weaponfilms, Glover continued to star in many successful productions includingThe Royal Tenenbaums,Dreamgirls,2012, andDeath at a Funeral.[12]Although highly acclaimed by critics,To Sleep with Angerdid poorly at the box office.[2]Burnett attributes this to poor distribution and lack of good taste.[2]The film won many awards, including best screenplay from the National Society of Film Critics (the first award of its kind given to an African American writer).[16]Other awards include two Independent Spirit Awards for Best Director and Best Screenplay, the American Film Institute's Maya Deren Award,[4]the Special Jury Recognition Award at the 1990Sundance Film Festival,[2]a Special Award from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and nominations for Burnett and Glover by the New York Film Critics Association.[1]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
