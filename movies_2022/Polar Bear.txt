A mother polar bear and her cub swim across the waters that was once the ice of the Arctic Tundra, as the film tells us the story of how she and her family survived during her youth. She had loved playing with her twin brother as they were watched and protected by their mother, as she goes seal hunting and keeping a look out for male polar bears who threaten the cubs, they even came across a dead whale, and they, along with many other bears, feasted on it. Sadly one day, the polar bear's brother died, and it was only her and her mom left, she successfully hunted a baby walrus abandoned by a panicked mother. The bear's mother knew it's time to fend for herself again, and departs. The polar bear then spent years not seeing another ice bear, until she meets another male her age and they spend a day playing together, as he bids farewell, she realizes she was being tracked by a much bigger male. Thinking he was going to kill her, she stands her ground, but soon realizes she was being courted. As the big male and the female go their separate ways, the polar bear soon becomes a mother of one cub. In the present day, the mother and daughter spend their days surviving in the disappearing Arctic, the female knows her daughter will have what it takes to become a good ice bear, with a concerned question on what kind of world will she call home. The film ends with a message reading, "The Arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040, the actions we take today can positively change the future of polar bears."

Disneynatureis an independentfilm studiothat specializes in the production ofnature documentaryfilms forWalt Disney Pictures, a subsidiary of theWalt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned byThe Walt Disney Company. Disneynature was founded on April 21, 2008, and is headquartered inBurbank, California.
The company's nature films are consistently budgeted between $5 million to $10 million, with their distribution and marketing handled byWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.[2]The label's event films are released onEarth Dayand have a conservation campaign based on the feature of the film with an appropriate conservation charity receiving donations based on tickets sold,[3]at a pace of one per year.[4]The eight Disneynature theatrical films have a gross of $151.6 million at the box office, at an average of $19 million, withEarththe top earner at $32 million.[5]
Disney had a background in making nature films prior to the creation of Disneynature;Bambi(1942) featured forest life and was a hit.[4]From 1948 through 1960, the company produced theTrue-Life Adventuresseries, which won severalAcademy Awards.[2]Outside of film work, Disney parks were involved.Disneylandin 1955 opened theJungle Cruiseride.Walt Disney WorldincludesDisney's Animal Kingdom, which is a theme park crossed with a zoo.[4]Animal Kingdom has contributed to conservation causes by nursingendangered sea turtlesback to health, returning white rhinos to Africa and conducting a census ofcotton-top tamarins, a monkey species native to Colombia. In addition, since its creation in 1995, the Disney Wildlife Conservation Fund has given over $11 million to 650 conservation projects in 110 countries.[2]
After a long absence from nature documentaries, Disney decided to get back into the market after the French release ofMarch of the Penguins. The film was given U.S. distribution throughWarner Independent Picturesin 2005. Made on an $8 million budget, it grossed almost 10 times its budget at the U.S. box office and won theAcademy Award for Best Documentary Featurein 2006.[2]Jean-Francois Camilleri, head ofBuena Vista International Franceat the time, had the company acquire the film for the French market. Buena Vista International France also managed to obtain a 20% ownership stake in the French version of the film, butBuena Vista Pictures Distribution's bid to distribute the film in the U.S. ultimately failed.[6]Disney CEOBob Iger, in consideration of Disney's past efforts, felt thatPenguins"should have been a Disney film worldwide". This was the impetus behind the creation of Disneynature. The film's 2007 follow-up wasArctic Tale, which only took in $1.8 million worldwide.[2]Paul Baribault, Vice President of Disney Studios Marketing, led the US efforts for Disneynature from 2008 forward, overseeing all marketing, production, brand development, and conservation programmatic efforts for the label. He was eventually named general manager of Disneynature.
Disneynature was announced on April 21, 2008, a day beforeEarth Day, with a starting slate of seven films. Camilleri was set to head the new division. A multi-film production agreement was made withAlastair Fothergill,BBC'sPlanet Earthseries producer, for three scheduled films:Earth(2009),African Cats(2011) andChimpanzee(2012).[7]The other announced slate films and their release years were:The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos(2008),Oceans(2010),Orangutans: One Minute to Midnight(2010) andWings of Life(2011).[8]Original announced plans had the division releasing two films per year,[9]which was curtailed by April 2009 due to a nature film's long period needed to film wildlife.[4]No decision was made at that time as to whether or not the studio would donate the films' proceeds to conservation causes.[2]
The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingoswas the first film produced for Disneynature.[10]The first film released domestically under the new label wasEarth, opening on April 22, 2009, in the US.[2]In 2012, a Disneynature TV cable channel was launched in France. It is currently carried byFrance Telecom.[11]
Animal Planetpick up for a two-year period three Disneynature films,Oceans,African Cats, andThe Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos, in April 2012 fromDisney-ABC Domestic Television.[12]In April 2014,Jane Goodallwas named Disneynature ambassador.[13]
Disneynature has recently expanded to China with the production ofBorn in China. The production was made possible due to an expansion of Disney's relationship withShanghai Media Groupstarting in 2014.[14]FollowingBorn in China,Ghost of the MountainsandExpedition Chinawere released toNetflixto reflect the incredible journeys involved in creating these films. In 2016, the company released its first compilation film,Growing Up Wild,direct-to-video(Blu-rayandDVD) and video on demand.[15][16]
Paul Baribault, vice president of studio marketing and Disneynature, was appointed general manager of Disneynature officially in 2018, after having been operating in the capacity for several years. Camilleri resigned his posts with Disney in March 2019. Helene Etzi was appointed to take over his responsibility as head of Disney's French operations.

Throughout her career, Keener has developed a reputation for succeeding in complex roles,[5]often portraying desolate, bittersweet women "who come across as empty or unfulfilled in their relationships or their creative endeavors", effortlessly earning sympathy from audiences in both protagonist and antagonist roles.[22]DirectorRebecca Millersaid that Keener is "very good at playing disgruntled", a designation about which Keener explained, "Anger is not a bad thing"; she finds comfort in playing roles of this nature because "It doesn't go hand in hand with the mode of behaviour that's ladylike or proper or dignified."[23]Nate Williams ofComingSoon.netdeemed Keener "one of the most interesting performers in the game" as of 2019 due to her willingness "to embrace different roles", describing her as "A dramatic actor with no problem playing strange characters".[22]

Keener seldom gives interviews, believing that overexposure "becomes a dirty business".[4]The actress is known for being notoriously press-shy, and refuses to refer to herself as "famous" despite her success in the film industry.[4]In 2010,Inside Jerseycontributor Stephen Whitty observed that, throughout a decade of interviewing the actress, Keener had always been open to commenting about her collaborators, both directors and co-stars, but often refused to be interviewed about herself, considering her a shy person who values her privacy.[5]In 2014, theMontreal Gazettejournalist T'Cha Dunlevy selected Keener as his most memorable interview of the year, during which he admitted to mostly remembering laughing.[26]Dunlevy described the actress as "a consummate pro who has brought charisma and soul to projects ranging from" goofball comedies to blockbuster films.[26]Keener has continued to enjoy a reputation "as a both charming and well respected actress".[25]
Keener married actorDermot Mulroneyin 1990. They have a son, Clyde, born in 1999, who is a singer.[10]Mulroney filed for divorce in June 2007, citingirreconcilable differences[27]and the divorce became final on December 19, 2007.[28][29]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
