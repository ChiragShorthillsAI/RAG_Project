Apollo 10½: A Space Age Childhoodis a 2022 Americananimatedcoming of agecomedy-dramafilm set during the events preceding theApollo 11Moon landing, loosely based on the childhood of writer, director, and producerRichard Linklater. It presents a fictional tale of a fourth-grader who becomes the first person to land on the Moon and starsGlen Powell,Jack Black,Zachary LeviandJosh Wiggins.
Linklater, who originally got the idea for the film in 2004, was planning to create the film in live action but instead decided to go with an animation style influenced bySaturday morning cartoons, due to the playful nature of animation.Home moviescreated inHouston, Texasduring the 1960s were used for research, and some were also included in the film.Principal photographybegan in February 2020 atRobert Rodriguez'sTroublemaker StudiosinAustin, Texas, and wrapped in March 2020. Parts of the filming were done in front of the largestgreen screenin Texas and parts of the film, which were shot in live-action, were animated during post-production using a technique similar to therotoscopingused in Linklater'sWaking Life(2001) andA Scanner Darkly(2006).
Apollo 10½premiered atSouth by Southweston March 13, 2022, and was released in select theaters on March 24, 2022, before premiering onNetflixon April 1.[1]It received positive reviews, with praise for its writing, visuals, and nostalgic feel.
The film tells the story of thefirst Moon landingin the summer of 1969 from two interwoven perspectives. It captures both the astronaut and mission control view of the triumphant moment, and the lesser-seen bottom up perspective of what it was like from an excited kid's perspective, living near NASA but mostly watching it on TV like hundreds of millions of others. It is ultimately both an exacting re-creation of that special moment in history, and a kid's fantasy about being plucked from his average life in suburbia to secretly train for a covert mission to the Moon.

Richard Stuart Linklater(/ˈlɪŋkleɪtər/; born July 30, 1960)[2]is an American filmmaker. He is known for making films that deal thematically withsuburban cultureand the effects of thepassage of time. In 2015, Linklater was included on the annualTime100 list of the most influential people in the world.[3]
His films include the comediesSlacker(1990) andDazed and Confused(1993); theBeforetrilogyof romance films:Before Sunrise(1995),Before Sunset(2004), andBefore Midnight(2013); the music-themed comedySchool of Rock(2003); theadult animatedfilmsWaking Life(2001),A Scanner Darkly(2006), andApollo 10½: A Space Age Childhood(2022); the coming-of-age dramaBoyhood(2014); the comedy filmEverybody Wants Some!!(2016); and the romantic comedyHit Man(2023).
Many of Linklater's films are noted for their loosely structured narratives. TheBeforetrilogy andBoyhoodboth feature the same actors filmed over an extended period of years. He has received fiveAcademy Awardnominations and won theSilver Bear for Best DirectorforBefore Sunrise. He also won aGolden Globe Awardfor directingBoyhood.
Linklater was born inHouston, Texas, the son of Diane Margaret (née Krieger), who taught atSam Houston State University, and Charles W. Linklater, III.[4][5]He attendedHuntsville High SchoolinHuntsville, Texas, during grades 9–11, where he played football forJoe Clementsas a backup quarterback for the #1 ranked team in the state. For his senior year, he moved toBellaire High SchoolinBellaire, Texas, because he was better at baseball than football and Bellaire had a better baseball coach. As a teen he won aScholastic Art and Writing Award.[6][7]
Linklater studied atSam Houston State University(where he also played baseball),[8]until dropping out to work on anoffshore oil rigin theGulf of Mexico.
He frequently read novels on the rig, and upon returning to land, developed a love of film through repeated visits to arepertory cinemain Houston. At this point, Linklater realized he wanted to be a filmmaker. He used his savings to buy aSuper-8camera, a projector, and editing equipment, and moved toAustin, Texas.[9]
Linklater founded theAustin Film Societyin 1985 with his college professor Chale Nafus,University of Texasprofessor Charles Ramirez-Berg,SXSWfounderLouis Black, and his frequent collaboratorLee Daniel. One of the mentors for the Film Society was former New York City critic for theSoHo Weekly NewsGeorge Morris, who had relocated to Austin and taught film there.
For several years, Linklater made many short films that were exercises and experiments in film techniques. He finally completed his first feature,It's Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books(which is available inThe Criterion Collectionedition of his second feature,Slacker), a Super-8 feature that took a year to shoot and another year to edit.
Linklater created Detour Filmproduction (an homage to the1945 low budgetfilm noirbyEdgar G. Ulmer), and subsequently madeSlackerfor only $23,000. It went on to gross more than $1.25 million. The film shows an aimless day in the life of the city of Austin, Texas showcasing its more eccentric characters.
While gaining a cult following in theindependent filmworld, he made his third film,Dazed and Confused, based on his years at Huntsville High School and the people he encountered there. The film garnered critical praise and grossed $8 million in the United States while becoming a hit on VHS. This film was also responsible for the breakout of fellow Texas nativeMatthew McConaughey.
In 1995, Linklater won theSilver Bear for Best Directorfor the filmBefore Sunriseat the45th Berlin International Film Festival.[10]His next feature,subUrbia, had mixed reviews critically, and did very poorly at the box office. In 1998, he took on his first Hollywood feature,The Newton Boys, which received mixed reviews while tanking at the box office.
With therotoscopefilmsWaking LifeandA Scanner Darkly, and his mainstream comedies,School of Rockand the remake ofBad News Bears, he gained wider recognition.
In 2003, he wrote and directed a pilot forHBOwithRodney Rothmancalled$5.15/hr, about severalminimum wagerestaurant workers. The pilot deals with themes later examined inFast Food Nation.
The British television network Channel 4 produced a documentary about Linklater, in which the filmmaker discussed the personal and philosophical ideas behind his films.St Richard of Austinwas presented by Ben Lewis and directed byIrshad Ashrafand broadcast on Channel 4 in December 2004 in the UK.
Linklater was nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Adapted Screenplayfor his filmBefore Sunset.
Waking LifeandA Scanner Darklyboth usedrotoscopinganimation techniques. Working withBob Sabistonand Sabiston's programRotoshopto create this effect, Linklater shot and edited both movies completely as live-action features, then employed a team of artists to "trace over" individual frames. The result is a distinctive "semi-real" quality, praised by such critics asRoger Ebert(in the case ofWaking Life) as being original and well-suited to the aims of the film.
Fast Food Nation(2006) is an adaptation of the best selling book that examines the local and global influence of the United States fast food industry. The film was entered into the2006 Cannes Film Festival[11]before being released in North America on November 17, 2006, and in Europe on March 23, 2007. The film received mixed reviews.
Linklater fared better with the critics withA Scanner Darkly(released in the same year),Me and Orson Welles(2009), andBernie(2011).[12]
He was nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Adapted ScreenplayforBefore Midnight, the third film in theBefore...trilogy.[13]
In 2014 he released the filmBoyhood, which had been 12 years in the making.[14]Boyhoodreceived overwhelming critical acclaim. Linklater won theGolden Globes,Critics' Choice Movie Awards, andBAFTAsfor Best Director and Best Picture. He also received his first nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Director, along with nominations forBest Original ScreenplayandBest Picture.
For a while Linklater was attached to direct a remake ofThe Incredible Mr. LimpetforWarner Bros.[15]However, he dropped the project in favor of working on a spiritual successor toDazed and Confused, titledEverybody Wants Some!!,[15]with backing fromAnnapurna PicturesandParamountdistributing the film in North America.[16]The film was released in March 2016 and was well received by critics, but it failed to recoup its budget of 10 million dollars, grossing only 4.6 million.[17][18]
In the second half of the 2010s, Linklater wrote and directed the drama filmLast Flag Flying, starringBryan Cranston,Laurence Fishburne, andSteve Carell. A sequel toHal Ashby's 1973 filmThe Last Detail, it began filming in November 2016, and was released on November 3, 2017.[19]Linklater then directedWhere'd You Go, Bernadette, based on the novel byMaria Sempleand produced byAnnapurna Pictures.[20]
Linklater was attached to direct an adaptation ofGraeme Simsion's novelThe Rosie Projectthat would have starredJennifer Lawrencein the lead role, but he dropped out of directing when Lawrence dropped out of the project.[21]
In 2019, it was announced that Linklater would be filmingan adaptationofStephen Sondheim's musicalMerrily We Roll Along. LikeBoyhood, it will be filmed over the course of several years, but, like the musical andthe play it is based on, will be presented inreverse chronology.[22]
In 2024, Linklater directed an episode ofGod Save TexasforHBO, focusing on theprison industrial complexinHuntsville, Texas.[23]
Inspiration for Linklater's work was largely based on his experience viewing the filmRaging Bull.[24][25]
It made me see movies as a potential outlet for what I was thinking about and hoping to express. At that point I was an unformed artist. At that moment, something was simmering in me, butRaging Bullbrought it to a boil.[26]
He was also influenced byRobert Bresson,Yasujirō Ozu,Rainer Werner Fassbinder,Eric Rohmer,François Truffaut,Josef Von Sternberg, andCarl Theodor Dreyer.[27][28]
Many of Linklater's films, includingSlacker,Dazed and Confused,Tape, and all three installments of theBefore Trilogy, take place in a single day. They are less plot-driven and more about human interactions.[29]
Linklater lives inAustin, Texas, and refuses to live or work in Hollywood for any extended period of time.
Linklater has been partnered with Christina Harrison since the 1990s.[30]In 1994 they had a daughter, and twin girls in 2004. The oldest,Lorelei Linklater, co-starred inBoyhoodas the sister of the main character.
Linklater has been avegetariansince his early 20s.[31]In 2015, he explained the dietary lifestyle in aBoyhood-style documentary forPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.[32]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
