Aftersunis a 2022semi-autobiographicalcoming-of-agedrama filmwritten and directed byCharlotte Wellsin herfeature directorial debut. StarringPaul Mescal,Frankie Corio, andCelia Rowlson-Hall, the film is loosely based on Wells' childhood and follows an 11-year-old Scottish girl on holiday with her father at a Turkish resort on the eve of his 31st birthday.
Aftersunhad its world premiere at theCannes Film Festivalon 21 May 2022, where Wells was nominated for theCaméra d'Or. It was theatrically released in the United States on 21 October and in the United Kingdom on 18 November. The film received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the direction, screenplay, cinematography, visuals, and performances of Corio and Mescal.
Aftersunreceived four nominations at the76th BAFTA Awards, where Wells won forOutstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer.[3]Mescal was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Actorat the95th Academy Awards. TheNational Board of ReviewnamedAftersunone of the best films of 2022[4]andSight and Soundranked it first on its list of the best films of 2022.[5]Since then, it has been cited as among the best films of the 2020s.[6][7][8]
In 1999, Scottish 11-year-old Sophie Patterson travels to a Turkish holiday resort with her 30-year-old father, Calum, who moved to London after separating amicably from her mother. Sophie records the holiday on aMiniDVcamera, the footage of which is interspersed throughout the film. Over the course of the holiday, Sophie befriends and observes various teenage English tourists at the resort, often meeting and playing arcade games with a boy named Michael. Calum exhibits signs of depression, anxiety, and internal turmoil, which he tries to hide from Sophie beneath a facade of contentment. During his time alone, he practicestai chiand reads self-help books; he also smokes, which he hides from Sophie.
One day, Sophie and Calum go scuba diving and she loses her expensive scuba mask; Calum feigns nonchalance, but Sophie senses his actual feelings, says she knows the mask was expensive and comforts him. Calum later tells their diving instructor that he is surprised he has lived to be 30. Soon after, Calum and Sophie go to a rug shop, where she sees him grapple with the cost of one he likes. He declines to buy the rug, but later returns alone and buys it.
The next night, Sophie and Calum attend a karaoke night and Sophie signs them up for a song. Calum refuses to sing with Sophie despite her insistence, and she sings "Losing My Religion" alone as Calum watches. Upset by being left alone by him, Sophie refuses to return to their room with him and hangs out with some other tourists she previously met playing billiards. Michael creeps up on Sophie from behind, frightening her. They later kiss beside a pool. Meanwhile, Calum goes to the beach and walks into the ocean. When Sophie returns to their room, she finds him asleep naked and gently covers him with a sheet.
The two reconcile the next day while travelling to themud baths, and Calum apologises for his behaviour the previous night. Sophie surprises him by having other tourists sing "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow" for his 31st birthday. Calum watches stoically. He is shown sobbing in the hotel room alone, with a postcard addressed to Sophie that tells her he loves her on the floor.
On the last night of their holiday, Calum and Sophie dance to "Under Pressure" in a loving embrace. In the morning, at the airport, Calum waves goodbye and sends Sophie off on her flight home.
In the present day, the adult Sophie lives with her wife and young child. The rug Calum bought is next to their bed. Sophie watches the video footage from the holiday in Turkey.
Interspersed throughout the film are abstract, dreamlike sequences in which the adult Sophie stands in the middle of a crowded rave, catching glimpses of Calum dancing frantically through strobing lights. Throughout the sequences, Sophie attempts to get closer to him, eventually briefly embracing him; with their hands wrapped around each other, Calum ultimately falls from Sophie's grasp. In the final scene, Calum packs the videocamera away and walks down the airport hallway after having waved goodbye to Sophie, opening the doors to the rave.
Aftersunis director and writer Charlotte Wells' feature film debut. Calling it "emotionally autobiographical", she sought to delve into "a different period" in a relationship between a young parent and a daughter than what she explored in her 2015 debut short filmTuesday.[9]Frankie Corio was one of over 800 applicants before being cast.[9]Filming took place inÖlüdeniz, Turkey.[10]During the two-week rehearsal period Corio and Mescal spent time at a holiday resort in order to make their dynamic more authentic.[11]
Oliver Coateswrote and composed the film'soriginal score.
The film premiered as part ofCritics' Weekduring the2022 Cannes Film Festival,[13]where it won a jury prize.[14]It screened at theEdinburgh International Film Festival,[15]theMelbourne International Film Festival,[16]theTelluride Film Festival,[17]theToronto International Film Festival,[18]theLondon Film Festival,[19]theNew York Film Festival,[20]the New Hampshire Film Festival,[21]theAdelaide Film Festival,[22]and the Athens International Film Festival.[23]

The New York TimescriticA.O. Scottcalled the film "astonishing and devastating", writing that Wells was "very nearly reinventing the language of film, unlocking the medium's often dormant potential to disclose inner worlds of consciousness and feeling."[31]Screen Daily's Fionnuala Halligan wrote that Wells' "measured but relentless probing ... mark her out as one of the most promising new voices in British cinema in recent years".[32]Guy Lodge ofVarietycalled the film "sensuous, sharply moving".[33]Carlos Aguilar ofTheWrappraised Gregory Oke's "visually fluid" cinematography, saying it "evokes a radiant melancholia".[34]InEmpire, Beth Webb called the film a "deftly orchestrated, empathetic and honest character study" and "A triumph of new British filmmaking."[35]In 2023, filmmakerClaire Denissaid "Never before have I felt the power of a point of view that immerses us into gazes that dare to secretly spar in front of the lens of a small video camera. We are pulled in by the characters’ words too, which comprise a kind of game that slowly reveals the father to his almost adolescent daughter."[36]In 2024, filmmakerChristopher NolansaidAftersunis one of his favorite films, calling it "just a beautiful film".[37]
Several critics have pointed out the film's resonances with the work ofMargaret Tait; asMark KermodeofThe Guardianwrites, "There are also clear traces of the films of Margaret Tait in Wells's craft, specificallyBlue Black Permanent(1992), which seems to have served as a tonal reference (a volume of Tait's writings is prominently displayed on screen)."[38]In an interview, Wells acknowledged Tait's impact on her, particularlyBlue Black Permanent, saying, "It's a special film and it relates in many ways to what I was doing".[39]A copy of Tait'sPoems, Stories and Writingslies between a tai chi manual and a self-help book in Calum's pile of holiday readings. Pat Brown ofSlant Magazinecalled the film's "Under Pressure" sequence one of the best movie scenes of 2022, saying that it "brings to the surface what was kept simmering throughout: the searing pain of loss that's led Sophie to reflect on the past."[40]
In 2024,Colliderranked the film sixth on its list of the "30 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far)," with Jeremy Urquhart calling it "a film about growing up and reinterpreting who your parents are or were, as people, once you're old enough to see the world how they might've seen it when you were just a kid. Any descriptions of whatAftersunis about - or what emotions it inspires - ultimately undersell it. One really has to watch it and engage with it to feel and understand exactly what it's going for."Far Outranked the film 16th on its list of "The 21 Greatest Movies of the 21st Century", calling it "A poetic tale told with a marvelous understanding of cinematography" that "seems to define the contradictory contemporary world, where loneliness and detachment fester in a society that is technically more connected than ever".[6]Business Insiderincluded it on its list of the "25 Best British Movies of the Last Ten Years".[41]IndieWireranked a line spoken by Sophie ("I think it’s nice that we share the same sky") 10th on its list of the "22 Best Movie Quotes of 2022".[42]

During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, A24 was approved to continue filming and promotional activities since they do not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP).[57]
In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

A restructuring in 2007 integrated it into the main BBC Fiction department ofBBC Vision. As a result, it moved out of its independent offices intoBBC Television Centre, and Thompson left to start his own film production company.[7]BBC Film has been based atBroadcasting Housein London since 2013.[8]The company changed its name to BBC Film in 2020.[9][10]

TheBritish Film Institute(BFI) is a film and television charitable organisation which promotes and preserves film-making and television in the United Kingdom. The BFI uses funds provided by theNational Lotteryto encourage film production, distribution, and education. It is sponsored by theDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport,[2]and partially funded under theBritish Film Institute Act 1949.[3]
The BFI was established in 1933 to encourage the development of the arts of film, television and the moving image throughout the United Kingdom, to promote their use as a record of contemporary life and manners, to promote education about film, television and the moving image generally, and their impact on society, to promote access to and appreciation of the widest possible range of British andworld cinemaand to establish, care for and develop collections reflecting the moving image history and heritage of the United Kingdom.[4]
The BFI maintains the world's largestfilm archive, theBFI National Archive, previously calledNational Film Library(1935–1955), National Film Archive (1955–1992), and National Film and Television Archive (1993–2006). The archive contains more than 50,000 fiction films, over 100,000 non-fiction titles, and around 625,000 television programmes. The majority of the collection is British material but it also features internationally significant holdings from around the world. The Archive also collects films which feature key British actors and the work of British directors.[citation needed]
The BFI runs theBFI Southbank(formerly the National Film Theatre (NFT)) and theBFI IMAXcinema, both located on the south bank of theRiver Thamesin London.[5]The IMAX has the largest cinema screen in the UK and shows popular recent releases and short films showcasing its technology, which includes IMAX 70mm screenings, IMAX 3D screenings and 11,600 watts of digital surround sound.[6]BFI Southbank shows films from all over the world, particularly critically acclaimed historical and specialised films that may not otherwise get a cinema showing. The BFI also distributes archival and cultural cinema to other venues – each year to more than 800 venues all across the UK, as well as to a substantial number of overseas venues.[7]
The BFI offers a range of education initiatives, in particular to support the teaching of film and media studies in schools.[8]In late 2012, the BFI received money from theDepartment for Educationto create the BFI Film Academy Network for young people aged between 16 and 25.[9][10][11]A residential scheme is held at theNFTSevery year.
The BFI runs the annualLondon Film Festivalalong withBFI Flare: London LGBT Film Festivaland the youth-orientatedFuture Film Festival.[12]
The BFI publishes the monthlySight & Soundmagazine, as well as films onBlu-ray, DVD and books. It runs the BFI National Library (a reference library), and maintains theBFI Film & TV Databaseand Summary of Information on Film and Television (SIFT), which are databases of credits, synopses and other information about film and television productions. SIFT has a collection of about 7 millionstill framesfrom film and television.
The BFI has co-produced a number of television series featuring footage from the BFI National Archive, in partnership with theBBC, includingThe Lost World of Mitchell & Kenyon,The Lost World of Friese-GreeneandThe Lost World of Tibet.
The BFI has also produced contemporary artists' moving image work, most notably through the programme of theBFI Gallery, which was located atBFI Southbankfrom March 2007 to March 2011. The programme of the gallery resulted in several new commissions by leading artists, including projects which engaged directly with the BFI National Archive, among which arePatrick Keiller's 'The City of the Future',Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard's 'RadioMania: An Abandoned Work' and Deimantas Narkevicious' 'Into the Unknown'. The Gallery also initiated projects by film-makers such asMichael Snow,Apichatpong Weerasethakul,Jane and Louise WilsonandJohn Akomfrah.[13][14]
The BFI also operates a streaming service called BFI Player. This streaming service offers a variety of niche and art films.[15]
The institute was founded in 1933.[16]Despite its foundation resulting from a recommendation in a report onFilm in National Life, at that time the institute was a private company, though it has received public money throughout its history. This came from thePrivy Counciland Treasury until 1965, and from the various culture departments since then.
The institute was restructured following the Radcliffe Report of 1948, which recommended that it should concentrate on developing the appreciation of filmic art, rather than creating film itself. Thus control of educational film production passed to the National Committee for Visual Aids in Education and theBritish Film Academyassumed control for promoting production. From 1952 to 2000, the BFI provided funding for new and experimental film-makers via theBFI Production Board.
The institute received aroyal charterin 1983. This was updated in 2000, and in the same year the newly establishedUK Film Counciltook responsibility for providing the BFI's annual grant-in-aid (government subsidy). As an independent registered charity, the BFI is regulated by theCharity Commissionand the Privy Council.
In 1988, the BFI opened the LondonMuseum of the Moving Image(MOMI) on theSouth Bank. MOMI was acclaimed internationally and set new standards for education through entertainment, but it did not receive the high levels of continuing investment that might have enabled it to keep pace with technological developments and ever-rising audience expectations. The museum was "temporarily" closed in 1999 when the BFI stated that it would be re-sited. This did not happen, and MOMI's closure became permanent in 2002 when it was decided to redevelop the South Bank site. This redevelopment was itself then further delayed.
The BFI is currently managed on a day-to-day basis by its chief executive, Ben Roberts. Supreme decision-making authority rests with a chair and a board of up to 15 governors. The current chair isJay Hunt, a television executive, who took up the post in February 2024.[17]Governors, including the Chair, are appointed by theSecretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.
The BFI operates with three sources of income. The largest is public money allocated by theDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport. For the year 2021–22, the BFI received £74.31m from the DCMS as Grant-in-Aid funding.[18]The second largest source is commercial activity such as receipts from ticket sales at BFI Southbank or the BFI London IMAX theatre (£5m in 2007), sales of DVDs, etc. Thirdly, grants and sponsorship of around £5m are obtained from various sources, includingNational Lotteryfunding grants, private sponsors and through donations (J. Paul Getty, Jr., who died in 2003, left the BFI a legacy of around £1m in his will). The BFI is also the distributor for all Lottery funds for film (in 2011–12 this amounted to c.£25m).[citation needed]
As well as its work on film, the BFI also devotes a large amount of its time to the preservation and study of British television programming and its history. In 2000, it published a high-profile list of the100 Greatest British Television Programmes, as voted for by a range of industry figures.[citation needed]
The delayed redevelopment of the National Film Theatre finally took place in 2007, creating in the rebranded "BFI Southbank" new education spaces, a contemporary art gallery dedicated to the moving image[19](theBFI Gallery), and a pioneering mediatheque which for the first time enabled the public to gain access, free of charge, to some of the otherwise inaccessible treasures in the National Film & Television Archive. The mediatheque has proved to be the most successful element of this redevelopment, and there are plans to roll out a network of them across the UK.[citation needed]
An announcement of a £25 million capital investment in the Strategy for UK Screen Heritage was made by Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport at the opening night of the 2007 London Film Festival. The bulk of this money paid for long overdue development of the BFI National Archive facilities in Hertfordshire and Warwickshire.[citation needed]
During 2009, theUK Film Councilpersuaded the government that there should only be one main public-funded body for film, and that body should be the UKFC, while the BFI should be abolished. In 2010, the government announced that there would be a single body for film. Despite intensive lobbying (including, controversially, using public funding to pay public relations agencies to put its case forward), the UKFC failed to persuade the government that it should have that role and, instead, the BFI took over most of the UKFC's functions and funding from 1 April 2011, with the UKFC being subsequently abolished. Since then, the BFI has been responsible for all Lottery funding for film—originally in excess of £25m p.a., and currently in excess of £40m p.a.[citation needed]
The BFI Film Academy forms part of the BFI's overall 5–19 Education Scheme. The programme is being supported by theDepartment for Educationin England who have committed £1m per annum funding from April 2012 and 31 March 2015. It is also funded through theNational Lottery,Creative ScotlandandNorthern Ireland Screen.
On 29 November 2016, the BFI announced that over 100,000 television programmes are to bedigitisedbefore the video tapes, which currently have an estimated five-to-six-year shelf life, become unusable. The BFI aims to make sure that the television archive is still there in 200 years' time.[20]
The BFI announced in February 2021 that it is teaming up with American diversity and inclusion program #StartWith8Hollywood founded byThuc Doan Nguyento make it global.[21]
The BFI is currently chaired byJay Huntand run by CEO Ben Roberts and deputy CEO Harriet Finney.

Charlotte Wells(born 13 June 1987) is a Scottish director, writer, and producer. She is known for her feature film debutAftersun(2022),[1]which premiered in 2022 duringCritics' WeekatCannes Film Festival, receiving 121 nominations and 33 awards, includingGothamandBritish Independent Film Awards.[2]Wells has worked on numerous other films, such asBlue Christmas(2017), and her films have screened at festivals worldwide.
Wells was born in Edinburgh. She attended secondary school at the independentGeorge Heriot's School.[3]Wells did not live with her father, who died when she was 16,[4]but remembers him as a very involved parent, despite the living situation. The father-daughter dynamic was a frequent topic of conversation after her first feature-film debutAftersun, a film about a father and daughter.
Wells was interested in film from a young age, but did not initially pursue it. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Classics from King's College London and a Master of Arts from Oxford University. She went into finance and rediscovered film through helping Callum Just, a school friend, run Digital Orchard, a post-production and DIT agency.[5]She used this experience to apply to New York University's joint business and film graduate program with the intention of becoming a producer. She completed a dual Master of Fine Arts and Master of Business Administration atTisch School of the Artsand theStern School.
While at NYU, Wells created three short films:Tuesday(2015), about a 16-year-old learning to cope with a big loss, featuring Megan McGill, which earned Wells the Best Writer Nominee at BAFTA Scotland New Talent Awards 2016;[6]Laps(2016), about a normal weekday, until the main character is sexually assaulted on the New York subway, featuring Thea Brooks, which earned Wells Special Jury Recognition at the SXSW Short Film Awards and Special Jury Award for Editing at Sundance 2017;[7]andBlue Christmas(2017), about a debt collector who goes to work instead of seeing his wife on Christmas Eve to avoid her worsening psychosis, featuring Jamie Robson andMichelle Duncan.[8]
Before starting her career in the film industry as a producer, Wells helped run Digital Orchard, a company specialising in film, finishing images, developing film and digital imaging. Wells was a fellow at the 2020Sundance InstituteScreenwriters and Directors Labs with her feature film debutAftersun, which premiered at the2022 Cannes Film Festivalto critical acclaim. The film is a drama starringPaul MescalandFrankie Corio. She received many accolades as a breakthrough director and appeared on numerous year-end lists.Aftersunreceived anAcademy Awardnomination forPaul Mescal's performance.[9]
Aftersunis a coming-of-age drama that tells the story of a young woman, Sophie, recalling a holiday she took with her father, Calum (Paul Mescal), 20 years earlier, for Calum's 31st birthday. The 11-year-old Sophie (Frankie Corio) does not spend much time with her father, who does not live with her and her mother. The time they spend on this holiday is precious to them. They go to a Turkish budget resort, where Calum struggles with depression. The adult Sophie is trying to remember her father by looking back on this holiday and piece together her memories with the help of the videos she and he took on vacation.
The film is shot on35mmfilm and partly by the actors themselves on aMiniDVcamera.[10]This camera is used for many of the scenes with Sophie during the holiday, including playing with friends at the resort and spending time with her father. The 35mm footage is spread throughout the film to intimately depict the father-daughter dynamic from Sophie's perspective. While Calum struggles with depression, Sophie struggles with living apart from him. Adult Sophie is, as she was when she was young, slowly figuring out who her father was as a person, not just a father.
The film's subject matter sparked conversation about Wells' personal life. Her father died when she was 16 and she lived apart from him, though she did not feel that he was uninvolved with her upbringing.[4]The father-daughter dynamic was not something Wells was initially trying to uncover in the film, but rather arose during its making. The first goal was to show how a relationship can shift over time.[4]Aftersunreceived 121 nominations, including a nomination forBest Actorat the2023 Academy Awardsfor Mescal's performance.[11]TheNational Board of Reviewnamed the film the Best Directorial Debut of 2022.[12]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
