Several years ago,Frylockmoved out of the house in frustration. Sometime later,MeatwadandMaster Shakealso had to leave and are now separated and homeless.
Frylock works at the IT department of megacompanyAmazin, which is led by reclusive and diminutive owner Neil from hisllama-shaped skyscraperLlama Dolly, rumored to be a functioningspaceship. One day Frylock is summoned to Neil, who explains that he wishes to become taller. He has a scientist assistant, Elmer, who had no success in that regard and who is shown (seemingly also without success) working on creating plants with human-like intelligence. Neil requests Frylock to repair one of Elmer's stretching machines, but Frylock suggestsDNAsplicing toclonea larger version of Neil, who enthusiastically agrees.
Later that night, Frylock is attacked by muggers and badly mutilated, before he is rescued by Neil and Elmer. Since Frylock's old shell is destroyed in the attack, he is given a new metal shell by Neil and Elmer, who admire the crystal that is attached to Frylock and powers him. During his convalescence, it seems that a friendship develops between him and Neil.
After several failed experiments, Frylock can splice the DNA of agiraffeand formerbasketballplayerShawn Kempinto Neil's, which creates an extremely tall clone. The clone calls himselfBig Neiland immediately usurps Neil's position, locking him inside a wooden box.
Meanwhile, Master Shake and Meatwad arrive in short succession at former neighborCarl'shouse, asking to crash with him. Carl only lets them stay in his backyard.
Amazin has sent out scores of packages to addresses all over the United States. When Carl tried to steal the packages that arrived in his neighborhood, he noticed that most of them were empty. Meatwad and Shake use the empty boxes to build provisional homes in Carl's backyard. When Carl'ssprinklerturns on and soaks the boxes, they turn into plant creatures that attack and almost kill Shake, Meatwad, and Carl. They can contact Frylock when they learn that he works at Amazin and try to warn him, but he is unwilling to hear their story. When Frylock returns to Amazin, Big Neil, and Elmer fire all workers, two alien races called the Japongaloids and the Fraptaculans, whom Neil had enslaved using the Llama Dolly, which is revealed to be a powerful spaceship.
Big Neil and Elmer plan to replace the aliens with the plant creatures Elmer has finally successfully developed by synthesizing Frylock's crystal. Neil comments that he only got close to Frylock to obtain access to his crystal and that all Amazin packaging consists solely of seeds, which develop into the creatures when they are watered. When a storm creates the plant creatures all over the land and they seem to overwhelm the humans, Big Neil fires Elmer and wants to kill the creatures withpesticide. Elmer consumes plant seeds and drinks some water to transform into a giant treelike human/plant hybrid, takes control of the plant creatures, and attacks Big Neil and Neil, who flee in Llama Dolly.
Frylock rushes to Shake and Meatwad and helps them defend themselves from the plant creatures. When they are about to be overwhelmed, Carl arrives with his car and takes them in. They flee toUsed Babywipe Mountain, the only place inNew Jerseyabove thetree line, where they are safe from the plant creatures. Llama Dolly also arrives there and Frylock and the two Neils hatch a plan to exterminate the plant creatures: they will fly Llama Dolly to theMoonand push itin frontof theSun, which will deprive the plant creatures of sunlight and kill them. On the Moon, their ship is attacked by theMooninites' ship. When it is about to lose the fight, Frylock frees Neil from his box because he is the only one able to fully operate the ship. They defeat the Mooninites and push the Moon in front of the Sun.
While this is happening, Carl, Shake, and Meatwad create aMad Max-like car and attack the plant creatures with it. After some initial successes, they are about to get overwhelmed when the Japongaloids and the Fraptaculans join the battle, evening the odds. When the moon is finally pushed in front of the sun, all plant creatures, including Elmer, die, but the Earth starts to freeze over.
When the Neils return to Earth, they are immediately brutally killed by the Japongaloids and the Fraptaculans, who then ask themselves what to eat now that the Earth is freezing over. Carl mentions that the Aqua Teens are made of food, which leads to the Japongaloids and the Fraptaculans devouring them.
In apost-credits scene, a dying Master Shake is bitten byMarkula, turning him into a vampire bat and screaming, "I smell a sequel!"
There has been talk of producing asequeltoColon Movie Film for TheaterstitledDeath Fighter.[2]While little has been confirmed by Adult Swim in regards to the film, there have been many statements regarding it. On December 15, 2008, Willis stated no script was written and that the film would be released in Spring 2009 (though, as he also stated that Death Fighter was a T-shirt he was working on, he likely wasn't being serious).[3]Following this, in an April 2009 interview, Willis joked about the film lacking any sort of funding and being sold out of the back of his car.[4]
In a 2010 interview,Radical Axisstaff statedDeath Fighterwas in production, and mentioned the possibility that the film might be made in3-D. When asked if the film was designed for a theatrical release, a Radical Axis staff member responded yes, but stated: "We're not sure if we have a distributor yet", though this was then followed by the statement that "Adult Swim will never make another movie ever again".[5]
In 2014, Willis claimed that the script had been completed & approved and that the film would be released sometime in mid-2015, then jokingly stated that the film was shelved as it was not G-rated;[6][7]however, on April 25, 2015, at a C2CE convention panel, Willis indirectly stated that the project was scrapped, soon after announcing the series' cancellation.[8][9]He later mentioned onRedditthat it would need a $3.4 million budget, and expressed interest in funding viaKickstarter. He reportedly stated that release could happen within the next two years.[10]
A new film was confirmed to be in production in May 2021, with no further details confirmed aside from it beingdirect-to-video.[11]

The company was founded in 1978 and launched in the United States with twenty films onBetamaxandVHSvideocassettes in late 1979. The company later expanded its line to include additional titles throughout 1979 and 1980.
Warner Bros. began to branch out into the videodisc market, licensing titles to MCADiscoVisionand RCA'sSelectaVisionvideodiscformats, allowing both companies to market and distribute the films under their labels.[4][5]By 1985, Warner was releasing material under their own label in both formats. Titles from Warner Home Video were and continue to be distributed and manufactured byRoadshow Home Videoworldwide except for Australia and New Zealand because of its film counterpart's films released byVillage Roadshow.[6]
Warner also experimented with the "rental-only" market for videos, a method also used by20th Century Foxfor their first release ofStar Warsin 1982. Two known films released in this manner wereSuperman IIandExcalibur. Other films released for rental use includeDirty Harry,The Enforcer,Prince of the City, andSharky's Machine. In 1990, Warner Home Video acquired the worldwide home video rights to theMGM/UAcatalog. The $125 million purchase was used to finance MGM/UA's acquisition by thePathé Communications Corporation.[7]The intended 12½-year-long deal was cut short in February 2000, with MGM paying Warner Home Video $225 million to regain video rights to a number of its films. In exchange, Warner Home Video gained full control over the video rights to MGM's pre-May 1986 library, an asset the studio had acquired outright fromTurner Entertainment Co., but due to a pre-existing licensing deal with MGM, was originally expected to expire in 2001.[8]
On December 20, 1996, Warner Home Video was one of the first major American distributors for the then-newDVDformat, by releasing the filmsAssassins,Blade Runner: Director's Cut,Eraser, andThe Fugitiveon DVD in Japan and on March 24, 1997, in the United States withBlade Runneralso being a launch title for the region there.[9]Warner Bros. executiveWarren Lieberfarbis often seen as "the father of DVD". Lieberfarb's successor, Warner Bros. executiveJames F. Cardwellwas recognized in paving the way for WHV's strategic positioning in next generation technologies such as High Definition DVD (HD DVD), electronic sell-through and portable video. In 2003, Warner Home Video became the first home video releasing company to release movies only on DVD with no VHS equivalent.
In 2009, Warner Home Video introduced theWarner Archive Collection, which allows the public to order custom-made DVDs of rarely seen films and TV series from the Warner and Turner libraries. The films are also available as digital downloads. Warner Archive DVDs and downloads can be ordered online on Warner's website, onAmazon.comor one-timeTurner Classic Movies-affiliated DVD website MoviesUnlimited.com.[10]
On June 30, 2020, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment regained the home video rights to theMGMcatalog after 21 years.
Starting in 2022, due to the finalization of the Warner Bros. Discovery merger, WBHE started distributing the television libraries of Discovery-owned networks including the flagshipDiscovery ChannelandAnimal Planet.
On January 14, 2020, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment andUniversal Pictures Home Entertainmentannounced that they would partner on a 10-year multinational joint-venture. In North America, their physical distribution operations were merged into a company named Studio Distribution Services, LLC.[11]Internationally, Universal will distribute Warner Bros.' titles in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan; while Warner will distribute Universal's titles in the United Kingdom (until 2025), Italy (until 2024) and Benelux.[12]On April 7, 2020, the European Commission approved the merger.[13]Since June 1, 2021,[14][15][16]SDS' logo took the WBHE logo's place on the back covers of the home releases; while there have been several exceptions that had the WBHE logo in place, mainlymanufactured on demandtitles including4K[17][18](also steelbooks)[19][20][21][22][23][24][25]andBlu-rayreleases.[26][27][28][29][30]It is unknown whenever SDS uses an on-screen logo; as Warner releases by SDS use the 2017–present Warner Bros. Home Entertainment logo.
On June 24, 2024, it was reported thatSony Pictures Home Entertainmenthad entered into a distribution deal with SDS to handle the physical distribution of titles fromSony Pictures(Columbia Pictures,TriStar Pictures,Screen Gems,Crunchyroll, LLC, etc.) as well as those fromWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment(Walt Disney Pictures,Marvel Studios,Lucasfilm Ltd.,20th Century Studios,Searchlight Pictures, etc.),Lionsgate Home Entertainment(Lionsgate Films,Summit Entertainment,eOne Films,Roadside Attractions, etc.) andThe Criterion Collectionthrough their existing distribution deals with SPHE.[31]

Williams Street Productions, LLC,[1](formerly known asGhost Planet Industries) is an American animation and live action television production studio owned by theWarner Bros. Television Studiosdivision ofWarner Bros., a unit ofWarner Bros. Discovery. The studio is the in-house production arm ofAdult Swim(theprogramming blockonCartoon Network).Mike LazzoandKeith Croffordoversaw operations for the building for most of its existence.
On December 16, 2019, co-founder Lazzo retired from the company,[2]with business partner and co-founder Crofford retiring the following year.[3]Michael Ouweleenwas named president of Adult Swim on April 29, 2020.[4]
From November 27, 2019 to July 1, 2020 and since May 13, 2022, Ouweleen was named president ofThe Cartoon Network, Inc., which also overseesAdult Swim.[5]
In 1976,Ted Turnerbought the building and used it for his own television station, WTCG. This new channel was the result of a recent UHF takeover. In December 1976, the first WTCG signal was beamed via satellite to its four cable systems located aroundGeorgia. This broadcast was the first use of non-pay-service satellite transmission, an innovation that would come to revolutionize basic cable nationwide.
Starting out as a minor local channel, the station grew into success and was re-launched as WTBS in 1979. Then, after a five-year period, WTBS was renamedTBS Superstation. During this time, Turner also createdCNN, a 24-hour news network. Both became the standard for cable providers by the late 80s. Due to this success, the studio building became too small to operate as a headquarters. A new campus was built across the street for the expanding Turner empire. Upon completion, Turner launchedCartoon Networkto showcase their recent acquisitions of the vastMGMandHanna-Barberalibrary of cartoons.
When Turner moved out of the Williams Street building, they kept ownership, using it as a storage facility. Although no longer its main purpose, to this day, Williams Street houses all the show tapes for Turner Networks. Appointed to run the building were veteran Turner employees such asKeith Crofford,Andy Merrill, and former mail-room employeeMike Lazzo. Although Cartoon Network was run at Hanna-Barbera Studios at the time, certain duties were eventually controlled by the trio at Williams Street. One of their most important early tasks was producing host segments forThe Moxy Pirate Show(laterThe Moxy Show).
From 1990 to 1993, TBS had started its own original programming such asCaptain Planetand2 Stupid Dogs. This interested the team at Williams Street, and they all wished to create their own series. Towards the end of '93, the three mustered up courage to approach Ted Turner with their ideas for Cartoon Network original programming. It didn't go as planned and they were eventually kicked out of Ted's office. According to Lazzo, they were clearly told that unless CN started making more money for Turner, they wouldn't be allowed funding or a chance. They didn't listen.
They decided to produce their own series pilot. On a shoestring budget, they tried to come up with compatible ideas. During brainstorming, they realized they could simply re-use footage of any animation in the Turner library. They eventually settled onSpace Ghost and Dino Boy. Because they felt it would fit, they paired it with Mike Lazzo's idea of a satirical talk show with a clueless host asking guests a stream of stupid questions. The final pilot featured rotoscoped animation superimposed on a simple background and used CNN interview footage for the live-action interview.
They went back to Turner and presented the pilot, andSpace Ghost Coast to Coastwas then greenlit for a ten-episode season. Work began, and the minor CN production/storage facility became its own studio, named afterCoast to Coast's own in-show one: Ghost Planet Industries. Soon the series was acquiring its first C and D-list celebrity guests, small animation and writing crew, and voice actors. The voice actor forSpace Ghostwas local voice actorGeorge Lowe; all other roles were done by the GPI crew. The series eventually premiered on April 14, 1994. This marked Cartoon Network's first original series and the first animated talk show in history.
Due to its more mature surreal humor, the series attracted a devoted cult audience. Its success led to a special that was simulcast on TBS, a special short for VHS release of blockbusterThe Mask, and much more famous guests. In the height of popularity, it was awarded its own spin-off. Turner commissioned GPI to produce some sort of lighter version for TBS, due to a need for children's programming.Cartoon Planetpremiered on TBS in 1995 and later moved to Cartoon Network in 1996. The series featured Space Ghost hosting segments and cartoons for young viewers. After two seasons, TBS decided to cancel all kids' programming, following the trend ofTNTandUSA.
The current name of the company originates from the location of its headquarters building (which is also the home office forCartoon NetworkandAdult Swim) at 1065 Williams Street NW inAtlanta,Georgianear the current offices ofTBSandTNTon Techwood Drive.[6]The facility began as a carpet factory and was purchased by Turner as overflow offices for, among other things, set building and woodworking facilities, as well as CNN Field Engineering. Soon after CNN moved into theCNN Centerin downtown Atlanta in the early 1980s, other Turner operations moved into the Techwood campus, an old country club which became the first headquarters forCNN.[6]The street is named for early Atlanta settlerAmmi Williams.
The company's original name, Ghost Planet Industries, came fromSpace Ghost's fictional planet, where the animatedtalk showSpace Ghost Coast to Coastwas purportedly filmed.[7]
The studio'sproduction logofeatures a wavy, blurred gray image of Space Ghost's fictional studio, with the words "Williams Street" beneath it. The soundtrack ofJack Webb'sMark VII Limited's production logo (a rumbling drum roll and two clinks of ahammer) is often used while the GPI/Williams Street production card is shown.[8]
This list is only for video games licensed by Williams Street Games; seeAdult Swim Gamesfor other video games produced after the label's dissolution.
Williams Street formed their own music label,Williams Street Records. The label was created after Jason DeMarco, Adult Swim's vice president of strategic marketing and promotions, worked onDanger Doom, a project withDanger MouseandMF Doomin 2005. Danger Mouse had previously worked on the music forToonamiand wanted to do an album that sampled that work. The group suggested the idea to Mike Lazzo; the project was successful. Williams Street Records now releases a majority of the music related to their shows. The label is managed by DeMarco.[38]
1065, the street number for Williams Street, is also the hull number forFishCenter Live's USSFishCenterprise(a parody of theoriginalStar Trek'sUSSEnterprise).[39]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
