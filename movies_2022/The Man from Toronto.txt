Teddy Jackson is a struggling fitness entrepreneur inYorktown, Virginiawho is fired from his job at a local gym for giving ad brochures without the gym's address. He decides not to tell his wife Lori and takes her toOnancockfor her birthday. Leaving her at a spa, Teddy arrives at the wrong cabin, where a man named Coughlin is being held hostage. Mistaken for "The Man fromToronto", a mysterious assassin with a talent for brutal interrogation, the clueless Teddy manages to intimidate Coughlin into giving up a code. The cabin is raided by theFBI, who convinces Teddy to pose as the Man from Toronto to help capture would-be Venezuelan dictator Colonel Marín in exchange for the FBI paying off his overdue mortgage.
Much to Teddy's jealousy, an agent is assigned to accompany Lori and her friend Anne on a day of luxury inWashington, D.C., telling them the trip has been provided by Teddy's job. As Toronto, Teddy meets Marín's wife Daniela, who flies him toSan Juan, Puerto Ricowith orders to identify Green, Coughlin's partner, and bring him to the Colonel in D.C. En route, Teddy is ambushed by the Man from Toronto, whose real name is Randy. Planning to complete the $2 million contract by maintaining the ruse that Teddy is Toronto, Randy informs his Handler, who sends another assassin, the Man from Miami. Randy and Teddy arrive at a tech conference where Marín's men have captured Green's research team. Randy guides Teddy through interrogating the hostages; accidentally stabbing one of the men in the eye, Teddy vomits all over him and another hostage, who admits he is Green.
Green explains that he and Coughlin worked forDARPAdeveloping a seismic bomb with a dual failsafe — Coughlin's code and Green'sthumbprint— but realized they were working on behalf of Marín, who plans to use the weapon to assassinate thePresident of Venezueladuring a visit to D.C. Teddy leaves the room while Randy cuts off Green's thumb and they are attacked by the Man from Miami, but manage to subdue him and escape. They return to D.C. to attend Lori's birthday dinner, where Randy finds himself connecting with Anne. Miami steals the thumb, which he and the Handler deliver to Marín. Teddy and Randy crash the deal and the FBI arrives; Randy flees with the $2 million, while Miami and the Handler escape. The FBI discovers that the thumb belonged to Marín's henchman as Randy chose not to let Marín arm the weapon. Teddy returns home to find Lori has gone to stay with her mother, having learned that he lost his job and lied to her.
Racing to stop her, Teddy is nearly killed by Miami, but Randy intervenes. They fight off several other assassins summoned by the Handler, who arrives demanding the money. She pursues them into a warehouse, where Teddy unintentionally drops her into a vat of boiling oil, frying her alive. Teddy is confronted by a final assassin, the Man from Tokyo, but Randy dispatches him with "Debora", his beloved 1969Dodge Charger. Taking the car, Teddy reconciles with Lori at the train station, but parks on the tracks, and the car along with the money are destroyed by a train. A year later, Randy has followed through on his dream of opening his restaurant and is in a relationship with Anne. Teddy declares Randy as his partner in his new online gym, presenting him with a small payment toward replacing Debora, but Randy later calls Teddy during a live stream workout to threaten him.

Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.is an American diversifiedmultinationalmass media andentertainmentstudioconglomeratethat produces, acquires, and distributes filmed entertainment (theatrical motion pictures, television programs, and recorded videos) through multiple platforms. Through an intermediate holding company called Sony Film Holding Inc., it is operated as a subsidiary ofSony Entertainment Inc., which is itself a subsidiary of the multinational holding conglomerateSony Group Corporation.[4][5]
Based at theSony Pictures Studioslot inCulver City, California, as one of the"Big Five" major American film studios, it encompasses Sony'smotion picture,television productionanddistributionunits. All of SPE's divisions are members of theMotion Picture Association(MPA).[6]Sony's film franchises includeThe Karate Kid,Ghostbusters,Jumanji,Men in Black,Spider-Man, andSony'sSpider Manuniverse.
On September 1, 1987,the Coca-Cola Companyannounced plans to spin offColumbia Pictures, which it had owned since 1982. Under this arrangement, Coca-Cola would sell its entertainment assets (Coca-Cola's Entertainment Business Sector) toTriStar Pictures, of which it owned 39.6%. Tri-Star would be renamed Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. (CPE), with Coca-Cola owning 49%, its shareholders owning 31%, and Tri-Star's shareholders owning 20%.[7][8]As part of a merger plan, the two television businesses, comprising Columbia/Embassy Television andTri-Star Television, merged altogether to form a new incarnation of the originalColumbia Pictures Television.[9]
The merger enabled three top Tri-Star executives, namely Arnold Messner, who ranTri-Star Telecommunications, Victor A. Kaufman, who ran the main Tri-Star Pictures studio, andScott Siegler, who ranTri-Star Televisionto stay on, while four of the Coca-Cola Entertainment Business Sector departed, namelyBarbara Corday, who ranColumbia/Embassy Televisionas president, Herman Rush and Peter Seale, who ranCoca-Cola Telecommunications, and Brian McGrath, who was the president of the Coca-Cola Entertainment Business Sector.[10]In early December 1987, former Coke EBS vice president Kenneth Lemberger exited the post to joinTri-Star Pictures, displacing Roger Faxon, who had joined Columbia Pictures as senior vice president of the studio.[11]
The merger was approved by shareholders on December 15, 1987, and it was completed two days later. Columbia and Tri-Star brands would be used as separate and autonomous production entities, and would be part of CPE whole, along with the prior assets, units and commitments of the former Coca-Cola Entertainment Business Sector, which included all feature, TV, home video, and pay cable operations as well as the Entertainment Sector's feature production deal withNelson Entertainmentand its investment inCastle Rock Entertainment, andTeleVentures; a company it continues to own, which was linked to three independent companies:Tri-Star Pictures,Stephen J. Cannell ProductionsandWitt/Thomas Productions.Merv Griffin Enterprisescontinue to function as a separate operation.[12]A new company was formed in early 1988 with the Tri-Star name to take over the studio's operations.[13]
In early January 1988, CPE announced that they would revive the Triumph branding for the new worldwide subsidiary,Triumph Releasing Corporation, which was functioned as a theatrical distributor, marketing and promotion forColumbiaandTri-Starfilms, and named Patrick N. Williamson as president of the unit and the company provided administrative services related to distribution of its films in North America, while internationally, would be responsible for the direction of each studio.[14]
On September 28, 1989,Sonyobtained an option to purchase all ofThe Coca-Cola Company's stock (approximately 54 million shares or 49% of the outstanding shares) in CPE for $27 per share.[15]The next day, Sony also announced that it reached an agreement with Guber-Peters Entertainment Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: GPEC; formerlyBarris Industries, Inc.) to acquire CPE for $200 million when Sony hiredPeter GuberandJon Petersto be its co-chairmen.[16]This was all led byNorio Ohga, who was the president and CEO of Sony during that time.[17]
The hiring of Guber and Peters by Sony to run Columbia was conflicted by a previous contract the producers had signed atWarner Bros.Time Warner's chairman,Steve Ross, threatened Sony with a lawsuit forbreach of contract. The lawsuit would be subsequently dropped when Sony sold half-interest inColumbia Houseand cable distribution rights to Columbia's feature films, TV movies, and miniseries to Warner Bros. That same agreement also saw Columbia sell its 35% interest in the Burbank Studios and acquiredLorimar Studios, previously theMGMlot, from Warner Bros.[18][19]
On October 31, 1989, Sony completed a friendlytakeoverbid for the rest of shares (51%) of CPE, which was a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: KPE), and acquired 99.3% of the common stock of the company. On November 8, 1989, Sony completed the acquisition by a "short-form" merger of its wholly owned subsidiary Sony Columbia Acquisition Corporation into CPE under theDelaware General Corporation Law. Sony also completed a tender offer for shares of common stock of the Guber-Peters Entertainment Company on November 6, 1989, and acquired the company 3 days later. The acquisition cost Sony $4.9 billion ($3.55 billion for shares and $1.4 billion of long-term debt) and was backed (financed) by five major Japanese banksMitsui,Tokyo,Fuji,MitsubishiandIndustrial Bank of Japan.[20][21][22]
The company was renamed as Sony Pictures Entertainment on August 7, 1991.[23][24]Also that year, Jon Peters left Columbia to start Peters Entertainment with a three-year exclusive production agreement at the studio at first, before transitioning to a non-exclusive deal at the studio.[25]Longtime CPE employeeLaurie MacDonaldalso left to start Aerial Pictures at the studio, first for a two-year deal, before going to20th Century Foxin 1993, and being swallowed up byAmblin Entertainmentlater that year, eventually setting upDreamWorks.[26]
Sony has since created numerous other film production and distribution units, such as creatingSony Pictures Classicsfor art-house fare, by forming Columbia TriStar Pictures (also known as the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group) by merging Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures in 1998, revitalizing Columbia's former television division Screen Gems.
This in effect re-united the MGM studio name, with the MGM main studio lot, although somewhat confusingly, the bulk of the pre-May 1986 original MGM library ended up at Time Warner via theTed Turner-Kirk Kerkorian"Turner Entertainment Co." transactions. The post-April 1986 MGM library consists of acquisitions of various third-party libraries, such as the Orion Pictures catalogue, leading to MGM's2014 remake ofRoboCop.
In July 2000, a marketing executive working for Sony Corporation created a fictitious film critic,David Manning, who gave consistently good reviews for releases from Sony subsidiaryColumbia Picturesthat generally received poor reviews amongst real critics.[27]Sony later pulled the ads, suspended Manning's creator and his supervisor and paid fines to the state of Connecticut[28]and to fans who saw the reviewed films in the US.[29]

On January 22, 2014, SPE folded its technology unit into the various cores of its businesses.[41]In April, Sony Pictures arranged a film financing deal worth $200 million withLStar Capital, the credit venture of Lone Star Capital andCitibank, half in debt and the other in equity to fund most of SPE's film slate for several years. SPE was originally considering a $300 million deal with Blue Anchor Entertainment, led by Bloom Hergott partner John LaViolette and former investment banker & producer Joseph M.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
