The Bubbleis a 2022 Americancomedyfilm directed byJudd Apatowfrom a screenplay co-written withPam Brady. The film features anensemble castthat includesKaren Gillan,Vir Das,Pedro Pascal,Iris Apatow,Fred Armisen,Maria Bakalova,David Duchovny,Keegan-Michael Key,Leslie Mann,Kate McKinnon,Guz Khan,Peter Serafinowicz, andHarry Trevaldwyn. It follows the cast and crew of a blockbuster action franchise who attempt to shoot a sequel while quarantining at a posh hotel during theCOVID-19 pandemic.
The Bubblewas released on April 1, 2022, byNetflix. It received negative reviews.[1]
Following a problematic film role that nearly destroyed her career, actress Carol Cobb is offered the chance to revive it by reprising her role as the heroic Dr. Lacey Nightingale in the sixth installment of the wildly popularCliff Beastsfranchise:Cliff Beasts 6: Battle for Everest – Memories of a Requiem. Having turned down appearing in the fifth film in favor of doing the aforementioned panned role, Carol initially fears that her formerCliff Beastscastmates may hold a grudge against her.
One of the first major film productions to resume amid theCOVID-19 pandemic, theCliff Beastscast arrive at a swanky English hotel and must self-quarantine for two weeks. Afterward, a welcome back party is organized for the cast and crew. Here, Carol happily reunites with co-stars Dustin, Howie, and Sean, but has an awkward meeting with Lauren, the onlyCliff Beastsco-star appearing bitter about her absence. There are two series newcomers: Dieter, a respected but indifferent veteran actor, and Krystal, a youngTikToksensation brought in to attract a younger demographic. The latter quickly bonds with Carla, a deadpan on-set production assistant who's her age. Director Darren Eigan, an enthusiastic but frazzled indie filmmaker, tries to boost morale and make the shoot special, coming off as pretentious. He clashes with Dustin, who constantly bombards him with revised versions of the script to fit his own vision. Dieter has a crush on Anika, the hotel's sweet front desk clerk, but she wants to build a proper relationship first before jumping into sex.
Shooting begins and for the first few days, everything appears to be okay. But a series of events delay the production further. During a group meditation session, Howie becomes paranoid and quits the film in a panic. In consequence, hisCliff Beastscharacter is killed off gruesomely. Bored in the hotel, Krystal and Carla sneak out to party in the city. This gains traction online and gets Krystalcanceledfor her behavior, losing many of her followers. Later the cast tests positive forinfluenza, linked to a delivery girl who gave them their morning coffee. Despite being ill, the studio forces them to film. Introduced is the mysterious Mr. Best, the head of a new security team from the studio to oversee the cast and film's production, making some of the cast suspicious. When the shoot starts back up again, Carol realizes that most of her character's dialogue and actions have either been given to Krystal or omitted entirely, making her suspect this is how the studio is getting back at her for leaving the franchise. Carol has a heart-to-heart with Darren, telling him her concerns, but when he talks to the higher-ups about giving back her dialogue, it backfires.
Lauren tries to escape from the hotel in a frenzy one night. Mr. Best's men graphically shoot one of her hands off, leaving her in the hospital for the remainder of the shoot. Infuriated, Carol tries to rally her castmates and fight for their rights. Shortly afterward, while filming an elaborate dancing TikTok with Krystal, Dieter collapses. They quickly work together to revive him; Anika succeeds, cementing their relationship. This event inspires the team, and they plan a getaway. As they shoot the climax, Dustin creates a distraction by clashing with Darren about the script revisions while the rest of the cast leave the set and try to avoid getting caught by Mr. Best and his men.
The cast meets up at the helipad, calling upon an unsure Sean to fly them out. A furious Darren tries to stop them from leaving, but is knocked out by Dustin. Inside the helicopter is Anika, who hopes to run away with Dieter, who happily accepts. Sean gets the helicopter off the ground but doesn't know how to fly it forward. The rest of the crew encourage Sean to fly the helicopter away from the hotel as theCliff Beastscast celebrate their victory.
Two years later, a documentary detailing the troubled production and antics on set,Beasts of the Bubble, is released to rave reviews and praise from the public. While Carol is described as "the villain" of the film, she's proud of the project. Dieter and Anika's relationship is still strong. Lauren is in good spirits, having a robotic hand. Meanwhile, Darren is signed on to direct a movie based onSkittles.

He also wrote and directed several episodes of the series. After its cancellation, Apatow was the executive producer and creator of the seriesUndeclared, which reusedSeth Rogenin the main cast and otherFreaks and Geekscast members in recurring roles. Although both shows were quickly canceled,USA Todaymedia critic Susan Wloszczyna called the shows "two of the most acclaimed TV series to ever last only one season".[30]

His second film, the romantic comedyKnocked Up, was released in June 2007 to wide critical acclaim. Apatow wrote the initial draft of the film on the set ofTalladega Nights.[20]The story concerns a slacker and a media personality (Rogen and Heigl, respectively) whoseone-night standresults in an unintended pregnancy. In addition to being a critical success, the film was also a commercial hit, continuing Apatow's newfound mainstream success.[citation needed]
In August 2007, Apatow produced the filmSuperbad, which was written bySeth Rogenand his writing partnerEvan Goldberg. A concept Rogen and Goldberg had created as teens, Apatow convinced Rogen to write the film as a vehicle for himself in 2000. Rogen and Goldberg finished writing the film, but were unable to find a studio interested in producing it. Apatow then enlisted Rogen and Goldberg to writePineapple Express, astoneraction movie that he felt would be more commercial. After the success ofAnchormanandThe 40-Year-Old Virgin, Apatow was still unable to sell bothSuperbadandPineapple Express; it was only after he produced the commercial hitTalladega NightsthatSony Pictures Entertainmentdecided to produce both.[25]
At this point, Rogen was unable to play the lead forSuperbad, as he had grown too old to play the part of Seth. Subsequently, he was cast in a supporting role as a police officer and friendJonah Hilltook his role as the high school student. Apatow credits Rogen for influencing him to make his work more "outrageously dirty".[20]
In August 2007,Superbadopened at No. 1 in the box office to critical acclaim, taking in $33 million in its opening weekend.[36]Industry insiders claimed Apatow was now a brand unto himself, creating movies geared toward older audiences, who would watch his movies even when the films delved into the teen genre.[37]
Apatow served as producer and co-writer along with directorJake Kasdanfor the biopic spoofWalk HardstarringJohn C. Reilly,Kristen WiigandJenna Fischer, which was released in December 2007.[38]While the film received positive reviews,[39]it did poorly commercially.[40]In 2008, he served as producer forDrillbit Taylorstarring Owen Wilson andLeslie Mannand written bySeth Rogen, which opened in March and earned negative reviews.[41]
For the rest of 2008, Apatow produced the comedy filmsForgetting Sarah MarshallstarringJason SegelandKristen Bell;Step Brothers, which reunitesTalladega Nightsco-starsWill FerrellandJohn C. Reilly; andPineapple Expressstarring Seth Rogen andJames Franco, both of whom originally starred onFreaks and Geeks. In addition, he served as co-writer for theAdam Sandlercomedy filmYou Don't Mess with the Zohan, which Sandler andRobert Smigelalso co-wrote and went on to gross $204 million at the worldwide box office.[42][43]
He tries to keep a low budget on his projects and usually makes his movies about the work itself rather than using big stars. After his success in film, he hired the entire writing staff fromUndeclaredto write movies forApatow Productions.[20]He never fires writers and he keeps them on projects through all stages of productions, known colloquially as "the comedy wheel".[20]Apatow is not committed to any specific studio, but his projects are typically set up atUniversalandSony,[20]and in 2009Varietyreported that Universal had signed him to a 3 picture directing deal.[44]Apatow once vowed to include a penis in every one of his movies.[45]He explained his position as, "I like movies that are, you know, uplifting and hopeful...and I like filth!"[46]
In 2009, Apatow served as producer for the biblical comedy filmYear One; the film was not well received.[47]He also released his third directorial feature on July 31 that same year, titledFunny People. Apatow wrote the film, which starredAdam SandlerandSeth Rogenas a pair of standup comedians, one of whom has a terminal illness. Other co-stars included his wifeLeslie MannandEric Bana, who was a comedic actor in Australia before appearing in American films. The film contained more dramatic elements than Apatow's previous directorial efforts.[48]Although the film was not financially successful (grossing $54 million domestically), the critical reception was primarily positive, with David Denby ofThe New Yorkermagazine including the film on his top ten films of 2009,[49]callingFunny People"a serious comedy about a funny man's brush with death" and stating that the film "is Apatow's richest, most complicated movie yet—a summing up of his feelings about comedy and its relation to the rest of existence."[50]New York TimescriticA.O. Scott, reflecting on summer films of 2009, opined thatFunny Peoplewas "a movie about growing up, feeling sad, facing death—a long, serious film whose subject is the challenge of maturity. Which may be why, in the face of a softish opening weekend, various interpreters of box office data were quick to declareFunny Peoplea flop. The summer is no time for grown-ups."[51]
In 2010, Apatow served as producer on theForgetting Sarah Marshallspin-offGet Him to the GreekwithRussell Brandreprising his role andJonah Hillreturning from the original film, albeit as a different character.

The series ran from 2012 to 2017 and generating criticism over its depiction of sexual assault,[55]male ejaculate,[56]and Dunham's frequent on-screen nudity.[57][58]In a January 2013 interview inFast Company, Apatow and Dunham discussed the creative process of working on the show, saying that "this type of show is an auteur's vision. It isn't collaborative in the same way as other shows. We are probably closer toCurb Your Enthusiasmthan we are to something likeFriends."[59]
Apatow producedWanderlust(2012), starringJennifer AnistonandPaul Ruddas a married couple who leave New York City and live in a hippie commune.[60]He also producedThe Five-Year Engagement(2012), featuringJason SegelandEmily Bluntas a couple who have a rocky five-year engagement.[61]

In 2012,Entertainment Weeklyreported that 22 years after writing an episode ofThe Simpsons, Apatow's script ("Bart's New Friend")[64]was being developed into an episode that would air in 2015.[65]Apatow co-producedAnchorman 2: The Legend Continues, which was released December 18, 2013, with the plot focusing on "Ron Burgundy's struggle to find his place in the rise of new media and the 24-hour news cycle".[66]Apatow producedBegin Again(2013), starringKeira Knightleywho plays a singer-songwriter who is discovered by a struggling record label executive (played byMark Ruffalo) and collaborates with him to produce an album recorded in public locations all over New York City.

In November 2017, Apatow returned to stand-up after a long hiatus to headline a show in New York City'sCarnegie HallcalledJudd Apatow and Friends.

The program was described as being able to "articulate intense and often ineffable emotion" while still remaining "brazenly candid...and packed with great jokes". In a review forThe A.V.

In his comedy, Garry Shandling always was in pursuit of the truth and contemplating real life. With this two-partHBOspecial, he and Judd Apatow achieved that very beautifully one last time."[91]In September 2018, Apatow took home the outstanding documentary or nonfiction special award at theCreative Arts Emmy Awardsfor his work on the documentary.[92]
In June 2020, Apatow's seventh directorial film,The King of Staten Island,co-written with and starringPete Davidson, was to be released in theatres but due to the ongoingCOVID-19 pandemicit was instead released tovideo on demandon the 12th of June to positive reviews from critics.[citation needed]

Apatow memorialized the friendship of comicsBob NewhartandDon RicklesinBob & Don: A Love Story—a 2023 short documentary film featuring interviews with and home movies of both families.[94]
In 2007,New Yorkmagazine noted that former Apatow associateMike Whitewas "disenchanted" by Apatow's later films, "objecting to the treatment of women and gay men in Apatow's recent movies", with White quoted as saying ofKnocked Up: "At some point it starts feeling like comedy of the bullies, rather than the bullied."[95]In Apatow's comedies, characters had frequently used demeaning words against theLGBTQ community, words such as "tranny", and "faggot".[96]
ActressKatherine Heiglsaid in 2007 that though she enjoyed working with Apatow onKnocked Up, she found the film itself "a littlesexist" and felt it "paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys."[97][98][99]Apatow responded, "I'm just shocked she used the wordshrew. I mean, what is this, the 1600s?"[100]Apatow said the characters in the film "are sexist at times... but it's really about immature people who are afraid of women and relationships and learn to grow up."[101]
In 2012, Alyssa Rosenberg ofThinkProgressquoted Apatow as saying, "I got bored of penises. I said, 'enough of that.' No, I just like immaturity, I like to show people struggle and try to figure out who they are. I'm a guy and so it leaned guy for a while.

My relatives are Scottish, so I think my Scottish audience is important. Some are in Glasgow, but my mum's from Aberdeen. I hear it's grey there—like my mum. The name's Russian, but New York is my home. That's where I'm from.
I like that I look like my father and mother put together—that's aRussian Jewand aScottishLutheran, and I like that it all looks mixed up. ... I'm sure my nose wasn't an asset until I was David Duchovny. Before that, it was, like, "Yeah, that kind of Jewish-looking guy with the kind of big nose."

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
