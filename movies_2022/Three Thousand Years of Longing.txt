Written by Miller and Augusta Gore, it is based on the 1994short story"The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye" byA. S. Byattand follows adjinn(Idris Elba) who is unleashed from a bottle by a professor (Tilda Swinton) and tells her stories from his thousands of years of existence. The film is dedicated to Miller's mother Angela, as well as Rena Mitchell, relative of producerDoug Mitchell.
The film premieredout of competition at the 75th Cannes Film Festivalon May 20, 2022. It was released theatrically in the United States on August 26, 2022, byMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures(viaUnited Artists Releasing), and in Australia on September 1, 2022, byRoadshow Entertainment. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its visuals and performances, but was abox-office bomb, grossing $20.3 million against a budget of $60 million.
Alithea Binnie is a Britishnarratologyscholar who occasionallyhallucinatesdemonic beings. During a trip toIstanbul, Alithea purchases an antique bottle and unleashes theDjinntrapped within it. The Djinn offers to grant Alithea three wishes, as long as each one is truly her heart's desire, with the following exceptions: no wishing for more wishes, no wishing for immortality, and no wishing for an end to sin or suffering. However, Alithea argues that wishing is a mistake, accusing the Djinn of being a trickster. She says that when she was a child, she created an imaginary friend in the form of a young boy and even imagined his whole life (which she wrote in a diary) but decided to forget about him, fearing to be overwhelmed by her own imagination. In response, the Djinn proceeds to tell her three tales of his past and how he ended up trapped in the bottle.
In the first story, theQueen of Sheba, the Djinn's kin and lover, is wooed by KingSolomon, who jealously imprisons the Djinn in a brass bottle which is cast into theRed Seaby a bird. Twenty-five centuries later the now-encrusted bottle is brought up from the ocean floor by fishermen and eventually is used as a stone in a wall.
The second story centers on Gülten, aconcubinein the palace ofSuleiman the Magnificent. After finding the bottle, Gülten wishes for Suleiman's son,Mustafa, to fall in love with her and subsequently wishes to bear his child.Hürrem Sultan, a favored concubine of Suleiman, schemes to have her own son on the throne and convinces Suleiman that Mustafa is conspiring against him; this results in Mustafa's murder. Despite the Djinn's attempts to save her, the pregnant Gülten is also killed on Suleiman's orders before she can make her final wish.
With the third wish ungranted, the Djinn wanders the palace invisibly for over 100 years, his bottle concealed beneath a stone in an unused bathing room. He almost captures the attention ofMurad IV, who goes to war and becomes a ruthless ruler, later dying fromalcoholism. His brotherIbrahimbecomes the new sultan and develops a fetish for overweight concubines. His favorite among them,Sugar Lump, after finding the bathing room while wandering through the palace, discovers the bottle when she slips and falls on the stone, breaking it. The Djinn appears to her and desperately begs her to make the third wish. Thinking he is a trickster, Sugar Lump wishes for the Djinn to be re-imprisoned in his bottle at the bottom of theBosporus.
In the final story, Zefir, the young wife of a Turkish merchant, is given the bottle after it is recovered in the mid-19th century from the belly of a gutted fish. Zefir wishes first for all-reaching knowledge, which the Djinn grants in the form of books, and later to perceive the world as djinns do. Despite the Djinn's growing love for Zefir and the fact she is now pregnant with his child, she feels increasingly trapped by his unwillingness to let her make a third wish, which would end their bond. To placate her, the Djinn offers to imprison himself in a new glass bottle whenever she wishes. However, during one such time, Zefir wishes to forget she had ever met the Djinn, leaving him imprisoned and unknown once again.
Alithea is moved by the story and realizes that she has fallen in love with the Djinn. For her first wish she asks for him to love her the way he had loved Zefir. They spend the night making love, and in the morning, the Djinn accompanies Alithea back toLondon. They settle into a routine where he either accompanies her as she works, or explores the new modern world, learning all of the new technological discoveries.
One day, Alithea discovers that the Djinn is becoming weaker due to the effects of the city's cell tower and satellite transmissions, which have been interacting with his electromagnetic physiology. Finding him turning to dust and comatose, she uses her second wish to get the severely ill Djinn to speak to her, and apologizes for using her wish to deny them the chance to fall in love naturally. She uses her third and final wish to free the Djinn to return to "The Realm of Djinn" where he belongs, as she realizes he does not belong in the world of humans.
Three years later, Alithea has written a book containing all the stories that the Djinn told her, like she once did with her childhood imaginary friend, and sees the now-healthy Djinn approaching her from across the park. Holding hands, they continue through the park and Alithea's narration reveals that he promises to return throughout her lifetime.

It is responsible for some of Australia's best-known and most successful films, including the fiveMad Maxfilms, the twoBabefilms, and the twoHappy Feetfilms.
Kennedy Miller Mitchell is one of Australia's oldest existing film production companies, and the most successful internationally. Its principals are George Miller and Doug Mitchell who has been a financial partner in the enterprise since 1981 and is George Miller's producing partner.
Many of the films are directed by the co-founder,George Miller, though he sometimes takes an organisational role and prefers to use someone else to direct, as withBabe, which was directed byChris Noonan.[2]
The company's most recent project was the fifthMad Maxfilm, titledFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga. A prequel and spin-off to the series, the film was released on 23 May 2024, to critical acclaim but was a financial disappointment.
Byron Kennedy, who was a film school lecturer at the time, andGeorge Millerfirst met at a summer film school in Australia in 1971. They began making short features and experimental work, includingViolence in the Cinema, Part 1, which Byron produced, photographed and edited, and which won two Australian Film Institute (AFI) awards.[3]
In 1978, Kennedy and Miller formed the production companyKennedy Miller Productions, which produced their first feature film,Mad Max. The success of the film allowed them to establish Hollywood contacts, and work in the United States as well as in Australia.[4]
In July 1983, Byron Kennedy was killed when the helicopter he was piloting crashed. Miller's first reaction was to back away from filmmaking without Kennedy's input, but he decided to continue, and created a sizeable body of TV productions during the 1980s and 1990s,[4]among them the six-part seriesThe Dismissal(1983), the seven-part seriesBodyline(1984), the six-part seriesThe Cowra Breakout(1984), the ten-part seriesVietnam(1987) withNicole Kidman, the three-part seriesBangkok Hilton(1989), and the five-part seriesThe Dirtwater Dynasty(1989).[5]

In 1995, the company had a major success with the filmBabe, the story of a pig who thinks it is a sheepdog. The film used cutting-edge animal animatronic and visual effects created byJim Henson's Creature Shop,John Cox's Creature WorkshopandRhythm and Hues. Along with visual effects supervisorScott E. Anderson, they were awarded theAcademy Award for Best Visual Effects.Babewas the second largest grossing film at the Australian box office afterCrocodile Dundee(1986).[7]
In 1996, the company releasedVideo Fool for Love, an autobiographical documentary shot by film editor Robert Gibson oncamcordersover 10 years that focuses on his personal life and relationships.
In 2006, the company had another big success withHappy Feet, which topped the US box office.[2]
In 2007, the company formed a partnership with Australian production and media services outfit the Omnilab Media Group, to launch a digital production company.[8]
In 2009, the company was renamedKennedy Miller Mitchell.[1]
In 2011, the company made a strategic move towards video game creation, and plans to make games for its own films. The company has taken on staff from two Australian game developers that have collapsed,Krome StudiosandTeam Bondi.[1]
In early 2013, the company closed down their video game studio, KMM Interactive Entertainment, and ceased production onWhore of the Orient, which was going to be the next title from the devs behind the gameL.A.

Trained in medicine at theUniversity of New South Wales, Miller worked as a physician for several years before entering the film industry full-time. He is a co-founder of the production housesKennedy Miller Mitchell, formerly known as Kennedy Miller, and Dr. D Studios. Since the death of his producing partnerByron Kennedy, his younger brotherBill MillerandDoug Mitchellhave produced his later films.
Miller was born on 3 March 1945[2]inChinchilla, Queensland, toGreek immigrantparents: Jim Miller and mother Angela. Jim (aka Dimitrios) was born on the Greek island ofKythira(at Mitata), Jim's fatheranglicisedhis surname from Miliotis to Miller when he emigrated to Australia in 1920; Angela's family wereGreek refugeesfromAnatolia, displaced by the1923 population exchange.[3]
Miller attendedIpswich Grammar Schooland laterSydney Boys High School,[3]then studied medicine at theUniversity of New South Waleswith his twin brother John. While in his final year at medical school (1971), George and his younger brother Chris madeSt. Vincent's Revue Film, a one-minute short film that won them first prize in a student competition.[4]
In 1971, George attended a film workshop atMelbourne Universitywhere he met fellow studentByron Kennedy, with whom he formed a lasting friendship and production partnership, until Kennedy's death. In 1972, Miller completed his residency at Sydney'sSt Vincent's Hospital, spending his time off crewing on shortexperimental films. That same year, Miller and Kennedy foundedKennedy Miller Productions.[5]The pair subsequently collaborated on numerous works. After Kennedy died in 1983, Miller kept his name in the company. It was later renamed Kennedy Miller Mitchell in 2009 as a way to recognise producerDoug Mitchell's role in the company.[6]
Miller's first work, the short filmViolence in Cinema: Part 1(1971), polarised critics, audiences and distributors so much that it was placed in the documentary category at the 1972Sydney Film Festivaldue to its matter-of-fact depiction of cinematic violence.[7]In 1979, Miller made his feature-length directorial debut withMad Max. Based on a script written by Miller and James McCausland in 1975, the film was independently financed by Kennedy Miller Productions and went on to become an international success.[5]As a result, the film spawned theMad Maxserieswith two further sequels starringMel Gibson:Mad Max 2also released asThe Road Warrior(1981) andMad Max Beyond Thunderdome(1985).
During the time between the second and thirdMad Maxfilms, Miller directed a remake of "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet" as a segment for the anthology filmTwilight Zone: The Movie(1983). Despite not being involved or present, the infamoushelicopter crashshook him, leading to a re-evaluation of the stunt-work in his future films.[8]He also co-produced and co-directed many acclaimedminiseriesfor Australian television includingThe Dismissal(1983) andThe Cowra Breakout(1984).
In 1987, Miller directedThe Witches of Eastwick, starringJack Nicholson,Susan Sarandon,CherandMichelle Pfeiffer. The film proved to be a troubling experience for Miller. "I quit the film twice and Jack [Nicholson] held me in there," said Miller. "He said, 'Just sit down, lose your emotion, and have a look at the work. If you think the work is good, stick with the film.' And he was a great man. I learnt more from him than anybody else I’ve worked with - he was extraordinary."[9]Nicholson also coached Miller to exaggerate his needs during the production, asking for 300 extras when he only needed 150, knowing that his producers would give him less than he requested.[10]The award-winning production designerPolly Plattalso collaborated closely with Miller onThe Witches of Eastwick.Cherlater said that prior to working on the film, Miller called her at home, the day after her 40th birthday, to inform her that he and Nicholson didn't want her in the film. She was deemed "too old and not sexy".[11]
FollowingThe Witches of Eastwick, Miller focused primarily on producing Australian projects.[12]His role as producer ofFlirting,Dead Calmand the TV miniseriesBangkok HiltonandVietnam, all starringNicole Kidman, was instrumental in the development of her career. Miller returned to directing with the release of the biographical medical dramaLorenzo's Oil(1992), which he co-wrote withNick Enright.[13]The film starredNick NolteandSusan Sarandon. The film received critical acclaim[14]withVarietydescribing the film as a "true-life story brought to the screen intelligently and with passionate motivation by George Miller".[15]For his work on the film Miller was nominated for theAcademy AwardandWriters Guild of America Awardfor Best Original Screenplay.[16][17]The following year Miller was hired to direct the science fiction drama filmContactbased on the story byCarl SaganandAnn Druyan.[18]After working on the film for over a year,Warner Bros.and Miller mutually agreed to part ways andRobert Zemeckiswas eventually brought on to direct.[19]

The film was a critical and financial success.[20][21]The film earned 7Academy Awardnominations including for Miller forBest Adapted Screenplay.[22]Miller went on to write and direct its sequelBabe: Pig in the City(1998).[23]Chicago Sun-TimescriticRoger Ebertgave the film four stars praising Miller's work on the sequel writing, "It outdoes itself with the sets and special effects that make up "the city." And it is still literate, humane and wicked. George Miller, who produced, directed and co-wrote the film, has improved and extended the ideas inBabe: Pig in the City,instead of being content to copy them."[24]CriticGene Siskelof theChicago Tribunenamed it the Best film of 1998.[25]
In 1995, Miller also producedVideo Fool for Love, a controversial and divisivecinema veritédocumentary shot on video by film editor Robert Gibson that deals with Gibson's personal life and relationship issues.[26]
Miller was also the creator of the animated jukebox musical filmHappy Feet(2006) about the life ofpenguinsinAntarctica.[27]TheWarner Bros.-produced film was released in November 2006. It was a runaway box office success earning $363 million worldwide, and also brought Miller his fourthAcademy Awardnomination, and his first win in the category ofBest Animated Feature.[28]Manohla DargisofThe New York Timespraised the film writing, "Miller...shows a remarkable persistence of vision. Even in a story about singing-and-dancing fat and feather, Mr. Miller can’t help but go dark and deep" adding, "[He] brings an unusual depth of feeling to his work as well as a distinct moral worldview".[29]
In 2007, Miller signed on to direct aJustice Leaguefilm titledJustice League: Mortal.[30]While production was initially held up due to the2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike,[31]further production delays and the success ofThe Dark Knightled to Warner Bros. deciding to put the film on hold and pursue different options.[32]As a partnership between his production companyKennedy Miller Mitchelland Omnilab Media, George Miller co-founded Dr. D Studios, a Sydney-based digital animation studio in mid-2007.[33]In 2011, theHappy FeetsequelHappy Feet Twowas released by Dr. D Studios.[34]But following the financially unsuccessful release ofHappy Feet Twoand the long delay ofMad Max: Fury Road(2015), the studio closed down in 2013.[33][35]

ScottofThe New York Timeslabeled it a "New York Times Critic's Pick" writing, "Miller has always stayed true to his scrappy, pragmatic roots. At 70, he has a master craftsman’s intuitive sense of proportion and a visual artisan’s mistrust of extraneous verbiage" adding, "It’s all great fun, and quite rousing as well — a large-scale genre movie that is at once unpretentious and unafraid to bring home a message".[39]It went on to receive 10Academy Awardnominations includingBest Picture, while Miller himself was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Director.[40]
In October 2018 it was announced that Miller would directThree Thousand Years of Longing, which began filming in November 2020.[41]The film starringIdris ElbaandTilda Swintonpremiered at theCannes Film Festivalin May 2022.[42]Peter BradshawofThe Guardiandescribed the film as "a heartfeltAladdin-esque adventure for grownups" adding, "Miller shows he is now doing one-for-him-and-one-that’s-even-more-for-him. It’s anArabian Nights-type fantasia which he has clearly been gagging to make for years".[43]Justin ChangofNPRwrote that "Miller unveils an outlandish premise with a sly wit that's initially hard to resist" but added the film "ends on a muted, uncertain note".[44]The film was abox office bombgrossing $20 million worldwide off a budget of $60 million.[45][46]
In April 2017, Miller said that he and co-writer Nico Lathouris have finished two additional post-Fury Roadscripts for theMad Maxseries. TheFury Roadlead, Tom Hardy, is committed to the next sequel.[47]In 2015, and again in early 2017, Miller said "the fifth film in the franchise will be titledMad Max: The Wasteland."[47][48]In 2020, it was reported that Miller would next direct theMad MaxspinoffFuriosa: A Mad Max SagastarringAnya Taylor-JoyandChris Hemsworth.[49]The film premiered at the2024 Cannes Film Festivalto critical acclaim.[50][51]Manohla DargisofThe New York Timesgave the film a "NYT Critic's Pick" declaring, "Miller is such a wildly inventive filmmaker that it’s been easy to forget that he keeps making movies about the end of life as we know it. It’s a blast watching his characters fight over oil, water and women, yet while I’ve long thought of him as a great filmmaker it’s only withFuriosathat I now understand he’s also one kick-ass prophet of doom."[52]
Miller was married to actressSandy Gorefrom 1985 to 1992; they have a daughter. He has been married to film editorMargaret Sixelsince 1995. They have two sons.[53][needs update]Sixel has worked in some capacity on many of Miller's directorial efforts.[54]Miller is afeminist, having toldVanity Fairin May 2015, "I've gone from being very male dominant to being surrounded by magnificent women. I can't help but be a feminist."[55]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
