Cherie is a young single mother and pre-law student working as a secretary for a legal firm in Los Angeles. On her way home, her boss James calls her saying that she double-booked him and asking her to attend a dinner with an important client in his place; she reluctantly accepts. While preparing for the dinner, Cherie's period starts and she realizes she is out of tampons.
At the dinner, Cherie is charmed by the client, Ethan, although he suddenly becomes irritated when approached by a dog, explaining that he was bitten by one as a child. Ethan invites Cherie to spend the night with him, which she accepts. He sets an alarm on his phone for the early morning so she can return home before her daughter awakens. As he does so, she notices that he already has an alarm for 5:25 AM. When they enter his house, Ethan attacks Cherie, who flees into the streets while shouting for help.
Cherie eventually finds two women outside a movie theater and convinces them to call 911. The police arrest Cherie for public intoxication, despite her protestations that she was attacked. Cherie talks to another woman in the cell who panics when Cherie describes Ethan. The woman warns Cherie that Ethan "controls men" and urges her to seek the "First Lady". The police escort Ethan into Cherie's cell, where he declares that he will hunt her through the night, but promises to let her go if she survives until morning.
Upon her release, Cherie finds shelter in James' apartment. She searches for information about Ethan on James' computer and finds that she is the latest in a long string of women marked astithesfor Ethan. James' wife, Judy, warns Cherie that Ethan can smell her blood and that she should clean herself thoroughly. Cherie flees on a bus and calls her ex-boyfriend Trey for help.
While stopping at a gas station to buy tampons, Cherie is ambushed by Ethan. She strikes him in the head and escapes with the help of Trey, who drives her to his place. Dawn, Trey's current girlfriend and Cherie's former best friend, is unexpectedly sympathetic toward Cherie. When Ethan arrives looking for Cherie, Dawn and her friends arm themselves to fight him off, but he effortlessly kills them, before decapitating Trey in front of Cherie.
Remembering Judy's advice, Cherie throws some of her menstrual blood onto a passing car to mislead Ethan. She flees to a church and asks a priest for holy water and a crucifix. However, she discovers the priest unconscious and realizes that Ethan had assumed his form. Ethan then reveals his true monstrous form to Cherie. Returning to human form, Ethan is attacked by the priest, allowing Cherie to escape.
Arriving at an underground rave, Cherie calls the number on a flyer for the First Lady, obtaining the location for a nearby spa. When Cherie is accosted by a man, she is rescued by a group of party girls. As they leave the rave, Cherie realizes that Ethan's alarm was set for sunrise. Ethan then kills the party girls and attacks Cherie until a pit bull intervenes, barking at Ethan and scaring him off.
At the spa, Cherie discovers the "First Lady", Dinah, and a group of women practicing martial arts. Dinah explains that Ethan is afallen angelwhose job was to protect and guide humanity. Instead, Ethan decided to use his prodigious powers to promote male dominance throughout history. Dinah says she needs to use Cherie as bait to lure Ethan out so he can be defeated.
Cherie drives to theSanta Monica Pierand reopens her wounds, attracting Ethan. As Ethan prepares to kill Cherie, his alarm rings and he realizes that the dawn has arrived. Cherie throws a rock through a blacked-out window, exposing Ethan to the sunlight and incapacitating him. The women from the spa, who have gathered outside, throw more rocks through the windows, flooding the room with sunlight and fatally weakening Ethan.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
