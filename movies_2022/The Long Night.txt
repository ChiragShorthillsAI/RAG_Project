The film is about a couple whose quiet weekend takes a bizarre turn when a nightmarish cult and their maniacal leader come to fulfill an apocalyptic prophesy.[4][5]
A young big city couple, Grace and Jack, are about to begin the rest of their lives together. Just two things stand in their way. Grace meets Jack’s wealthy judgmental parents and Jack accompanies Grace to her hometown in the deep south, where she desperately wants to locate her biological parents along with bringing closure to her mysterious childhood past before embarking on her bright future.
The meeting with Jack’s parents causes a slight riff between the two lovers but is just a foreshadowed speed bump before a full-on terror train collision. Upon arriving at a large estate, owned by a guy that has reached out to Grace about her past, the duo only discover an empty house shrouded in secrets. Grace begins to psychologically unravel as her dark destiny appears to float off the vast farmhouse walls and into her psyche.
The town’s welcoming committee shows up at dusk to greet the tourists. Instead of food and drink, the masked and cloaked crew offer up a dead kitten, burning pentagrams, and death on a stick. Jack and Grace attempt to fight and flee as the ancient dark history behind Grace’s existence is explained.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
