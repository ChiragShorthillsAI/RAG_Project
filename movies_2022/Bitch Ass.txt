The film opens with a framing device, where Tony Todd introduces the movie, claiming it to have been previouslylost mediaand praising the titular character's place in Black horror as the first masked black serial killer.
Cecil is a young boy who lives with his abusive, religious grandmother during the 1970s. His sole joys are boardgames and the local beauty Marsia. This leads him to get bullied by some of the other kids, particularly as Spade is dating Marsia. The bullies call him "bitch ass" and eventually Spade goads the others into committing a brutal assault on Cecil that involves slicing off parts of Cecil's face.
Approximately 20 years later, Cecil's grandmother has died. Spade, has grown to be a small-time thug with a gang made up of local kids. When he learns of her death he decides to task them with robbing the place, as he believed it to have been empty. Among these kids is Marsia's son Q, who she wants to gain a better life by attending college.
Shortly after breaking into the house they discover that it has been set up with various tricks and traps that mimic popular board games likeJengaandOperation. They learn that all of these games were set up by "Bitch Ass", who is revealed to be the alter ego of Cecil, whose mind is now broken due to years of abuse. Bitch Ass picks them off one by one, only sparing Q because the boy empathized with him. Marsia and Spade arrive and are also captured. Bitch Ass forces Spade to play him in a deadly game of Battleship, during which Spade experiences genuine remorse for his past actions. Bitch Ass then forces Spade to wear a gas mask filled with poisonous gas.
It is revealed that Cecil's grandmother is not dead and has been monitoring Q. Marsia is brought to Q, causing the boy to realize that he must challenge Bitch Ass to another game if he and his mother are to survive. He and the killer play rock, paper, scissors, where each brutalizes their hand if they lose. Eventually this causes Marsia to snap and she attacks the grandmother. This distracts Bitch Ass, allowing Marsia to overpower him and escape with her son. The two return home, believing that they are safe. She soon discovers that this is not the case and that Bitch Ass will come for her, as he had left aRubik's cubeon her desk.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
