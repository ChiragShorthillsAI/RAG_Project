Plans for aHellraiserremake were publicized in October 2007, whenJulien Maury and Alexandre Bustillowere reported to be directing, with Barker producing andMarcus DunstanandPatrick Meltonwriting the script. After Maury and Bustillo left the project,Todd FarmerandPatrick Lussierwere attached, with production slated for an early 2012 release. However, following the release ofHellraiser: Revelations(2011) to secure continuing rights, Farmer and Lussier were no longer involved. By 2018, after the critical and commercial success ofHalloween,Miramaxhad confirmed plans for newHellraiserinstallments. The film wasgreen-litin early 2019, with Bruckner directing from a script written by Collins and Piotrowski, while the project moved toHuluwithSpyglass Media Groupand Phantom Four Films. Filming took place from September to October 2021.
The film was released in 2022, first duringFantastic Fest 2022,[2]then throughoutNorth Americavia Hulu,[3]and finally throughout theUnited Kingdomand globally viaSpyglassandParamount Pictures.[6]The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, with some deeming it an improvement over its predecessors and the best since the original 1987 film; it was praised for its new take on the series, its faithfulness to the tone of the source material and Clayton's performance, while being criticized for its rushed character development and runtime.
While hosting a lavish orgy at his mansion, hedonistic millionaire investor, art collector and socialite Roland Voight forces homeless sex worker Joey Coscuna to solve a mechanical puzzle box, which then springs a blade that cuts Joey and opens a portal to another dimension, from which chains fly out and rip him apart.
Six years later, recovering drug addict Riley McKendry lives with her estranged brother Matt, his boyfriend Colin, and their roommate Nora. Riley and her boyfriend Trevor discover the puzzle box in an abandoned storage warehouse. Returning home late, she argues with Matt when he accuses her of relapsing. At an empty park, she solves the puzzle but misses being cut by the blade. TheCenobites, a group of mutilated humanoids, appear and demand another sacrifice. Matt, feeling guilty about his strained relationship with Riley, finds her incapacitated and inadvertently cuts himself on the box while attempting to awaken her. He enters a nearby restroom to clean his wound but then experiences a headache. Outside, Riley notices the box changing shapes before she hears Matt screaming, finding him missing upon entering the bathroom.
Believing the box caused Matt's disappearance, Riley and Trevor track down Voight's former lawyer Serena Menaker at an assisted living facility. Having concealed it in the warehouse, Menaker attempts to confiscate the box from Riley but is cut by the blade and later abducted by the Cenobites. Visiting Voight's abandoned mansion, Riley discovers from his journals that each of the box's 6 configurations require a victim to be marked for sacrifice by its blade. On completion, the holder receives a "gift" from Leviathan, the entity that rules overHell. Riley sees an apparition of Matt and is horrified to discover he has been flayed.
Colin, Trevor and Nora arrive in Trevor's van to take Riley home. While Riley explains her findings to Colin, Nora hits a switch in the bar that opens a secret passage. Trevor inadvertently shuts the door, trapping her inside the passage, and as he attempts to rescue her, the mutilated Voight, concealed inside the walls, stabs her with the box. The group escapes the mansion to seek help, but the Cenobites abduct Nora, who is taunted, tortured, and fatally flayed in a decrepit hallway by their leader,the Priest. The van crashes after Riley sees a reflection of Nora's torture in the rearview mirror, whereupon the Priest appears. After Riley refuses the Priest's offer to exchange Matt for two sacrifices, she is ordered to sacrifice either two people or herself. After a Cenobite known as theChattererinjures Trevor, Riley solves the next configuration and stabs the Chatterer, who is ripped apart as the next sacrifice.
The trio retreats to the mansion, realizing the steel doors will bar the Cenobites from entering. Leaving Trevor to rest, Riley and Colin plan to trap a Cenobite known as the Asphyx as the last sacrifice, but she drops the box. Voight appears, picks it up, and stabs Colin, revealing that he sought "sensation" after completing all of his sacrifices, but instead, a contraption was attached to him that randomly twists his nerve endings. He privately speaks with Trevor, revealing he employed him to locate suitable humans, then completes the final configuration and traps the Cenobites, demanding they ask Leviathan to free him. While Leviathan appears above the mansion, Riley retrieves the box, unlocks the steel doors, and rescues Colin from torture by stabbing Trevor, marking him as the final sacrifice. Meanwhile, the Priest warns Voight that his reward can only be exchanged and not revoked; he accepts her offer of "power" and is released from his contraption and healed, only for Leviathan to immediately impale him with a large chain and lift him away.
With the sacrifices completed, the Cenobites offer to resurrect Matt. Riley declines, realizing their gifts will bring pain, and decides to accept Matt's death. After the Cenobites praise her for choosing the Lament Configuration, a life of regret with bitter and brief suffering, they vanish and the box resumes its cube configuration. As the duo leaves the mansion, Colin asks a silent Riley if her choice was justified; meanwhile, inside Leviathan's realm, Voight is brutally transformed into a new Cenobite.

The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
