Inspired by actual events, the film tells the story ofNew Orleans Saintshead coachSean Paytonwho coached his 12-year-old son's football team during hisone-year suspensionfrom theNFL.
Home Teamwas produced byAdam Sandler'sHappy Madison Productionsand James's Hey Eddie Productions, and filmed inNew Orleansfrom May to June 2021. It was released on January 28, 2022, byNetflix.
Two years after theNew Orleans SaintswonSuper Bowl XLIV, head coachSean Paytonis involved in theBountygatescandal and suspended from theNFLfor one year. While he's awaiting the results of his appeal, he returns to his hometown,Argyle, Texas, to reconnect with his 12-year-old son Connor.
Not knowing how long he'll stay, Sean checks into a local hotel for 5 days and heads to his old middle school,Liberty Christian. Showing up to the football team's game unannounced, his ex-wife Beth and her new husband Jaime call him over.
Connor wonders why his father has come and Sean explains he just wants to get to know him. Beth and Jaime invite him to their barbecue the next afternoon. Sean introduces himself to coach Troy. At the BBQ, Connor's teammate in the Argyle Warriors friends are friendly, but he remains distant.
Watching the practices, Sean occasionally shouts out suggestions to Connor and others take notice. Known around town, other parents encourage him to help out with their kids as he sees fit. At the next game as he sees a way to help the team, Sean pops down and gives advice to Coach Troy, securing the team's first touchdown of the season.
Troy hunts down Sean that evening, convincing him to join them as the team's offensive coordinator. At the first game after the kids have the new playbook it's obvious they don't get it, so he shows them using nacho ingredients as props. Soon, the Warriors are winning every game.
However, facing the state champs the Porcupines, the Warriors are intimidated. The aggressive, much larger players cream them. Although dejected, they are reminded that they wouldn't have to play them again until the final. They go on to win all of their following matches, their semi-final is won in heavy rain as the kids projectile vomit, caused by natural energy wraps provided by Jaime.
In the final, Sean runs their two best players in both offense and defense in the first half, making them exhausted, but keeping the lead. Finally, in the last quarter, he puts the two benched defensive players back in and has their kicker Harlan, who hasn't scored one all season, to go for the tie. He misses, but the team rejoices as he knocks out the scoreboard.
Heading back to New Orleans, before Sean leaves he organizes Connor's future visit to see him and the team. Back in his office, Sean proudly places the second-place middle school trophy next to his Super Bowl one as a janitor named Lionel enters his office.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
