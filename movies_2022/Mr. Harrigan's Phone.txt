Mr. Harrigan's Phoneis a 2022 Americansupernaturalcoming-of-agehorror film[1]film written and directed byJohn Lee Hancock. It is based on the novella of the same name byStephen Kingfrom the collectionIf It Bleeds. The film starsDonald Sutherland,Jaeden Martell,Joe Tippett, andKirby Howell-Baptiste. It follows Craig who has a strong friendship with retired businessman John Harrigan; both get their firstiPhonesafter the former wins a lottery. Despite the latter's death, a supernatural connection persists between them through their phones, one of which is buried alongside Harrigan.
Mr. Harrigan's Phonewas released on October 5, 2022, byNetflix. The film received mixed reviews from critics.
In 2003, young Craig Poole becomes acquainted with retired businessman John Harrigan following the death of his mother, Joanna, with instructions to simply read to him three times a week. Five years later, a teenage Craig and elderly Harrigan have become friends.
During this time, Craig startshigh schooland becomes close to Ms. Hart, a teacher who comes to his aid when Kenny Yankovich, a school bully, attempts to intimidate him. After winning $3,000 from a lottery ticket that Harrigan gave him and receiving his firstiPhonefor Christmas, Craig buys one for Harrigan too. Despite initial resistance to new technology, he enjoys the phone.
The elderly Harrigan dies, leaving Craig heartbroken at the loss of his friend. At the funeral, Craig sneaks Harrigan's phone into the coffin, later being informed by Harrigan's associate that he was left a bequest in Harrigan's will. Craig will receive $800,000 in a trust fund, to support his future studies and pursuit of a writing career, which he had told Harrigan about.
Craig calls Harrigan's phone as a gesture of thanks. The next morning, he discovers that Harrigan sent him an odd text message, though his father chalks it up to being a bug within the iPhone itself.
Life goes on for Craig, who goes to a dance with his crush, only to be attacked by Kenny, who accuses him of  ratting out his drug-dealing activities on school grounds, getting him expelled. Later that night, Craig calls Harrigan's phone in a fit of frustration and sadness; he tells him what Kenny did and he is "afraid that this won't end, and I wish that you were here just to give me some advice."
Kenny is found dead the next day, having apparently fallen from his bedroom window while attempting to sneak out. Scared by what happened, Craig goes to an Apple store, upgrades his phone to a newer model, and puts away his old one.
Craig graduates from high school and departs for college in Boston to study journalism. While there, his father calls to tell him Ms. Hart was killed in a car accident involving a drunk driver, leaving her fiancé hospitalized. The driver, Dean Whitmore, is sent to rehab instead of prison for the accident although he'd been caught for drunk driving on other occasions, his license was suspended and he had an open container.
Infuriated by the verdict, Craig returns to his room and uses his old phone to call Harrigan, explicitly wishing death on Whitmore. Craig later learns Whitmore was found dead in his shower. He drives to the rehab center and bribes a worker there to give him details about the suicide. He is told that Whitmore swallowed shampoo and a piece of broken soap bar. Craig is disturbed to learn that the soap is the same brand used by Ms. Hart, and Whitmore's suicide note is actually a lyric from the song "Stand by Your Man" by Tammy Wynette; Harrigan's ringtone.
Craig breaks down and returns to his hometown. While there, he remembers opening Harrigan's "secret closet" (which he had refused to let Craig enter) after he passed, that it was actually a shrine to his deceased mother. He visits his gravestone, apologizing for his messages. He theorizes that Harrigan's odd text messages to him are his way of begging Craig to let his spirit rest in peace and for him to move forward in the here and now.
As he leaves Harrigan's grave, Craig visits his own mother's and collapses in tears, begging for forgiveness. He then rushes to the town quarry, contemplating the water while standing very near the edge before throwing his old phone into the water, but finds himself unable to do the same with his new phone. As Craig walks away, he quietly narrates that when he himself passes on and is buried, he wants his pockets to be empty.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 45% of 67 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "Despite a pair of layered performances from its talented leads,Mr. Harrigan's Phonenever quite connects with the source material's intriguing themes."[8]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 55 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[9]
InCommon Sense Media, Brian Costello gave it a rating of four out of five, saying that "viewers might expect a horror-thriller, but this is more of acoming-of-agestory about the perils of revenge and a reflection on how we've changed since the arrival of the smartphone."[10]InThe Hollywood Reporter, Frank Scheck said that "unfortunately, despite its intriguing premise,Mr. Harrigan's Phonelacks the necessary ingredient to make it truly memorable; it simply isn't very scary."[11]
In theArizona Republic,[12]Bill Goodykoontz gave it four out of five, saying that "as with the greatest King stories, the best parts here are not the horror elements (of which there are few). It's the time spent with the characters."[13]OnCinemaBlend,[12]Eric Eisenberg gave it two out of five stars, saying that "it's a dull and lagging feature that tries to be both a coming-of-age drama and a supernatural horror film, and it ends up failing to make an emotional impact with either genre."[14]
Writing inThe Guardian, Benjamin Lee also gave the film two out of five stars, calling it "...a competently made yet utterly inconsequential pre-Halloween time-waster."[15]OnIGN, Ryan Leston said, "what’s worse is that this potentially terrifying tale does almost nothing of any horror value throughout its overly long runtime. There are no jump scares, no dream sequences, no monsters, no gore, or anything remotely resembling a hefty-enough scare to warrant calling this a horror film."[16]

A life well lived".[143]Upon hearing of his death, Canadian Prime MinisterJustin Trudeauwrote, "We've lost one of the greats. Donald Sutherland brought a level of brilliance to his craft few could match. A remarkable, legendary actor — and a great Canadian".

The long list of Sutherland's roles and accomplishments shows a man who understood emotion well. But it's this marriage of suspicion and empathy, human feeling and the fear of humanity gone wrong, that secured his place in acting history and made him an uncommon kind of star. He didn't disappear into a role, not exactly; he was too distinctive for that. More often, the role disappeared into him, and the result was something unforgettable".
Helen Mirrennamed Sutherland as "one of the smartest actors I ever worked with. He had a wonderful enquiring brain and a great knowledge of a wide variety of subjects. He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity, and with seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became."[156]David Oyelowo, who worked with Sutherland on what became his final performance inLawmen: Bass Reeves,stated that "Given the iconic status he rightly achieved, having a front row seat to Donald Sutherland's last onscreen performance was both a privilege and clear evidence to me of his deep passion for the craft of acting. The glint in his eye was that of an inquisitive, hungry artist still on the hunt for the truth. Seeing that glint, up close, in the eyes of a legend was something to behold."[157]Jane Fonda, who worked with Sutherland on the 1971 filmKlute, wrote: "Donald was a brilliant actor and a complex man who shared quite a few adventures with me, such as theFTA Show, an anti-Vietnam war tour that performed for 60,000 active duty soldiers, sailors, and marines in Hawaii, Okinawa, the Philippines, and Japan in 1971. I am heartbroken."[158]
Sutherland'sBBCobituary says that the "late Donald Sutherland cast a literal and figurative shadow over his industry for almost 50 years".[159]The Guardian'sPeter Bradshawwrote that "Sutherland was an utterly unique actor and irreplaceable star" and "was an aristocrat of screen actors".[160]Variety'sOwen Gleibermanwrote that "in 1970, Donald Sutherland ... was the coolest movie star on the planet. The moment I saw him in "MASH," I knew he was the person I wanted to be, the same way that I wanted to beMick JaggerorSteve McQueen".[161]Canadian Prime MinisterJustin Trudeaustated, "He was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft, and truly a great Canadian artist and he will be deeply missed."[162]
Over his career he receivednumerous accoladesincluding aPrimetime Emmy Award, aGolden Globe Award, and anAcademy Honorary Award.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second.
