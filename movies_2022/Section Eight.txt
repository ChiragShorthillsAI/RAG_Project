The company is headquartered inChatsworth, California.
Founded in 1981 as aNASDAQ-listed public company known as Image Entertainment, Image began as a distributor ofLaserDiscs, whose sound and picture quality surpassed that ofVHSandBeta, the dominant tape formats of the time. In its earlier years, the company originally distributed X-rated titles in addition to mainstream titles.[4]Image successfully secured exclusive output deals with major studios such asUniversal Studios,20th Century Fox,Orion Pictures, andThe Walt Disney Company, and grew to become the dominant distributor of the format. The company was trading under the symbol "DISK".
In August 1994, Image entered theCD-ROMmarket, releasing movies on the CD-ROM format.[5]
As the 1990s came to a close and Laserdiscs gave way to DVDs, Image re-focused on the fledgling format that quickly came to dominate the home video marketplace. While studios were busy managing the transition from VHS to DVD, Image began to acquire DVD rights to long-form music concert programs, television programming, foreign films and a broad array of special interest programming fromGRB Entertainment,20th Television/Foxstar Productions,Orion Pictures,Playboy Home EntertainmentandUniversal Pictures, all of which were being ignored by the major studios and music labels.[6]
In 2005, Image signed a distribution deal withBandai Visualto distribute selectanimetitles under the Honneamise label.[7]The deal ended in March 2007, when Bandai Visual switched over toGeneon USA.[8]
Image continued to work with its long-term partner,Criterion Collection, as well as hundreds of independent content producers and rights holders to bring products to the marketplace. By the 10th anniversary of the DVD, Image has once again established itself as a dominant distributor of independently produced programs. In 2008, Image began to expand its release schedule to include feature films.
On August 31, 2010,Sony Pictures Home Entertainmentpartnered with Image Entertainment in a multi-year agreement, marketing and distributing some DVDs and Blu-rays by Image. Image retains its own sales and marketing.[9]The deal was expired in April 2012, when Mill Creek Entertainment agreed to release the most ofSony Pictureslibraries. On April 27, 2011, Image Entertainment made a long-term agreement withLakeshore Entertainmentto distribute their film library on home media. This also gave them access to theNew World Pictureslibrary which Lakeshore acquired in 1996, with many of the titles not issued on Blu-ray at the time.[10]Incidentally, Image originally released a number of New World titles on laserdisc from the late 80's to early 90's. 
On April 2, 2012, it was announced that RLJ Acquisition, Inc. had entered into an agreement to acquire Image Entertainment as well as Acorn Media and plan to merge the two companies. The two companies operate under the banner "RLJ Entertainment".[11]The company was then renamed RLJ Entertainment.[12]In 2014, RLJ acquired British media distributor Acorn Media UK, this deal also included 64% inAgatha Christie Limited.[13]

He lived inSpångauntil the age of 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland,Ångermanland.[1][2][3]Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth,[4][5]but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957.[6][7][8]He has two sisters, Katarina and Annika and an elder brother Johan.[3]Lundgren claims his father was physically abusive and took out his own personal frustrations on his wife and son. He has stated that, during his tirades, his father would call him a "loser", which motivated him later as he grew more ambitious to prove himself. But he also said, "I still love my father, no matter what happened. There are many things about him I still admire. As a child, I was probably too much like him, very stubborn—perhaps that's what he couldn't deal with."[3]He has cited his troubled relationship with his father as the reason he developed a desire to participate in heavy contact sports such as boxing and karate.[3]
Lundgren has said that, as a child, he was insecure and suffered from allergies, describing himself as a "runt".[3][9]He showed a keen interest in drumming and had aspirations to become a rock star.[3]At age seven, he triedjudoandGōjū-ryū. He took upKyokushinkarateat the age of 10, and beganlifting weightsas a teenager.[9]Lundgren stated that "My dad always told me that if I wanted to make something special with my life, I had to go to America."[3]After graduating from high school with straight A's, he spent time in the United States in the 1970s on various academic scholarships, studying chemical engineering atWashington State University1976–1977,[10]andClemson University[11]prior to serving his mandatory one year in theSwedish Coastal Artilleryat theCoastal Ranger School. In the late 1970s, he enrolled at theRoyal Institute of Technologyin Stockholm and graduated in the early 1980s with a degree inchemical engineering.[3][12]
Amidst his years of studying, Lundgren honed hiskarateskills by training in a dojo for five years, and attained ablack beltinKyokushinby the late 1970s. He captained the Swedish Kyokushin karate team, and was a challenger at the 1979 World Open Tournament (arranged by the Kyokushin Karate Organization).[13]He won the European championships in 1980 and 1981, and a full-contact karate tournament in Australia in 1982.[14]In 1982, Lundgren graduated with amaster's degreein chemical engineering from theUniversity of Sydney.[15]During his time inSydney, he earned a living as abouncerin a nightclub in the notoriousKing's Crossarea.[16]
Lundgren was awarded aFulbright ScholarshiptoMITin 1983.[17]However, while preparing for the move toBoston, he was spotted in the nightclub where he worked in Sydney and was hired byGrace Jonesas a bodyguard, and the two became lovers.[18]He moved with Jones to New York City, where he dabbled in modeling at theZoli Agencybut was described as "a bit too tall and muscular for a model's size 40".[3]He earned a living as a bouncer at the Manhattan nightclubThe Limelight, which was housed in the formerEpiscopalChurch of the Holy Communion, working withChazz Palminteri.[3]In the daytime, he studied drama at the Warren Robertson Theatre Workshop and has said that "my time in New York City opened up my adolescent Swedish eyes to a multitude of different people and lifestyles, mostly in the arts. I hung out withAndy Warhol,Keith Haring,Iman, andSteve Rubell, danced atStudio 54, and studied acting withAndie MacDowellandTom Hulce."[3]Friends told him he should be in movies.[3]He quit studying at MIT after two weeks to pursue acting.[17][19]Lundgren said after being exposed to the entertainment business, he found it more attractive and rewarding than chemical engineering, so he decided to pursue a career in acting.[18]
Lundgren made his film debut in the 1985James BondfilmA View to a Kill,Roger Moore's final film as 007, in the minor role of Venz, aKGBassassin.[20][21]His former loverGrace Jones, who portrayed the villainMay Day, personally recommended him.[22]According to Lundgren, Moore said of him, "Dolph is larger than Denmark."[23]
Upon learning thatSylvester Stallonewas seeking an imposing fighter to play Soviet boxerIvan DragoinRocky IV(1985), Lundgren sent videos and pictures of himself to a distant contact of Stallone, eventually reaching him. Lundgren tried out for the role, but as he himself has stated, he was initially turned down because he was too tall.[24]Lundgren eventually beat 5,000 other hopefuls to land his breakout role opposite Stallone,Carl Weathers, andBrigitte Nielsen. To improve his physique and athletic abilities, he trained intensely inbodybuildingandboxingfor five months before the film was shot. Lundgren said: "We trained six days a week—weights in the morning for about an hour, then boxing in the afternoon. We did a split of chest and back one day and then shoulders, legs, and arms the next. We boxed for an hour and a half, practiced the fight choreography, and did bag work and abs."[25]He weighed 240 pounds during filming,[25]but in the film he was billed at 260 pounds, one shipping above of Drago, "He's a exceptional 250 pounds of merciless fighting machine, Drago is listed come to behold 270 pounds, the best that Soviet science & medicine can create".[26]His character's lines "If he dies, he dies" and "I must break you" are amongst the best known of theRockyseries, and have often been cited in popular culture.[27][28]Lundgren hit Stallone so hard during the filming of a fight scene that Stallone was in intensive care in the St. John's Hospital for nine days with a blood pressure of 290, due to swelling of thepericardial sacaround his heart.[29]Lundgren later fought in a real boxing match against formerUFCfighterOleg Taktarov, and lost via decision.[30]Lundgren has highlighted the premiere ofRocky IVat theMann Village Theatre,[31][32][33]inWestwood, Los Angeles, as the moment which changed his life, remarking: "I walked in to a Westwood movie theater as Grace Jones' boyfriend and walked out ninety minutes later as the movie star Dolph Lundgren. I was shell-shocked for years from the mind-boggling and daunting experience of being a student-athlete from tiny Sweden suddenly having to live up a new action-star persona."[3]
In 1987, Lundgren released on home media a workout video calledMaximum Potential,[34]and he also got his first lead role asHe-ManinMasters of the Universe, based on thepopular children's toyline and cartoon, directed byGary Goddard.[35]Lundgren weighed his all-time heaviest during the filming at 280 pounds.[25]The film was a critical failure and viewed as far too violent for a family picture.[36][37]It is referred to as a "flop" byVarietymagazine,[38]and has a 13% "rotten" rating atRotten Tomatoes.[39]Lundgren was criticized for being too wooden as a leading man, and it was dismissed as "a glossy fantasy starring monosyllabic Dolph Lundgren".[40]
In 1988, he starred inJoseph Zito'sRed Scorpion. Lundgren plays a SovietKGBagent who is sent to an African country to assassinate the leader of ananti-communistrebel movement, but eventually switches sides.[41]The film was poorly received and has an 17% "rotten" rating at Rotten Tomatoes.[42]Stephen HoldenofThe New York Timessaid: "Dolph Lundgren's pectorals are the real stars ofRed Scorpion,an action-adventure movie set in the fictional African country of Mombaka. Filmed from below so that one has the sense of peering up at a massive kinetic sculpture, his glistening torso, which over the course of the film is subjected to assorted tortures, is the movie's primary visual focus whenever the action slows down. And since Mr. Lundgren remains stone-faced, rarely speaking except to issue commands in a surprisingly hesitant monotone, his heaving chest actually communicates more emotion than his mumbling lips."[43]
In 1989, Lundgren then starred asMarvel ComicsadaptationThe Punisherplaying the title role. Directed byMark Goldblatt, the film changes some details of the character's origin, and eliminates the signature skull logo. These elements troubled fans of the comic book upon its release and were dismissive. Also initial reviews found it to be a trashy comic book film. The film had a troubled release as the studios who made it were changed ownership. While the film was theatrically released internationally, the film went direct-to-video in the US. However over the years the film developed a cult with some who think it's the best adaptation of the comic. The film was re-evaluated with a much more positive outlook who find Lundgren's performance solid as a ghostly and soul depraved vigilante.[44]
In 1990, Lundgren starred inCraig R. Baxley's sci-fi thrillerI Come in Peace(also known asDark Angel) oppositeBrian Benben,Betsy Brantley, Matthias Hues, andJay Bilas. Lundgren plays a toughHoustoncop with an inner sensitivity,[45]who does not let the rules of police procedure prevent him pursuing his mission to wipe out a gang of drug dealers who killed his partner. Lundgren said of his role: "What attracted me to Dark Angel is that I get to do more than just action. There's some romance, some comedy, some drama. I actually have some clever dialogue in this one. I get to act."[46]
In 1991, Lundgren starred inManny Coto's action filmCover UpoppositeLouis Gossett Jr.Lundgren portrays a US Marine veteran turned reporter, who finds his own life in jeopardy after stumbling across a political cover-up.[47]InMark L. Lester's martial arts action filmShowdown in Little Tokyo, he andBrandon Leeplay police officers investigating theyakuza.[48][49]The film received a mainly negative reception from critics and was criticized for its violence;Vincent CanbyofThe New York Timesdescribed it as "violent, but spiritless."[50]Varietywrote: "Lundgren can hold his own with other action leads as an actor and could easily be Van Damme-marketable if only he'd devote as much attention to quality control as he does to pectoral development."[51]David J. Fox of theLos Angeles Times, however, described the film as a "class act", and some retrospective critics find it to be entertaining for its genre.[52][53][54][55]
In 1992, Lundgren starred in the sci-fi action pictureUniversal Soldierdirected byRoland Emmerich. Lundgren (as Sergeant Andrew Scott) andJean-Claude Van Damme(asLuc Deveraux) play U.S. soldiers who died during theVietnam War,[56]only to be laterreanimatedin a secret Army project to be sent on missions as GR operatives. At the1992 Cannes Film Festival, Van Damme and Lundgren were involved in a verbal altercation that almost turned physical, but it was believed to have only been a publicity stunt.[57][58]Universal Soldieropened in theatres on 10 July 1992, a moderate success domestically with $36,299,898 in US ticket sales, but a major blockbuster worldwide, making over $65 million overseas, which earned the film a total of $102 million worldwide, on a $23 million budget.[59]Despite being a box office hit, it was not well-received; mainstream critics dismissed the movie as aTerminator 2rip-off.[57][60][61][62]Film criticRoger Ebertsaid: "it must be fairly thankless to play lunks who have to fight for the entire length of a movie while exchanging monosyllabic idiocies", and includedUniversal Soldierin his bookI Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie.[57][58]
In 1993, Lundgren starred oppositeKristian AlfonsoandGeorge SegalinVic Armstrong'sJoshua Tree.[63]Lundgren plays Wellman Anthony Santee, a former racecar driver who is framed by police officer Frank Severance (Segal) for the murder of a highway patrolman. Much of the film was filmed in theAlabama Hillsof the Sierra Nevada and the desert of theJoshua Tree National Parkof southeast California.[64]
In 1994, Lundgren starred inBruce Malmuth'sPentathlonas an East GermanOlympicgold medalistpentathleteon the run from an abusive coach.[65]Lundgren trained with the U.S. pentathlon team in preparation for the role,[66]which later led to him being selected to serve as the (non-competing) Team Leader of the 1996 U.S. OlympicModern Pentathlonteam during theAtlanta Games, to promote the image of the sport and to coordinate planning and other details between the team and theUnited States Olympic Committee.[67]The film was seen negatively by most critics;Film Reviewsaid it was "appallingly acted and monotonous"[68]and Video Movie Guide 2002 described it as a "sillyCold Warthriller".[69]
Later in 1994, Lundgren appeared inPerry Lang'sMen of War(scripted byJohn Sayles) alongsideCharlotte LewisandBD Wong, as Nick Gunar, a former Special Ops soldier who leads a group of mercenaries to a treasure island in theSouth China Sea. The film was well received by some critics. One author said "Men of Warinvokes the most vividly remembered fighting in a foreign land of recent Western history. This innovation, associating the muscle image with the Vietnam experience, is carried over into other contemporary muscle films."[70]Another said, "fine performances by an all-star Dolph Lundgren as a mercenary assigned to 'convince' a cast in this offbeat and disturbing film."[71]
In 1995, Lundgren appeared inRobert Longo'sJohnny Mnemonic, co-starringKeanu Reeves. The film portrays screenwriterWilliam Gibson'sdystopiancyberpunkview of the future with the world dominated bymegacorporationsand with strongEast Asianinfluences.[72]Reeves plays the title character, a man with acyberneticbrain implant designed to store information. Lundgren plays Karl Honig, aJesus-obsessed hitman and street preacher who wears a robe and carries a shepherd's staff.[72][73]Critical response was negative overall; Roger Ebert said, "Johnny Mnemonic is one of the great gestures of recent cinema, a movie which doesn't deserve one nanosecond of serious analysis."[74]The film was a financial disappointment, grossing $19,075,720 in the domestic American market against its $26m budget. The cloak worn by Lundgren in the film is now located in the lobby of the Famous Players Coliseum inMississauga, Ontario, it was his last theatrical release film until 2010.[75]Later in 1995, Lundgren appeared inTed Kotcheff'sThe Shooter, an action drama in which he plays Michael Dane, a U.S. Marshall who gets caught up in politics when he is hired to solve the assassination of a Cuban ambassador.
In 1996, Lundgren starred inRussell Mulcahy'sSilent Trigger, playing a formerSpecial Forcesagent who joins a secretive government agency as an assassin.[76][77]The Motion Picture Guide to the films of 1997 said, "this stylish but empty thriller gives square-jawed Dolph Lundgren another shot at straight-to-video immortality".[76]

After retiring from boxing in 1994, Rourke returned to acting and had supporting roles in several films such asThe Rainmaker(1997),Buffalo '66(1998),Animal Factory,Get Carter(both 2000),The Pledge(2001),Spun(2002),Once Upon a Time in Mexico(2003),Man on Fire(2004) andDomino(2005). In 2005, Rourke made a comeback in mainstream Hollywood circles with a lead role in the neo-noir action thrillerSin City, for which he won awards from theChicago Film Critics Association, theIrish Film and Television Awards, and the Online Film Critics Society.
This comeback culminated in his portraying aging wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson in the sports drama filmThe Wrestler(2008). For the role, Rourke won theGolden Globe AwardandBAFTA Award for Best Actor, and received a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Actor.[3]After this, Rourke appeared in several commercially successful films;Iron Man 2,The Expendables(both 2010) andImmortals(2011), before primarily going on to work in mostlydirect-to-videoproductions and someindependent filmssuch asAshby(2015),Nightmare Cinema(2018), andThe Palace(2023).
Philip Andre Rourke Jr. was born on September 16, 1952, inSchenectady, New York,[1]to Annette (néeCameron) and Philip Andre Rourke (1924–1982).[4]He hasIrishandFrenchancestry.[5]He was raisedCatholicand still practices his faith.[6][7][8]His father left the family when Rourke was young. After his parents divorced, his mother married Eugene Addis, aMiami Beachpolice officer with five sons, and moved Rourke and two younger siblings toSouth Florida.[9]There, he graduated fromMiami Beach Senior High Schoolin 1971.[10]
"My stepfather used to crack my head just because he felt like it. He was big, very big, and mean. And he was physically abusive to my mother. I hated the f***er for hurting her, for making her afraid. For years, I wanted nothing more than to take him down. In our neighborhood, there was some community services center set up to give kids a place to go and to keep us out of trouble. That's where I first found a speed [punching] bag. To me, it represented a ticket to manhood..."
During his teenage years, Rourke focused his attention mainly on sports. He took up self-defense training at theBoys ClubofMiami.[citation needed]It was there that he learned boxing skills and decided on an amateur career.
At age 12, Rourke won his first boxing match as a 112-pound (51 kg)flyweight,[12]fighting some of his early matches under the name Phil Rourke. He continued his boxing training at the famed5th Street Gym, inMiami Beach, Florida. In 1969, Rourke, then weighing 140 pounds (63.5 kg),[citation needed]sparred with former World Welterweight ChampionLuis Rodríguez. Rodríguez was the number one–ratedmiddleweight(154 lb to 160 lb) boxer in the world and was training for his match with world championNino Benvenuti. Rourke says he received aconcussionfrom his sparring match with Rodríguez.[13]
At the 1971FloridaGolden Gloves, Rourke suffered another concussion in a boxing match. After being told by doctors to take a year off and rest, Rourke temporarily retired from the ring. From 1964 to 1973, Rourke compiled an amateur boxing record of 27 wins (including 12 straight knockouts), including a first-round knockout win over John Carver and decision victories over Ronnie Carter and Javier Villanueva, and three defeats.[12]
In 1971, as a senior atMiami Beach Senior High School, Rourke had a small acting role in theJay W. Jensen–directed school playThe Serpent.[14]However, Rourke's interests were geared to boxing, and he never appeared in any other school productions. Soon after he temporarily gave up boxing, a friend at theUniversity of Miamitold Rourke about a play he was directing,Deathwatch, and how the man playing the role of Green Eyes had quit. Rourke got the part and immediately became enamored with acting. Borrowing $400 from his sister, he moved to New York,[15]working an assortment of odd jobs while studying withActors Studioalumni Walter Lott andSandra Seacat.[16][17]It was under the latter's tutelage, Rourke later recalled, that "everything started to click." Seacat motivated Rourke to find his father, from whom he was separated for more than twenty years.[18]
During his appearance onInside the Actors Studio, after the release ofThe Wrestler, hostJames Liptondisclosed that Rourke had been selected to the Actors Studio in his first audition, whichElia Kazanis reported to have said was the "best audition in thirty years".
Appearing primarily in television films during the late 1970s, Rourke made his feature film debut with a small role inSteven Spielberg's1941. He played Ritchie,Dennis Christopher's bullying and ill-fated co-worker in the 1980 slasher filmFade to Black. However, it was in 1981, with his portrayal of anarsonistinBody Heat, that Rourke first received significant attention, despite his modest time on screen. The following year, he drew further critical accolades for his portrayal as the suave compulsive gambler "Boogie" Sheftell inBarry Levinson'sDiner, in which Rourke co-starred, alongsidePaul Reiser,Daniel Stern,Steve Guttenberg,Tim DalyandKevin Bacon; theNational Society of Film Criticsnamed him Best Supporting Actor that year. Soon thereafter, Rourke starred inRumble Fish,Francis Ford Coppola's follow-up toThe Outsiders.
Rourke's performance in the filmThe Pope of Greenwich VillagealongsideDaryl HannahandEric Robertsalso caught the attention of critics, although the film was not financially successful. In the mid-1980s, Rourke earned himself additional leading roles. His role oppositeKim Basingerin the erotic drama9½ Weekshelped him gainsex symbolstatus.[19]He received critical praise for his work inBarbet Schroeder'sBarflyas thealcoholicwriterHenry Chinaski(the literaryalter egoofCharles Bukowski), co-starringFaye Dunaway, and inYear of the Dragon, written byOliver Stone.
In 1987, Rourke appeared inAngel Heart. The film was nominated for several awards. It was seen as controversial by some, owing to a sex scene involvingCosby Showcast memberLisa Bonet, who won an award for her part in the film.[20]Although some of Rourke's work was viewed as controversial in the US, he was well received by European, and especially French audiences, who loved the "rumpled, slightly dirty, sordid ... rebel persona"[21]that he projected inYear of the Dragon,9½ Weeks,Angel Heart, andDesperate Hours. DirectorAdrian Lynesaid that had Rourke died after the release ofAngel Heart, he would have become a bigger phenomenon thanJames Dean.[13]
In the late 1980s, Rourke performed withDavid Bowieon theNever Let Me Downalbum. Around the same time, he also wrote his first screenplay,Homeboy, a boxing tale in which he starred. In 1989, Rourke starred in the docudramaFrancesco, portrayingSt. Francis of Assisi. This was followed byWild Orchid, another critically panned film, which gained him a nomination for aRazzieaward (also forDesperate Hours). In 1991, he starred in the box office bombHarley Davidson and the Marlboro Manas Harley Davidson, a biker whose best friend, Marlboro, was played byDon Johnson. In his last role before departing for the boxing ring, Rourke played an arms dealer chased byWillem DafoeandSamuel L. JacksoninWhite Sands, afilm noirthat reviewers found stylish but incoherent.
[22][23]
Rourke's acting career eventually became overshadowed by his personal life and career decisions. Directors such asAlan Parkerfound it difficult to work with him. Parker stated that "working with Mickey is a nightmare. He is very dangerous on the set because you never know what he is going to do."[21]In a documentary on the special editionDVDofTombstone, actorMichael Biehn, who plays the part ofJohnny Ringo, mentions that his role was first offered to Rourke.[citation needed][24]Rourke has allegedly turned down several roles in high-profile films, including48 Hrs.,Platoon,Highlander,Top Gun,Beverly Hills Cop,The Untouchables,Rain Man,The Silence of the Lambs,Pulp Fiction,[25]andDeath Proof.
In 1991, Rourke decided that he "had to go back to boxing" because he felt that he "was self-destructing ... [and] had no respect for [himself as] an actor".[2]Rourke was undefeated in eight fights, with six wins (four by knockout) and two draws. He fought internationally in countries including Spain, Japan, and Germany.[26]During his boxing career, Rourke suffered a number of injuries, including a broken nose, toe, and ribs, a split tongue, and a compressed cheekbone. He also suffered from short-term memory loss.[27]
His trainer during most of his boxing career wasHells Angelsmember, actor, and celebritybodyguardChuck Zito.[28]Freddie Roachalso trained Rourke for seven fights.[29]Rourke's entrance song into the ring was oftenGuns N' Roses' "Sweet Child o' Mine" (to which reference is made in his filmThe Wrestler, in which Rourke's character enters his final match of the film to the song playing over the loudspeakers).[30]Boxing promoters said that Rourke was too old to succeed against top-level fighters. Indeed, Rourke himself admits that entering the ring was a sort of personal test: "[I] just wanted to give it a shot, test myself that way physically, while I still had time."[31]Rourke's boxing career resulted in a notable physical change in the 1990s, as his face neededreconstructive surgeryto mend his injuries.
On November 28, 2014, Rourke briefly returned to the boxing ring and fought 29-year-old Elliot Seymour inMoscow, Russia.[32]It was Rourke's first boxing match in over 20 years. Talks of him being involved in four more matches were released by Rourke himself after the match. He won the exhibition fight in the second round by TKO. The fight is not counted in his professional record since it was an exhibition match. The opponent later stated that he threw the fight, having been promised payment to take a dive in the second round.[33]
In the early 1990s, Rourke was offered and declined the role ofButch Coolidge, which later becameBruce Willis's role inPulp Fiction.[34]After his retirement from boxing, Rourke did accept supporting roles in several 1990s films, includingFrancis Ford Coppola'sadaptationofJohn Grisham'sThe Rainmaker,Vincent Gallo'sBuffalo '66,Steve Buscemi'sAnimal Factory,Sean Penn'sThe Pledge, andSylvester Stallone's remake ofGet Carter. Rourke also has written several films under the name Sir Eddie Cook, includingBullet, in which he co-starred withTupac Shakur.
While Rourke was also selected for a significant role inTerrence Malick'sThe Thin Red Line, his part ended up on thecutting room floor. Rourke also played a small part in the filmThursday, in which he plays a crooked cop. He also had a lead role in 1997'sDouble Team, which co-starred martial arts actorJean-Claude Van Dammeand formerNBAplayerDennis Rodman. It was Rourke's first over-the-top action film role, in which he played the lead villain. During that same year, he filmedAnother 9½ Weeks, a sequel to9½ Weeks, which received only limited distribution. He ended the 1990s with thedirect-to-videofilmsOut in Fifty,Shadesand television filmShergar, about the kidnapping of Epsom Derby-winning thoroughbred racehorseShergar. Rourke has expressed his bitterness over that period of his career, stating that he came to consider himself a "has-been" and lived for a time in "a state of shame".[35]
In 2001, Rourke appeared as the villain inEnrique Iglesias's music video for "Hero", which also featuredJennifer Love Hewitt. In 2002, he took the role of The Cook inJonas Åkerlund'sSpun, teaming up once again withEric Roberts. His first collaborations with directorsRobert RodriguezandTony Scott, inOnce Upon a Time in MexicoandMan on Fire, respectively, were in smaller roles. Nonetheless, these directors subsequently decided to cast Rourke in lead roles in their next films. In 2005, Rourke made his comeback in mainstream Hollywood circles with a lead role asMarvinRobert Rodriguez's adaptation ofFrank Miller'sSin City. Rourke received awards from theChicago Film Critics Association, the IFTA, and the Online Film Critics Society, as well as Man of the Year fromTotal Filmmagazine that year.

Despite having withdrawn from acting at various points, and having made films that he now sees as a creative "sellout" (the action filmHarley Davidson and the Marlboro Man), Rourke stated that "all that I have been through ...[has] made me a better, more interesting actor". Rourke's renewed interest in pursuing acting can be seen in his statement that "my best work is still ahead of me".[31]
Rourke had a role in the film version ofThe Informers, playing Peter, an amoral former studio security guard who plots to kidnap a small child. In 2008, Rourke played the lead inDarren Aronofsky'sThe Wrestler, winner of theGolden LionAward for Best Film at theVenice Film Festival, about washed-up professional wrestler Randy "The Ram" Robinson.[37]Regarding first reading thescreenplay, he stated that he originally "didn't care for it".
"I didn't really care for the script, but I wanted to work with Darren and I kind of thought that whoever wrote the script hadn't spent as much time as I had around these kind of people and he wouldn't have spoken the way the dude was speaking. And, so Darren let merewriteall my part and he put the periods in and crossed the T's. So once we made that change I was okay with it."[38]
He also spoke on personal concern and hesitance of being in a film about wrestling, for he perceived it as being "pre-arranged andpre-choreographed". As he trained for the film, he developed an appreciation and respect for what real-life pro wrestlers do to prepare for the ring:
I kept getting hurt. I think I had threeMRIsin two months because I wasn't landing right. These guys take several years to learn how to land and I think after I started getting hurt doing it, I started to realize these guys are really suffering and I kind of gained a respect for their sport.[38]

Rourke gave his dogs credit during his Golden Globe Best Actor acceptance speech January 11, 2009: "I'd like to thank all my dogs. The ones that are here, the ones that aren't here anymore because sometimes when a man's alone, that's all you got is your dog. And they've meant the world to me."[77]The day of the2009 Golden Globes, he toldBarbara Waltersthat "I sort of self-destructed and everything came out about 14 years ago or so ... the wife had left, the career was over, the money was not an ounce. The dogs were there when no one else was there." Asked by Walters if he had consideredsuicide, he responded:
Yeah, I didn't want to be here, but I didn't want to kill myself. I just wanted to push a button and disappear.... I think I hadn't left the house for four or five months, and I was sitting in the closet, sleeping in the closet for some reason, and I was in a bad place, and I just remember I was thinking, "Oh, man, if I do this," [and] then I looked at my dog, Beau Jack, and he made a sound, like a little almost human sound. I don't have kids, the dogs became everything to me. The dog was looking at me going, "Who's going to take care of me?"
Beau Jack sired two of Rourke's later pets, Loki and her littermate Chocolate.[79]Beau Jack died in 2002, although Rourke reportedly gave him 45 minutes ofmouth-to-mouth resuscitation.[76][80]Chocolate was the subject of a children's book,Chocolate at the Four Seasons, about his temporary stay with producerBonnie Timmermann.[81]Chocolate returned to Rourke and died in 2006.[81]In addition to those dogs and several other past pets, Rourke currently owns a chihuahua named Jaws who appeared with him in his 2009 PETA ad, as well as in the filmOnce Upon a Time in Mexico.[74]He has had as many as seven dogs at one time, back in 2005.[80]Jaws originally was named "Little Mickey" and was originally slated to be euthanized. Rourke also believed Jaws was previously abused.[82]At the time of his Golden Globes tribute to his pets, Rourke owned five chihuahuas: Loki, Jaws, Ruby Baby, La Negra and Bella Loca.[76]About a month later, on February 16, 2009, Loki died in Rourke's arms at the age of 18.[83]
