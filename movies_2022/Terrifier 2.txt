Terrifier 2is a 2022 Americansupernaturalslasher film[2][6][7]written, edited, and directed byDamien Leone. It is the sequel toTerrifier(2016) and the second installment in theTerrifierfilm series. It includes the return ofDavid Howard ThorntonandSamantha Scaffidi, who portrayedArt the ClownandVictoria Heyes, respectively, in the first film, and starsLauren LaVera, Elliott Fullam, Sarah Voigt, Kailey Hyman, and Casey Hartnett. The plot follows Art's resurrection and pursuit onHalloweennight of teenageSienna Shaw(LaVera), who discovers that she is destined to defeat him.
The film originated from a feature film concept Leone began developing shortly after filming his directorial debut short filmThe 9th Circle(2008). The concept of the planned film focused heavily on an angel-dressed heroine and ultimately fell apart. Following its predecessor's release, Leone wanted to bring the heroine back—she would evolve into Sienna, someone Leone describes as the "heart and soul" ofTerrifier 2. Leone spent three months writing a character-driven screenplay following criticism of the first film's perceived lack of narrative.
Funding was exacting as the script was more ambitious than the first film and required a bigger budget. Leone secured finances from private investors prior to filming, and he launched anIndiegogocampaign with a $50,000 goal to produce a practical effects-driven scene. The campaign was a massive success, reaching over 430% of the initial goal with a donation total of $250,000. It is one of the numerous filmsimpacted by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, withprincipal photographycoming to a halt mid-2020 due to thepandemic lockdowns.
Terrifier 2had its premiere at theFrightFeston August 29, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 6, byCinedigm. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for LaVera and Thornton's performances, though the film's runtime received some criticism. Many critics considered the film to be an improvement over its predecessor. A sequel,Terrifier 3, was released in October 2024.
After being resurrected by an unknown entity following the Miles County Massacre,[a]Art the Clownbrutally murders the coroner examining his body and goes to the laundromat to clean his blood-soaked garments, where he encounters the Little Pale Girl—a mysterious entity in similar clown attire. A lone patron sees Art interacting with the girl — who is invisible to him — before being killed.
One year later, teenagerSienna Shawis preparing her Halloween costume: a Valkyrie character designed by her recently deceased father. Her younger brother Jonathan has become fixated with Art since discovering art of him in their father's sketchbook. That night, Sienna has a nightmare about a show called "The Clown Cafe" starring Art. In the dream, she has to fend him off and the only thing that can save her from his jerry-rigged flamethrower is her sword.  She awakens to a fire burning the dresser the sword was resting on, but the sword is mysteriously unscathed.
That day, Halloween, Jonathan sees Art and the Little Pale Girl at school playing with a deadopossumand gets the blame. Sienna has a panic attack when her friends Allie and Brooke discussVictoria Heyes's mutilation of talk show host Monica Brown.[a]Sienna and Allie go to the costume shop, where they encounter Art. Art kills the shop vendor. He then arrives at Allie's home trick or treating. Allie ridicules him, calling him a "mime gimmick." That night Art breaks into Allie's home andbrutally maimsher to death.
Jonathan shows Sienna and their mother, Barbara, his father's sketchbook, filled with newspaper clippings revealing that the Little Pale Girl bears resemblance to Art's first victim Emily Crane. He believes their father knew how to stop Art, saying that he gifted her the sword for that purpose. Sienna departs for a Halloween party, Jonathan flees after Barbara slaps him, then Barbara is shot and killed by Art. Art kidnaps Jonathan when he returns home and steals Sienna's sword.
At the Halloween party, Brooke spikes Sienna's drink withMDMAand she has a panic attack after seeing the Little Pale Girl in the crowd. Brooke's boyfriend, Jeff, is driving them home when Sienna's lured to The Terrifier attraction at the old abandoned carnival. The Little Pale Girl imitates Jonathan pleading for a ride home, so while Sienna goes searching alone after a big argument on the way there, Art murders Jeff. Brooke is chased into the park and murdered as well, and Sienna is beaten unconscious after discovering her body.
Sienna awakens to find Art using a scalpel on her brother and begins attacking him with his own weapons. The siblings discover Art is immortal and he wears them out with his endurance. The Terrifier attraction is slowly revealed to be the location where Art chained his victims up in the originalThe 9th Circleshort. He stabs Sienna with her father's sword and throws her into a portal to hell where she encounters the "Clown Cafe" again. Sienna dies and is resurrected by the sword. She decapitates Art while he's biting into Jonathan's calves, and the Little Pale Girl takes his head and leaves the two alone.
In a mid-credits scene, an orderly at Miles County Psychiatric is heard humming a "The Clown Cafe" theme song and tells another orderly she picked the tune up from Victoria. Victoria is down the hall, reinstitutionalized, writing "Vicky + Art" and obscenities on the wall with her own blood. She gives birth to Art's living head. Victoria's eyes glow exactly like the Little Pale Girl's eyes.
Additionally,Jenna Kanelland Catherine Corcoran are credited for photographic cameos as Tara and Dawn, respectively.
"...That was my favorite character that I ever wrote, ever. So I knew that character was always there; I knew one day I was going to bring that character back and finally make a movie with her. So she is the heart and soul ofPart 2, and everything revolves around that character. So I always knew that seed was there."
On February 12, 2019, Leone revealed in a post on his social media, showing the cover page, that the first draft of the screenplay was complete.[11]Leone envisioned the concept of the film dating back to 2008—with an idea of an angel-warrior costumed heroine battling the Art the Clown character. This heroine was the basis of Sienna, who Leone wanted to bring back forTerrifier 2, which he knew he wanted to make while filming the first film. The writing process for the film differed from Leone's previous film projects, in which he had to work around part-time jobs. Leone spent three consecutive months writing. Much of his focus was on developing a character that could rival Art in popularity. When he was not writing, he would read books about screenwriting and listen to screenwriters discuss their processes with writing.[12][10]
He opted to bring back the angel-attired heroine a decade later and adapt her into Sienna Shaw.[10]Leone described much of the screenplay revolving around the teenage girl, his favorite character he has ever written.[10]Leone describes the screenplay as much bigger in scope than the previous film and recollects not considering a budget while writing.[10]
One of the factors during writing was establishing an adversary to Art—something inspired by the relationship betweensuperheroBatmanandsupervillainJoker.[13]During a lunch with Leone and David Howard Thornton, the actress who plays Sienna, Lauren LaVera, was told of this intended dynamic between her character and Art.[13]Besides Sienna, LaVera recollects the script focusing heavily on Sienna's younger brother Jonathan, their mother, and her friends—all of whom play a crucial part in the story.[13]
Both Thornton and Scaffidi were confirmed to reprise their respective roles of Art the Clown and Victoria Heyes,[14]becoming the only returning cast members of the prior film, other than a brief voice cameo by Michael Leavy (who played Will the Exterminator in the original film) as the Club Announcer and DJ voice, and Corey Duval, who returns as the coroner from the first installment. There were also reports of Steven Della Salla and Jason Leavy, the two cops in the original film, returning in cameo appearances as well; the three are all producers on the second installment.[15]On September 11, 2019, it was announced that actress Lauren LaVera was cast in the lead role of Sienna Shaw. On October 15, it was announced thatFelissa Rose,Chris JerichoandTamara Glynnhad joined the cast incameo roles.[16][17]Actress Leah Voysey had auditioned for Sienna and her friends Ally and Brooke before co-producer Jason Leavy, who knew about Voysey's singing and guitar skills, invited her to be the host that performed a song in the Clown Cafe dream sequence, which after being filmed led to Leone bringing Voysey to appear as a nurse in the credits scene.[18]
While Leone had secured full funding for the film from a handful of private investors prior to filming, he launched anIndiegogowith a $50k goal to finance a practical effects driven scene and to attach a well known actor to the project. The campaign was a major success, grossing over $125k in the first week.[19]It reached a total of $250k by the end of the campaign, 430% more than the initial goal.
Filming began in October 2019.[20]While a majority of the film's main story line had already been completed,principal photographywas halted due toCOVID-19, becoming one of many filmsaffected by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.[21]On September 7, Leone revealed that he was in the process of working on theprosthetic makeupfor Victoria's disfigured face in preparation of filmingSamantha Scaffidi's scenes.[22]As Sienna's costume received a positive reception whenproduction stillswere officially released, when asked about the attire, LaVera described liking it on the first day of wearing it but began to feel disdain for it throughout the course of filming as it was uncomfortable to wear. She even obtained blisters from wearing it.[23]Filming quietly resumed and wrapped on July 10, 2021.[24]The post-credits scene would originally reveal Art growing out of the back of Victoria's head, but onceMalignanthad a similar getup for its villain, Leone discarded it and shot another sequence where Victoria gave birth to Art's head.[25]
A teaser trailer forTerrifier 2was released on July 24, 2020.[26][27]MovieWeb's Jeremy Dick commented on the teaser, stating that "the teaser is pretty exciting to watch for anyone who enjoyed the first movie."[28]
It was also announced that a three-issue limited release comic book series would be issued prior to the film's release.[29][30]
The film has gained significant media coverage because of the gore effects, particularly for the notorious "Bedroom Scene," depicting the lengthy murder of the supporting character Allie (Casey Hartnett).[31]Leone has stated it was the most challenging and technical scene to film out of the entire production—three minutes depicting mutilation.[31]Leone had to create a life-size replicapuppetof Hartnett that could work as an animatronic.[31]He stated, "I had people under the bed with rods going through it into her limbs and behind the wall operating her head. I put some rubber gloves in her chest with tubing to have her breathe."[31]Leone digitally added Hartnett's eye onto the puppet when Allie awakens to her mother.[31]
Terrifier 2had its world premiere at theFantastic Feston August 29, 2022,[32]and screened the same day atFright Festin London.[33]It was theatrically released on October 6, 2022.[32]The film was later available to stream onScreambox, as well as play at various "prominent genre festivals" prior to its official release.[6]Leone had previously expressed a desire to release the picture "road showstyle" once finished.[34][35]
While initially set for aone-week limited theatrical release, audience demand led Bloody Disgusting to announce thatTerrifier 2would remain in theaters for a second weekend on October 12, 2022.[36]On October 17, this run was extended once more for another week.[37]
The film was released forVODon November 11, 2022, followed by aBlu-rayand DVD release on December 27, 2022.[38]It grossed $3.9 million in home sales.[39]In June 2024, aVHSversion of the film  was released by Witter Entertainment throughWalmart.[40]

Speaking of the film's box office success, Leone said, "I did not expect it to make this kind of splash or play in theaters, honestly, other than maybe a few arthouse theaters. To see it snowballing, the word of mouth growing, people getting sick and fainting and it really taking off, I never expected this or for it to make millions of dollars in theaters."[45]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 86% of 78 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's consensus reads: "Terrifier 2outdoes the original in every way – which makes it bad news for the squeamish, but a bloody good time for genre enthusiasts."[46]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100, based on eight critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[47]
Jeffrey Anderson ofCommon Sense Mediadescribed the characters as memorable, particularly Sienna, due to her character development. Anderson states that "human life starts to matter more here than it did in the first film."[48]Matt Donato ofIGNwhile stating the film has "underdeveloped subplots and themes" noted it as an improvement of the original film and highlighted the performance of LaVera, writing that she "rules as Sienna in her angel-winged fantasy armor as a final girl fighting for family, facing her demons, and screaming bloody war cries in Art's mocking face."[49]Matthew Jackson ofPastewrote that "LaVera, tasked with injecting humanity into the sequel, lives up to this task with pure star power."[50]Trace Sauveur ofThe Austin Chroniclepraised the "sense of physicality and comic timing" of Thornton.[51]Sammy Gecsoyler fromThe Guardianrated the film a total of three stars out of five, praising the film's creative kills, and performances, while giving some criticism towards its runtime.[52]
The film was not without its detractors.Owen GleibermanofVarietycommended the film for effectively capturing the look and feel of 1970's and 1980's slasher films, as well as the soundtrack and special effects, but was critical of the relentless brutality and unsympathetic characters.[53]Adam Graham ofThe Detroit Newsrated the film a grade D, calling it "[a] bludgeoning exercise in splatter, which drags on well past the two hour mark with no sense of purpose other than its own inert attempts to shock."[54]
Following its release, there were several reports of viewers vomiting andfaintingduring their screenings ofTerrifier 2, with one instance allegedly having emergency services being called.[55][56]Speaking on the audience reactions to the film, director Damien Leone remarked, "Listen, I would have loved to have a couple of walk-outs, I think that's sort of a badge of honor because it is an intense movie. I don't want people fainting, getting hurt during the movie. But it's surreal."[57]
A novelization ofTerrifier 2byTim Waggonerwas released by Titans Books on October 29, 2024.[59]
In 2019, both Leone and Thornton stated that aTerrifier 3is planned,[60]along with further installments that will slowly build on Art's background and motives.[61]In October 2022, Leone said he had an entire treatment for a third film but it "is getting so big that it could potentially split into aPart 4because [he] wouldn't want to make another 2 hour 20 minute movie."[45]The Coven Films, a French distribution company and executive producer of the series, announced in May 2023 that filming for the third would begin in either November or December of that year with an expected release in late 2024, a "low-mid seven figure budget." Leone, producer Phil Falcone, and actors David Howard Thornton and Lauren LaVera are all slated to reprise their roles.[62][63]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
