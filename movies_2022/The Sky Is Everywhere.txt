Apple TV+is an Americansubscriptionover-the-topstreaming serviceowned byApple. The service launched on November 1, 2019, and it offers a selection of original production film and television series calledApple Originals.[9]The service was announced during theApple Special Event of March 2019,[10][11]where entertainers from Apple TV+ projects appeared onstage, includingJennifer Aniston,Oprah Winfrey, andSteven Spielberg.[12][13]The service can be accessed through Apple's website and through theApple TV app, which has gradually become available on manyApple devicesand some major competingdigital media players,[14]including somesmart TVmodels and video-game consoles.
Apple plans to expand the services' availability,[15][16][17][18]and there are workarounds for subscribers whose device is not presently supported.[14]Access is included as part of theApple Onesubscription.[19]Most of the content is available inDolby Visionprofile 5 andDolby Atmos. Upon its debut, Apple TV+ was available in about 100 countries, fewer than the reported target of 150.[20][21]Several countries were excluded from service despite other Apple products being available.[22][23][24]Commentators noted that the fairly wide initial reach of the service offered Apple an advantage over other recently launched services such asDisney+, and that because Apple distributes its own content through the service instead of distributing licensed third-party content (as, for example,Huludoes) it will not be limited by licensing issues during its expansion.[25][26][27]
By early 2020, Apple TV+ had poor growth and low subscriber numbers relative to competing services.[28][29][30][31]In the middle of that year, Apple began to license older television programs and films, attempting to stay competitive with other services, attract and retain a viewership for its original content, and convert into subscribers users who were trialing the service.[29][28]Since then, the service has become the home to critically acclaimed content: between September 2021 and March 2022, Apple TV+ netted aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy SerieswithTed Lassoand theAcademy Award for Best PicturewithCODA, the first Best Picture win for a film distributed by a streaming service.[32]Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston have all signed a multi year look deal with Apple TV+ to develop more television projects under their production companies after their critically acclaimed shows. Apple TV+ (along with the simultaneously announceda-la-cartepremium-videosubscription aggregation serviceApple TV app) is part of a concerted effort by Apple to expand its service revenues.[16][33][34]The service's programming arm isApple Studios.
Apple had long been rumored to have an interest in beginning astreaming televisionservice, and in 2015 entered into negotiations with varioustelevision studiosand programmers to aggregate their content for a live-television streaming bundle.[35][36]Negotiations fell apart over differing views on how to value the content, lack of transparency on details, and the personality of Apple's chief negotiator,Eddy Cue.[35]
In October 2016, Apple CEOTim Cooksaid that television is "of intense interest to me and other people here", and added that Apple has "started focusing on some original content", which he called "a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it's an area we're focused on."[37]
In June 2017, Apple began to take the first major steps to form its new television unit by hiring the co-presidents ofSony Pictures Television, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to oversee all aspects of worldwide video programming.[36][2]In August, Matt Cherniss was hired as Head of Domestic Creative Development, reporting directly to Van Amburg and Erlicht.[3]For the rest of 2017, Apple continued to fill out its executive team for Apple TV+, with Kim Rozenfeld joining as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted,Jay Huntjoining as Creative Director for Europe,Morgan Wandelljoining as Head of International Creative Development, Tara Sorensen joining as Head of Kids Programming, and Max Aronson, Ali Woodruff, Carina Walker, and Michelle Lee joining as development and creative executives.[38][39][4][6][40]
Throughout 2019, Apple continued to build out its unscripted content team, with Molly Thompson hired as Head of Documentaries in April.[5]In November, Rozenfeld stepped down as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted to focus on producing content again with a first-look content production deal with Apple under his Half Full Productions. Cherniss took over Rozenfeld's duties overseeing current scripted programming.[41]
In May 2018, it was reported that Apple was expected to start a sister project to its original content service, and begin selling subscriptions to certain video services directly via itsApple TV appapplication oniOSandtvOS, rather than asking Apple device owners to subscribe to those services through applications individually downloaded from Apple's app store.[42]
In October 2018, it was reported that Apple would distribute its future original content through a still-in-development digital video service within its TV application that is pre-installed in all iOS and tvOS devices. The service was expected to feature both original content, free to owners of Apple devices, as well as subscription "channels" from legacy media companies such asHBOandStarz, which would allow customers to sign up for online-only services.[43]Later that month, it was reported that Apple intended to roll out the service in the U.S. during the first half of 2019 and that it would expand its availability to around 100 countries in the months after its launch.[44]
On March 25, 2019, Apple held a press event to announce Apple TV+. At the event, Apple showed a teaser of its upcoming original content and formally announced some of it, with actors and producers attached to the content appearing on stage. The announced content includedHelpsters, the first series fromSesame Workshop, the producer ofSesame Street, and Oprah Winfrey's first projects for Apple TV+, including a documentary under the working titleToxic Labor[45]about workplace sexual harassment, a documentary series about mental health, and a revival ofOprah's Book Clubas a standalone television series.[46][47]
On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would launch on November 1 at $4.99 per month (with a 1-week free trial) for an account that can be shared with up to six family members. Apple also announced that it would be give away a year of Apple TV+ to anyone who bought a newApple TV,Mac,iPad,iPhone, oriPod Touchbeginning that day.[48]Student subscribers to the monthlyApple Musicservice at a discounted rate also have Apple TV+ bundled in at no additional cost for the time being.[49]
From the start of Apple TV+ on November 1, 2019, Apple offered a free one-year subscription to anyone buying certain of its hardware products (an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod Touch, or Mac).[50]Apple initially extended the free year that was due to end on November 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021,[51]but then announced in mid-January 2021 that it would extend it a second time to July 31, 2021.[52]
In mid-June 2021, Apple added a note to its website advising customers that new users subscribing after June 30, 2021, would receive only three months of free subscription instead of a year.[53]
On October 24, 2022, Apple announced it was to increase pricing of Apple TV+ (along withApple MusicandApple One) subscriptions in many regions. The monthly plan increased $2 to $6.99, and the annual plan increased $20 to $69.[54]
During the announcement of Apple TV+, Apple announced a number of prominent writers, directors, and stars who would be featured in the service. The signing of high-profile talent was intended to attract viewers to the service.[55]
As of March 2019[update], five of the upcoming series had completed production, with six more well into filming.[56]On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would have eight original series (seven scripted and one unscripted) and one original documentary available at launch, with plans to launch new original content every month thereafter. Most series were expected to launch with three episodes, with a new episode released weekly thereafter, although Apple said that not all series would follow that model and that some series might instead launch all at once.[57]
Early critical reaction to the bulk of the service's programming was mixed to poor, but commentators predicted that Apple would have time to grow into its new role as a content provider and to produce well-regarded content, especially as the free year of the service provided with many Apple product purchases enticed users to continue watching, and for some to eventually pay for a subscription, as new series are released.[58][59][15]
On March 13, 2020, Apple suspended all active filming on Apple TV+ shows due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, and all production on series was postponed for an indeterminate period.[60]
Apple's decision in mid-2020 to license large swaths of existing older content for the Apple TV+ service was viewed, in part, as buying time for its original content production during the pandemic by keeping users engaged and in a habit of visiting the service regularly, so that a viewer base would be in place by the time new Apple original content was released.[29][28]
In addition, Apple TV+ endeavored to gain new high-profile content, taking advantage of the pandemic's disruption of theatrical film releases. Among these acquisitions were the 2020 feature filmGreyhoundstarringTom Hanks, which was purchased fromSony Picturesfor $70 million.[61]In July 2020, the service won a heated bidding war forEmancipation, a slavery-based action-thriller starringWill Smithand directed byAntoine Fuqua.[62]Apple paid a record $105 million for the rights.[62]Apple also reportedly considered a $350 to $400 million offer for the rights to stream theJames BondfilmNo Time to Die, which was far short of the $650 to $800 million studioMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(owned byAmazon, which is one of theBig Techcompanies alongside Apple) was willing to accept.[63]
In October 2017, following reports ofsexual abuse allegationsagainst producerHarvey Weinstein, Apple announced that it was severing ties withThe Weinstein Company(TWC) and cancelling a plannedbiopicseries aboutElvis Presley.[64]
In April 2018, Apple signedKerry Ehrinto a multi-year deal to produce original content.[65]Ehrin and Apple renewed the deal in May 2020.[66]
In June 2018, Apple signed theWriters Guild of America's minimum basic agreement andOprah Winfreyto a multi-year content partnership.[67][68]The same month, Apple announced that it had given a multi-series order toSesame Workshopto produce variouslive-actionand animated series as well as a single puppet-based series.[69]
In September 2018, it was reported that Apple had decided to shelveVital Signs, a six-episode biopic television series centering on the life of hip-hop producer and performerDr. Dreand starringIan McShane,Sam Rockwell, andMichael K. Williams, due to concerns about the show's content being too graphic, with moments cited including characters usingcocaine, instances ofgun violence, and an explicitorgyscene. Reports further indicated that Apple CEO Tim Cook was taking a hands-on approach to the company's Worldwide Video Unit, with programming decisions reportedly being aligned to Cook's personal taste, with a preference for family-friendly shows. Various programs in different stages of production apparently had their content altered, including the toning down ofThe Morning Showand the removal of crucifixes from a scene in theM. Night Shyamalandrama series. Additionally, Apple reportedly passed on a television series from comedianWhitney Cummingsabout the #MeToo movement because it was "too sensitive a topic".[70][71][72]Cummings's series was ultimately put into development byAmazon Prime Videoin October 2018.[73]
In November 2018, Apple entered into a multi-year agreement with entertainment companyA24to produce a slate of original films in partnership with its Worldwide Video Unit.[74]The same month, Apple signed a deal with DHX Media (nowWildBrain) and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide to develop and produce original programs, including new series, specials, and shorts based on thePeanutscharacters. One of the first productions created through the deal was an original short-form,STEM-relatedseriesfeaturing astronautSnoopy.[75]Also that month, Apple signedJustin Linand his production company, Perfect Storm Entertainment, to a multi-year overall deal to produce original television content.[76]

Apple is seemingly pleased with its box-office returns, which reached $221 million and nearly made back its budget. It is apparent that Apple is attempting to compete with movie production companies.[119][120][121]
In March 2022, Apple announced that it would airFriday Night Baseball, a weekly doubleheader ofMajor League Baseball(MLB) games with live pre- and postgame shows on Apple TV+ in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom starting in the2022 Major League Baseball season.[122]

Apple TV+ subscribers can watch select games at no additional charge, and receive a discount on the MLS Season Pass.[126][127]
In mid-2020, Apple began discussions with film and television studios to license their previously released content as part of an effort to build a back catalog of non-original films and television shows for the streaming service.[30][29]The shift was designed to help the service better compete against the large content libraries competitors likeNetflixhave.[30]This represented a pivot for Apple, which had initially attempted to build the service entirely on original content, avoiding licensing fees to help keep monthly subscription fees low, and relying on its Apple TV Channels content partners to supply other content users wanted.[30][29]
Analysts believed that the addition of older, highly re-watchable content like popular sitcoms and well-liked films would help retain the slowly growing subscriber base while Apple continues to develop original content.[28]The shift was also an acknowledgement of poor growth, especially relative to competing services.[28]The back catalog development was also seen as a move to attempt to persuade free trial users to transition into paid users as the first wave of one-year trials was scheduled to expire in November 2020.[29]
On May 26, 2020, Apple announced its first acquisition of catalogue content would be theFraggle Rockseries.[128]In addition to being the exclusive home of the 1983–1987Jim Henson Companyseries, Apple would develop a new, full-length, rebootedFraggle Rockseries after the success of theFraggle Rock: Rock On!short-form series on Apple TV+.[129]On October 19, 2020, Apple announced the exclusive transmission rights of the various animated productions of thePeanutsfranchise, withdrawing them from broadcast television after 55 years; as part of that agreement, Apple TV+ must make the majorPeanutsspecials available for free in short windows.[130]After an outcry from fans of the specials, Apple sublicensedA Charlie Brown ThanksgivingandA Charlie Brown ChristmastoPBSfor commercial-free airing.[131]In 2021,It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brownalso came to the PBS rotation. The PBS sublicensing arrangement ended before October 2022.[132]
In March 2024, Apple made 51 catalog films available under a "Great Movies special collection" banner.[133]
Apple has announced a number of partnerships, bundles, and initiatives to increase subscriber growth in the service.[when?]
It has included Apple TV+ in several reduced-cost bundles designed to increase uptake and stickiness of subscriptions, including a bundle with Apple Music available for students, a bundle offeringCBS All AccessandShowtimefor an additional $9.99 monthly for TV+ subscribers, and a bundling of the service as part of theApple Onesubscription package.[134][135][136]
It has partnered with largecable television MSOsand telecommunicationsmobile network operators, such asAltice USA,[137]the UK'sEE,[138]and Ireland'sEir TV,[139][140]to offer those systems' customers Apple TV+ as part of a bundle, sometimes including anApple TV 4Kset-top box.
By February 2020, about 10 million people had signed up for Apple TV+.[30][29]This included users who received a free one-year trial with the purchase of an Apple device,[30][29]although it was estimated that less than 10% of Apple device owners eligible for the trial had activated it, perhaps because of Apple's failure to promote the service, Apple's desire to slow the uptake rate due to accounting concerns, or users' lack of interest in the service's perceived poor content options.[30]About half of those 10 million users actively used the service.[31]In late 2020, the continuing expansion of availability of the Apple TV app to a growing number of smart TV platforms and to newer lines ofPlayStationandXboxvideo game consoles (specifically, thePS4andPS5, and the XboxOne,Series S, andSeries X[141]) was seen as potentially boosting subscriber numbers for Apple TV+, including as part of Apple One subscription bundle purchases.[142]But Apple has created no native TV app for theWindowsandAndroidplatformsor official method to stream the content toChromecastor on theAndroid TVplatform (except for selectSonyBraviatelevision models[143]), leaving users of those devices to use a web browser to view Apple TV+ content, where possible, or to employ other workarounds, especially for sending Apple TV+ content to a television set.[14]On December 16, 2020,Googleannounced it would add the Apple TV app to itsChromecast with Google TVdevice in early 2021 and to its Android TV platform by June 1, 2021;[144][145]Google made Apple TV available on its Chromecast with Google TV, as well as on selectSonyandTCLsmart TVsrunning the Google TV interface, on February 18, 2021.[146]On December 18, 2020, theBritish Urban Film Festivalannounced that it was to be the first UK film festival to host all of its official selections on theApple TV app.[147]
The service received several nominations for the2021 Golden Globe Awardsin both the television and film categories and was regarded as having "established an impressive track record for turning out consistently good—and sometimes great—programming for subscribers, despite offering a much, much smaller overall offering."[148]Apple's seriesTed Lassowon fourPrimetime Emmy Awards in 2021, includingOutstanding Comedy Series,Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series(Jason Sudeikis),Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series(Brett Goldstein) andOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series(Hannah Waddingham).[149]
Apple TV+ is the first streaming service to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture, withCODAat the94th Academy Awards.[150]As of March 2022, it is estimated to have 25 million paid subscribers and an additional 50 million viewers who access the service via promotions.[151]
Apple is partnering withBharti Airtelto provide its music and video streaming services to the telecom company's premium clients in India from 2024 at no cost, providing the American behemoth access to thousands of users in the most populated country.[152]
On the 96th Academy Awards, Apple Films earned a record breaking 14 Oscar nominations, withKillers of the Flower Moonreceiving 10 andNapoleonreceiving 4. This marked the second time an Apple Films received a Best Picture nomination.[citation needed]
In October 2024,Amazonannounced that Apple TV+ would be available as an add-on subscription onAmazon Prime Videoin the United States later that month on October 15, with other countries to follow.[153][154]
In January 2025, Apple TV+ announced that the service would be free for the first weekend of 2025, from January 3 - January 5, as a way to "increase publicity and global knowledge" regarding their service, worldwide.
In February 2025, Apple announced the Apple TV+ app is available to download fromGoogle Playon Android mobile devices.[155]

Guests on the podcast have includedBo Burnham,Sofia Coppola,Paul Schrader,Martin Scorsese, andAlia Shawkat. Despite lacking any pre-defined structure, episodes generally contain discussions around recent works of the two guests, allowing for branching discussions to other areas. The first two guests wereBarry Jenkins(director of A24'sMoonlight) andGreta Gerwig(director of A24'sLady Bird), who both discussed what it's like to make a movie about the place they grew up.[39]As of October 18, 2023, 38 episodes have been released.[40][41][42]
On March 26, 2018, co-founder John Hodges announced that he was exiting the company.[43]On November 15, 2018, A24 andAppleannounced that they had entered into a multi-year partnership where A24 will produce a slate of original films for Apple. This was not afirst-look deal, meaning that A24 can continue to produce and acquire films to release outside of the deal, and that it would not affect previous deals that A24 had signed with other companies. It is currently unknown if this slate of films will have a theatrical release or be exclusive to Apple's streaming service,Apple TV+.[44]
On November 13, 2019, A24 entered into a premium cable television broadcast deal withShowtime Networks, covering all film releases through November 1, 2022. The deal excludes films that are already part of the Apple partnership.[45]
In July 2021, A24 explored a possible buyout for between $2.5 billion to $3 billion.[46]In January 2022, formerHBOandAmazon MGM StudiosTV executive Nick Hall joined A24 to oversee creative for the company's growing television slate.[47]In April 2022, the company released its membership "AAA24" forsubscription; members' benefits include early access to merch drops, exclusive merch for members only, monthly merch discounts for members, and azineevery four months.[6]
In March 2023, A24 became the first independent studio to sweepBest Picture,Best Director, and all four acting categories in a single year at the95th Academy Awards.[48][49][50]That same month, the company bought distribution rights to two older films released before the company's inception, starting withDarren Aronofsky'sPi(1998) andJonathan Demme'sStop Making Sense(1984), both of which areremastered versions.[51][52][53][54]
In May 2023,Leonine Studios, a German independent film distributor, partnered with A24 to set up a joint label called "A24 | Leonine Studios", which will distribute films in Austria and Germany.[55]The next month, it was reported that formerDisney General EntertainmentChairmanPeter Ricesigned a deal with A24 as an independent producer, agreeing to co-finance films for global distribution.[56]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, A24 was approved to continue filming and promotional activities since they do not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP).[57]
In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

Josephine Decker(born April 2, 1981) is an English–born American filmmaker. Films she has directed includeButter on the Latch(2013),Thou Wast Mild and Lovely(2014),Madeline's Madeline(2018),Shirley(2020), andThe Sky is Everywhere(2022). She also co-directed the documentaryBi the Way(2008) with Brittany Blockman.
Decker was born in London and raised inTexas. As a child, she played the piano and dreamed of being a writer, as well as a photographer forNational Geographic.[1]She graduated fromHighland Park High Schoolin 1999 andPrinceton Universityin 2003, where she aspired to become a conductor and applied for a conducting class.[2]She was inspired to become a filmmaker after watchingMonsters, Inc.[3]
Decker produced and directed her first short film,Naked Princeton, in 2005.
In 2008, Decker co-directed the documentaryBi the Waywith Brittany Blockman, which focused onbisexualityin the United States. Despite being described byVariety's Joe Leydon as a "once-over-lightly examination of an alleged cultural phenomenon",[4]the film went on to win the Alternative Spirit Grand Prize at theRhode Island International Film Festival.[5]
Decker wrote and directed her second short film,Where Are You Going, Elena?, in 2009. In 2012, she wrote and directed the short filmMe the Terrible, which Richard Brody ofThe New Yorkercalled a "wondrous short film."[6]
In May 2010, Decker attended the last day ofMarina Abramović's retrospectiveThe Artist Is PresentatMoMA. As she sat down across from Abramovic, Decker immediately disrobed and stood naked in the middle of the museum until seven security guards escorted her out over the museum’s no-nudity policy. Decker declared that her goal was to be "as vulnerable to [Abramovic] as she constantly makes herself to us."[7]
In 2013, Decker wrote, produced, and directed her first feature film, the experimental psychological thrillerButter on the Latch.  The film garnered praise from Eric Kohn ofIndiewire, who said Decker's career was "one to keep an eye on",[8]and Peter Debruge ofVariety, who wrote that "Decker has fashioned the kind of feature debut the film industry simply doesn’t support, but would do well to encourage: a visually poetic, virtually free-form groove in which emotion, rather than narrative, guides viewers through a young woman’s visit to a Balkan folk music camp."[9]Decker was included inFilmmaker Magazine's2013 list of 25 New Faces in Independent Film.[2]
In early 2014, she completed her second theatrical film, the experimental erotic thrillerThou Wast Mild and Lovely, starringSophie Trauband Decker's frequent collaboratorJoe Swanberg.[10]To raise money for the film's post-production,[11]Decker ran a crowdfunding campaign onKickstarterwith a goal of $15,500.[12]The campaign closed on August 22, 2013, having raised $18,517.[12]In his review, Kohn gave the film a B+ and commented, "Its labyrinthine characteristics suggest the unholy marriage ofIngmar BergmanandDavid Lynch. While nowhere near the same level of refinement as those giants, Decker concocts a wholly enveloping vision of isolation told with a grimly poetic style that wanders all over the place but never stops playing by its own eerie rulebook."[13]
In September, 2014, it was announced thatButter on the LatchandThou Wast Mild and Lovelyhad been picked up for a theatrical andVODdistribution byCinelicious Picswith a planned release set for November, 2014.[10][14]
Decker has also appeared as an actor in many independent films, includingJoe Swanberg'sUncle Kent,Onur Tukel'sRichard's Wedding,Saturday Morning Mystery, the romantic tragedyLoves Her Gun, andStephen Cone'sBlack Box.
In November 2015, Decker served on the jury of the 33rdTorino Film Festival. The festival had paid tribute to her work in the Onde section in 2014.[15]
Decker co-directed with Zefrey Throwell the 2017 documentaryFlames. AsDeadlineput it, "Shot over the course of five years, the project charts the immensely passionate and profound relationship between the two artists, watching the spectacular romance, excitement and adventure of their relationship at its peak, and the fallout as Decker and Throwell clash, falling out of love with each other."[16]
Decker’s third feature film,Madeline's Madeline, screened at theSundanceandBerlinfilm festivals in early 2018.[17][18]It featuresMolly ParkerandMiranda July, and introduces 19-year-oldHelena Howardas a troubled acting student whose "class exercises become increasingly immersive and personal".[18]
In 2020,Neondistributed Decker's featureShirley, inspired by the life of authorShirley Jackson. The film starredElisabeth MossandMichael Stuhlbarg, and was produced byChristine Vachonand executive produced byMartin Scorsese.[19]OnRogerEbert.com, critic Sheila O'Malley called it Decker's "most ambitious film to date."[20]
In a change of pace, Decker directed the coming-of-age dramaThe Sky is Everywhere, which was released in 2022 byApple+andA24.[21]In an interview, Decker said, "I think I was really ready to make something that was a little lighter and had more lightness and less gritty, dark, violent, sexual. Probably for my next movie, I’ll go back into it hard, but this was a nice little respite."[22]
Decker citesAntichrist,Days of Heaven,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, andSilent Lightas her primary influences, as well as the novelEast of Eden, directorJoe Swanberg, and frequent collaboratorSarah Small. She citedBlack Swanas a particular influence onButter on the Latch.[23]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
