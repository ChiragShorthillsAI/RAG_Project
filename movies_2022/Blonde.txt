Six-year-oldNorma Jeane Mortensonis raised by her mentally unstable mother,Gladys Pearl Baker.

Norma Jeane flees to the house of her neighbor, Miss Flynn, who promises she will be fine. Days later, Norma Jeane is sent to anorphanagewhile Gladys is admitted to amental hospital, having been declared unfit to raise a child.
In the 1940s, Norma Jeane has become apin-up modelunder the stage name "Marilyn Monroe," featuring on magazine covers and calendars. While trying to get a break into the acting world, she israpedby film studio presidentMr. Z. In 1951, she auditions for the role of Nell inDon't Bother to Knock; the audition goes awry when she breaks down and leaves in tears, but impresses the casting director enough to give her the part. As her career steadily rises, she meetsCharles "Cass" Chaplin Jr.andEdward G. "Eddy" Robinson Jr., and becomes aloverto both. Norma Jeane lands her breakout role in 1953 withNiagara, but after she is spotted in public with Cass and Eddy, her agent requests that she limit her appearances with them in public, which upsets her as she feels that her Marilynpersonais just a role and not her real self.
Norma Jeane becomespregnantby Cass, much to her delight, but decides to get anabortionout of fear of the child possibly inheriting her mother's mental issues. Cass supports her decision. On the day of the appointment, she changes her mind, but her pleas to cancel the appointment are ignored. After, she breaks things off with Cass and Eddy. She later meetsJoe DiMaggio, a retiredathletewho sympathizes with her when she expresses her desire to leaveHollywoodand become a more serious actress inNew York City. As Norma Jeane beginsGentlemen Prefer Blondes, she receives aletterfrom a man claiming to be her father. She feels disconnected from her onscreen performance at the film'spremiere, saying it is not her. She returns to her hotel room, having been told that someone is waiting for her. Expecting it to be her father, she instead finds DiMaggio, whoproposesto her, which she accepts reluctantly.
Norma Jeane and Joe's marriage sours when Cass and Eddy give Joe some nudepublicityphotographs of her, which enrages him so much that hehitsNorma Jeane and demands that she stops makingThe Seven Year Itch. She goes through with filming nonetheless, doing the famous stunt withthe white dress. When she arrives home, adrunkenJoe screams at her and gets more physically violent. Shedivorceshim shortly after.
In 1955, Norma Jeane auditions for theBroadwayplayMagdaby renowned playwrightArthur Miller. During a read-through, her performance impresses everyone except Miller, but he eventually warms up to her when she gives him some insightful character analysis. Norma Jeane and Arthur marry and move to Maine, where she lives a happy life with him and becomes pregnant again. However, when walking on thebeachone day with a platter of food, she falls andmiscarries. Distraught, she returns to acting.
While filmingSome Like It Hot, Norma Jeane becomes more uncontrollable and mentally disturbed, overwhelmed by the constant press attention, feels that she is becoming a joke, has frequent outbursts on set, especially towardsdirectorBilly Wilder, and grows increasingly distant from Arthur. To cope with her stress, she begins taking pills.
By 1962, she has become dependent on drugs andalcohol.Secret Serviceagents pick up an intoxicated Norma Jeane and take her to a hotel to meetPresident John F. Kennedy, who forces her tofellatehim, before raping her, and then has her taken away after she vomits in his bed. Already dazed and drugged, Norma Jeane begins to wonder if this is what being Marilyn Monroe has led to, and she also hallucinates having another abortion before being sent back toher homein Los Angeles. She learns from Eddy on the phone that Cass has died and left something for her, which she refuses to see initially but is convinced by Eddy, who sends it in a package in the mail. It turns out to be the stuffed tiger she had found when the three of them were together, and the package also contains a letter from Cass, where he confesses that the letters Norma Jeane has been receiving, supposedly from her father, were actually written by him.
Shattered by the revelation, Norma Jeaneoverdoses on barbiturates; as she lies dying on her bed, she has a vision of her father welcoming her to the afterlife.
Andrew Dominik, who directed the film and served as screenwriter, had begun developing the project as early as 2010, which is an adaptation of the novelBlonde(2000), a fictional and controversial account of Monroe's life—and a Pulitzer Prize finalist—byJoyce Carol Oates.[12]Dominik said that he did his own research by reading several of Monroe's biographies and that he used very little of Oates' novelBlondein the movie, but he also added that the book was pretty much the bible for the film.[13]Dominik toldVulturethatBlondeis "a film that definitely has a morality about it. But it swims in very ambiguous waters because I don't think it will be as cut-and-dried as people want to see it. There's something in it to offend everyone."[4]
Dominik discussed his fascination withMarilyn Monroe, stating, "Why is Marilyn Monroe the great female icon of the 20th Century? For men she is an object of sexual desire that is desperately in need of rescue. For women, she embodies all the injustices visited upon the feminine, a sister, a Cinderella, consigned to live among the ashes [...] I want to tell the story of Norma Jean [sic] as a central figure in a fairytale; an orphan child lost in the woods of Hollywood, being consumed by that great icon of the twentieth century."[14]
Dominik described the film as being "more accessible" than his previous projects and revealed that his script contained "very little dialogue", as he preferred to make it more of an "avalanche of images and events." Furthermore, Dominik stated:[15]
It tells the story of how a childhood trauma shapes an adult who's split between a public and a private self. It's basically the story of every human being, but it's using a certain sense of association that we have with something very familiar, just through media exposure. It takes all of those things and turns the meanings of them inside out, according to how she feels, which is basically how we live. It's how we all operate in the world. It just seems to me to be very resonant. I think the project has got a lot of really exciting possibilities, in terms of what can be done, cinematically.
For Dominik,Blondewas his first attempt at developing a film featuring a woman at the center of the story. During a retrospective screening of his Oscar-nominated westernThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford(2007), Dominik stated, "It's a different thing for me to do [...] the main character is female. My films are fairly bereft of women and now I'm imagining what it's like to be one."[16]
WhileNetflixclassifiedBlondeas "a fictional portrait of Marilyn Monroe" on the platform's official website,[17][18]Dominik stated; "I thinkBlondeis a work of fiction and it's got just as much Joyce in it as it does Marilyn. But having said that, I think it's probably closer to the truth than what Fox is pushing to sell Marilyn stuff."[19]
In May 2010, it was announced thatNaomi Wattswould star in the film as Monroe, and that the production, which at this point cost an estimated $20 million, was slated to begin principal photography in January 2011.[14]Principal photography on the film did not commence, with Dominik later stating he hoped it would be his next film, with production commencing in 2013.[20][21]During this time, Dominik directed the crime dramaKilling Them Softly(2012), starringBrad Pitt, who subsequently became interested in the project.[22]
In June 2012, it was announcedPlan B Entertainmentwould produce the film, with Pitt,[23]Dede GardnerandJeremy Kleinerserving as producers, but Watts' participation was in question, as "it's likely that the filmmakers would go in a different direction," according to the report.[24]In April 2014, it was announced thatJessica Chastainhad replaced Watts as Monroe. Chastain had co-starred inTerrence Malick's dramaThe Tree of Life(2011) opposite Pitt, who was instrumental in her casting. The report also revealed that Dominik was planning to begin principal photography in August of that year.[25][26]
Dominik attributed the delays in production partly due to financing: "it's just a question of how much money I can get to make the film. And I really want to make that movie. I've been working on it for years."[16]
In August 2016, it was announced thatNetflixwould distribute the film.[27]
In March 2019, it was announced thatAna de Armaswas in early negotiations to star in the film,[28]replacing Chastain.[15]Dominik noticed de Armas's performance inKnock Knock, and while she went through a long casting process, Dominik secured her the role after the first audition.[29][30]
In preparation, de Armas worked with adialect coachfor a year.[31][32][33]De Armas described her casting process: "I only had to audition for Marilyn once and Andrew said 'It's you,' but I had to audition for everyone else [...] The producers. The money people. I always have people I needed to convince. But I knew I could do it. Playing Marilyn was groundbreaking. A Cuban playing Marilyn Monroe. I wanted it so badly. You see that famous photo of her and she is smiling in the moment, but that's just a slice of what she was really going through at the time."
De Armas considered her relationship with Dominik to be the most collaborative of her career, remarking, "Yes, I have had collaborative relationships, but to get phone calls at midnight because he has an idea and he can't sleep and all of a sudden you can't sleep for the same reason."[34]De Armas read Oates' novel and also said she studied hundreds of photographs, videos, audio recordings, and films.[23]
In August 2019, it was announced thatAdrien Brody,Bobby Cannavale,Julianne Nicholson,Caspar Phillipson,Sara PaxtonandXavier Samueljoined the cast, followed byGarret Dillahunt,Scoot McNairy,Lucy DeVito, Michael Masini,Spencer Garrett,Chris Lemmon,Rebecca Wisocky,Ned BellamyandDan Butlerin September 2019.[35][36]
Vanessa Lemonides provided Monroe's singing voice in the film.[37]
Principal photography began in Los Angeles in August 2019.[36]In April 2022, Dominik confirmed that the filming was finished in July 2021, following theshutdowns as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemicin 2020, and that post-production had also been finished.[38][39]
DuringBlonde's press conference at the79th Venice Film Festival, Dominik said that the initial scenes of the film were shot in the same apartment where Monroe had lived with her mother.[40]Monroe's death scene was also filmed in the same room where she died in real life.[41]"It definitely took on elements of being like a seance," Dominik said.[41]Filming also started on August 4, 2019,[36][41]the 57th anniversary of Monroe's death.[41]De Armas said at the press conference that she believes Monroe's ghost was close to them on set.[40]"I think she was happy. She would also throw things off the wall sometimes and get mad if she didn't like something. Maybe this sounds very mystical, but it is true. We all felt it."[41]De Armas later toldAnOthermagazine that everyone in the crew wrote a message to Monroe in a big card, then they went to the cemetery and put it on her grave. "We were asking for permission in a way. Everyone felt a huge responsibility, and we were very aware of the side of the story we were going to tell—the story of Norma Jeane, the person behind this character, Marilyn Monroe. Who was she really?", she said.[42]
Much ofBlonde's cinematography is digitally shot inblack and white;[43]other portions of the film are incolor,aspect ratios(1:1, 1.37:1, 1.85:1, 2.39:1[44]) shift to depict historical usage.[9][45][46][47]Many scenes are visual homages to classic photographs of Monroe by notable photographers.[46][48][49]Blondewas set to premiere at 2021 Venice Film Festival, but Netflix was unhappy with the final cut it received, and hiredJennifer Lameto help.[50]
Real footage from Monroe's filmography is used in this movie mixed in with scenes recreated by Ana de Armas, who was placed in the filmsAll About Eve(1950),Don't Bother to Knock(1952),Niagara(1953),Gentlemen Prefer Blondes(1953), andSome Like It Hot(1959).[51]Andrew Dominik said that he initially failed to obtain permission fromMetro-Goldwyn-Mayerto use footage from their films, so he had to
recreate some scenes, such as the scene with de Armas andTony CurtisinSome Like It Hot, which he shot with an actor playing Curtis in case he couldn't get permission to use the original footage. Dominik was allowed to use the footage after an MGM executive was fired and was replaced byMichael De Luca, who finally gave him permission to use the film clip.[51]
The score was composed and performed by long-time collaboratorsNick Cave&Warren Ellis, with the soundtrack album released on September 28, 2022.[52]
Blondehad its world premiere in-competition at the79th Venice International Film Festivalon September 8, 2022,[53]followed by a screening at the 48thDeauville American Film Festival.[54]It was released on Netflix on September 28, 2022,[55]after an initial release date of September 23, 2022.[56]
The film also had a limited theatrical release in New York City that began on September 16, 2022, and in other locations on September 23, 2022.[23][57][58]
Blondewas controversial among critics and audiences alike[59]and was described as a "complicated, highly divisive film".[60]Praise was directed towards de Armas's performance,[61][62][63][64]but the response to the writing and Dominik's depiction of Monroe's life polarized critics;[61][65]some found the film's spin on the traditional biopic refreshing,[66][67]while others criticized it as exploitative,[65][68]sexist,[59][68]and dehumanizing.[69][70][71]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes,Blondeholds a rating of 42% based on 318 reviews, with an average of 5.5/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "Ana de Armas' luminous performance makes it difficult to look away, butBlondecan be hard to watch as it teeters between commenting on exploitation and contributing to it."[72]OnMetacritic, which uses aweighted average, the film has a score of 50 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[73]
Reviewing the film following its world premiere at Venice, where it received a 14-minute standing ovation, reducing de Armas to tears,[74][10]Catherine Bray ofEmpirepraised Dominik's visual style and de Armas' performance, but found the film failed at demystifying Monroe's life, writing: "The portrait that this film paints of Monroe depicts a little girl lost, who repeatedly calls her lovers 'Daddy' and reacts to almost every new setback with the same tremulously teary ingénue's pout."[75]Vanity Fair'sRichard Lawsonfound it a "fascinating alternative to the traditional biopic", commending the unconventional storytelling, direction, and de Armas' performance.[76]Owen GleibermanofVarietycalled de Armas' work "a performance ... of breathtaking shimmer and imagination and candor and heartbreak."[77]Deadline Hollywood's Damon Wise stated the film is an "astonishing" way to tell Monroe's life in a fictional sense, as it is "presented as a horror movie in the surreal, nightmarish style" comparable to thefilms of David Lynch, especiallyMulholland Drive(2001).[12]In a very positive review,IGN's Siddhant Adlakha called the film a "dreamlike fictional biopic about Marilyn Monroe" that features "a stunning, volatile performance from Ana de Armas, whose daring vulnerability is matched by director Andrew Dominik's equally daring formal approach".[78]
David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reportercalled it "a must-see", yet also "a work of such wild excesses and questionable cruelty".[79]InGQ, Jack King's review also noted how the film shifts from a "traditional biopic" to "a movie unrelenting in its brutality".[80]The Guardian's Leslie Felperin described the film as "ravishing, moving and intensely irritating" but ultimately "all a bit much", and assigned it a rating of three stars out of five.[81]In a mixed review forIndieWire, Sophie Monks Kaufman called the film a "bizarre, miserablist biopic", admiring de Armas' performance and the cinematography, but criticizing Dominik's portrayal of Monroe: "Dominik critiques the world for reducing his subject down to her topline assets—and then treats her in exactly the same way. His Marilyn is a sexy, breathy blonde with daddy issues. And that's all, folks."[82]
The New York TimescriticManohla Dargispanned the film, criticizing the fact that "once again a director is more interested in examining [Monroe's] body (literally, in this case) than getting inside her mind" and writing "Given all the indignities and horrors that Marilyn Monroe endured during her 36 years, it is a relief that she didn't have to suffer through the vulgarities ofBlonde, the latest necrophiliac entertainment to exploit her."[83]In his negative review,Justin Changfrom theLos Angeles Timesstated that the film "isn't really about Marilyn Monroe. It's about making her suffer."[84]He also opined that the film "turns Marilyn Monroe into an avatar of suffering, dwelling on her pain so obsessively that even the film's fleeting moments of empathy feel like another form of exploitation".[85]
"At times, the movie feels like a slaughterhouse seen from the animal's point of view" wroteBilge Ebiriin his review forVulture, remarking on the film's tendency to elicit strong reactions and emotions from an audience by putting together what he described as a "captivating and terrifying" jigsaw puzzle of Monroe's life.[86]Anthony Lane, in his review forThe New Yorker, praised de Armas' performance and Dominik's visual style, but heavily criticized his portrayal of Monroe, ultimately concluding: "Bedazzling, overlong, and unjust,Blondedoes a grave disservice to the woman whom it purports to honor."[87]In a negative review forSlant Magazine, Jake Cole echoed Lane's sentiment, stating: "Blonde…is the worst kind of feminism, one so absorbed in the desire to 'save' a woman that it victimizes her as much as possible to make its redemption of her that much more praiseworthy."[88]
Writing forTime,Stephanie Zacharekcriticized Dominik for allowing "no room for the real-life Marilyn's multidimensionality", asserting that "Marilyn—the brilliant, perceptive if often difficult performer—is almost nowhere to be seen in Andrew Dominik's willfully clueless Freudian fantasyBlonde".[89]Jessie Thompson ofThe Independentgave the film one star out of five, stating; "Blondeis not a bad film because it is degrading, exploitative and misogynist, even though it is all of those things. It's bad because it's boring, pleased with itself and doesn't have a clue what it's trying to say."[68]
Joyce Carol Oates, the author of the novel on which the film is based, observed a rough cut of the film, and publicly stated: "I have seen the rough cut of Andrew Dominik's adaptation and it is startling, brilliant, very disturbing and perhaps most surprisingly an utterly 'feminist' interpretation... not sure that any male director has ever achieved anything [like] this."[90]
ActressJamie Lee Curtis—who starred opposite Ana de Armas inKnives Out(2019), and whose father,Tony Curtis, starred opposite Monroe inSome Like It Hot(1959) and is featured inBlonde—was impressed with de Armas' performance, after also seeing an early cut: "I dropped to the floor. I couldn't believe it. Ana was completely gone. She was Marilyn."[34]Brad Pitt, who co-produced the film via his Plan B banner praised de Armas' performance, saying "She is phenomenal in it. That's a tough dress to fill. It was 10 years in the making. It wasn't until we found Ana that we could get it across the finish line".[91]ActorCasey Affleckalso praised the film, stating, "I've seen a couple of versions ofBlondeand it's taken him [Dominik] a long time to get it out into the world. But that's just how he is. He's so slow with it. And it's an amazing, beautiful film."[92]
Suzie Kennedy, an English Marilyn Monroe impersonator and historian for over twenty years, openly despised the film, calling it "a terrible movie... an absolute assassination of Marilyn Monroe's legacy... an assassination of an icon," and that it "capitalized on and exploited the deep sadness of Marilyn's life."[93][94]
Upon the trailers' release, de Armas' casting as Monroe received some backlash as some viewers felt her ethnic background did not entirely match Monroe's, with complaints that she still maintained her native Cuban accent.[95][96][23]Regarding her accent, Dominik toldScreen Dailyin February 2022 that there was "work involved" in making the actress "sound American".[97]Monroe's official estate defended de Armas' casting, stating, "Marilyn Monroe is a singular Hollywood and pop culture icon that transcends generations and history. Any actor that steps into that role knows they have big shoes to fill. Based on the trailer alone, it looks like Ana was a great casting choice as she captures Marilyn's glamour, humanity and vulnerability. We can't wait to see the film in its entirety!"[98]
Blondesparked some controversy when its NC-17 rating (meaning adults only) was confirmed, raising concerns that it would be exploitative in its depiction of Monroe.[99][100]The film itself features graphic scenes of sexual abuse, including a rape scene,[101]as well as Monroe having an abortion,[101]and a miscarriage.[12]Writing forJezebel, Kady Ruth Ashcroft remarked on how the rating's relationship with Monroe's enduring status as asex symbolin pop culture prevents the film from achieving its goal of humanizing her, concluding: "Blonde's NC-17 rating is intended as both a warning and restriction as to who can handle the film's mature content. It also acts like a tease—just how scandalous was this sexpot's life anyways?—in a way that may prevent the movie from shrinking Monroe the myth back down to Norma Jean [sic]."[102]
Speaking on the rating in an interview withScreen Daily, Andrew Dominik stated, "It's a demanding movie—it is what it is, it says what it says. And if the audience doesn't like it, that's the fucking audience's problem. It's not running for public office," adding, "If I look at an episode ofEuphoria, it's far more graphic than anything going on inBlonde".[103]In an interview with fashion magazineL'Officiel Italia, de Armas echoed the sentiment, saying, "I don't understand why it happened. I can cite a number of programs or movies that are much more explicit and with a lot more sexual content thanBlonde. But to tell this story it's important to show all those moments in Marilyn's life that brought her to the end she did. It needs to be explained. In the cast everyone knew we should delve into unpleasant territory, it wasn't just up to me".[104]Delving into what Dominik's vision for the film was, de Armas toldRotten Tomatoes, "Andrew's ambitions were very clear from the start—to present a version of Marilyn Monroe's life through her lens. He wanted the world to experience what it actually felt like to not only be Marilyn, but also Norma Jeane. I found that to be the most daring, unapologetic, and feminist take on her story that I had ever seen." She added, "Our movie is not linear or conventional; it is meant to be a sensorial and emotional experience. The film moves along with her feelings and her experiences. There are moments when we are inside of her body and mind, and this will give the audience an opportunity to experience what it was like to be Norma and Marilyn at the same time."[105]
In a piece forGQ, Keith Phipps argues thatBlonde, being an exception from the commercial stigma of having an NC-17 rating due to its exclusive release on a streaming platform, could usher in a new era of films and filmmakers that will "push beyond the restrictions of the R rating", writing, "In theory, the NC-17 rating could thrive on services like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max andBlondecould be a sign of things to come, possibly serving as a cue for other filmmakers to push beyond the restrictions of the R rating."[106]
Writing forIndieWire, Samantha Bergeson claimed the film makes an anti-abortion statement by showing aCGIfetus talking to Monroe.[107]Charles Pulliam-Moore wrote forThe VergethatBlonde's CGI fetus "is anti-abortion propaganda dressed up as art", and called it "a judgmental CGI fetus who sometimes talks to Marilyn Monroe from within her uterus to shame her for having had an abortion in the past."[70]A sentiment shared by abortion rights activists such as Caren Spruch, national director of arts and entertainment engagement at thePlanned Parenthood Federation of America, who called it "medically inaccurate descriptions of fetuses and pregnancy" in a statement toThe Washington Post.[108]Steph Herold, who researches reproductive health at theUniversity of California at San Franciscoand studies abortion depiction in films and television shows, said the scene in which Monroe's character speaks to the fetus "totally infantilized her in ways that I've only seen in anti-abortion propaganda-type movies," Herold said; "I was pretty shocked by it, especially given the platform and the mainstream quality of this movie."[108]
Planned Parenthoodaccused the film of delivering an anti-abortion message about Monroe's abortion, releasing the following statement toThe Hollywood Reportersaying the film was rooted inanti-abortion propaganda;[109]
"As film and TV shapes many people's understanding of sexual and reproductive health, it's critical these depictions accurately portray women's real decisions and experiences. While abortion is safe, essential health care, anti-abortionzealotshave long contributed to abortion stigma by using medically inaccurate descriptions of fetuses and pregnancy. Andrew Dominik's new film, 'Blonde,' bolsters their message with a CGI-talking fetus, depicted to look like a fully-formed baby."[109]
There is no evidence that Monroe ever had an abortion, much less forced procedures as it was portrayed in the movie, according to historianMichelle Vogel, author ofMarilyn Monroe: Her Films, Her Life.[110]"Any talk of pregnancy termination is an assumption on our part. Marilyn loved children and she was desperate to be a mother. Sadly, she never carried a baby to term."[110]It is well-documented that Monroe suffered three miscarriages during her marriage to Arthur Miller; in 1956, in 1957, and again in 1958.[110]In the 1993 biographyMarilyn Monroe: The Biographywritten byDonald Spoto, Monroe's gynecologist, Dr. Leon Krohn, stated; "the rumors of her multiple abortions are ridiculous. She never had even one."[111]
Andrew Dominik denied the film is anti-abortion, saying in a statement toTheWrap:
"I don't think the movie is anti-pro choice. I don't think it is at all. And I'm not convinced that she actually wants to have a baby. I think she has feelings about not having a baby, but I'm not convinced that what she's doing – I mean, she doesn't end up having one. […] There's a wish for baby but there's a fear of baby, and I think that's kind of the central stressor on her."[107]
The Catholic World ReportcalledBlonde"unwittinglypro-life".[112]

Principal shooting in Canada was completed in 2005, thoughThe Assassination's 2006 release was delayed to a fall 2007 release, largely due to studio interference with the film's editing process.[7]Dominik and Pitt were pulling for a less quick-paced and more contemplative cut of the film while the studio wanted "less contemplation and more action". There were reportedly more than a dozen edited versions of the film at one time fighting to be the final cut, the longest version being over four hours.[8]The disputes during post-production lasted for over a year before a final version was settled upon. Over an hour of scenes were deleted for the theatrical version, but Dominik remarked he was still very proud of the theatrical version of the film.[9]The film garnered twoAcademy Awardnominations: Best Cinematography (Deakins) and Best Supporting Actor (Affleck).
Dominik reteamed withBrad Pittin their second collaboration (afterThe Assassination of Jesse James) in a thriller/dark comedy based onGeorge V. Higgins' Boston-set crime novelCogan's Trade.[10]The film was renamedKilling Them Softly.

The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded the film a score of 91, indicating "universal acclaim".[15]Dominik joinedDavid Fincherfor season 2 ofNetflixseriesMindhunter, which debuted in late 2019.[16]Dominik directed two episodes.[16]
In 2022, Dominik completedBlonde, based onJoyce Carol Oates's fictionalMarilyn Monroememoir of the same name, which was scheduled to start shooting in January 2011 but the project was put on hold when he announcedKilling Them Softly. In 2014Jessica Chastainwas in talks to play Monroe.[17]In late 2019, Cuban actressAna de Armaswas cast in the lead role.Blondehad its world premiere at the79th Venice Film Festivalon 8 September 2022,[18]and was released in the United States on 16 September 2022, before its streaming release on 28 September 2022, byNetflix. It is ratedNC-17for its graphic sexual content and is the first NC-17 film released through a streaming service.[19][20]
In 2003,Paramount Picturesapproached Dominik and offered him to direct an adaptation ofAlfred Bester's 1953 novelThe Demolished Man, but as time passed, the project eventually became stuck indevelopment hellwhen there were disagreements about the screenplay.[21][22]By 2003, Dominik had also written an adapted screenplay forThe Killer Inside Me, an acclaimed noir novel byJim Thompson, and was at one point considered to direct it, but dropped out.[23]Michael Winterbottomeventually directed the 2010film.
In 2007,Cormac McCarthy'sCities of the Plainwas in development withJames Francostarring.[24][25]In a 2008 interview, Dominik stated that he has interest in adaptingJim Thompson'sPop. 1280. In 2010, Dominik was writing a script for an American remake of the 2006 French thrillerTell No One. It was unclear if he intended to direct the film.[26]

She then playedBond girlPaloma in theJames BondfilmNo Time to Die(2021) and actressMarilyn Monroein the biographical dramaBlonde(2022), for which she received a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first Cuban to do this.
De Armas was born inHavana, Cuba,[1]and raised inSanta Cruz del Norte.[2]Her maternal grandparents wereSpanish migrants to Cubafrom the regions ofLeónandPalencia, both in the north of Spain.[3][4]Her father Ramón had various jobs, including a bank manager, teacher, school principal and deputy mayor of a town.[5]He previously studied philosophy at a Soviet university.[5][6]Her mother Ana worked in the human resources section of the Ministry of Education.[7][8][9]De Armas has one older brother, Javier, a US–based photographer[5][10]who, in 2020, was questioned by Cuban police due to his critical stance onDecree 349and his links to artists under government surveillance.[11]While de Armas grew up withfood rationing, fuel shortages and electricity blackouts during Cuba'sSpecial Period,[5][12]she has described her early life as happy.[7]
During her childhood and adolescence, de Armas had no Internet access and had limited knowledge of popular culture beyond Cuba.[13]She was allowed to watch "20 minutes of cartoons on Saturday and the Sunday movie matinee."[14]Her family did not own a video or DVD player, and she watched Hollywood movies in her neighbor's apartment.[15]She memorized and practiced monologues in front of a mirror,[16][17]and decided to become an actress when she was 12.[18]In 2002, aged 14, she successfully auditioned to join Havana'sNational Theatre of Cuba.[7][19]She sometimes hitchhiked to attend the "rigorous" course.[20][21]While a student, she filmed three movies.[5][8]She left the four-year drama course shortly before presenting her final thesis because Cuban graduates are forbidden from leaving the country without first completing three years of mandatory service to the community.[8][22]At age 18, with Spanish citizenship through her maternal grandparents,[3][12]she moved toMadridto pursue an acting career.[8]
In her native Cuba, de Armas had a starring role oppositeÁlex GonzálezinManuel Gutiérrez Aragón's romantic dramaUna rosa de Francia(2006).[12]Cuban actorJorge Perugorríasuggested that the director consider de Armas for the role, after meeting her while attending a birthday party with his daughters.[23][24]The director visited de Armas's drama school and interrupted the sixteen-year-old during her audition to inform her that the role was hers.[23][25]She travelled to Spain as part of a promotional tour for the film and was introduced to Juan Lanja, who would later become her Spanish agent.[23]She then starred in the movieEl edén perdido(2007) and had a supporting role inFernando Pérez'sMadrigal(2007), filmed at night without the permission of her drama school tutors.[8]
At age 18, de Armas moved to Madrid. Within two weeks of arriving, she met with casting director Luis San Narciso, who had seen her inUna rosa de Francia.[13]Two months later,[26]he cast her as Carolina in the dramaEl Internado,[8]in which she starred for six seasons from 2007 to 2010. The television show, set in a boarding school, became popular with viewers and made de Armas a celebrity figure in Spain.[8]In a break from filming, she starred in the successful coming-of-age comedyMentiras y Gordas(2009).[27]Despite the popularity ofEl Internado, de Armas felt typecast and was mainly offered roles as youngsters.[13]She asked to be written out of the show in its second to last season.[28]
After spending a few months living in New York City to learn English,[22]de Armas was persuaded to return to Spain to star in seventeen episodes of the historical dramaHispania(2010–2011).[2]She then starred inAntonio Trashorras's horror filmsEl callejón(2011) andAnabel(2015),[29]and in the dramaPor un puñado de besos(2014).[30]During a long period without acting work,[20]de Armas participated in workshops atTomaz Pandur's Madrid theatre company[5]and felt "very anxious" about the lack of momentum in her career.[14]
With encouragement from her newly hired Hollywood agent, she decided to move to Los Angeles.[13]When de Armas first arrived in Los Angeles in 2014,[31]she had to start her career again "from scratch."[15]She spoke very little English and, during early auditions, she often "didn't even know what [she] was saying."[6]She spent four months in full-time education to learn English,[32][28]not wanting to be confined to playing characters written specifically for Latina actresses.[8]She starred oppositeKeanu Reevesin her first Hollywood release—Eli Roth's erotic thrillerKnock Knock(2015)—and learned her lines phonetically.[33]Despite giving a positive review of the film, Randy Cordova of theArizona Republicfound de Armas to be "unconvincing" in her role.[34]Reeves then telephoned de Armas to invite her to star in a Spanish-language role in the thrillerDaughter of Godwhich he acted in and produced.[35]Producer Mark Downie hoped the film would be a star vehicle for de Armas, but due to executive meddling,Daughter of Godwas severely edited with de Armas' former starring role reduced. The film was ultimately released asExposedin 2016.[36][37]Frank ScheckofThe Hollywood Reporternoted that while she was "appealing" in her part, de Armas was unable to demonstrate her "character's intense emotional demands."[38]
De Armas had a supporting role inTodd Phillips'sWar Dogs(2016), acting oppositeMiles Telleras the wife of an arms dealer, and again learned her lines phonetically.[39]David Ehrlich of IndieWire found her to be "memorable in a thankless role".[40]She starred oppositeÉdgar Ramírezin the biopicHands of Stone(2016) as the wife of Panamanian boxerRoberto Durán. Despite its delayed release,Hands of Stonewas the first Hollywood film de Armas had filmed. She was contacted by directorJonathan Jakubowiczwhile still living in Madrid after watching her inEl Internado[28]and asked her to travel to Los Angeles to audition for the Spanish-language part.[12]In reviewing the film, Christy Lemire ofRogerEbert.comdescribed de Armas as "a hugely charismatic presence. But except for a couple of showy moments, she gets little to do besides function as the dutiful wife."[41]
InDenis Villeneuve's futuristic thrillerBlade Runner 2049(2017), de Armas had a supporting role as Joi, theholographicAIgirlfriend ofRyan Gosling's character, a blade runner. Mark Kermode ofThe Guardiansaid she "brings three-dimensional warmth to a character who is essentially a digital projection."[42]Anthony Lane ofThe New Yorkerfound her to be "wondrous": "Whenever Joi appears, the movie's imaginative heart begins to race."[43]While the performance was initially discussed as a breakthrough role,[44][31]the film underperformed commercially, and de Armas spent much of the following year in her native Cuba, where she purchased a house.[33]For her performance, she earned a nomination for theSaturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. Also in 2017, she had a supporting role in the action thrillerOverdriveas the love interest toScott Eastwood's character.[45]Stephen Dalton ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote that she "radiates more kick-ass charisma than her thankless sidekick role might suggest."[46]

She played a Dominican woman withcongestive heart failurein the short film, funded byMontefiore Medical Centerto raise awareness of organ donation.[47]While de Armas's scenes oppositeHimesh Patelin the 2019 romantic comedyYesterdaywere included in the film's trailer, they were cut from the final product. The directorDanny Boylesaid that, while de Armas was "really radiant" in her scenes, the introduction of a love triangle subplot did not test well with audiences.[48]
De Armas's role as an immigrant nurse in the ensemble murder mystery filmKnives Out(2019), written and directed byRian Johnson, was widely praised and marked a breakthrough for the actress.[49]When first approached about the project, she was unenthusiastic about the idea of playing a stereotypical "Latina caretaker" but soon realized that her character was "so much more than that."[50]Tom Shone ofThe Timesremarked, "The film's standout performance comes from its least well-known member, the Cuban de Armas, who manages the difficult task of making goodness interesting."[51]Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiansaid her "striking" performance left a "lasting impression."[52]The film was a major box office success.[53]De Armas was nominated for theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical[54]with her also winning theSaturn Award for Best Supporting Actressand theNational Board of Review Award for Best Castwith the cast.[55]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
