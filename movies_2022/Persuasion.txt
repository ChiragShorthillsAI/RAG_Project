The story begins seven years afterAnne Elliothas broken off herengagementtoFrederick Wentworth, at the time a young and undistinguishednaval officer. He was considered clever, confident and ambitious, but his lowsocial statusand lack of wealth made Anne's friends and family view him as an unsuitable partner. Furthermore, Lady Russell, a distant relative whom Anne considers to be a second mother to her after her own died, also saw the relationship as imprudent for one so young, so persuaded Anne to break off the engagement.
Sir Walter Elliot, his debts mounting, reluctantly decides to lease their family estate Kellynch Hall to Admiral Croft. Sir Walter and Anne’s sister Elizabeth, along with the widowed Mrs Penelope Clay, go to Bath while Anne is instructed to care for her sister Mary, who has taken ill.
Admiral Croft and his wife arrive and reveal that Admiral Croft's wife is Wentworth's sister. While visiting Mary, the Admiral, his wife and Captain Wentworth are expected for dinner; Mary recovers from her illness for the dinner, and Anne volunteers to miss the dinner to sit with Mary's injured son. Unknowing of their previous attachment, one of Mary's sisters-in-law, Louisa, encourages Anne to pursue Captain Wentworth but ends up doing so herself.
The group, including Mary's family, Anne, Louisa, and Wentworth, travel to Lyme to enjoy a holiday by the sea and meet some of Captain Wentworth's naval friends, including Captains Benwick and Harville. Louisa's infatuation with Wentworth is obvious, and Anne tries to hide her feelings. Anne and Wentworth agree to be friends, and the group encounters a mysterious gentleman who seems to be interested in Anne. They discover his identity after he has departed to Bath: William Elliot, cousin to the family who stands to inherit everything.
Louisa, in a misguided attempt at flirtation, has Captain Wentworth catch her as she jumps down the last stairs of a staircase. She tries to repeat the gesture from a greater height, despite Wentworth's objections, and is seriously injured. Captain Benwick fetches a doctor, and Mary resolves to stay with her while Anne goes to Bath.
In Bath, Anne is reacquainted with William Elliot, who begins to pursue her. He also states that his intention in Bath is to ensure Anne's father does not marry Mrs Clay, who could bear a son that would displace him as heir to the estate. Anne becomes distraught upon learning of Louisa's engagement following her recovery. Wentworth arrives and reveals that he has been made an offer of a ship and is deciding whether to take it. Upon seeing William Elliot's pursuit of Anne, he decides to accept the offer.
Wentworth overhears Anne and Harville discussing the relative faithfulness of men and women in love. Deeply moved by what Anne says about women not giving up their feelings of love even when all hope is lost, Wentworth writes her a note declaring his feelings for her and departs. Anne runs after Wentworth, along the way seeing William Elliot in a romantic embrace with Mrs Clay. Anne and Captain Wentworth embrace themselves. William Elliot and Mrs Clay marry.
Later, Wentworth shows Anne how to use asextantwhile the happy couple look out over the ocean as they talk of their impending naval voyage.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 31% of 129 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Despite Dakota Johnson's best efforts, the chaotically anachronisticPersuasionfails to convince as a worthwhile Austen adaptation."[8]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating mixed or average reviews.[9]
Variety'sPeter Debruge found Carrie Cracknell to have "gone and done a strange thing with the book", by trying to "modernize it, borrowing heavily fromFleabagwith its fourth-wall-breaking gimmicks", while "casting a free-spirited, fully liberated American star, Dakota Johnson, as Anne — all of which strips the novel of its core tension."[10]Christy Lemire from the Roger Ebert website found Dakota Johnson offering in the film "a taste of her under-appreciated comic timing", though she claims "it's impossible to care about whether Anne ends up with Frederick Wentworth because, as played by Cosmo Jarvis, he is so stiff and uncharismatic."[11]The Guardian's Stuart Heritage wrote that the "attempt to modernize the classic novel has led to a disaster of anachronistic dialogue and annoyingly wry glances at the camera,"[12]whileVoxcritic Constance Grady found the film an "absolute disaster."[13]The Spectatorwent so far as to proclaim in its review that "everyone involved should be in prison."[14]
Vanity FaircitedPersuasionas a work that fails to utilizebreaking the fourth wallsuccessfully, writing that it "risk[s] structural damage" to itself due to breaking the fourth wall in an unnecessary and "narratively jarring" way.[15]

Ronald Jay Bass(born March 26, 1942), sometimescreditedasRon Bass, is an Americanscreenwriterandfilm producer. He won anAcademy Award for writing the screenplayforBarry Levinson's filmRain Man, and films that Bass is associated with are regularly nominated for multiple motion picture awards. His films have grossed over $2 billion.[1][2]
Bass was born inLos Angeles,California. From the age of 3 to 11, Bass was afflicted with an undiagnosed condition that kept him bedridden. His symptoms includedrespiratoryproblems andstomach painswith high fevers and nausea. It was during this illness, at age six, that Bass is said to have started writing.
During his teens, Bass began work on anovel, which he entitledVoleur. He completed this work at age 17 and showed it to his English teacher. He took hercritiqueof his first completed project quite hard. She described the writing as very good, but she felt that it was too personal to be published. Bass's response was to later burn hismanuscript. Later in life, Bass recalled "it was like the voice of God telling me I didn't have what it takes to be a writer, and I should find something practical to do with my life".[citation needed]Bass would revisit his teenage writings later in life.
Bass entered law studies, first atStanford, thenYale, and finally atHarvard Law School, where he graduated in 1967 with a degree in law. He seemed quite confident about his future prospects, saying, "When I learned there was such a thing as entertainment law, I thought, 'This is where I belong'".[citation needed]Back in Los Angeles, Bass began a seventeen-year career practicing law in the entertainment business. He was successful, and eventually rose to the level ofpartnerin hislaw firm.
Bass has worked with his sister Diane Bass, who served as an uncreditedtechnical consultanton the filmRain Man.
As he moved up the career ladder in law, the love of writing that Bass had acquired as a child never left him. He started writing again, usually during the predawn hours before going to work. Writing and working at unusual hours became a lifelong habit of his. In 1974, he began to rework his novelVoleur, apparently from memory, as he had burned the manuscript in a fit of pique when he was 17. In 1978, he completed the work, renaming itThe Perfect Thief(ISBN0-515-04622-1). This was the first of his three published novels. In 1982, Bass published his second novel,Lime's crisis: A novel(ISBN0-688-01025-3). TheLimereferred to in the title isHarry Lime, the central mystery character of the 1949 motion pictureThe Third Man. On January 1, 1984, his third novel was published,The Emerald Illusion(ISBN0-688-02622-2). The following year, he wrote the screenplayCode Name: Emerald, based on this novel. It was his debut as a screenwriter with a produced script.[3]
As a screenwriter, Bass is known for successfully working in collaboration with other writers, includingAmy TanonThe Joy Luck ClubandAl FrankenonWhen a Man Loves a Woman. He also collaborated on the script for the 2022 filmThe King's Daughter.[citation needed]
Ron is currently under contract to write an original Screenplay entitled "Pegasus" for Pegasus Productions Corp.
A small controversy has arisen over Bass's use of assistants to help him write screenplays. While it is common for screenwriters to employ assistants to help them with research and typing, Bass employs six or seven mostly female assistants that one journalist dubbed "The Ronettes". According to Bass, his assistants help him in research and also in critiquing his scripts. They enable him to write, revise, or polish a comparatively large number of screenplays each year.[4][5]
Please see theWGA screenwriting credit systemfor an explanation of the termsstory by,screenplay by, andwritten by. Also note that under the rules of theWriters Guild of America, Bass has not received on-screen credit for every script he has contributed to. It is thought that Bass has helped to write or consulted on more than 100 screenplays (not all of which have necessarily been produced).[citation needed]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
