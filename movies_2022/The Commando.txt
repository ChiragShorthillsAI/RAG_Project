The Commandois a 2022 American action crime thriller film directed by Asif Akbar and starringMickey RourkeandMichael Jai White.
It was released in the United States on January 7, 2022, bySaban Films.
A DEA SWAT team, led by elite DEA agent James Baker (Michael Jai White), assault a Mexican cartel's drug lab. The bad guys are taken out in the ensuing gun fight, but Baker inadvertently kills three hostages. As a result of PTSD-induced hallucinations and nightmares, caused by the killing of the innocent, Baker gets sent home to recover.
At this time, his family makes an unexpected discovery in their house - a stash of money worth $3 million. Baker just happens to live, with his wife Lisa (Aris Mejía) and  their two teenage daughters, in the house where career criminal Johnny (Mickey Rourke) stashed his loot. The Baker family soon faces the danger and threat of freshly sprung Johnny, who quickly reunites with his old crew to retake the $3 million of stolen money he hid before his arrest. Johnny is über-badass, just before his release, he "dealt" with three inmates who tried to shank him right before he was freed.
Eventually, James and Lisa head off for a quiet weekend together, leaving their two daughters home alone. The youngest girl promptly organizes a house party. It is during this party that Johnny's goons stage a home invasion.
Johnny and his henchmen will do whatever it takes to retrieve the money, including kidnap Baker's daughters. Stakes are high in this head-to-head battle as Baker stops at nothing to protect his family against the money-hungry criminals. There are many confrontations, but none of them between Baker and Johnny, until the final minutes.
One of the highlights is a high schooler getting shot while taking a leak and peeing all over his killer.

During the 1980s, Rourke played supporting roles in films likeBody Heat(1981) andDiner(1982), for which he won theNational Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actor. Since then he established himself as an acclaimed leading man in drama films such asRumble Fish(1983),The Pope of Greenwich Village(1984),Year of the Dragon(1985),9½ Weeks(1986),Angel Heart(1987),Francesco(1989), andJohnny Handsome(1989). His performance inCharles BukowskibiopicBarfly(1987) has earned him anIndependent Spirit Award for Best Male Leadnomination. In 1991, following a string of critical and commercial failures, Rourke—who trained as aboxerin his early years—left acting and became a professional boxer for a time.[2]
After retiring from boxing in 1994, Rourke returned to acting and had supporting roles in several films such asThe Rainmaker(1997),Buffalo '66(1998),Animal Factory,Get Carter(both 2000),The Pledge(2001),Spun(2002),Once Upon a Time in Mexico(2003),Man on Fire(2004) andDomino(2005). In 2005, Rourke made a comeback in mainstream Hollywood circles with a lead role in the neo-noir action thrillerSin City, for which he won awards from theChicago Film Critics Association, theIrish Film and Television Awards, and the Online Film Critics Society.
This comeback culminated in his portraying aging wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson in the sports drama filmThe Wrestler(2008). For the role, Rourke won theGolden Globe AwardandBAFTA Award for Best Actor, and received a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Actor.[3]After this, Rourke appeared in several commercially successful films;Iron Man 2,The Expendables(both 2010) andImmortals(2011), before primarily going on to work in mostlydirect-to-videoproductions and someindependent filmssuch asAshby(2015),Nightmare Cinema(2018), andThe Palace(2023).
Philip Andre Rourke Jr. was born on September 16, 1952, inSchenectady, New York,[1]to Annette (néeCameron) and Philip Andre Rourke (1924–1982).[4]He hasIrishandFrenchancestry.[5]He was raisedCatholicand still practices his faith.[6][7][8]His father left the family when Rourke was young. After his parents divorced, his mother married Eugene Addis, aMiami Beachpolice officer with five sons, and moved Rourke and two younger siblings toSouth Florida.[9]There, he graduated fromMiami Beach Senior High Schoolin 1971.[10]
"My stepfather used to crack my head just because he felt like it. He was big, very big, and mean. And he was physically abusive to my mother. I hated the f***er for hurting her, for making her afraid. For years, I wanted nothing more than to take him down. In our neighborhood, there was some community services center set up to give kids a place to go and to keep us out of trouble. That's where I first found a speed [punching] bag. To me, it represented a ticket to manhood..."
During his teenage years, Rourke focused his attention mainly on sports. He took up self-defense training at theBoys ClubofMiami.[citation needed]It was there that he learned boxing skills and decided on an amateur career.
At age 12, Rourke won his first boxing match as a 112-pound (51 kg)flyweight,[12]fighting some of his early matches under the name Phil Rourke. He continued his boxing training at the famed5th Street Gym, inMiami Beach, Florida. In 1969, Rourke, then weighing 140 pounds (63.5 kg),[citation needed]sparred with former World Welterweight ChampionLuis Rodríguez. Rodríguez was the number one–ratedmiddleweight(154 lb to 160 lb) boxer in the world and was training for his match with world championNino Benvenuti. Rourke says he received aconcussionfrom his sparring match with Rodríguez.[13]
At the 1971FloridaGolden Gloves, Rourke suffered another concussion in a boxing match. After being told by doctors to take a year off and rest, Rourke temporarily retired from the ring. From 1964 to 1973, Rourke compiled an amateur boxing record of 27 wins (including 12 straight knockouts), including a first-round knockout win over John Carver and decision victories over Ronnie Carter and Javier Villanueva, and three defeats.[12]
In 1971, as a senior atMiami Beach Senior High School, Rourke had a small acting role in theJay W. Jensen–directed school playThe Serpent.[14]However, Rourke's interests were geared to boxing, and he never appeared in any other school productions. Soon after he temporarily gave up boxing, a friend at theUniversity of Miamitold Rourke about a play he was directing,Deathwatch, and how the man playing the role of Green Eyes had quit. Rourke got the part and immediately became enamored with acting. Borrowing $400 from his sister, he moved to New York,[15]working an assortment of odd jobs while studying withActors Studioalumni Walter Lott andSandra Seacat.[16][17]It was under the latter's tutelage, Rourke later recalled, that "everything started to click." Seacat motivated Rourke to find his father, from whom he was separated for more than twenty years.[18]
During his appearance onInside the Actors Studio, after the release ofThe Wrestler, hostJames Liptondisclosed that Rourke had been selected to the Actors Studio in his first audition, whichElia Kazanis reported to have said was the "best audition in thirty years".
Appearing primarily in television films during the late 1970s, Rourke made his feature film debut with a small role inSteven Spielberg's1941. He played Ritchie,Dennis Christopher's bullying and ill-fated co-worker in the 1980 slasher filmFade to Black. However, it was in 1981, with his portrayal of anarsonistinBody Heat, that Rourke first received significant attention, despite his modest time on screen. The following year, he drew further critical accolades for his portrayal as the suave compulsive gambler "Boogie" Sheftell inBarry Levinson'sDiner, in which Rourke co-starred, alongsidePaul Reiser,Daniel Stern,Steve Guttenberg,Tim DalyandKevin Bacon; theNational Society of Film Criticsnamed him Best Supporting Actor that year. Soon thereafter, Rourke starred inRumble Fish,Francis Ford Coppola's follow-up toThe Outsiders.
Rourke's performance in the filmThe Pope of Greenwich VillagealongsideDaryl HannahandEric Robertsalso caught the attention of critics, although the film was not financially successful. In the mid-1980s, Rourke earned himself additional leading roles. His role oppositeKim Basingerin the erotic drama9½ Weekshelped him gainsex symbolstatus.[19]He received critical praise for his work inBarbet Schroeder'sBarflyas thealcoholicwriterHenry Chinaski(the literaryalter egoofCharles Bukowski), co-starringFaye Dunaway, and inYear of the Dragon, written byOliver Stone.
In 1987, Rourke appeared inAngel Heart. The film was nominated for several awards. It was seen as controversial by some, owing to a sex scene involvingCosby Showcast memberLisa Bonet, who won an award for her part in the film.[20]Although some of Rourke's work was viewed as controversial in the US, he was well received by European, and especially French audiences, who loved the "rumpled, slightly dirty, sordid ... rebel persona"[21]that he projected inYear of the Dragon,9½ Weeks,Angel Heart, andDesperate Hours. DirectorAdrian Lynesaid that had Rourke died after the release ofAngel Heart, he would have become a bigger phenomenon thanJames Dean.[13]
In the late 1980s, Rourke performed withDavid Bowieon theNever Let Me Downalbum. Around the same time, he also wrote his first screenplay,Homeboy, a boxing tale in which he starred. In 1989, Rourke starred in the docudramaFrancesco, portrayingSt. Francis of Assisi. This was followed byWild Orchid, another critically panned film, which gained him a nomination for aRazzieaward (also forDesperate Hours). In 1991, he starred in the box office bombHarley Davidson and the Marlboro Manas Harley Davidson, a biker whose best friend, Marlboro, was played byDon Johnson. In his last role before departing for the boxing ring, Rourke played an arms dealer chased byWillem DafoeandSamuel L. JacksoninWhite Sands, afilm noirthat reviewers found stylish but incoherent.
[22][23]
Rourke's acting career eventually became overshadowed by his personal life and career decisions. Directors such asAlan Parkerfound it difficult to work with him. Parker stated that "working with Mickey is a nightmare. He is very dangerous on the set because you never know what he is going to do."[21]In a documentary on the special editionDVDofTombstone, actorMichael Biehn, who plays the part ofJohnny Ringo, mentions that his role was first offered to Rourke.[citation needed][24]Rourke has allegedly turned down several roles in high-profile films, including48 Hrs.,Platoon,Highlander,Top Gun,Beverly Hills Cop,The Untouchables,Rain Man,The Silence of the Lambs,Pulp Fiction,[25]andDeath Proof.
In 1991, Rourke decided that he "had to go back to boxing" because he felt that he "was self-destructing ... [and] had no respect for [himself as] an actor".[2]Rourke was undefeated in eight fights, with six wins (four by knockout) and two draws. He fought internationally in countries including Spain, Japan, and Germany.[26]During his boxing career, Rourke suffered a number of injuries, including a broken nose, toe, and ribs, a split tongue, and a compressed cheekbone. He also suffered from short-term memory loss.[27]
His trainer during most of his boxing career wasHells Angelsmember, actor, and celebritybodyguardChuck Zito.[28]Freddie Roachalso trained Rourke for seven fights.[29]Rourke's entrance song into the ring was oftenGuns N' Roses' "Sweet Child o' Mine" (to which reference is made in his filmThe Wrestler, in which Rourke's character enters his final match of the film to the song playing over the loudspeakers).[30]Boxing promoters said that Rourke was too old to succeed against top-level fighters. Indeed, Rourke himself admits that entering the ring was a sort of personal test: "[I] just wanted to give it a shot, test myself that way physically, while I still had time."[31]Rourke's boxing career resulted in a notable physical change in the 1990s, as his face neededreconstructive surgeryto mend his injuries.
On November 28, 2014, Rourke briefly returned to the boxing ring and fought 29-year-old Elliot Seymour inMoscow, Russia.[32]It was Rourke's first boxing match in over 20 years. Talks of him being involved in four more matches were released by Rourke himself after the match. He won the exhibition fight in the second round by TKO. The fight is not counted in his professional record since it was an exhibition match. The opponent later stated that he threw the fight, having been promised payment to take a dive in the second round.[33]
In the early 1990s, Rourke was offered and declined the role ofButch Coolidge, which later becameBruce Willis's role inPulp Fiction.[34]After his retirement from boxing, Rourke did accept supporting roles in several 1990s films, includingFrancis Ford Coppola'sadaptationofJohn Grisham'sThe Rainmaker,Vincent Gallo'sBuffalo '66,Steve Buscemi'sAnimal Factory,Sean Penn'sThe Pledge, andSylvester Stallone's remake ofGet Carter. Rourke also has written several films under the name Sir Eddie Cook, includingBullet, in which he co-starred withTupac Shakur.
While Rourke was also selected for a significant role inTerrence Malick'sThe Thin Red Line, his part ended up on thecutting room floor. Rourke also played a small part in the filmThursday, in which he plays a crooked cop. He also had a lead role in 1997'sDouble Team, which co-starred martial arts actorJean-Claude Van Dammeand formerNBAplayerDennis Rodman. It was Rourke's first over-the-top action film role, in which he played the lead villain. During that same year, he filmedAnother 9½ Weeks, a sequel to9½ Weeks, which received only limited distribution. He ended the 1990s with thedirect-to-videofilmsOut in Fifty,Shadesand television filmShergar, about the kidnapping of Epsom Derby-winning thoroughbred racehorseShergar. Rourke has expressed his bitterness over that period of his career, stating that he came to consider himself a "has-been" and lived for a time in "a state of shame".[35]
In 2001, Rourke appeared as the villain inEnrique Iglesias's music video for "Hero", which also featuredJennifer Love Hewitt. In 2002, he took the role of The Cook inJonas Åkerlund'sSpun, teaming up once again withEric Roberts. His first collaborations with directorsRobert RodriguezandTony Scott, inOnce Upon a Time in MexicoandMan on Fire, respectively, were in smaller roles. Nonetheless, these directors subsequently decided to cast Rourke in lead roles in their next films. In 2005, Rourke made his comeback in mainstream Hollywood circles with a lead role asMarvinRobert Rodriguez's adaptation ofFrank Miller'sSin City. Rourke received awards from theChicago Film Critics Association, the IFTA, and the Online Film Critics Society, as well as Man of the Year fromTotal Filmmagazine that year.

Despite having withdrawn from acting at various points, and having made films that he now sees as a creative "sellout" (the action filmHarley Davidson and the Marlboro Man), Rourke stated that "all that I have been through ...[has] made me a better, more interesting actor". Rourke's renewed interest in pursuing acting can be seen in his statement that "my best work is still ahead of me".[31]
Rourke had a role in the film version ofThe Informers, playing Peter, an amoral former studio security guard who plots to kidnap a small child. In 2008, Rourke played the lead inDarren Aronofsky'sThe Wrestler, winner of theGolden LionAward for Best Film at theVenice Film Festival, about washed-up professional wrestler Randy "The Ram" Robinson.[37]Regarding first reading thescreenplay, he stated that he originally "didn't care for it".
"I didn't really care for the script, but I wanted to work with Darren and I kind of thought that whoever wrote the script hadn't spent as much time as I had around these kind of people and he wouldn't have spoken the way the dude was speaking. And, so Darren let merewriteall my part and he put the periods in and crossed the T's. So once we made that change I was okay with it."[38]
He also spoke on personal concern and hesitance of being in a film about wrestling, for he perceived it as being "pre-arranged andpre-choreographed". As he trained for the film, he developed an appreciation and respect for what real-life pro wrestlers do to prepare for the ring:
I kept getting hurt. I think I had threeMRIsin two months because I wasn't landing right. These guys take several years to learn how to land and I think after I started getting hurt doing it, I started to realize these guys are really suffering and I kind of gained a respect for their sport.[38]
He trained under former WWE wrestlerAfa the Wild Samoanfor the part, and has received aBAFTAaward, aGolden Globeaward, anIndependent Spirit Award, and an Oscar nomination as Best Actor. Rourke lost the Oscar toSean Penn, while Penn did acknowledge Rourke in his acceptance speech.

In June 2006, Rourke publicly supported U.S. PresidentGeorge W. Bushand American involvement in theIraq War.[60]In January 2009, Rourke expressed admiration for Bush in an interview withGQmagazine. In the interview, Rourke also expressed his astonishment thatIslamic fundamentalistswere allowed to continue their activities in Britain after the7 July 2005 London bombings.[61]
In August 2014, Rourke came under scrutiny for purchasing and wearing a T-shirt bearing the likeness of Russian PresidentVladimir Putinat a time when most of the Western world was criticizing and sanctioning Russia due to theannexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation.[62]When questioned by the press, Rourke explained: "If I didn't like him, I wouldn't buy the T-shirt, believe me. I met him a couple of times and he was a real gentleman. A very cool, regular guy. Looked me right in the eye. Good guy."[63]However, Rourke has since denounced Putin for his role in theRussian invasion of Ukraineand has urged him to end the conflict.[64][65]
In 2015, Rourke expressed his support for theBen Carson 2016 presidential campaign. He also denounced Republican frontrunnerDonald Trumpas a "bully".[66]Rourke revealed that he has had a personal vendetta against Trump after an incident in which Trump sued both him andTupac Shakurin the 1990s.[67]Rourke has since been very vocal in his criticisms of Trump's presidency, referring to him as a "Garbage Can" president.[68]In 2022, Rourke claimed that Trump had sent theUnited States Secret Serviceto visit him as a result of his comments on Trump.[69]
In July 2020, Rourke expressed support forJoe Bidenin the2020 United States presidential electionon hisInstagramaccount, encouraging him to "Go get his fat ass, Joe @joebiden" and showing disapproval for Trump.[70]In August, he expressed support forKamala Harrisfollowing her nomination forvice presidentin the2020 United States presidential electionfollowing previous approval of her earlier in July.[71]In October, Rourke voted for Biden and Harris which he said was the first time he had ever voted.[72]
In addition to his faith, Rourke has publicly attributed his comeback to his dogs. He is well known as a pet lover, particularly fond of small-breed dogs. Aspay/neuteradvocate, Rourke participated in a protest outside a pet shop in 2007[73]and has done a public service announcement forPETA.[74]
His first little dog was reportedly a gift from his second wife.[73]Though Rourke's dogs are generally referred to as "chihuahuas", some are not purebred. Loki, his most-publicized dog whom he described as "the love of my life",[73]was a chihuahua-terrier mix.[75][76]So reliant was Rourke on Loki's companionship, he spent US$5,400 to have her flown to England while he was on the set of the filmStormbreaker.[76]
Rourke gave his dogs credit during his Golden Globe Best Actor acceptance speech January 11, 2009: "I'd like to thank all my dogs. The ones that are here, the ones that aren't here anymore because sometimes when a man's alone, that's all you got is your dog. And they've meant the world to me."[77]The day of the2009 Golden Globes, he toldBarbara Waltersthat "I sort of self-destructed and everything came out about 14 years ago or so ... the wife had left, the career was over, the money was not an ounce. The dogs were there when no one else was there." Asked by Walters if he had consideredsuicide, he responded:
Yeah, I didn't want to be here, but I didn't want to kill myself. I just wanted to push a button and disappear.... I think I hadn't left the house for four or five months, and I was sitting in the closet, sleeping in the closet for some reason, and I was in a bad place, and I just remember I was thinking, "Oh, man, if I do this," [and] then I looked at my dog, Beau Jack, and he made a sound, like a little almost human sound. I don't have kids, the dogs became everything to me. The dog was looking at me going, "Who's going to take care of me?"
Beau Jack sired two of Rourke's later pets, Loki and her littermate Chocolate.[79]Beau Jack died in 2002, although Rourke reportedly gave him 45 minutes ofmouth-to-mouth resuscitation.[76][80]Chocolate was the subject of a children's book,Chocolate at the Four Seasons, about his temporary stay with producerBonnie Timmermann.[81]Chocolate returned to Rourke and died in 2006.[81]In addition to those dogs and several other past pets, Rourke currently owns a chihuahua named Jaws who appeared with him in his 2009 PETA ad, as well as in the filmOnce Upon a Time in Mexico.[74]He has had as many as seven dogs at one time, back in 2005.[80]Jaws originally was named "Little Mickey" and was originally slated to be euthanized. Rourke also believed Jaws was previously abused.[82]At the time of his Golden Globes tribute to his pets, Rourke owned five chihuahuas: Loki, Jaws, Ruby Baby, La Negra and Bella Loca.[76]About a month later, on February 16, 2009, Loki died in Rourke's arms at the age of 18.[83]

Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
