Their latest project,Gosnell: The Trial of America's Biggest Serial Killer, is a true crime drama film based on the crimes ofKermit Gosnell.[1]Their book,Gosnell: The Untold Story of America’s Most Prolific Serial Killer, was an Amazon andNew York Timesbest seller.[2]They were married at the Basilica Church of St Mary Magdalene in Dublin in 1992.

There he covered the Northern Irelandtroublesand peace process, before becoming night editor.[3]From 1998 to 2000, he worked for the UK'sSunday Times[3][4]in itsDublinoffice. From 2000 to 2003 he was the Romania/Bulgaria Correspondent for theFinancial Times, and he also covered those countries forThe Economist.[3]It was this position that ultimately led him to filming documentaries.[3]

McElhinney has worked as a journalist and filmmaker in the US, Canada, Romania, Bulgaria, Chile, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Ghana and Uganda.[7]
FrackNationis a feature documentary that claims to address misinformation about the process ofhydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking. It premiered in 2013 onMark Cuban'sAXS TV[8]and was distributed byMagnolia Picturesin 2014.[9]FrackNationwas inspired by a confrontation betweenJosh Fox, the director of the 2010 documentaryGasland, and McAleer. While Fox was promoting his film project McAleer confronted him about the historical record of people being able to ignite natural gas coming from their water taps. McAleer told theLos Angeles Times:
He knew that people could light their water for decades before fracking started. He said he didn’t include that in the film because it wasn’t relevant.[10]
McAleer toldPoliticohe was motivated to make the film by the "one-sided approach taken by the media, 'outsiders' and 'urban elites'" on the fracking process. McAleer said there has been no real debate on the issue, with the environmental lobby relying on emotion and scare tactics to condemn fracking.[11]
In an interview with thePittsburgh Post-GazetteMcAleer stressed the film is trying to show both sides of the fracking discussion. "We're definitely covering the contamination" in the film, McAleer said. "We feature both sides." Though the filmmakers wanted to avoid appearing pro-industry, according to the interviewer, trailers from the film "play rather like industry commercials ... of farmers and landowners who say gas drilling provides economic stability".[12]
In 2013, a sequel to Gasland titledGasland Part IIpremiered at theTribeca Film Festivalin New York City on 21 April 2013.[13]A group of farmers, who were featured inFrackNation, along with McAleer and McElhinney, were not admitted into the premiere and claimed that it was because they asked difficult questions; organizers said that after guests who had purchased advance tickets and waited in line had been admitted, the screening was full.[14][15][16]
Not Evil Just Wrongis a film McElhinney and McAleer directed and produced to challengeAl Gore'sAn Inconvenient Truth.It claims that the evidence for human-causedglobal warmingis inconclusive, and that the impact of suggested legislation for mitigating climate change would be much more harmful to humans than beneficial.[17]The movie was filmed in 2008, and was screened at theInternational Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam[18]and at the Right Online conference in 2009.[19]
In 2010, the directors cooperated with theIndependent Women's Forumto create a program, Balanced Education for Everyone (B.E.E.) that seeks to placeNot Evil Just Wrongin schools.[20]
Mine Your Own Businessis a documentary partly funded by the Canadian Mining Company[21]that looked at campaigns by foreign environmentalists against a large scale mining project in Romania[22]that never came to fruition. The film looked at how the lives of the poor people in the area would have been affected if the mine had been built. McAleer agreed to film the documentary, funded by the Canadian Mining Company featured in the movie, after the company guaranteed that he and wife would retain creative control over its content.[23]McAleer said of his findings during the shoot:
It was surprising that environmentalists would lie, but the most shocking part was yet to come. As I spoke to the Western environmentalists, it quickly emerged that they wanted to stop the mine because they felt that development and prosperity will ruin the rural "idyllic" lifestyle of these happy peasants.  This "lifestyle" includes 70-percent unemployment, two-thirds of the people having no running water and using an outhouse in winters where the temperature can plummet to 20 degrees below zero Celsius.[24]
In the documentary, McAleer films Mark Fenn from theWorld Wildlife Fund, who is shown living in luxurious conditions, at one point showing off his $35,000 sailboat to the cameras, all the while advocating the value of living the simple, village life.[25]
McElhinney and McAleer directed and co-produced "The Search for Tristan's Mum," which highlights the case of a toddler Tristan Dowse who was adopted by an Irish couple at birth—and then abandoned in an Indonesianorphanagetwo years later. It broadcast onRTÉ One, the Irish state television station, in 2005.[26]Tristan Dowse was an Indonesian boy adopted by an Irish man, Joe Dowse, and hisAzerbaijaniwife, Lala.  After two years, Tristan was abandoned at the Indonesian orphanage from where he had been originally adopted, when, according to the Dowses, the adoption "hadn't worked out."  At that stage, his adoption had been recognised by the Irish Adoption Board and he had been granted Irish citizenship.  He could only speak English. In 2005, McAleer and McElhinney reunited the young boy with his natural mother, Suryani.  In 2006, an Irish court ordered the Dowses to pay an immediate lump sum of €20,000 to Tristan, maintenance of €350 per month until he is 18 years of age, and a further lump sum of €25,000 when he reaches the age of 18. In addition, Tristan would remain an Irish citizen and enjoy all the rights to the Dowses' estate. Tristan's adoption was struck off the Register of Foreign Adoptions held by the Irish Adoption Board and Suryani was appointed his sole legal guardian.[27]
This film was selected to be part of Input 2006, a showcase for programs representing national public broadcasters from around the world, and was duly screened for industry professionals at the film festival that year in Taiwan in May.[28]

In January 2017, Regnery Publishing[38]released McElhinney and McAleer's book about abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell,Gosnell: The Untold Story of America's Most Prolific Serial Killer. The book debuted at No. 3 on Amazon's best seller list[39]and No. 13 on theNew York Times's "Combined Print & E-Book Best Sellers."[40]Regnery Publishing said that theNew York Times"ignored real sales numbers".[39]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
