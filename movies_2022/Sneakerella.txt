InQueens, teenage orphan El works in his late mother's shoe store "Laces", now run by his stepfather Trey, who overworks El instead of his stepbrothers Zelly and Stacy. El closes the store early to join his best friend and fellowsneakerheadSami at the release of a new sneaker, where they meet a girl named Kira, who is impressed by El's insight into people from looking at their shoes. They miss the drop, but El shows Kira around his neighborhood, losing track of time as they fall for each other.
El is forced to rush back the store without a way to contact Kira, and is grounded by Trey, to his stepbrothers’ delight. Kira returns home, and is revealed to be the daughter of sneaker mogul and former basketball star Darius King. Inspired by El, Kira suggests that her older sister Liv's shoe design is too “basic” and convinces their father to let her look for another original design before the upcoming SneakerCon.
Learning Kira's identity, Sami and El plan to sneak into King's charity gala to find her. Overwhelmed by running the business alone, Trey has decided to sell the store, leading El to draw on memories of his mother and create a unique shoe design, with inspiration and help from the neighborhood. The night of the gala, Zelly and Stacy trap El in the stockroom, but he is rescued by Gustavo, the community garden'smagicalcaretaker. He provides El and Sami with outfits, tickets, and a classic convertible to reach the gala, but warns that they must leave by midnight.
At the event, El's custom-made shoes become the talk of the crowd, as Sami inadvertently spreads rumors that El is a sought-after independent designer. El reunites with Kira, who prepares to introduce him to her father as the designer everyone is talking about, but he and Sami are forced to flee at midnight. El loses one of his shoes on an escalator, which is found by Kira. Determined to track down the young mystery designer, Kira and Liv launch a viral campaign to find her “prince”.
El is unsure how to explain the truth to Kira, but Sami convinces him to reach out to her and arrange a meeting with her father. Realizing El's plan, Zelly and Stacy steal his other shoe, and El arrives just after his stepbrothers have informed Darius that El is merely a stock boy. El tries to explain himself, but Darius and Kira rebuke him for lying to them and send him away. As Trey prepares to close the store and move the family back toNew Jersey, El throws away his designs, which are found by Gustavo.
Kira's mother suggests that her disappointment in El comes from trying too hard to meet her father's expectations, leading her to realize that she put just as much pressure on El herself. El wakes up to find a pair of sneakers from Gustavo, created from his design inspired by Kira. While Sami distracts his stepbrothers, El races to the King brand sneaker drop, where he and Kira apologize to each other.
Zelly and Stacy take off in the moving truck to confront El, and Sami urges Trey to see how unfairly he has been treating El since his mother's death. El convinces Darius of his good intentions, his talent, and his feelings for Kira, but is interrupted by his stepbrothers. Trey arrives, reining in his sons. He apologizes for being so hard on El, and asks for a second chance to be a real father to El, while Darius declares El his new designer.
One year later, El is in a relationship with Kira, and has transformed Laces into “El-evate”, his own sneaker store pushing new and creative designs for all of Queens.

He was the first player inNBAhistory to win championships with three franchises (since joined byRobert Horry,Danny Green, andLeBron James), as well as the first player in the NBA to win a championship in three different decades (since joined byTim Duncan).[1][2]
After being drafted in the first round out ofGeorgia Techin the1986 NBA draft, the 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m)-tall Salley played bothpower forwardandcenterfor theDetroit Pistons,Miami Heat,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls,Panathinaikos, andLos Angeles Lakers.

Salley is a 1988 graduate ofGeorgia Tech'sCollege of Management.[6]He helped the Yellow Jackets win the 1985 ACC Championship, they also advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. He left in 1986 as Tech's all-time leader in blocked shots. Salley holds Georgia Tech's personal fouls record, and has had his jersey number 22 retired, a very rare honor in college basketball.[7]Salley was seen as potential top 3 pick during his senior year .
Salley had a draft workout for theBoston Celticsfor the 2nd overall pick againstLen Biasin front offRed Auerbach. The Chicago Bulls promised Salley if he was there at nine they would take him but tookBrad Sellers. Salley was drafted by theDetroit Pistonswith the 11th overall pick in the first round of the1986 NBA draftout ofGeorgia Tech. After joining the Pistons, he became close friends withAdrian Dantley, who taught him proper nutrition, how to exercise, and how to conduct himself off the court. Salley, for his part, called Dantley "The Teacher". Salley would become good friends with comedianEddie Murphyand made several appearances at comedy clubs in the off-season. In 1989 and 1990, he played on two Pistons NBA championship teams. He is among the Pistons' all-time leaders in blocked shots.[8]
Under the coaching ofChuck Daly, Salley was part of the Pistons era that featured three consecutive NBA finals appearances.  The team's highly physical, defense-oriented, and dirty style of play earned them the nickname of the NBA's "Bad Boys", with Salley playing alongsideDennis Rodman,Bill Laimbeer,James Edwards,Joe Dumars,Isiah Thomas,Rick Mahornand Dantley. After losing the1988 NBA Finalsin seven games to the Lakers, the Pistons turned it around to sweep the Lakers in four games in1989. Salley and the Pistons repeated in1990, defeating thePortland Trail Blazersin five games. The Pistons' run came to an end when theMichael Jordan-ledChicago Bullsswept them in four games in the1991 Eastern Conference finals; following game four, while most of the Pistons players chose to return to the locker room rather than congratulate the new Eastern Conference champions, Salley was one of the few who stayed on the court as the game ended to congratulate the Bulls.
Salley was traded to theMiami Heatin 1992. In the1995 NBA expansion drafthe was selected by the inaugural Toronto Raptors team after being made available by the Heat.
In February 1996, he negotiated a buyout of his contract and was waived thus ending hisstint with the Raptorsduring which he averaged 19.3 minutes and 6 points per game.
Free of his Raptors contract, in early March 1996, Salley signed a 10-day contract with theChicago Bulls, joining the roster withMichael Jordan,Scottie Pippen,Toni Kukoč, and former Pistons teammatesDennis RodmanandJames Edwards. Following another 10-day contract right after the first one ended, the Bulls signed Salley as a free agent and he spent the rest of the season with the team. The1995–96 Bullsachieved a record-breaking 72-win season, the best-ever regular-season record at the time, later surpassed by the2015–16 Golden State Warriorsat 73–9. Salley would win his third NBA championship in June, playing sparingly in the1996 NBA Finals.

Salley made his Panathinaikos debut on September 25, 1996, inEuroLeagueaway atFC Barcelona, a 77–58 loss during which he scored 5 points before fouling out in only 12 minutes of action.[10]Right away, Salley got on the bad side of coach Maljković who refused to modify his disciplinarian approach in order to accommodate a veteran player with a notable NBA career behind him.[10]Though Salley's performances somewhat improved over the following three EuroLeague outings—10 points in a home loss versusASVEL, 9 points and 11 rebounds in a blowout home win versusKK Split, and 21 points and 8 rebounds in a win away at minnowsBayer Leverkusen—as he seemingly showed signs of adjustment to FIBA basketball rules and European referees by managing to stay out of foul trouble, he continued to butt heads with coach Maljković. After flying back to Athens with the team the morning after the Leverkusen game, Salley refused to go to practice and as a result, got dropped by Maljković for their Greek League game the following day.[11]The player then flew back to the United States for meetings with TV executives over a new talk show he had been planning to host forDisney, returning to Athens an hour before the club'sGreek Cupgame versusP.A.O.K.on October 22, 1996—a trip that included Salley renting a privateLear jetin Paris for US$20,000 out of his own pocket in order to make it back to Athens in time for the game after having his connecting flight delayed and then even renting ahelicopteronce he landed at Athens'Ellinikon Airportto take him right to Panathinaikos'OACA Hallin the city'sMarousineighbourhood.[11]However, Maljković still refused to include him in the lineup. In response, Salley decided to leave Panathinaikos unilaterally two days later on October 24, 1996, after only a month at the club.

He would be the last Laker to wear #16 beforePau Gasol, whom it was retired in honor of.[12]14 years later,Tim Duncanof theSan Antonio Spursbecame the second player to achieve titles in three different decades (sans the requirement of different teams) by leading his Spurs to five championships between1999and2014.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
