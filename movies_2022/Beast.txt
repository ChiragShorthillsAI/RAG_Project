The film starsIdris Elba,Iyana Halley,Leah Jeffries,Sharlto Copley. It follows a widowed father and his two teenage daughters who visit a South Africangame reservebut must fight to survive when they are stalked and attacked by a ferocious, rogue,man-killinglion.
Beastwas released in the United States on August 19, 2022, byUniversal Pictures.[6]The film received generally positive reviews from critics, grossing just over $59 million on a $36 million production budget.
RecentlywidowedDr. Nate Samuels and his daughters, Meredith and Norah, arrive at theMopani ReserveinSouth Africafor avacation. Nate reunites with his old friend, Martin Battles, abiologistand Mopani manager, who introduced Nate and his wife. Martin takes Nate and the girls to thevillagewhere Nate's wife grew up. Nate confides to Martin his guilt over being distant following his and his wife's separation, after which she developedterminal cancer. The trip is to reconnect with his daughters.
The next day, Martin and the family tour the reserve's restricted areas. Martin shows them a locallionpride and notices that one is injured. At a nearbyTsongacommunity, Martin discovers most of the population is dead. Suspecting a rogue,man-killing lionis responsible, Martin rushes back to report the finding. Nate encounters an injured Tsonga man on the road but is unable to save him. Martin is mauled as he tracks the lion. It then ambushes Nate, who takes cover in the car. Meredith speeds away but crashes into a tree, stranding them.
Martin radios Nate on awalkie-talkie, warning him to stay away, saying the lion is using Martin as bait to lure the others out. As the radio is out of range to contact help, Nate assembles atranquilizerrifle. He confronts the lion, hoping to subdue it long enough to recover Martin and trek back to civilization. The lion attacks, and Meredith takes advantage of the distraction to save Martin. Norah stabs the lion with a tranquilizer dart after it knocks the gun from Nate's hands, causing the lion to retreat. Meredith brings Martin back to the car, and Nate treats his wound. To the group's surprise, the lion soon returns to stalking them, seemingly unaffected by the tranquilizer.
As night falls, the now-recovering Martin speculates the lion went rogue afterpoacherskilled its pride. Soon after, the poachers arrive and initially agree to transport the group to the village in exchange for payment. Tensions rise after the poachers spot Martin, an avid anti-poacher, inside the car. The lion attacks and scatters the poachers, killing most of them. Nate maneuvers his way past the lion and finds the poachers' truck keys. Back at the car, Martin holds the lion off long enough to allow the sisters to escape, though Meredith sustains a deep laceration to her side. The car falls into a ravine and Martin sacrifices himself by setting off an explosion from the leaking gasoline, severely burning the lion. Nate starts the truck and races away with Meredith and Norah but has to stop the car before they run out of fuel. They leave the car and walk to an abandoned schoolhouse nearby.
At the abandoned schoolhouse, which the poachers used as their base, Nate treats Meredith's wound and forages for water. The lion appears and stalks the girls, but Nate returns and scares it off. Locking his daughters inside a room, Nate promises to return after subduing the lion. After provoking the lion into chasing him, Nate lures it to the local lion pride which Martin helped raise. The rogue lion overtakes and mauls Nate, nearly killing him, until the pride males named Kuda and Kawe intervene and kill the rogue. A Mopani worker named Banji arrives and saves Nate as he falls unconscious.
Awakening in a hospital, a recovering Nate tells his daughters he loves them. Sometime later, the three return to the reserve, this time as a united family, and recreate the photo Nate's dead wife took of herself next to her favorite tree.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
