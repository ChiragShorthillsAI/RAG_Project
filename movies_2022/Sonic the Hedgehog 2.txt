Following the success ofSonic the Hedgehog(2020),Paramount Picturesannounced the sequel in May 2020, with Fowler, Casey, Miller and the cast returning. Filming took place from March to June 2021 in Vancouver and Hawaii. The film draws inspiration from the video gamesSonic the Hedgehog 2(1992),Sonic the Hedgehog 3(1994), andSonic & Knuckles(1994).
Sonic the Hedgehog 2was theatrically released in several markets on March 30, 2022, in the United States on April 8, and in Japan on August 19. Like its predecessor, it set several box office records for a video game film and received positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances and action sequences but criticized the screenplay and runtime. It grossed $405.4 million worldwide. A spin-off series,Knuckles, premiered onParamount+on April 26, 2024, whilea third filmwas released on December 20, 2024.
After banishingDr. Ivo Robotnikto the mushroom planet,[c]Soniclives with the Wachowskis and attempts to help the public as a vigilante hero with little success due to his recklessness. While on a fishing trip, Tom advises Sonic to remain patient for the day his powers will be needed before he and Maddie depart for her sister Rachel's wedding inHawaii, leaving Sonic in charge of the house for the weekend.
While staying at home, Sonic is attacked by Robotnik, who has escaped with the help ofKnuckles, anechidnawarrior, and returned to Earth for revenge on Sonic. Knuckles demands the location of the legendaryMaster Emerald—an ancient relic that grants its user ultimate power and the ability to change reality to their will—so he can bring honor to his ancestors. Sonic is rescued byMiles "Tails" Prower, a young two-tailed fox who idolizes him and has come to warn him about Knuckles.
Sonic convinces Tails to help him find the Master Emerald while Robotnik reunites with his assistant,Agent Stone, and offers to "help" Knuckles, scheming to steal the emerald. Following clues on a map given to Sonic by his late former guardian, Longclaw, Sonic and Tails find a compass within a temple inSiberia. Knuckles and Robotnik track them and chase Sonic and Tails down a mountain. Knuckles reveals that he lost his whole tribe the same day Sonic lost Longclaw. Despite this brief moment of sympathy, Knuckles and Robotnik steal the compass. However, Knuckles begins to question Robotnik's sense of loyalty and honor when he mocks Sonic for choosing to save an injured and unconscious Tails instead of the compass before an avalanche starts upon them.
Tom saves Sonic and Tails by usinga ringto teleport them to the wedding. Rachel's fiancé Randall and his wedding guests reveal themselves as undercover agents of theGuardian Units of Nations(G.U.N.), having set the wedding up to capture Sonic and Tails; they ultimately also arrest Tom when he tries to stop them. The trio are saved by Maddie and a vengeful Rachel, who reconciles with Randall after he confirms that his feelings for her are real. Meanwhile, Knuckles and Robotnik find an underwater temple containing the Master Emerald.
Blaming himself for Tails' injuries, Sonic decides to face Knuckles and Robotnik alone and goes to the temple, where he fights Knuckles to keep him from taking the Master Emerald. Robotnik exploits the distraction and seizes the emerald, which collapses the temple, sinking it into the water. No longer needing Knuckles, Robotnik betrays him and leaves both him and Sonic behind. Teaming up after rescuing one another from the flood, Sonic and Knuckles manage to escape just as a recovered Tails rescues them in abiplane.
InGreen Hills, Robotnik uses his new abilities from the emerald to create a giant robot resembling himself. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles work together to fight the robot and its accompanying drones and reclaim the Master Emerald. The emerald shatters in Sonic's hands, splitting into the sevenChaos Emeralds. Tom and Maddie save Sonic, who inadvertently uses the Chaos Emeralds to transform intoSuper Sonic. He destroys the robot, allowing Robotnik to collapse with it, before dispersing the Emeralds and reverting to normal. Knuckles fixes the Master Emerald from the remaining shards before making a pact with Sonic and Tails to protect it from evil together instead of alone and they start an idyllic life with the Wachowskis.
While G.U.N. searches for Robotnik, Stone poses as a soldier to avoid capture. He overhears Commander Walters receiving information about the discovery of a secret research facility, which Walters immediately recognizes as the one housingProject Shadow.

Amy Nicholson ofThe New York Timesgave the film a positive review, saying, "Jim Carrey's reprised role as a villainous weirdo helps this fast-paced, family-friendly video-game-movie sequel maintain a refreshing silliness."[89]Nell Minow ofRogerebert.comgave the film a two out of four, writing, "Yes, we know we're appropriating details from better movies. It is over-plotted, with three different storylines mixing comedy and adventure."[90]Alex Stednan ofIGNgave the film a seven out of ten, saying, "Sonic the Hedgehog 2brings all the humor and charm of its predecessor, while also being delightfully more loyal to its source material."[91]Carlos Aguilar ofThe Wrapalso gave the film a positive review, writing, "The screenplay reflects actual effort, and Jim Carrey gets to be unfettered in his performance, leading a surprisingly satisfying follow-up."[92]Leslie Felperin ofThe Guardiangave the film a three out of four and wrote, "There's not much to spoil aboutSonic the Hedgehog 2because there's not very much to say about it, other than it's mildly amusing and reasonably competently assembled."[93]Brian
Shea ofGame Informergave the film a 8.5 out of 10, writing, "While Sonic the Hedgehog's unexpected positive reception could have put its sequel in a difficult spot since it comes in with higher expectations, the Jeff Fowler-directedSonic the Hedgehog 2clears the higher bar, delivering a better movie in nearly every way."[94]In a "C+" review, Ross Bonamie ofColliderwrote, "Sonic the Hedgehog 2is at its most clever when it's throwing in these clever nods that will appeal to fans who have waited to see this world come to life on the screen in this way with these characters."[95]
John Nugent ofEmpiregave the film a two out of five, writing, "Sonic's second outing is little more than a half-baked half-term distraction tool — though Jim Carrey's outrageously committed performance nearly saves the day."[96]Brian Lloyd ofEntertainment.iegave the film a three out of five and said, "Idris Elba as Knuckles is the most galaxy-brain casting idea ever conceived of."[97]Bob Hoose ofPlugged Ingave the film a positive review, saying, "In short, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 doesn't necessarily grab the gold ring right out the first loop-de-loop, but it won't disappoint the kids or their "fanboy" parents by the time you hit the flag-waving goal."[98]Thomas Floyd ofThe Washington Postgave the film a two out of four and wrote, "InSonic the Hedgehog 2, there is no problem that its titular speed demon can't outrun. With that in mind, it's especially perplexing that this video game-inspired sequel should be, of all things, a bit sluggish."[99]In a "C−" review, Siddhant Adlakha ofIndieWirewrote, "It's visual soup where nothing pops or stands out. Almost nothing anyone does or says feels rooted in recognizable character traits, and despite Marsden's most sincere efforts, he finds himself once again unable to meet Sonic's eye-line (a production kerfuffle that would be funny, were it not also another reminder of VFX crunch). Then again, who can blame Marsden's character for not wanting to gaze into a soulless blue abyss?"[100]
In February 2022, Sega of America and Paramount Pictures confirmed thatSonic the Hedgehog 3and aKnucklesspin-off miniseries were in development.

Sega Sammy Holdings Inc.[a](also known as theSega Sammy Groupor simply asSega Sammy) is a Japanese globalholding companyandconglomerateformed from themergerofSegaandSammy Corporationin 2004. Both companies are involved in theamusementindustry (Sega witharcadeand homevideo games, Sammy withpachinkomachines).[3]
Sega was founded on June 3, 1960, by American businessman Martin Bromley. The company started to distributeslot machinesto U.S. bases in Japan. During the 1960s, Service Games was renamed to Sega Enterprises Ltd. Sega Enterprises sold their first product, the electro-mechanical game calledPeriscopewhich became a worldwide hit. In 1969, Sega Enterprises was acquired by U.S. conglomerateGulf and Western Industries(which also owned the famed movie studioParamount Picturesaround this time). In 1983, Sega launched theSega Computer Videogame SG-1000, the first 8-bit video game platform. In 1986, a management buyout, led byComputer Serviceacquired Sega Enterprises through capital participation. Sega Europe Ltd. was established in Europe, and in 1985, Sega Enterprises, Inc. was established in the United States. These regional subsidiaries served as a marketing base for amusement arcade machines.[4]
During 1985, Sega releasedHang-On, the world's first force feedback game. Sega Enterprises was registered stock on over-the-counter (OTC) market. In 1988, Sega listed stock on the second section of Tokyo Stock Exchange. Within this year, Sega released theSega Mega Drive/Genesis, a 16-bit home video game platform that solidified Sega's presence in the console market. During this year, Sega also launched theR-360, the world's first amusement arcade cabinet could rotate 360 degrees in all directions. In 1991, Sega releasedSonic the Hedgehogas a competitor mascot to represent Sega againstNintendo'sMario, and with 15 million copies sold,Sonic the Hedgehogspawned multiple sequels over the years and became Sega's flagship franchise.[4]
In 1992, Sega releasedVirtua Racingin order to utilise polygonal 3D-graphics engines, and in 1993, Sega releasedVirtua Fighter, the world's first polygonal 3D fighting game. In 1994, Sega launched theSega Saturn, a32-bithome video game platform. In 1995, Sega launched Print Club Arcades in partnership withAtlus. In 1996, Sega releasedSakura Wars, a Japan exclusive sim-based Strategy RPG that became a cultural phenomenon within Japan, spawning a multi-media franchise. In 1997, Sega attempted to merge with toy manufacturerBandaiwith Sega as the surviving entity (which would be named Sega Bandai following the merger), but the deal eventually fell through. In 1998, Sega launched the SegaDreamcast. In 2000, Sega Enterprises changed their name to Sega Corporation. During this year, Sega releasedPhantasy Star Online, the first networked role-playing game (RPG) for home video game platforms. In 2001, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast and withdrew from the console hardware industry to become a third-party video game developer and publisher.[4]
Sammy Corporation was founded on November 1, 1975, as Sammy Industry Co., Ltd. by Japanese business magnate,Hajime Satomi. It was formed from Satomi Corporation's manufacturing and marketing divisions for amusement arcade machines. In the 1980s, Sammy marketed and sold Pachislot machines, and in the 1990s, Sammy expanded their portfolio by marketing and selling Pachinko machines. These two business ventures have been the primary pillar of Sammy Corporations revenue. During 1997, Sammy Industry Co., Ltd. changed its name to Sammy Corporation. By 2000, Sammy Corporation was listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 1st section, indicating it as a "large company".[5]Outside of Pachinko and Pachislot industry, Sammy Corporation was also involved in the video game industry as a publisher for fighting games such as theGuilty Gearseries (developed byArc System Works),The Rumble Fishseries (developed byDimps) andSurvival Arts.
In February 2003, Sega and Sammy announced their intentions to merge. Sammy presidentHajime Satomiwould head the new company.[6]However, this deal ultimately fell apart. In the year following, Sammy purchased 22.4% of Sega, forced out several Sega executives, and installed Satomi as chairman. By May 2004, the two companies announced a new merger, though this was essentially a takeover of Sega by Sammy. Sega presidentHisao Oguchiwas named vice president of the new company.[7]
According to the first Sega SammyAnnual Report, the merger happened due to the companies facing financial difficulties. According to chairman Hajime Satomi, Sega had been in the red for nearly 10 years[8]and lacked a clear financial base. Sammy, on the other hand, feared stagnation and overreliance of its highly profitable pachislot and pachinko machine business, and wanted to diversify its business in new fields, using Sega's broader range of involvement in different entertainment fields.[9][6]
In 2005, Sega Europe acquired British studioThe Creative Assembly.[10]That same year, Sega Sammy acquired 50.2% voting shares of animation studio and entertainment companyTMS Entertainment, converting the company into a consolidated subsidiary. Sega Sammy previously held a minority stake in TMS, which was inherited from Sega.[11]In 2006, Sega Europe purchasedSports Interactive.[12]
On December 22, 2010, Sega Sammy Holdings acquired the remaining outstanding shares of TMS Entertainment, Sammy NetWorks, and Sega Toys, thus making all three companies, wholly owned subsidiaries of Sega Sammy Holdings.[13]In April 2017,Marza Animation Planet, Sega's CGI animation studio, was restructured into TMS Entertainment.[14]
Together, as the Sega Sammy group, the company has grown and acquired and founded multiple companies.[15]
Until 2015, the group was structured in four areas:[16]
For the better half of the first decade of the holding's existence it has sought the arcade machine sales of Sega and the pachinko sales of Sammy, as its biggest financial incentive. A shift happened in the 2010s, leading to the "Group Structure Reform" in 2015. Casinos, resorts and digital games became the biggest financial incentives. Arcade sales and packaged games from Sega has softened, while growth in pachinko sales is not anticipated.[17]By this point, Sega Sammy restructured into three business units: Entertainment Contents (which compromises of the company's video game, animation, amusement and toy companies, all under Sega Holdings), Pachinko & Pachislot (compromising of the company's gambling business, under Sammy) and Resort (compromising of the company's resort and casino assets).
On November 4, 2020, it was announced that Sega Sammy would sell 85.1% of Sega Entertainment, its arcade operating business, to Genda Inc., an amusement equipment rental business, due to the effects of theCOVID-19 pandemicon its arcade and amusement facilities businesses. Sega will still be involved in the arcade machine manufacturing business.[18][19]
On January 29, 2021, Sega Sammy announced that it would restructure and split its corporate functions for their businesses which occurred at the beginning of the 2022 fiscal year.[20]That same year, it was announced that Sega Sammy would be a kit sponsor forJ2 LeagueclubTokyo Verdy, and their women's team,Nippon TV Tokyo Verdy Beleza, and also sponsored a Tokyo Classic match on September 26, 2021, between Verdy and crosstown rivalFC Machida Zelvia.[21]
Sega Sammy Holdings announced in April that they have made a €706 million ($776 million USD) offer to acquireRovio Entertainment.[22]Rovio rejected an earlier acquisition bid from Israeli mobile companyPlaytikafor $800 million.[23]The deal closed on 17 August 2023, making the latter company a wholly owned subsidiary of Sega.[24]
In November 2023, Sega Sammy Creation announced that it would acquire sports betting company, GAN Limited, for the price of $1.97 per share pending regulatory approval.[25]
In January 2024, Sega Sammy announced that it would transfer the Amusement Machine business ofSegatoSega Toys, while also changing the name of Sega Toys to Sega Fave Corporation, which is scheduled to take effect during April of 2024.[26]In order for the company to focus more on its core businesses, the company's board has elected that it would sell Phoenix Segaia Resort toFortress Investment Groupon May 10 that same year pending regulatory approval.[27]
In July 2024, Sega Sammy announced it would acquire Dutchonline gamblingplatform Stakelogic for $141 million, pending regulatory approval with the transaction set to close by the 2026 fiscal year.[28]
The intertwining dynamics of the operating income of Sega's and Sammy's businesses changed throughout the decades. The pachinko and pachislot machine sales of Sammy were overwhelmingly bigger than Sega's business from 2009 to 2015. From 2017 to 2024, Sega's entertainment contents overtook pachinko and pachislot sales several times or often had about half or a third of the profits of Sammy.[29][30]
Sega Sammy's business consists of three segments, which covers entertainment contents (including video games, animation and toys), pachinko & pachislot and casino & resort.
The entertainment contents business provides a diverse range of entertainment from digital content to toys. These are the companies and subsidiaries affiliated with the Sega Sammy Group's entertainment contents business.[31]
These are the companies and subsidiaries affiliated with Sega Sammy Group's pachislot and pachinko machine business.[32]
These are companies charged with operating the Sega Sammy Group's resorts and casinos, including the development and sale of casino machines.[33]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
