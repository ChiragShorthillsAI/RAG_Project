Connor Connolly, a disgraced parole officer, becomes indebted to a local drug kingpin, Tyrone Pettis, after having no choice but to kill one of the latter's young enforcers (an "asset"). Upon having his pregnant wife Candice abducted by Pettis as leverage, Connor is forced to pull off a series of dangerous drug heists within twelve hours in order to pay the $2 million dollars he now owes. Connor recruits his old teammates to conduct the heists with him, rescue his kidnapped pregnant wife, and settle a score with the city's corrupt police chief Alston who had double-crossed them years ago in a botched hostage situation that led to the former team's disbandment. Alston is secretly in an uneasy alliance with Pettis, who has financed his rise to power. The team goes through with the heists, and confronts Pettis whilst rescuing Candice, before coming to a mutual understanding and engaging in one final heist in an attempt to disrupt Alston's criminal operations. In the end, Connor, Pettis, and Candice successfully flee the country, while Alston, having been recorded during the ongoing heist gunning down one of his subordinates who was catching onto his illicit activities, is arrested.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
