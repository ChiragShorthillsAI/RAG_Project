The plot follows a woman who has to fight a clone of herself to the death after she unexpectedly recovers from a terminal illness. The film premiered at the2022 Sundance Film Festivalon January 22, 2022. It was released in the United States on April 15, 2022, byRLJE Films.
In the near future, Sarah is a depressed alcoholic in a lacklustre relationship with her boyfriend Peter and generally disconnected from her pestering mother. One day, Sarah awakens to find a pool of blood in her bed and later learns she is terminally ill. To save those she cares about from the pain of losing her, Sarah opts for the creation of a clone of herself, to be trained to act like her and to take her place after her death.
Sarah gives her clone "Sarah's Double" the basic knowledge of her interests and lifestyle. Ten months after her initial diagnosis, Sarah is informed that she has, inexplicably, gone into full remission, and that she is going to live. When she arrives at her mother's house to share the good news, she finds Peter and Sarah's Double there and is furious to discover that Sarah's Double has been in contact with her mother for quite some time, against her wishes. With the truth now exposed, Sarah tries to return things to normal and demands her clone to be "decommissioned", only to be rejected by Peter, as well as her mother, both of whom prefer the clone.
Sarah is told that Sarah's Double has requested to stay alive, meaning that, by law, the two will have to participate in a publicized duel to the death. To prepare for the duel, Sarah takes up combat classes with a trainer, Trent. For the next year, Sarah improves herself both physically and mentally, learning to tolerate violence, and how clone duels operate. Feeling confident, Sarah meets up with Peter to state that she means no ill will but promises to unapologetically kill her clone.
While training with Trent at his gym, Sarah spots her clone on the street, watching her, and chases her to a nearby playground. There, they talk over their situation before Sarah's Double takes Sarah to a support group for people who survived their duels. Afterwards, the two bond and agree to escape across the border to live their lives. The next morning, they embark on a hike through a forest. During the hike, it becomes clear that Sarah's Double has poisoned Sarah's water.
Sarah's Double shows up to the duel alone, lying that she is Sarah and stating that the "clone" has fled. After an investigation and a court hearing, a judge declares her to be the original Sarah. However, Sarah's Double is soon left feeling just as depressed and unfulfilled as the original Sarah, carrying her burdens such as the unfiltered Peter and her doting mother (who both know she is the clone). While out driving (which she isn't good at), Sarah's Double hears a voice message from Sarah's mother containing an implicit threat that the truth could be exposed anytime if the new Sarah ceases to bend to her mother's will. Sarah's Double stops in the middle of aroundaboutand cries.
The film was announced in April 2020, withKaren Gillan,[4]Aaron Paul,[4][5]Beulah Koale[4][6]andJesse Eisenbergcast. However, three months later,Theo Jameshad replaced Eisenberg.[7]Principal photographybegan in October 2020.[8]The film was shot entirely inTampere,Finland,[4][6]and is also co-financed by IPR.VC, the Finnishventure capitalcompany.[9]Due to theCOVID-19 pandemicin America, the film crew tried to find a suitable location inCanadaandNew Zealand, but to no avail, so Finland was chosen as the shooting location for the film.[10]The filming took six weeks,[6]and during that time, Karen Gillan embarked on a heavyfitness workoutfor her role guided by local coaches.[11][12]
With the successful filming, the City ofTampereand Film Tampere signed an agreement withXYZ Filmsfor other future productions of the company.[13]The idea of organizing an internationalshort filmcompetition called Generation XYZ for the 2021Tampere Film Festivalarose from the same collaboration.[14]
The film premiered at the2022 Sundance Film Festivalon January 22, 2022.[15]In Finland, where the film was completely shot, it premiered at theTampere Film Festivalon March 12, 2022.[16]RLJE Filmsacquired the film's distribution rights afterwards.[17]It was released in the United States on April 15, 2022.[18]In April 2022, RLJE Films signed an output deal withAMC+. The film was released on the streaming service on May 20, 2022.[19]
In the United States and Canada, the film earned $118,254 from 157 theaters in its opening weekend.[20]
The film received positive reviews from critics. On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 70% of 150 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "Dualbrings writer-director Riley Stearns' signature deadpan style to bear on a smart sci-fi comedy that's well-led by Karen Gillan in double roles."[21]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 62 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[22]
Peter Debruge atVarietywrote, "Dualis in fact a fairly astute comedy. The laughs come not from jokes so much as sharp jabs of truth—wince-inducing insights into the subjects most movies won't touch, like our fear of death, intimacy and being forgotten."[23]IndieWire's David Ehrlich said the film "isn't too big on world-building (lo-fi technology does much of the heavy lifting here, with slide projectors and squelching dial tones co-existing alongside damningly realisticinternet porn), but it sure is huge on training sequences. ...Dualreliably gets close to unlocking that layer during its most juvenile moments, as Stearns finds a kind ofBeavis and Butt-Head-level poetry in the sort of things that are too immature for other films like this to touch."[24]Writing forThe Hollywood Reporter, John DeFore said "the problematic-clone theme is familiar enough that it alone won't keep many viewers engaged for 90 minutes, though Stearns does find an intriguing third-act complication or two. Gillan, who has spent much of her post-Doctor Whodecade playing cyborgs, computer avatars and a thinly imagined assassin, has a barely more human role to play here; to the extent that she makes either Sarah worth rooting for, it's an achievement."[25]

In August 1994, Image entered theCD-ROMmarket, releasing movies on the CD-ROM format.[5]
As the 1990s came to a close and Laserdiscs gave way to DVDs, Image re-focused on the fledgling format that quickly came to dominate the home video marketplace. While studios were busy managing the transition from VHS to DVD, Image began to acquire DVD rights to long-form music concert programs, television programming, foreign films and a broad array of special interest programming fromGRB Entertainment,20th Television/Foxstar Productions,Orion Pictures,Playboy Home EntertainmentandUniversal Pictures, all of which were being ignored by the major studios and music labels.[6]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
