Deep Waterwas released onHuluon March 18, 2022, following several delays due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.
Melinda and Vic Van Allen live with their young daughter Trixie in Little Wesley,Louisiana. Vic has retired early after developing guidance chips for combat drones, and his complicated relationship with Melinda is held together by a precarious arrangement: they sleep apart and Melinda takes lovers openly, even in their family home, while Vic finds solace in raising his large collection of snails. Their open marriage is no secret to their concerned friends, and Vic grows increasingly jealous, while Melinda laments his lack of passion.
Melinda invites her latest lover, Joel, to a neighbour's party. Alone with Joel, Vic tells him that he murdered Melinda's previous lover Martin, who has recently disappeared. The story spreads through their circle of friends, raising the suspicions of noir writer Don Wilson. Joel comes to dinner with the Van Allen family, and Vic elaborates in private that he killed Martin with a hammer, frightening Joel into leaving town. A TV news report reveals that Martin's body has been found shot to death, and a suspect is arrested.
Vic confronts Melinda after she gives money to Charlie, her new lover and piano teacher. She invites Charlie to a friend's pool party and introduces him to Vic, toying with his jealousy. Rain sends everyone inside, leaving Vic and Charlie alone in the water. After Melinda discovers Charlie's body drowned in the pool, the party is questioned by police, and Melinda is quick to accuse Vic of murdering Charlie. He later asks if she is scared of him, and she says she is not as "I'm the one you killed for".
Don's wife Kelly tells Vic that her husband and Melinda have been accusing him of Charlie's murder. Vic discovers they have hired a private investigator to follow him and confronts Don in front of Don's family. Melinda reconnects with an old boyfriend, Tony, and Vic overhears their conversation suggesting they will move to Brazil, taking Trixie with them. She invites Tony to dinner with Vic and takes him to her bedroom, furthering Vic's jealousy.
Vic lures Tony into his car and drives him to a secluded spot he and Melinda share, overlooking a rocky gorge. He throws stones at Tony, causing him to fall down the hill to his death, and sinks his body in the creek. Melinda takes Vic and their daughter on a picnic to the same spot. Vic gives her a collection of photographs he has surreptitiously taken of her as a testament to his love, but spots Tony's body resurfaced in the creek. Returning home, he offers to go back to the spot in the morning to retrieve Melinda's lost scarf. She notifies Don, but invites Vic to share her bed that night.
The next day, Vic bikes to the creek to deal with Tony's body, but is caught in the act by Don. Don rushes away in his car to notify authorities. Vic pursues him on his bike and takes a shortcut through the brush to try to head Don off. Vic tumbles out of the bushes and falls off his bike into the car's path; texting recklessly, Don swerves to avoid Vic but drives off a cliff and is killed. At home, Melinda finds Tony's wallet in one of Vic's snailvivaria. She packs a suitcase to leave, which Trixie throws in the pool, insisting they stay. Vic arrives home, where Melinda tells him that she "saw Tony". However, she then burns Tony's wallet and ID cards.

Deep Waterwas originally scheduled to be released on November 13, 2020,[4]but was delayed to August 13, 2021,[9]and again to January 14, 2022.[10]On December 9, 2021, it was taken off the release schedule.[11]Four days later, it was reported that the film would move to aHulu-exclusive release in the United States and anAmazon Prime Video–exclusive release internationally.[12]On February 14, 2022, it was announced that the film would be released on Hulu on March 18, 2022, and on Prime Video for a simultaneous international release.[13]
According toSamba TV, 826,000 U.S. households watchedDeep Waterduring its first weekend on Hulu.[14]According to the streaming aggregator Reelgood,Deep Waterwas the 4th most streamed movie across all platforms, during the week of March 23, 2022,[15]the 4th during the week of March 27, 2022,[16]and the 6th during the week of April 7, 2022.[17]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 36% of 226 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Viewers desperately seeking a new erotic thriller might findDeep Waterworth a dip, but it's far from director Adrian Lyne's best work."[18]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 53 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[19]
Natalia Keogan ofPasterated the film 8 out of 10, asserting, "There's a very good chance that the film's zero-sum game will not appeal to everyone, least of all those who flip it on with the hopes of a tumultuous sex-fueled affair. More akin to the similarly Affleck-starringGone GirlthanFifty Shades of Grey—or if we're using Lyne's filmography as a reference, more akin toLolitathanAn Indecent Proposal—Deep Wateris a sweat-inducing psychological scheme that is constantly aiming to intrigue and titillate. The paperback pulp origins of Highsmith's original story are kept intact, alleviating any semblance of eye-roll worthy ridiculousness that doesn't at least try to make an interesting point. As each shocking revelation tacks on another clue in the sprawling mystery, the audience isn't sure just who or what to believe—making the film's fiery ending all the more jaw-dropping."[20]Rex ReedofObserver MediagaveDeep Watera grade of 3 out of 4 stars, writing, "Ben Affleck plays a diabolical husband with the calm, resolute demeanor of a mathematician solving an elaborate calculus problem. Ana de Armas plays a wife with carnal ingenuity. She keeps finding handsome new guys to reduce the boredom, and he keeps thinking up ingenious new ways to murder them. Heading the exceptional supporting cast is actor-playwright Tracy Letts, as the suspicious neighbor whose radical discovery of the truth fatally backfires. How she finally traps her husband and ends the charade gives the film its “gotcha” moment, butDeep Waterhas shock effects when and where you least expect them. It's the kind of riveting and dynamic thriller from start to finish we used to take for granted in the good old days, don't see much anymore, and could definitely use a lot more of."[21]
David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterappreciated Lyne's return to filmmaking, but gave the film a negative review and wrote, "Lyne's take on the material, scripted without distinction by Zach Helm and Sam Levinson, manages to drain all the subtlety and psychological complexity from Highsmith's story of marital warfare, transgression and obsession."[22]Adam Nayman ofThe Ringersaid, "Thrillers that don't quite stick the landing are common, and considering rumors of a troubled production,Deep Wateris far from a disaster—or from the salacious camp classic the online hordes seem to be clamoring for. But it's also not good enough to serve as ground zero for some larger renewal of the erotic thriller. The frustration lies in watching people who know what they're doing fail to completely pull it off; the residual feeling is one of a missed opportunity. In the funniest—and most overtlyHitchcockianmoment—Vic watches as something he'd tried his best to hide winds up coming back into plain sight. Affleck's half-guilty, half-impatient expression is hilarious, as is his half-hearted attempt to push the incriminating thing back out of view. It's the perfect emblem for a movie that isn't really trying to submerge its flaws."[23]

Hulu(/ˈhuːluː/,HOO-loo) is an Americansubscriptionstreaming mediaservice owned byDisney Streaming, a subsidiary of theDisney Entertainmentsegment ofthe Walt Disney Company. It was launched on October 29, 2007, initially as ajoint venturebetweenNews Corporation(later21st Century Fox) andNBC Universal, which was laterbought byComcast. Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initiallybrandedas "Hulu Plus," which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and un-delayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—anover-the-topstreaming television service offering access tobroadcast televisionchannels.
In 2011, Hulu launchedits services in Japan, marking its first and only international expansion. Three years later in 2014, Hulu Japan was acquired byNippon TVand spun off from its American counterpart.[2]Since February 2021, Hulu's original content has since been distributed outside of the U.S. viaDisney+under theStarbrand. In 2019, Disney acquired a majority stake in Hulu as part of itsacquisition of 21st Century Fox, and subsequently acquired the remaining stakes held by AT&T and Comcast in 2019 and 2023, respectively, giving it full ownership. After the acquisition, Disneysoft launchedan integration of Hulu into Disney+ as a content hub in December 2023, allowing subscribers of both services to access Hulu content from within the Disney+ app. Hulu is one of the three streaming services in the Disney Bundle, alongside Disney+ andESPN+.
On January 6, 2025, Disney began its acquisition of a 70% stake inFuboTV, with the latter merging with Hulu's Live TV service. The combined company will remain publicly traded on theNew York Stock Exchange, but will be controlled by Disney executives. As part of the deal, Fubo settled a lawsuit againstESPN Inc.(majority-owned by Disney),Fox Corporation(21CF's successor), andWarner Bros. Discovery(WarnerMedia's successor after its merger withDiscovery, Inc.) over a joint venture known asVenu Sports, with Fubo being granted a preliminary injection to stop its launch in August 2024. The merger will take 12 to 18 months according to Disney and Fubo. Venu Sports was discontinued a few days later.
The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

It invited users to leave their email addresses for the upcomingbeta test.[13]In October 2007, Hulu began the private beta testing by invitation, and later allowed users to invite friends.[14]Hulu launched for public access in the United States on March 12, 2008.[15]
Hulu began an advertising campaign during NBC's broadcast ofSuper Bowl XLIIIwith an initial ad starringAlec Baldwintitled "Alec in Huluwood."[16]Advertisements have since aired featuringEliza Dushku,Seth MacFarlane,Denis Leary, andWill Arnett.[citation needed]
In July 2007,Providence Equity, the owner ofNewport Television, became one of the earliest "outside" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 millionequity investment,[17]before the company was known as "Hulu."[18]With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an "independent voice on the board."[18]In April 2009,the Walt Disney Companyjoined the Hulu consortium as a stakeholder, with plans to offer content fromABC,ESPNandDisney Channel.[19][20][21][22]
Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

Comcast, the only other shareholder, announced on May 14, 2019, that it had agreed to cede its control to Disney, and reached an agreement for Disney to purchase its 33% stake in the company as early as 2024.[38]
On May 14, 2019, Comcast relinquished its control in Hulu to Disney effective immediately. As a result, the streaming service became a division ofWalt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International(DTCI) with Comcast effectively becoming asilent partner. Under the agreement, Comcast's 33% stake can be sold to Disney atfair market valueas early as 2024. The fair market value will be determined at that time, but Disney guaranteed a minimum valuation of the entire company at $27.5 billion (valuing the Comcast stake as worth at least $9.075 billion).[39]Randy Freer would report to Disney executiveKevin Mayer.[39]

However, Comcast had not offered reasonable terms for an early buyout[54]and had instead expressed interest in buying Hulu themselves if it were for sale.[53]
On May 18, it was announced that Disney+ and Hulu would remove nearly 60 original films and series on May 26 in order to "cut costs." The news sparked some backlash, mostly towards the initial decision to removeHoward, the documentary on the life of lyricistHoward Ashman, on the eve ofPride Monthand the release of thelive-action adaptationofThe Little Mermaid.

Linked page for 'Adrian Lyne' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Lyne):
Adrian Lyne(born 4 March 1941)[1]is an English film director. Lyne is known for sexually charged narratives that explore conflicting passions, the power of seduction, moral ambiguity, betrayal, and the indelibility of infidelity.[2][3]
In the mid 1970s, he directed television commercials for  DIM Lingerie (France), but Lyne's career in feature length films began in 1980 withFoxes,and would later directFlashdance,9½ Weeks,Fatal Attraction,Jacob's Ladder,Indecent Proposal,Lolita, andUnfaithful. Lyne received a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best DirectorforFatal Attraction.[4]
Lyne was born inPeterborough,Northamptonshire(nowCambridgeshire) and raised in London.[1]He was educated atHighgate SchoolinNorth London;[5]together with his younger brother,Oliver Lyne(1944–2005), a classical scholar and academic at the University of Oxford.[6]Their father was a teacher at the school.[5]
An avid moviegoer during his school days atHighgate, he was inspired to make his own films by the work ofFrench New Wavedirectors likeJean Luc Godard,François TruffautandClaude Chabrol. Lyne was among a generation of British directors in the 1970s, includingRidley Scott,Alan Parker,Tony ScottandHugh Hudson, who would begin their career making television commercials before going on to have major success in films.[7]Their techniques in making commercials were admired and copied by major names in the film industry, with Lyne stating: "I remember making this advertisement up inYorkshirewhen I got a message thatStanley Kubrickhad called. He'd seen an ad I'd made for milk in which I'd used a particular type of graduated filter. He wanted to know exactly which filter I'd used."[7]Two of Lyne's early short films,The Table(1973) andMr Smith(1976), were entries in theLondon Film Festival. Lyne made his feature filmmaking debut in 1980 withFoxes, a look at the friendship of four teenage girls growing up in theSan Fernando Valley, starringJodie Foster.
His next film, 1983'sFlashdance, was an innovative blend of rock 'n' roll, new dance styles, and visual imagery. Lyne's visuals (reminiscent of his 1970s UK commercials forBrutus Jeans), wedded to Giorgio Moroder's score, propelled the story of an aspiring ballerina (Jennifer Beals, in her film debut) who works in a factory by day and dances in a club at night.[7]The film generated over $200 million worldwide and was the third highest-grossing film of 1983.[8]The film was also nominated for four Academy Awards, with the theme song, "What a Feeling", winning the Oscar for Best Song. In 1986, Lyne attracted controversy with9½ Weeks. Based on a novel byElizabeth McNeill, the tale of a sexually abusive relationship starredMickey RourkeandKim Basinger. Although considered too explicit by its American distributor, and cut for U.S. release, it became a huge hit abroad in its unedited version.
Lyne's fourth film wasFatal Attraction, which generated over $320 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 1987.[9]Based onJames Dearden's British erotic thrillerDiversion, the story of a happily married lawyer (Michael Douglas) who tries to break off an affair with an attractive single woman (Glenn Close), only to have her become obsessed with him and endanger his family, the film struck a chord with audiences. Deemed "thezeitgeisthit of the decade" byTimemagazine,Fatal Attractionearned six Academy Award nominations includingBest Picture,Best Director,Best Actress(Glenn Close),Best Supporting Actress(Anne Archer), Best Screenplay andBest Editing.
In 1990, Lyne directedJacob's Ladder. Written by Academy Award-winnerBruce Joel Rubin(Ghost) and starringTim Robbins,Elizabeth PeñaandDanny Aiello, the film takes audiences on a journey throughVietnamveteran Jacob Singer's (Robbins) post-war life where apparent reality is interleaved with nightmarish hallucinations, leading to atwist ending. WithIndecent Proposal, Lyne examined how the sexes look at relationships and money. StarringRobert Redford,Woody HarrelsonandDemi Moore,Indecent Proposalbecame a worldwide box office hit.[10]
Lyne's version ofLolita, based on thenovelbyVladimir Nabokovand starringJeremy Irons, was filmed for theatrical release in 1997, but American distributors shied away from it due to its controversial subject matter. The film premiered onShowtimeand was so well-received that national theatrical distribution soon followed. His next film,Unfaithful, was loosely based onClaude Chabrol'sLa Femme Infidèle. The movie starsRichard GereandDiane Lanein a story of a marriage threatened by infidelity and murder. Lane received much praise for her performance, and was nominated for aGolden Globe Awardand an Academy Award for Best Actress.
AfterUnfaithful, Lyne did not direct another film for twenty years.[11]
In 2005, Lyne was reportedly linked toWarner Bros.' biopic ofJohnny Stompanato, withKeanu Reevesportraying him andCatherine Zeta-Jonesset to star asLana Turner.[12]In 2006, Lyne was committed to directingTwo Minutes to Midnight, aSheldon Turner-scripted thriller for20th Century Fox.[13]In 2007, he was circling to directPrince of Thieves, which later becameThe Town.[14]In 2012, Lyne was in talks to direct a film adaptation of theJohn GrishamnovelThe Associate.[15]In 2015, there was talk of him directingNicole Kidmanin an adaptation of the 2013A.S.A. HarrisonnovelSilent Wife.[16]The next year,Michael DouglasandHalle Berrywere connected to another Lyne project calledSilence.[17]As of 2022, none of these projects have come to fruition.
He most recently directed the erotic thrillerDeep Water, based ona novelbyPatricia Highsmith.[11]Disney's20th Century Studiosreleased the film onHuluin the United States and onAmazon Prime Videoin other countries.[18]It is Lyne's first directorial effort in 20 years, and the first erotic film released by Disney sinceColor of Nightin 1994.[19][20]

Zach Helm(born January 21, 1975) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. He's known for his work on the filmsStranger than Fiction(2006) andMr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium(2007), as well as the stage playGood Canaryand its 2009 screen adaptation.
In 1996, Helm graduated fromDePaul University, where he trained as an actor.[2]After being chosen for a writer's program byFox 2000 Pictures, he spent several years doing uncredited rewrites for film scripts.[2][3]
He wrote the 2006 fantasy comedy-drama filmStranger than Fiction.[4]He won theNational Board of Review Award for Best Original Screenplay[5]and the PEN Center USA West Literary Award in the Screenplay category. He was also nominated for theCritics Choice Award for Best Writer,[6]theWriters Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay[7]and theSaturn Award for Best Writing.
In 2006, Helm was approached to directMr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium, for which he had previously written a screenplay.[3]In 2013, he described the movie as a "Technicolor train-wreck" as reported by online tabloid news sourceTMZ.[8]
He beganInterviewing the Audiencein 2008, a revival of one ofSpalding Gray's performance pieces which he had seen while in college. As the title suggests, audience members are brought onto stage and interviewed, their personal stories and insights extracted in long-form conversations meant to create a sense of communal intimacy but challenge the convention of theater and story. Helm's approach differed from Gray's in that Helm's conversations were entirely extemporaneous, without any prepared questions, and the audience members were drawn at random. Helm tended to find and illuminate themes and connections within the interviews, thereby creating a through-line for each performance as it happened.[9]
Helm wroteLe Bon Canari(Good Canary), which was produced in France in 2007, then translated into Spanish (El Buen Canario) and produced in Mexico. It was translated into English in 2016 for the Rose Theatre Kingston. Drawn from Helm's personal experiences, the play is known for its dark humor, coarse language, and views on sexism and misogyny as well as its use of Brechtian devices.[10]
In 2015, Helm directedCulo Quasars Cocaine Chaos, which he adapted from the true story of Paul Frampton.[11]He adapted theEpic Magazinearticle "The Mercenary" for Fox in 2016, collaborating with journalists Josh Davis and Josh Bearman.[12]
Helm was married to actressKiele Sanchez[13]from 2001 to 2008.[14]

During her childhood and adolescence, de Armas had no Internet access and had limited knowledge of popular culture beyond Cuba.[13]She was allowed to watch "20 minutes of cartoons on Saturday and the Sunday movie matinee."[14]Her family did not own a video or DVD player, and she watched Hollywood movies in her neighbor's apartment.[15]She memorized and practiced monologues in front of a mirror,[16][17]and decided to become an actress when she was 12.[18]In 2002, aged 14, she successfully auditioned to join Havana'sNational Theatre of Cuba.[7][19]She sometimes hitchhiked to attend the "rigorous" course.[20][21]While a student, she filmed three movies.[5][8]She left the four-year drama course shortly before presenting her final thesis because Cuban graduates are forbidden from leaving the country without first completing three years of mandatory service to the community.[8][22]At age 18, with Spanish citizenship through her maternal grandparents,[3][12]she moved toMadridto pursue an acting career.[8]

With encouragement from her newly hired Hollywood agent, she decided to move to Los Angeles.[13]When de Armas first arrived in Los Angeles in 2014,[31]she had to start her career again "from scratch."[15]She spoke very little English and, during early auditions, she often "didn't even know what [she] was saying."[6]She spent four months in full-time education to learn English,[32][28]not wanting to be confined to playing characters written specifically for Latina actresses.[8]She starred oppositeKeanu Reevesin her first Hollywood release—Eli Roth's erotic thrillerKnock Knock(2015)—and learned her lines phonetically.[33]Despite giving a positive review of the film, Randy Cordova of theArizona Republicfound de Armas to be "unconvincing" in her role.[34]Reeves then telephoned de Armas to invite her to star in a Spanish-language role in the thrillerDaughter of Godwhich he acted in and produced.[35]Producer Mark Downie hoped the film would be a star vehicle for de Armas, but due to executive meddling,Daughter of Godwas severely edited with de Armas' former starring role reduced.

But except for a couple of showy moments, she gets little to do besides function as the dutiful wife."[41]
InDenis Villeneuve's futuristic thrillerBlade Runner 2049(2017), de Armas had a supporting role as Joi, theholographicAIgirlfriend ofRyan Gosling's character, a blade runner. Mark Kermode ofThe Guardiansaid she "brings three-dimensional warmth to a character who is essentially a digital projection."[42]Anthony Lane ofThe New Yorkerfound her to be "wondrous": "Whenever Joi appears, the movie's imaginative heart begins to race."[43]While the performance was initially discussed as a breakthrough role,[44][31]the film underperformed commercially, and de Armas spent much of the following year in her native Cuba, where she purchased a house.[33]For her performance, she earned a nomination for theSaturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. Also in 2017, she had a supporting role in the action thrillerOverdriveas the love interest toScott Eastwood's character.[45]Stephen Dalton ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote that she "radiates more kick-ass charisma than her thankless sidekick role might suggest."[46]

She played a Dominican woman withcongestive heart failurein the short film, funded byMontefiore Medical Centerto raise awareness of organ donation.[47]While de Armas's scenes oppositeHimesh Patelin the 2019 romantic comedyYesterdaywere included in the film's trailer, they were cut from the final product. The directorDanny Boylesaid that, while de Armas was "really radiant" in her scenes, the introduction of a love triangle subplot did not test well with audiences.[48]
De Armas's role as an immigrant nurse in the ensemble murder mystery filmKnives Out(2019), written and directed byRian Johnson, was widely praised and marked a breakthrough for the actress.[49]When first approached about the project, she was unenthusiastic about the idea of playing a stereotypical "Latina caretaker" but soon realized that her character was "so much more than that."[50]Tom Shone ofThe Timesremarked, "The film's standout performance comes from its least well-known member, the Cuban de Armas, who manages the difficult task of making goodness interesting."[51]Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiansaid her "striking" performance left a "lasting impression."[52]The film was a major box office success.[53]De Armas was nominated for theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical[54]with her also winning theSaturn Award for Best Supporting Actressand theNational Board of Review Award for Best Castwith the cast.[55]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
