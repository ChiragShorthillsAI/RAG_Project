Searchlight Pictures was one of the21st Century Foxfilm production units that wasacquired by Disneyin 2019. The studio's current name was adopted in order to avoid confusion withFox Corporation. Searchlight is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideWalt Disney Pictures,Marvel Studios,Lucasfilm, and its larger sister unit20th Century Studios. Compared to 20th Century, whose distribution operations have folded intoWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Searchlight retains its autonomous distribution unit.[4]
Prior to the creation of Searchlight Pictures, 20th Century Fox was active in thespecialty filmmarket, releasing independent and specialty films under the banner of20th Century-Fox International Classics, later renamed20th Century-Fox Specialized Film Division, thenTLC Films. The most notable of the releases under these banners includeSuspiria,Bill Cosby: Himself,Eating Raoul,The Gods Must Be Crazy,Reuben, Reuben, andZiggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.[5]
In the early 1990s, 20th Century Fox executives decided to emulate the commercial success of Disney's newly acquiredMiramaxstudio. In 1994, 20th announced the formation of a subsidiary that would drive their entry into thespecialty filmmarket, and in July that year, they brought inThomas Rothman, then president of production atThe Samuel Goldwyn Company, to head up the new subsidiary. It was soon given the name "Fox Searchlight Pictures", with Rothman as its founding president.[6][1]The new company inherited the familiarbranding elementsassociated with 20th Century Fox; Fox Searchlight films opened with aproduction logoconsisting of the "Fox Searchlight Pictures" name presented as a large monolith, illuminated by the eponymoussearchlightsand accompanied by the 20th Century Fox fanfare composed byAlfred Newman.[7][8]
From its first release,The Brothers McMullen(1995), Fox Searchlight went to distribute a series of independent films such asGirl 6,Stealing Beauty, andShe's the One(all 1996).[9]While critically well received, these early releases were not commercially very successful; Fox Searchlight's first real commercial breakthrough came withThe Full Monty(1997), garnering the studio's first awards.[10]

Eight days later, Disney and 21CF shareholders approved the merger between the two companies.[20]On March 12, 2019, Disney announced it has set to close the Fox deal on March 20.[21][22]On March 19, 2019, 21CFspun offthe remaining assets–theFox Broadcasting Company,Fox Television Stations, the Fox News Group (which includes theFox News Channel), andthe domestic operations of Fox Sports–to the newFox Corporationin preparation for the completion of the sale, which occurred the following day.[23][24][25]The following day it was announced that Fox Searchlight Pictures would be situated under The Walt Disney Studios banner and several high profile layoffs occurred.[26]
As of November 2019,FX Networksand Fox Searchlight were assigned to supplyHuluwith content.[27]On January 17, 2020, it was announced that the "Fox" name would be dropped from several of the Fox assets that were acquired by Disney, shortening the company's name to "Searchlight Pictures", in order to avoid brand confusion with Fox Corporation.[28][7]

Film4is a Britishfree-to-airpublic broadcast television channel owned byChannel Four Television Corporationlaunched on 1 November 1998, dedicated to broadcasting films. Thestandard-definitionchannel is available onFreeviewandFreesatplatforms, while thehigh-definitionvariant is offered free on Freely, and as apay televisionservice on satellite and cable.
The channel offered an onlinevideo on demandservice,Film4oDuntil it was closed in July 2015.
The network has its origins inChannel Four Films, a production company opened byChannel Four Television Corporationin 1982 which has been responsible for backing a large number of films made in the United Kingdom and around the world. The company's first production wasStephen Frears'Walter, which was released in the same year.[citation needed]
In the late 1990s, Film4 Productions partnered withShowtime Australiain its first foreign co-financing venture, withMiranda Dearappointed in 1996[1]as production and acquisition consultant.[2]During this time the collaboration producedJohn Polson'sSiam Sunsetand Mark Lamprell'sMy Mother Frankin Australia. Dear left FilmFour in July 2000,[1]to became commissioning editor of drama atSBS independent(the production arm of public broadcasterSBS), after which FilmFour closed its Australian office.[1]
On 1 November 1998, the production company was re-branded asFilmFourto coincide with the launch of a newdigital televisionchannel of the same name on bothSkyandONdigitalplatforms, becomingChannel 4's second network. At its launch, it was asubscription-only service costing £6 a month, eventually rising to £7. The launch night (which also broadcasts on Channel 4) was hosted byJohnny Vaughanand the first film to be shown wasWhat's Eating Gilbert Grape, as well as the launch evening also featured its British network television premiere ofThe Usual Suspects.[citation needed]
On 31 March 2000 at 6.00am, the analogue version of FilmFour shut down and later switched to digital.[citation needed]
On 7 April 2001, FilmFour expanded with the launch of three additional digital networks.FilmFour Worldcarried the best of international cinema and broadcast from 4:00pm to 10:00pm, whileFilmFour Extremecarried "controversial and cutting-edge" movies, and broadcast from 10:00pm-4:00am, both of which operated on a timeshare. The other addition was the timeshift serviceFilmFour +1, which carried all of the main channel's films an hour later.[3]All three channels were initially exclusive toSky Digitalbut were made available onNTLcable from November-December 2001.[4]
In July 2002, Channel 4 reduced FilmFour's budget from £30 to £10 million and cut 50 staff to curb mounting losses, reintegrating FilmFour as a division of its television operation to continue to invest in new films. The cuts were a consequence of FilmFour's unsuccessful attempts to compete withHollywood. David Thompson, head ofBBC Filmsdescribed it as:[5][6][7]
A very sad day for the British film industry. The British film industry needs confidence right now and this doesn't inspire confidence.
Also in the same year,Tessa Rossbecame the head of both FilmFour and Channel 4 drama.[8]
On 31 March 2003, Channel 4 announced that FilmFour Extreme and FilmFour World would be replaced with a singular network -FilmFour Weekly, on 5 May. FilmFour Weekly was formatted as a "catch-up" network, broadcasting three movies across the week at the same time each day. Films that previously broadcast on Extreme and World would move to the regular FilmFour.[9][10]
On 3 July 2006, Channel 4 announced that FilmFour would relaunch as a free-to-air network on 23 July, as it would see its addition toFreeview, and begin to airadvertisementsduring films. The channel would also be renamed asFilm4, alongside its timeshift service and the production company.[11]The original subscription version of FilmFour and FilmFour +1 closed for the final time on 19 July, with FilmFour Weekly also ceasing broadcast to make way for the relaunch. The new free-to-air Film4 launched on 23 July at 9pm, with the UK free-to-air premiere ofLost in Translationas its first film. Due to the change, the channel's availability increased from 300,000 (subscribers) to 18 million households. It also changed its broadcasting hours from 12.45pm to 8.45am to 3.00pm to 3.00am. The switch to becoming a free channel meant it also lost the ability to adhere to looser broadcasting regulations regarding content on subscription channels - it thus now routinely edits films to make them suitable for pre-watershed screenings before 9pm and removes particularly explicit content from the more extreme material it shows after that time. Most post-9pm films are unedited though.
Prior to the arrivals ofMovie MixandMovies4Menon the Freeview platform, Film4 was the only free film channel available ondigital terrestrial television.
In 2007, the broadcasting hours were amended to 1.00pm to 4.00am. On 20 August 2007, Film4 +1 was removed from Freeview to make way for Channel 4 +1.[12]From 23 May 2009, the broadcasting hours were amended again to 11.00am to 4.00am, with the downtime hours broadcasting eitherteleshoppingor an animated caption screen stating when the channel will return. On 20 July 2010, ahigh-definitionsimulcast – Film4 HD launched exclusively onVirgin Media's cable television platform on channel 429, only available on certain packages.[13][14]On 1 November 2010, Film4 partnered withFilmFlexto launchFilm4oD.[15]On 27 August 2013, Film4 +1 returned to Freeview.[16]Film4 HD launched on Sky on 2 September 2013 as a subscription network, requiring Sky's HD package.[17]Film4 HD is not available on Freeview.
On 2 September 2014, Film4 debuted a new on-air look, designed by Man vs. Machine.[18]There are 16 new idents in the series which run alongside a newon-screen presentation.[19]On 26 November 2014, Film4 +1 became available via Freeview HD services only.[20]On 10 January 2019, Film4 +1 was moved from the Freeview HD PSB3 (DVB-T2) multiplex to the Freeview PSB2 (DVB-T) multiplex, making the service available once again to viewers with non-HD Freeview systems and television sets that are incapable of decoding DVB-T2 signals.[21]The capacity on PSB2 was made available by the "Sewing Quarter" service moving to Freeview COM6 (DVB-T) multiplex operated byArqiva.[citation needed]

In 1999 he was one of the recipients of the VEurope Prize Theatrical Realities[8]awarded to theRoyal Court Theatre(withSarah Kane,Mark Ravenhill,Jez Butterworth,Conor McPherson).[9]

The trilogy starts off withThe Beauty Queen of Leenane, which is the story of the dysfunctional relationship between a spinster and her domineering mother, during the course of which the former faces her last chance at love, and the latter faces a rather grim end.[15]The play was well received on its opening night in Galway in 1996 and was next producedoff-Broadwayby theAtlantic Theater Companyin 1998.[16]The play transferred to Broadway in April 1998 and was nominated for aTony Award for Best Play.[17]

It's not that I don't respect theatre. I'm intelligent enough to know that a play can completely inspire a person as much as a film...[but] theatre isn't something that's connected to me, from a personal point of view, I can't appreciate what I'm doing.[38]
In an interview in 2005, theNew York Timeswriter observed that McDonagh "now seems more comfortably resigned to the storytelling powers of drama, if still dismissive of its inherent elitism. 'It's kind of weird working in an art form that's not, well ...,' he stops and starts again. 'It's strange to be working in an art form that costs $100 to participate in.'"[39]In an interview with Sean O'Hagan ofThe Guardian, McDonagh said theatre "is never going to be edgy in the way I want it to be",[4]when discussing his absence from London theatre and promoting his new playHangmen.

In a 2008 interview withStop Smilingmagazine, McDonagh said, "I've got a couple of film scripts that are ready to go. I'm not going to do anything with them for a couple of years, until I've travelled and had some fun. But there's one calledSeven Psychopaths; if I do another film, that'll be it. I hope you like it."[46]The production of the film was confirmed in May 2011 and it was eventually released in North America on 12 October 2012. Colin Farrell,Sam Rockwell,Woody Harrelson, Christopher Walken, and Tom Waits star in the film.[47][48]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
