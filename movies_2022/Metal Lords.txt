Metal Lordsis a 2022 Americanteencomedy-dramafilm written byD. B. Weissand directed byPeter Sollett.[2]The story follows two high school best friends andmetalmusic lovers, Hunter and Kevin, who set out to start a metal band, against societal norms.[3][4]The film was released onNetflixon April 8, 2022.[5]
MetalheadHunter Sylvester jams with his best friend, introvert Kevin Schlieb, who as yet only plays a single drum in the school's marching band. During marching band practice, Kevin witnesses sensitive Scottish student Emily having a full meltdown and quitting band because of her lack of skill with the clarinet.
Later that day, Kevin drags Hunter to a party at Clay's house and tries to fit in while Hunter feels misplaced. Kevin gets drunk and flirts with Kendall, while Hunter gets into an altercation with jock Skip and derides Clay's band, Mollycoddle.
Learning that the school is holding aBattle of the Bandscontest, Hunter registers his and Kevin's band, Skullfucker. Hunter steals his father's credit card and buys an exorbitant amount of gear, including a full drum kit for Kevin.
Kevin adopts a grueling daily practice schedule after school, learning Hunter's metal playlists by ear; he notices that Emily is a skilled cello player with equal dedication. They become mutually interested, which prompts Kevin to give her a copy of the playlist. Meanwhile, Hunter auditions bassists to complete the trio, but is unsuccessful, and has an escalating series of run-ins with Skip.
Kevin unsuccessfully tries to pitch Emily as their new bassist but Hunter rejects her outright. Afterwards, Kevin calls her to apologize for Hunter's behavior and they have sex. Kevin and Emily become a couple, which enrages Hunter, who believes she will be theirYoko Ono.
While Kevin continues to hone his skills, Clay hears Kevin practicing and immediately recognizes his advanced abilities and 'intense' drumming style; since Mollycoddle's drummer is in rehab, he asks Kevin to be their drummer for a performance at his sister's wedding. During speech class, Hunter mocks Emily until she attacks him, breaking his guitar in the process. These circumstances lead to an argument between Hunter and Kevin, with the latter leaving Skullfucker.
As Kevin performs at the wedding reception, Hunter tries to crash it in fullheavy metal costumebut is arrested for trespassing. Clay praises Kevin's contributions, mastering the material on short notice and elevating their original pop music with his techniques. Clay invites him to hang out and join Mollycoddle for the Battle of the Bands, which Kevin reluctantly accepts. A drunk Kendall invites Kevin into the hot tub andmakes outwith him. Kevin's conscience materializes as heavy metal musiciansScott Ian,Tom Morello,Kirk HammettandRob Halford. Through the apparitions, Kevin realizes that he loves Emily and leaves to be with her. Kevin later discovers that Hunter's father sent him torehabas punishment.
At the rehab clinic, Hunter meets his idol Dr. Troy Nix, former lead guitarist of metal band Killoton, the last Battle of the Bands champions. Nix explains that he became a doctor after rehabilitating from alcohol abuse, which itself was due to the dysfunction of being in a band with people he didn't really like. Although Hunter is fit for discharge, due to clinic policy it cannot be until Monday, after the contest.
Kevin breaks Hunter and Mollycoddle's drummer out from the clinic. Hunter and Kevin go to Emily's, where Hunter apologizes and recognizes Emily's metal attitude, but she responds that she is not ready to perform.
At the Battle of the Bands, Kevin apologizes to Clay and presents Mollycoddle's now sober drummer to resume his position. Kevin and Hunter prepare to perform as a duo, when Emily joins them with anelectric celloand gothic metal gear. Just before they take the stage, Principal Swanson warns them the name "Skullfucker" is inappropriate for the event, forcing Emily to quickly change it to Skullflower.
Despite initial skepticism, their performance wins over the crowd. However, during Hunter's guitar solo, an inebriated Skip stumbles out of amosh pitand shoves Hunter into his amplifier stack. The amplifiers crash down, breaking Hunter's leg.
Later, the band reads in the paper that their performance went viral, despite losing the Battle of the Bands and coming in second behind Mollycoddle. They conclude that they are the moral winners of the contest as the entire crowd loved them and sang the chorus of their original song, and they received more prominent media coverage. As an inclusive trio, they begin to practice with renewed vigor and camaraderie.
in addition, metal musiciansScott Ian,Tom Morello,Kirk HammettandRob Halfordappear in cameo roles as themselves, representing Kevin's conscience, while music critic and author on heavy metal,Chuck Klosterman, plays the school's band teacher.

Sollett's first film wasFive Feet High and Rising, a 26-minute short film about the growth and coming-of-age of teenager Victor Vargas.[3]He andEva ViveswroteFive Feet High and Risingas their thesis film in 1998 atNew York University'sTisch School of the Artsand he served as the film's director, cinematographer and editor.[2]After he had the opportunity to work with professionals in the film industry at theCannes Residence Programme,[4]the short film went on to screen on the festival circuit and won a number of awards at theSundance Film Festival,Cannes Film Festival,Aspen Shortsfest,Valencia International Film Festival,South by Southwest Film FestivalandCinema Jove International Film Festival. Two years after the release ofFive Feet High and Rising, Sollett and Vives reunited to collaborate on a follow-up project that becameRaising Victor Vargas, originally namedLong Way Home.[3][5]While Sollett says thatFive Feet High and Risingwas purely autobiographical and based on the Italian,Jewishneighborhood he grew up inBrooklyn,[2][6]he and Vives decided to create another film directly about the experiences of the main characters Victor and Judy, continuing on two years after the film left off.[3]Using the same cast as the original short film, he wrote an action-and-dialoguescreenplaywhich he did not give to any of the actors to encourage them to improvise and create a feeling of spontaneity and authenticity.[5][2]Raising Victor Vargasearned Sollett threeIndependent Spirit Awardnominations in the categories ofBest Film,Best DirectorandBest First Screenplay,[7]as well as other awards and nominations at theViennale,San Sebastián International Film Festival,Online Film Critics Society Awards,Deauville Film Festival,Gotham Awardsand theHumanitas Prize.

The film takes place over one night inManhattan, where a number ofNew Jerseyteenagers have commuted in for the night—something Sollett was familiar with and often did himself, having lived in Brooklyn as a child andStaten Islandas an adult.[9]Many of his personal favorite Manhattan locations also featured in the film, includingKatz's Deliand theLower East Side'sMercury Lounge.[9]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
