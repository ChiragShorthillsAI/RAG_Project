The film starsMark Rylancewho leads anensemble castincludingZoey Deutch,Johnny Flynn,Dylan O'Brien,Nikki Amuka-Bird, andSimon Russell Beale. Rylance plays an Englishcutterwho runs a tailor shop in Chicago, whose primary customers are a family of vicious gangsters. The film premiered at the72nd Berlin International Film Festivalon February 14, 2022,[5]and was released in the United States on March 18, 2022, byFocus Features, to positive reviews from critics.
In 1956 Chicago, Leonard Burling is an Englishcutterwho runs a custom tailor shop in a neighborhood controlled byIrish Mobboss Roy Boyle. Roy's son and second-in-command, Richie, and his chief enforcer, Francis, use Leonard's shop as a stash house fordirty money; Leonard tolerates this arrangement as the Boyles and their men are his best customers. Leonard also shares a complicated relationship with shop receptionist Mable, who is also Richie's girlfriend.
One night, Francis shows up at the shop with Richie, who's been shot in the abdomen after a confrontation with the rival LaFontaine family. Leonard is forced at gunpoint to treat Richie's wounds and hide a briefcase containing a copy of anFBIrecording with detailed information on the crew's operations, which was provided by "The Outfit", a nationwide syndicate founded byAl Capone. Francis gets in touch with Roy and departs, leaving Leonard and Richie alone. Richie believes that there is aratin their organization, as the LaFontaines seem to know their every move, and believes that the recording will reveal the rat's identity. Leonard suggests to Richie that Francis is the rat.
When Francis returns, Leonard intercepts him, claiming that Richie is light-headed and delusional from blood loss. Richie threatens Francis, who kills him. He and Leonard hide Richie's body just as Roy arrives with his bodyguard Monk. The two men lie and tell Roy that Richie left the store on his own; Francis volunteers to go find him. Roy notices Richie's coat in the store's backroom and threatens Leonard. Francis then returns with Mable in tow, claiming that he found Richie's blood in her apartment and suggesting that she is the rat. When Roy orders his men to torture her for information, Leonard distracts him by revealing the reason why he came to Chicago: his wife and daughter were killed in a fire at his former shop and home onSavile Row.
The shop's phone rings and Leonard answers it; he lies that the call was from Richie, who is waiting for Roy. Roy and Monk depart but Francis insists on staying. Leonard convinces Francis to betray Roy by using Mable, who really is the rat and has been selling information to LaFontaine and the FBI; Roy's death at LaFontaine's hands will allow Francis to take over Roy's business. At Leonard's urging, Mable calls Violet LaFontaine to give her Roy's location and offer to sell her the recording. Francis hides at the back of the store when Violet arrives, intending to kill her, but Leonard warns Violet and her bodyguards shoot Francis twice instead. Mable takes the payment, and Violet leaves with the tape.
It is revealed that the night's events played out due to Leonard's manipulation. Leonard has been deceiving the Boyles by planting fake messages from The Outfit, and knew that Mable has allowed the FBI to place abugin his store. The recording Violet took was a fake; the real one is still in the store and has been recording the night's conversations, capturing enough information to convict any remaining Boyles as well as LaFontaine. Leonard gives Mable the real tape to send to the FBI and urges her to use LaFontaine's money to live her dreams.
Intending to start over again, Leonard douses the store with flammable liquid and lights it with a match, but is interrupted when Francis gets up and tries to kill him. Leonard tells Francis that he used to be a gang enforcer like him, but left when he was ordered to commit a heinous crime. Fleeing from his gang, he reinvented himself and started a family, until his old gang found them and burned down his shop, killing his wife and daughter. Leonard fatally stabs Francis in the neck with his prized fabric shears. Wearing a dark jacket to hide his wounds, he quietly leaves the store as it burns.

In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]

The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Graham Moore(born October 18, 1981) is an American screenwriter, author and director known for his 2010 novelThe Sherlockian, as well as his screenplay for the historical filmThe Imitation Game,[1]which topped the 2011Black Listfor screenplays and won the 2014Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay(awarded February 2015).
Moore was born inChicago, Illinoisand raised on the city'snorth side.[2]He is "the son of two lawyers who divorced and then married two other lawyers";[3]Moore's father, Gary Moore, is an insurancedefense attorneyand his mother,Susan Sher(née Steiner), works for theUniversity of Chicago. His mother was formerly the City of Chicago's chief lawyer and First LadyMichelle Obama'schief of staff.[4][5][6]
Moore's parents divorced when he was young.[2]Moore's stepfather isCook County Circuit CourtJudgeNeil Cohen.[7]Raised Jewish,[2]Moore graduated from theUniversity of Chicago Laboratory Schools[7][8]in 1999 and received a bachelor of arts degree in religious history in 2003 fromColumbia University.
During his Academy Award acceptance speech in February 2015, Moore stated:[9]
When I was 16 years old, I tried to kill myself because I felt weird and I felt different, and I felt like I did not belong. And now I'm standing here, and so I would like this moment to be for this kid out there who feels like she's weird or she's different or she doesn't fit in anywhere: Yes, you do. I promise you do. Stay weird, stay different
This led viewers to believe that Graham Moore was gay and highlighted his own experience as anLGBTQyouth. Many people praised the speech onTwittercomparing it to the openly gay screenwriterDustin Lance Blackwho won an Oscar forMilk(2008). However, Moore has clarified to reporters he is in fact straight and not gay.[10]
The speech has since drawn criticisms for his use of the word "weird" and for misleading audiences. J. Bryan Lowder ofSlatewrote, "without harping on Moore's flustered speech too much, it's worth taking a moment to explain the trouble with that equivalence more generally and to think about why gay people might be so sensitive to it—especially coming as it did from the straight writer of a film that desperately marketed itself to audiences and Academy voters as a gay political statement."[11]Ira Maddison III ofBuzzfeedsharply criticized the language and vaugeness of Moore's speech writing, "We don't need a straight, white male who wrote a straight-washed movie about Alan Turing as our savior. We need diverse women and men who are looking to the future, not people looking to past and crafting a speech that will appeal in its vagueness to anyone who's "weird.""[12]
Moore lives in Los Angeles, California. He married a woman in 2019 and together they have a child.[13]
Moore began his writing career working with childhood friend Ben Epstein, who was attendingTisch School of the Artsin New York City.[2]One of his earliest Hollywood jobs was on the writing staff of the short-lived television series10 Things I Hate About You.[14]
Moore's first book,The Sherlockian,was on the New York Times bestseller list for three weeks.[3]
His adapted screenplay for the 2014 filmThe Imitation Game, based on the biographyAlan Turing: The EnigmabyAndrew Hodges, topped the 2011Black Listof the best unproduced scripts inHollywood.[15]The script earned Moore numerous nominations, including the 2014Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay, and ultimately won the 2014Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplayat the87th Academy Awards(awarded February 2015).
Moore's second book,The Last Days of Night, was published by Random House on August 16, 2016. Set in 1888 New York City, the novel focuses on the heated rivalry betweenThomas EdisonandGeorge Westinghouseduring the advent of electricity and is told through the eyes of Westinghouse's attorney,Paul Cravath.[16]Moore has adapted the screenplay forThe Last Days of Nightto be directed by Oscar-nominated director ofThe Imitation GameMorten Tyldum.[17]Moore will write, direct, and produce the sci-fi thrillerNaked Is the Best DisguiseforStudio 8.[18]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
