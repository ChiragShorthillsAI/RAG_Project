Film4 Productionsis a British film production company owned byChannel Four Television Corporation. The company has been responsible for backing many films made in the United Kingdom. The company's first production wasWalter, directed byStephen Frears, which was released in 1982. It is especially known for its gritty,kitchen sink-style films andperiod dramas.
In 1981, producerDavid Roseleft theBBCfor Channel 4 where he was appointed the Commissioning Editor for Fiction byJeremy Isaacs, the channel's founding Chief Executive but became mostly identified with theFilm on Fourstrand. With an initial overall budget of £6 million a year,Channel Four Filmswas to invest in twenty films annually for Film on Four.[1]The first film backed wasNeil Jordan's debut filmAngel(1982).[2]The first film shown as part of Film on Four wasStephen Frears'sWalterwhich was screened on 2 November 1982, the launch date of Channel 4.P'tang, Yang, Kipperbangscreened the following day was also an early highlight.[3]Originally, the company's films were intended for television screenings alone; the "holdback" system prevented investment in theatrical films by television companies because of the length of time (then three years) before broadcasters could screen them. An agreement soon concluded with the Cinema Exhibitors Association allowed a brief period of cinema exhibition if the budget of the films was below £1.25 million.[3]Channel Four Films struck several deals with other film production companies including theBFI Production Board,Goldcrest FilmsandMerchant Ivory.[3]By 1984, Channel Four Films were investing in a third of the feature films made in the UK.[4]
Channel Four's Business Development Department was formed in 1983 for TV and film sales[5]and they also invested in foreign films includingWim Wenders'Paris, Texas(1984) andJan Svankmajer'sAlice(1988).[3]In 1985FilmFour Internationalwas created as a separate international film sales arm and to invest in foreign film, includingAndrei Tarkovsky'sThe Sacrifice(1986).[5][2][3]
Channel Four Film's first big hit was Frears' third feature film for the cinema,My Beautiful Laundrette, in 1985.[6]Originally shot in16mmfor Channel 4 it was met with such critical acclaim at theEdinburgh Film Festivalthat it was acquired byOrion Classicsand distributed to cinemas and became an international success.[7][8][2]
In 1987, FilmFour International agreed a licensing deal with Orion Classics to handle US distribution of two more FilmFour features,Rita, Sue and Bob TooandA Month in the Country.[9]By 1987, Channel 4 had an interest in half the films being made in the United Kingdom.[10]
Rose and Channel Four Films are credited by many as being a significant figure in the regeneration of British cinema and particularly remembered for films such asWish You Were Here,Dance With a Stranger,Mona Lisa, andLetter to Brezhnev. Channel Four Films also invested in earlyWorking Title Filmsas well as most of the films of Frears,Ken LoachandMike Leigh.[2]Leigh told writerHannah Rothschildaround 2008 that Film on Four had saved the British film industry: "This is a non-negotiable, historical fact of life and anybody who suggests that this isn't the case is simply either suffering from some kind of ignorance or has got some terrible chip."[1]
Rose remained in his post as Commissioning Editor until March 1990.[6]During his tenure at Channel 4, Rose approved the making of 136 films, half of which received cinema screenings.[11]Of the films Rose backed, 20 were from overseas sources, including work by directorsTheo Angelopoulos,Andrei TarkovskyandWim Wenders.[12]The company also helped British minority filmmakers includingPo-Chih Leong(Ping Pong(1986));Horace Ové(Playing Away(1986)) andHanif Kureishi(My Beautiful Laundrette;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid(1987)). This continued after Rose's departure with films directed byGurinder Chadha(Bhaji on the Beach(1993)) andSteve McQueen(Hunger(2008)).[13]
David Aukinjoined as head of drama in October 1990 and took over responsibility for Film on Four.[6]He changed his title to head of film in 1997 which he remained until 1998.[2]
The company had another big international success with Jordan'sThe Crying Gamein 1992.[2]In addition it was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Pictureas wasHowards Endthe same year.Damagealso received an Academy Award nomination that year.[6]Later in 1993, Leigh'sNakedand Loach'sRaining Stoneswere entered into competition at the1993 Cannes Film Festival.[6]
The following year,Mike Newell'sFour Weddings and a Funeralbecame thehighest-grossing UK film of all timeandDanny Boyle'sTrainspotting(1996) was also very successful.[2]
In the 1990s, Channel Four partnered withThe Samuel Goldwyn Companyto create a distribution company to release Channel Four films and Goldwyn films in the UK but Goldwyn pulled out late on and in August 1995,Film Four Distributorswas formed.[14]Its first release wasBlue Juice(1995) and its first major successes wereSecrets & LiesandBrassed Offin 1996.[15][16][2]
In 1998, the company was re-branded asFilmFourwith an annual budget of £32 million for 8 to 10 films.[6]East Is East(1999) becomes their biggest self-funded film.[6]In 2000, the company signed a three-year deal withWarner Bros.to make seven films with budgets of more than £13 million but their first,Charlotte Gray(2001) was not the success they hoped for.[6]
The company cut its budget and staff significantly in 2002, due to mounting losses, and was reintegrated into the drama department of Channel 4. The name "Film4 Productions" was introduced in 2006 to tie in with the relaunch of the FilmFour broadcast channel asFilm4.[citation needed]

Ismaïl Abou El Kanater(Arabic:إسماعيل أبو القناطر; born 1957) is aMoroccanactor. He participated in several Moroccan and foreign films and series.
Ismail began his artistic career through training at the Conservatory in Casablanca, and he studied alongside Aziz Saadallah, Khadija Asad and others, and participated as an actor in the plays (The Ghoul) and (Our Right to Land). In the early seventies, he participated, along with Conservatoire students, in founding the (Pocket Theater) troupe and undertaking a theatrical tour inAlgeria. In 1973, he worked in the plays ofTayeb Saddikisuch as (Maqamat Badi Al-Zaman Al-Hamdani), (Sidi Abdel-Rahman Al-Majdoub) and (Al-Sufoud), and in some television sketches by the late director Hamid Bin Al-Sharif, in addition to a dramatic work entitled (The Deserted Village), accompanied by Khadija Asad and Al-Shuaiba Al-Athrawi,Touriya Jabrane, and zhour maamri. He also participated with the director Abd al-Rahman al-Khayyat in the play (Dirham al-Halal) alongside Naima al-Mashriqi, Aziz Mawhoub and others, and in a television movie a person whose role is only he and Naima al-Mashriqi and directed by the husband of the latter.
In 1977, Abou El Kanater traveled to theUnited Statesto study the art of diagnosis, in fulfillment of a deep desire in himself since childhood, in which he started watching American films in particular in the Mondial and Monte Carlo halls and others with his father, his dream is to one day become an international actor of the caliber ofMarlon Brando. Indeed, he enrolled in an American university, where he studied cinema, painting, sculpture, engineering and design for four years, and obtained a degree in cinema (major) and psychology (minor), and instead of merging into the worlds of cinema, he returned to the theater there and performed the plays (Diary of a Madman) byNikolai Gogoland (Caligula) ByAlbert Camus. He made successful tours. He also stood on the stage of the most famous experimental and avant-garde theaters in New York (Manhattan), and worked with the world-famous "Lamama" theater and with other groups. Under the urgency of the desire to practice cinematic and television diagnostics, Abu al-Qanater went to Hollywood in the nineties, but the road was not paved with roses, and he returned to practicing his theatrical love through the play (Shahrazad and the Four Daughters of Baghdad) that was successfully shown. As part of his research on the life ofMuslims in Andalusia, in preparation for writing a theatrical text whose hero isLady Macbethas an Andalusian Muslim, he got acquainted with the Sufism movement in Andalusia and the elder SheikhIbn Arabiin particular, so he devoted himself to reading his texts and what was written about him. As a result of his influence, he decided to leave the Macbeth play project aside and devote himself to the completion of (One Man Show: Ibn Arabi) through which he will review his travel from Andalusia to Fez, Algeria, Tunisia and Asia, all the way to the home ofJalaluddin Al-Rumi. And he began to read about the latter and traveled with him in his worlds, and in the end settled his opinion on the completion of a first theatrical work on Jalal al-Din al-Rumi, a second on Ibn Arabi and a third on Macbeth. During his openness to the worlds of Sufi poles, he found that what he is doing is in fact a search for himself, through what he has lived and witnessed of things, so he became involved in the worlds of Sufism and traveled toKarachiand discovered the music of Pakistaniqawwaliand learned many things. He decided to perform the Hajj in the Holy Land, but a friend advised him to marry first, so he returned to Morocco and married in 2000 and had his first daughter from his oval wife in 2001 and then with a second daughter. And since he became responsible for a family of four people living under his cover in American homes in Los Angeles, it became clear to him that working in theater alone was no longer enough, and from here he decided to open up to cinema and television and transfer his long theatrical experience to them, so Abu Al-Qanater was able to enter the American art scene from Through many famous American series, including (24), (Sleeping Cell), (Elias), (over there), (Babylon 5) and others, and he also participated in many international films, includingthe Queen of the DesertbyWerner Herzog, which part was filmed From him in Morocco, and it was starringNicole Kidman,James FrancoandRobert Pattinson. In Morocco, the "Labricad" series was his first television work, which he filmed under the direction of director Adel El-Fadili, followed by many television and cinematic films.[1][2][3][4]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
