Downton Abbey: A New Erais a 2022historical drama filmdirected bySimon Curtisfrom a screenplay byJulian Fellowes. It is the sequel toDownton Abbey(2019) and the second film in theDownton Abbeyfranchise. Set in 1928, it follows the Crawley family on a journey to the south of France to uncover the mystery of the Dowager Countess's newly inherited villa.
Downton Abbey: A New Erapremiered atOdeon Luxe Leicester Squarein London on 25 April 2022 and was released in the United Kingdom on 29 April and in the United States on 20 May byFocus Features.[5]The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $92.7 million worldwide against a production budget of $40 million.
Asequelis set for release in September 2025.
In 1928, Tom Branson, theEarlof Grantham's widowed son-in-law, marries Lucy Smith, the illegitimate daughter of and sole heir to Lady Maud Bagshaw,Queen Mary'slady-in-waiting. Violet Crawley, the Dowager Countess of Grantham, astonishes the family by revealing that long ago she was given a villa inSouthern Franceby theMarquisde Montmirail, who has recently died. Violet is bequeathing it to her great-granddaughter, Sybbie, the daughter of Tom and the late Lady Sybil Crawley, to ensure that she is more socially and financially on a par with her cousins George, Caroline, Marigold and Peter.
Afilm production companywants to use Downton to shoot a silent film calledThe Gambler. Robert declines, until his eldest daughter and estate manager, Lady Mary Talbot, convinces him that the fee would replace Downton's leaking roof. The household staff are eager to see the film's stars, but lead actress Myrna Dalgliesh's haughtiness offends some of them.
The new Marquis de Montmirail invites the Crawley family to visit the villa. The ailing Violet is unable to travel, but Tom and Lucy, Lady Bagshaw, Robert Crawley and his wife Cora, their daughter Edith and her husband, Bertie Pelham, theMarquessof Hexham, accept. Former butler Carson, valet Mr Bates, and lady's maid Miss Baxter accompany the family.
Lady Edith, once again writing for the London-based magazine she owns, uses the trip as a working assignment. Lady Mary remains at Downton to oversee the film crew, assisted by Mrs Carson, the former Mrs Hughes.
The Marquis de Montmirail welcomes the family to the villa. His mother contests Violet Crawley's ownership. However, the family lawyer states that there is no basis for a claim, especially as the late Marquis bequeathed the villa to Violet before marrying. The villa is legally Violet's.
The Marquis later stuns Robert by implying that Robert's birth date, nine months after the Dowager Countess's 1864 visit, could mean they are half-brothers. That night, Cora tells Robert she may have a fatal illness. Robert breaks down at the prospect of losing his mother, the Crawley name and title, and his wife in short succession.
At Downton, the studio cancelsThe Gamblerbecause silent films have become unprofitable in the "talkie" era. Lady Mary suggests salvaging the project bydubbing in the dialoguefor completed scenes and filming new ones with sound. Lead actor Guy Dexter's resonant voice is suitable, but Myrna Dalgleish'scockneyaccent is inappropriate for her upper-class character. Mrs Hughes suggests that Lady Mary dub Dalgleish's voice. Fearing her career is ruined, Dalgleish quits, but Downton servants Anna and Daisy persuade her to complete the film. Former Downton footman Mr Molesley, who canlip-read, reconstructs the dialogue for dubbing, and creates a dialogued script. During production, Dexter tacitly reveals to Downton'sclosetedbutler, Thomas Barrow, that he is also gay, and they form a romantic bond. Dexter offers Barrow the position of housekeeper and wardrobe assistant in New York, which Barrow accepts.
The family returns to Downton while filming continues. Lady Mary gently rebuffs director Jack Barber's flirtations, although her husband Henry's prolonged absence for a car rally has strained their marriage. Barrow accepts Dexter's job offer so they can have a life together. Dr Clarkson diagnoses Cora withpernicious anaemia, a treatable condition. Cora helps Dalgleish develop an American accent, potentially saving her career. Edith, unfulfilled and constrained as a marchioness, intends to resume running her London-based magazine. Wanting more privacy, newlywed servants Daisy and Andy successfully scheme to match Daisy's former father-in-law, Mr Mason, and Downton cook Mrs Patmore. When the unpaid movie extras walk out, the Downton staff replace them, ensuring the film's completion. Barber offers Molesley a lucrative deal as ascreenwriter. Molesley then proposes to Baxter, unaware that everyone can overhear them on an open microphone.
Violet assures Robert that the late Lord Grantham was his father and that nothing serious occurred between her and the elder Montmirail. Violet's health deteriorates and she dies surrounded by family and servants. Mary asks Carson to temporarily return as butler to train footman Andy as Barrow's replacement. Months later, Tom and Lucy, along with Sybbie, return to Downton with their newborn child. A new portrait of Violet hangs in the entry hall.

In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

In 2018, it was reported that Fellowes was slated to serve as a writer on a TV drama series about theRothschild banking dynasty, executive produced byJemima Goldsmith.[21]As of 2025, it remains unproduced.
Fellowes was the screenwriter and one of the producers forDownton Abbey, which was released in September 2019, and its sequel,Downton Abbey: A New Era. Most members of the cast of the television programme appear in the movie versions.[22][23]
In April 2015,The Hollywood Reporterreported that Fellowes was at work on a new period drama series forNBC television, to be set in late 19th-centuryNew York City, entitledThe Gilded Age.[24]Fellowes suggested that a younger version ofMaggie Smith's Dowager Countess character from hisDownton Abbeydrama might appear in the new series, saying: "Robert Crawley would be in his early teens, Cora would be a child. A young Violet [the Dowager Countess] could make an appearance."[24]As the title suggests, the series would be set during the time of America's so-calledGilded Age– the industrial boom era in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries – and portray the upper echelons of New York'shigh societyduring that period.[24]
Production and writing forThe Gilded Agewas updated in January 2016 indicating that filming would start at the end of 2016. As reported in RadioTimes: "NBC'sThe Gilded Ageis set to start shooting later this year, Fellowes tells RadioTimes.com. Asked whether he'd written the script yet, Fellowes replied, 'No I haven't, no. I'm doing that this year', before adding: 'And then hopefully shooting at the end of the year.'"[25]In April 2016, it was announced that Fellowes would be the producer ofThe Gilded Agewhen it was reported that Fellowes is "about to begin writingThe Gilded Agefor NBC, a sort of AmericanDowntonabout fortunes made and lost in late 19th century New York, which he will also produce."[26]
On 4 June 2016, Fellowes was asked byThe Los Angeles Times, "Where doesThe Gilded Agestand?" Fellowes replied,
It stands really with me up to my neck in research, and I'm clearing the decks, so that when I startGilded Age, I'm only doingGilded Age.These people were extraordinary. You can see why they frightened the old guard, because they saw no boundaries. They wanted to build a palace, they built a palace. They wanted to buy a yacht, they bought a yacht. The old guard in New York weren't like that at all, and suddenly this whirlwind of couture descended on their heads. The newcomers redesigned being rich. They created a rich culture that we still have – people who are rich today are generally rich in a way that was established in America in the 1880s, '90s, 1900s. It was different from Europe. Something like Newport would never have happened in any other country, where you have huge palaces, and then about 20 yards away, another huge palace, and 20 yards beyond that another huge palace. In England right up to the 1930s, when people made money, they would buy an estate of 5,000 acres and they'd have to look after Nanny. The Americans of the 1880s and '90s didn't want too much of that.[27]
In August 2016, Fellowes indicated that his plans forThe Gilded Agewould not overlap substantially with the characters inDownton Abbeysince most of them would have been children in those earlier "prequel" decades. Writing forCreative Screenwriting, Sam Roads asked Fellowes, "Will there be any connection betweenThe Gilded AgeandDownton Abbey?" to which Fellowes stated:
I can't see it really. Someone asked if you would you see any of theDowntoncharacters, but most of them would be children. They said that Violet wouldn't be a child, and I replied that "Yes, I suppose you could see a younger Violet", and this became a newspaper story. "Violet comes from Downton to appear inThe Gilded Age!" It might be fun, but I doubt at the beginning, because I want it to be a new show with new people.[28]
Fellowes wrote an adaptation of the novelDoctor Thorneby one of his favorite writers,Anthony Trollope.[29][30]TheITVadaptation aired on 6 March 2016.[31]A report in early September 2018 stated that Fellowes had two projects underway, both in development: the Netflix seriesThe English GameandThe Gilded Agefor NBC.[22]In May 2019,The Gilded Agemoved toHBO, and it premiered in January 2022.[32]
On 13 January 2011, Fellowes was elevated to thepeerage, being createdBaron Fellowes of West Stafford, ofWest Staffordin theCounty of Dorset,[34]and on the same day wasintroducedin theHouse of Lords,[35]where he sits on theConservativebenches.[36]

On 28 April 1990, Fellowes married Emma Joy Kitchener (born 1963), daughter of Charles Kitchener (1920–1982) and alady-in-waitingtoPrincess Michael of Kent. She is also a great-grandniece ofHerbert, 1st Earl Kitchener.[41]He proposed to her only 20 minutes after meeting her at a party, "having spent 19 minutes getting up the nerve". On 15 October 1998 the Fellowes family changed its surname from Fellowes to Kitchener-Fellowes.[42][43][44]
Fellowes publicly expressed his dissatisfaction that theproposals to change the rules of royal successionwere not extended tohereditary peerages, which had they been would have allowed his wife to succeed her uncle asCountess Kitchenerin her own right. He said: "I find it ridiculous that, in 2011, a perfectly sentient adult woman has no rights of inheritance whatsoever when it comes to a hereditary title."[45]Instead, thetitlebecame extinct on her uncle's death because there were no male heirs, as he was unmarried.
On 9 May 2012, QueenElizabeth IIissued aroyal warrant of precedencegranting Lady Fellowes the same rank and style as the daughter of anearl, as would have been due to her if her late father had survived his brother and therefore succeeded to the earldom.[46]Fellowes and his wife have one son, Peregrine Charles Morant Kitchener-Fellowes (born 1991).[43]

But when the offer came from this fringe theatre group, the Brighton Combination, to leave university and join them for five quid a week, it was like a door opening, and there wasn't a moment's hesitation. I walked through that door and never looked back. I have never earned a penny from doing anything apart from acting. I have never had another job."[4]

They married in 1983 and have one daughter,Bessie, born in 1993, who enrolled at theNational Youth Theatrein 2010. Staunton says of Carter's acting, "He has never been the sort of actor who yearns to play Hamlet. Maybe it's because he came to acting from performing in the circus. He has always done just what he wants to do."[37]
Staunton later claimed that after 21 years of marriage, she and Carter had been apart for only three weeks.[38]They have aterriernamed Molly.[39][failed verification][40]

Theatre critic Paul Taylor forThe Independentwrote, "Maggie Smith has to be seen to be believed. The sudden subsidings into wretched senile tears; the frustrated, dismissive flappings of her arm as her mind gropes impotently for a mislaid fact; the comic cunning with which she tries to cover over her patches of blankness; the beadily aggressive suspicion and the moments of alert cackling triumph – Smith's performance which, at the moment, is firmly on the right side of caricature, captures all this and more."[62]She received her record fifthEvening StandardTheatre Award for Best Actressfor her performance.[63]

They were always – when everything had been done and the children were finished, they would turn the camera around and we'd have to do various reaction shots of amazement or sadness and things. And we used to say we'd got to about number 200-and-something and we'd run out of knowing what to do when the camera came around on us. But he was a joy."[69]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
