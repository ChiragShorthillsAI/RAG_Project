A young singer on the brink of stardom is determined to hold on to her identity amid her rising fame and the oppressive household of her religious parents.
On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes,Beautyholds an approval rating of 22% based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 5.10/10.[4]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 42 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[5]
Lovia Gyarkye ofThe Hollywood Reportercommended Dosunmu's direction for delivering "beautiful, indulgent vignettes" that are "aesthetically pleasing and immersive" in its vibes but was critical of the broadly straightforward story and its characters being "vague sketches" with "predictable and perfunctory" conversations, concluding: "As it stands,Beautyfeels too distant, treating its mercurial protagonist just as her mother feared — like a fantasy."[2]Noel Murray of theLos Angeles Timeswas critical of Waithe's interpretation ofWhitney Houston's story being composed of "mid-20th century progressive theater" archetypes, saying "this semi-true story is ultimately too sketchy to have anything effective to say about Houston, mainstream success or being in the closet."[6]Kristen Lopez ofIndieWiregave the film an overall D+ grade, writing: "Beauty could have something interesting to say about the cultural and aesthetic straitjacket Black female artists endured in the 1970s and 1980s, and whether that's changed (or not) even today. But Dosunmu's airless directing and Waithe's thin script only amount to loud allegory that never goes anywhere and drowns out any compelling ideas that might be worth singing."[7]

But being the bright spot in too many dull movies (He Said, She Said;Irreconcilable Differences) stalled her career. ThoughBasic Instinctestablishes Stone as abombshellfor the 1990s, it also shows she can nail a laugh or shade an emotion with equal aplomb."[30]Australian critic Shannon J. Harvey ofThe Sunday Timescalled the film "one of the best films of the early1990s, doing more for female empowerment than any feminist rally. Stone – in her star-making performance – is as hot and sexy as she is ice-pick cold."[31]For the part, Stone earned aGolden Globe Awardnomination forBest Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, fourMTV Movie Awardsnominations, and aGolden Raspberry Awardnomination forWorst New Starfor her "tribute toTheodore Cleaver".

Her turn as a street-wise, middle-aged moll inGloria(1999), a remake of the 1980film of the same name, proved to be a critical and commercial misfire.[45][46][47]A titular role followed in 1999 with the comedyThe Muse, playing the inspiration of an esteemed screenwriter. Wade Major, a critic forBoxoffice, found her portrayal of a "dizzy Muse" to be "the film's most delightful surprise",[48]but most reviews were ultimately lukewarm. Helmut Voss, then president of theHollywood Foreign Press Association, which gave the annualGolden Globe Awards, ordered all 82 of its members to return gift luxury watches sent by either Stone orOctober Films(now merged intoFocus Features) as these were considered to be promotions for a nomination for Stone's performance in the film.[49]She ultimately received the nomination forBest Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical.

Club, who had been critical of Stone's previous films, wrote that "nothing she's done has been quite as shameless or appalling asBeautiful Joe, a toxic piece of whimsy that ranks among the worst films of 2000".[55]
Following her September 2001 hospitalization for asubarachnoid hemorrhage, Stone took a hiatus from screen acting. She faced professional challenges as she was in the process of recovery. She felt that she had "lost [her] place" in Hollywood, and during a 2015 interview withUSA Today, she remarked: "[When] you find yourself at the back of the line in your business, as I did, [you] have to figure yourself out all over again."[56]She returned to the screen in 2003, when she took on a three-episode arc as Sheila Carlisle, an attorney who believes she can communicate with God, in the eighth season ofThe Practice. For her performance, she received thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.[57]

After years of litigation,Basic Instinct 2was released on March 31, 2006. A reason for a long delay in releasing the film was reportedly Stone's dispute with the filmmakers over the nudity in the film; she wanted more while they wanted less. Stone told an interviewer, "We are in a time of odd repression and if a popcorn movie allows us to create a platform for discussion, wouldn't that be great?".[67]Despite an estimated budget of US$70 million,Basic Instinct 2placed only tenth in gross on its opening weekend with a meager US$3.2 million and finished with a total domestic gross of under US$6 million.

The film was released onNetflix, to critical acclaim.Owen Gleibermandescribed her appearance as a "marketing hook" and further stated: "The presence of Sharon Stone embodies the spirit of [the Hollywood] machine.

And I had been this, you know, concerned about, oh how should we deal with theOlympicsbecause they are not being nice to theDalai Lama, who is a good friend of mine.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
