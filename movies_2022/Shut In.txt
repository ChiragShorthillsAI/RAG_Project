The Daily Wirehosted a special viewing for the film (an original first), at 9 pm E.T. on February 10, 2022, on the company's YouTube channel.[2][3]The film received mixed reviews from critics.
Young mother of two Jessica Nash is in the midst of fixing up the closet of her late grandmother's house (that she inherited) so that she can sell it and move. However, she accidentally gets stuck. She tries to get her young daughter Lainey to help her get out, but Lainey is unable to bring her the key. Jessica's ex-boyfriend Rob shows up with his friend Sammy, and Rob gets her out. However, Jessica is furious with Rob for bringing Sammy, apedophile, to her house. Sammy manipulates Rob into getting him to put Jessica back into the closet before they leave. However, Sammy later breaks in.
Jessica manages to trick Sammy into reaching under the closet door, where she nails his hand to the ground with a screwdriver that Lainey brought her earlier, trapping Sammy next to her. She yells for Lainey to stay upstairs with her baby brother Mason, but Lainey comes downstairs. Sammy grabs Lainey and threatens to assault her if Jessica doesn't free him, but Jessica sets his hand on fire. This makes Sammy let Lainey go without hurting her. Although Jessica is forced to put out the fire so she doesn't suffocate herself, Sammy's hand is severely burned and mutilated, and it appears as though Sammy is dead.
Jessica removes the screwdriver so she can escape by crawling through the ceiling onto the second storey. She brings Lainey and Mason to the car, but it starts to rain heavily, so Jessica lets her kids go back inside while she gets the door open. However, Sammy is still alive and he grabs the kids. Jessica runs back inside, but Sammy has a knife to Mason's throat.
Rob arrives with a gun and shoots Sammy in the head, and he and Jessica try to reconcile. However, Jessica realizes that Rob will always put his drugs before her and their children, so she slips him three grams ofcrystal meth. Rob attempts to persuade Jessica to relapse along with him, prompting her to attack him. As Rob is about to inject Jessica, he overdoses, and she pushes him out a window to his death.
Some time later, Jessica and her kids are shown in the house, now cleaned up, making and selling her ownapple butter(inspired by her mother's recipe) and mostly happy.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 55% of 11 critics' reviews are positive.[5]
Conservative reviewer Christian Toto gave the film a score of three out of four, saying: "Shut Inlacks the visceral thrills of some invasion films, but it more than compensates with a heart-tugging redemption arc and the return of an electric star."[6]Randy Myers ofThe Mercury Newsgave the film a score of 2.5 out of four, saying that it "doesn't redefine the genre by any means but it's a polished exercise in confined terror with a very nasty bite to it."[7]Alan Ng ofFilm Threatwrote: "D. J. Caruso masterfully orchestrates this symphony of suspense, albeit a twenty-piece symphony, but a symphony nonetheless."[8]
John Semley ofThe New Republicwas more critical, calling the film "dull" and writing: "for all its desperate edginess—drugs, guns, the implicit threat of a child being assaulted, the casting of Vincent Gallo, etc.—it plays like a moralizing Sunday school sermon."[9]Cath Clarke ofThe Guardiangave it two out of five stars, calling it "a film with some excruciatingly wooden acting – though not by Gallo, whose presence makes every scene he's in about seven times more interesting."[10]

I was raised with that."[10]Growing up, Gallo says that his father was abusive and beat him on several occasions, including one instance where Gallo's father broke his nose. He has said that while growing up, his father was "this kind of dark, raging figurehead...That's not who he is today, but when I was a child there wasn't a day...when he didn't hit me, punish me, yell at me or tell me something I did wrong."[7]Gallo's mother also forbade him from decorating his own room, which he shared with his siblings and grandfather,[11]and from owning a guitar, leading Gallo to secretly hide the latter underneath his bed.

Gallo worked for the mafia for approximately one year, and desired to continue down a life of crime and become a powerful gangster. However, he was eventually convinced by a mafia member, who felt that Gallo was wasting his potential, to abandon it in favor of a legitimate career.[12]

During filming, Gallo had difficulties working with actressChristina Ricci, who starred in the film alongside him. According to Ricci, Gallo was a "crazy lunatic man" and did not get along with her on the set. Ricci also said that Gallo mocked her weight several years after the film released, and that she has no interest in ever seeing his other films.[19]Gallo disputes Ricci's account, and in 2018, wrote "I still smile when I see a picture of her and when she insults me in the press it reminds me that we are connected in some way, and for that I am grateful. Christina Ricci was my friend during the filming of Buffalo 66 and working with her made sense and felt natural....I insulted her jokingly one day to a friend and a sneaky gossip writer overheard me. Christina and I have not spoken since."[20]

In 2003, Gallo starred in and directed the filmThe Brown Bunny, which chronicles a motorcycle racer's cross-country road trip and co-starredChloë Sevigny. The film, which contained a scene of Sevigny performing unsimulatedoral sexupon Gallo, received an overwhelmingly negative critical response to its Cannes premiere and became a mediascandal, in part due to Gallo's use of a still image from a sex scene on a promotional billboard. In part, the critical response discussed whether Sevigny had been pressured into performing a sex act by Gallo. Andrea LeVasseur ofAllmoviesaid thatThe Brown Bunny"premiered to much derision at the2003 Cannes Film Festival."[18]Film criticRoger Ebertstated thatThe Brown Bunnywas the worst film in the history of Cannes.[22]Gallo retorted by calling Ebert a "fat pig with the physique of a slave trader" and put ahexon Ebert, wishing himcolon cancer.[22]Ebert then responded – adapting a statement made byWinston Churchill– that, "although I am fat, one day I will be thin, but Mr. Gallo will still have been the director ofThe Brown Bunny."[23]In 2003, several media sources later reported that Gallo apologized to Ebert, but Gallo disputed this, saying "I never apologized for anything in my life...The only thing I am sorry about is putting a curse on Roger Ebert's colon. If a fat pig like Roger Ebert doesn't like my movie then I'm sorry for him."[24]
In 2004, Gallo and Ebert appeared to have reconciled, and Ebert ended up giving a thumbs up to a re-edited version ofThe Brown Bunny.[25]However, in a 2018 article, written after Ebert's death, Gallo accused Ebert's review of the re-edited version as being "far fetched and an outright lie."[20]

Gallo has stated that he has no plans to ever distribute the film and allow it to be seen again, as "I do not want my new works to be generated in a market or audience of any kind." He also added that allowing the film only ever being shown at two screenings was part of a deal he made withDelfine Bafort, who starred in the film.[30]Gallo explained in a 2011 interview that the film would be "allowed to rest in peace, and stored without being exposed to the dark energies from the public."[31]As of 2024,Promises Written in Wateris not available to watch, and has not been screened since 2010.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
