Kath and her slacker boyfriend Max travel several hours to a woodland cabin which Max has rented for the weekend. When they arrive, late at night, they find a car there and a man named Al standing outside claiming that he has already rented the cabin. Just as Max and Kath are about to leave, Al's girlfriend Greta emerges and suggests that the two should stay.
Kath and Max agree to play a romance themed board game to get to know the stand-offish Al and the lively, but abrasive, Greta. Kath tells them how she met Max when he was a student of hers.  Tired, Kath goes to bed early while the other three stay up.
The next morning, Kath awakens to find everyone gone.  Venturing into the surrounding woods, she finds Al, crying.  He explains that he found Greta and Max having sex and that the two left together. Angered, Kath returns to the city.
Despite being urged by her friends to move on, Kath decides to try and find Greta and learn what happened.  She locates contact info for the cabin owner and arranges a meeting on a pretext. Kath finds the owner, Nicholas Barlow, to be friendly and charming.
Nicholas helps Kath track Greta to an underground rave.  They split up to search for her and Kath encounters Greta, who apologises for stealing Max but says that she loves him. Kath and Nicholas become closer as they commiserate over their shared losses.  He explains that he was once a scientist at a biotech startup, but that he gave that life up when his father died of a hereditary disease.  Nicholas says that he has the same disease and is using experimental treatments on himself.
Flashbacks reveal Max leaving a party after an argument with Kath.  He runs into Al and Greta at a liquor store and goes drinking with them.  After asking him some odd questions they invite him to come to a party at the cabin. Greta and Al had sedated Max and kept him hidden until she left. Nicholas, who turns out to be Al's father, arrives at the cabin and discovers what they have done.  Al explains that they want Max to be a test subject for Nicholas' treatments.
In the present Kath visits Nicholas at his cabin.  When he leaves to get some wood for a fire she discovers a picture of him with Al.  In the woods she discovers Max, locked in a shipping container with medical equipment attached.  Nicholas, Al and Greta arrive.  Nicholas tries to convince Kath that what he's doing is okay.  Greta reveals that Nicholas isn't really sick, but is instead using Max as part of a treatment to keep himself youthful.  Kath asks Nicholas to use Greta to give her the same treatment. As Nicholas and Al subdue Greta, Kath frees Max, but a delusional Max pulls out his IV, causing himself to bleed to death. Kath locks Nicholas, Al and Greta in the shipping container and wanders back into the cabin.

Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film a score of 2.5/4, writing: "the twist here is so creatively perverted and strange and bizarre thatDavid Cronenbergmight approve. Alas, there's just not enough gristle and gore on the bone of this story to make for a memorably haunting viewer experience." He concluded: "Despite the star performance by Winona Ryder and an intriguing setup, 'Gone in the Night' is destined to fade quickly from our memories."[10]Dennis Harvey ofVarietywrote: "What at first looks like a standard missing-person suspense tale turns out to have a more complicated agenda — but it is so haphazardly advanced and clumsily articulated, the film itself seems to be fumbling around for a cohering structure or mood."[11]Jon Frosch ofThe Hollywood Reportercalled the film "depressingly slack and indecisive, neither leaning hard enough into its B-movie preposterousness nor taking the time to build any real, sustained suspense."[12]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
