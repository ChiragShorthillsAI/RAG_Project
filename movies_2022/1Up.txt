Rose credits her 2014short filmBreak Free, which she produced herself, for the success of her acting career. In an interview withVariety, she described how she was not able to get a manager, agent, or audition; so she decided to create short films "as a way of being able to give myself something to do and to study my craft." The film wentviral, getting millions of views in a short period of time.[21]
In 2015, Rose joined theOrange Is the New Blackcast inseason 3.

Some online commentators criticised Rose for not being Jewish, while the main focus of the scrutiny was the assertion that the fact she identifies asgenderfluidmade her "not gay enough" for the role.[31]Rose quitTwitterand deactivated public commenting on herInstagramaccount following the backlash.[31]Prior to leaving Twitter, she released a tweet responding to the negative reaction, stating, "Where on earth did 'Ruby is not a lesbian therefore she can't be batwoman' come from ‚Äî has to be the funniest most ridiculous thing I've ever read."[33]Rose called for unity between women and minorities, imploring women and theLGBT communityto be kinder and more supportive of each other.[31][33]
InEntertainment Weekly's 2019 LGBTQ special issue, Rose additionally discussed the backlash to her casting as the title character of the television seriesBatwoman.[34]She said the opportunity to audition forOrange is the New Blackcame about because the show wanted to have agender-neutralcharacter, but that she has also received criticism because of her genderfluid identity, adding, "when I got cast as a lesbian inBatwoman, I didn't know that being a gender-fluid woman meant that I couldn't be a lesbian because I'm not a woman - not considered lesbian enough." She said that while her initial response was dismissive, she later considered if there was a way to remedy the situation so that others would not be offended by her identity, and pondered making up a term that does not offend people and would indicate that she is "fluid in (her) gender, but also a lesbian."[34]
On 19 May 2020, Rose departedBatwomanafter the first season, and initially gave no definitive reason behind her departure.[35]Her character was subsequently written out of the series and replaced with a new one namedRyan Wilder, portrayed byJavicia Leslie.[36]Rose later said she suffered an injury during the production of the first season.[37]In August 2020, she called being the lead of a series "taxing" and stated her back surgery following the injury was a contributing factor in deciding to leave.[38]In a March 2021 interview with ComicBookMovie.com, when asked if she would reprise Kate at some point, Rose said, "I would totally do it. I don't think it would serve the story because I think building the new Batwoman is more important than going back too far into Kate Kane, but of course I would." She added, "I've watched a couple of episodes, and I think how they're handling it is beautiful. I think it's [Ryan Wilder's] time to shine."[39]Later that same month, English actressWallis Daywas cast as Kate Kane, as the show's story involved Kate receiving surgical alteration to her face after an airplane crash left her injured.[40]Rose, commenting on an Instagram tribute to her time in the role, said she was "stoked" about Day's casting.[41]
In July 2021, Rose said she was allergic to latex, which was another reason for leavingBatwomanas her character's mask was made of latex.[42]A few months later, in October, she began to publish allegations of an abusive and dangerous working environment on theBatwomanset, namingWarner Bros.executivePeter Roth, costarsDougray Scottand Camrus Johnson, and others on the production as responsible parties.[43][44][45]However, in response, Johnson confirmed that Rose had in fact beenfiredfromBatwoman(not quitting as she previously claimed),[46]with Warner Bros. then releasing a statement responding to the accusations, saying that "Warner Bros Television had decided not to exercise its option to engage Ruby for season two" after "multiple complaints about her workplace behaviour".[47]

Rose has said that she was convinced she was a boy while growing up, and that she was saving up money to physicallytransitionfrom female to male.[58][61]She said, "It was in my mind as something I wanted to do and then I just... didn't. I guess I grew out of it. I even used to sleep on my front because I didn't want to get boobs ever, which I think worked actually."[61]She later said she is glad she did not undergogender-affirming surgerybecause she wants to have children one day.[56]She has said that modelling led her to discoverandrogynyand allowed her to model with differentgender expressions: "I remember being at ayum charestaurant with my dad and the owner coming up and saying, 'Excuse me, we're trying to work out if you're a handsome boy or a beautiful girl.' It was a compliment and I was shocked, and when I thought about it I actually wanted to be a handsome boy."[62]
Rose said in 2015, "I am verygenderfluidand feel more like I wake up every day sort ofgender neutral."[63][64]This announcement came approximately a week after she releasedBreak Free, in which she visually transforms from a feminine-presenting woman to a heavilytattooedmasculine-presenting person. She stated that she prefers to continue using feminine pronouns,[65]but also usesthey/thempronouns.[66]She said that if she had to choose a sex, she would choose to be male, but she does not feel like she should have been born with different body parts. Seeing the desire hertransgenderfriends had for transitioning, she asked herself if her need to transition matched theirs, and concluded that it did not: "I think at this stage I will stay a woman but ... who knows. I'm so comfortable right now I feel wonderful about it, but I also fluctuate a lot."[58]

Emma Teitel ofMaclean'sstated, "Rose ... resembles an androgynous Angelina Jolie; she is a rare combination of angular and soft. She is a badass with a permanently arched brow and a Justin Bieber haircut. In other words, she is the lesbianJames Dean. And straight women are falling madly in love with her."[78]Alex Rees ofCosmopolitansaid that everyone was enamored of Rose at the time of her season three appearance onOrange Is the New Black.[81][78]
Rose acknowledged the public discourse concerning her physical appearance and subsequent debate onsexual fluidityafter heterosexual women said they would "go gay" for her,[78]commenting that while she thought it was brilliant and was neutral on the matter, some found the public affection toward her inappropriate because they believe it implied people can choose to be gay. Rose said she believes people are being complimentary when making such comments rather than trying to be derogatory or diminish the coming out process. She said today's society is more open about sexuality than in the past and that people should not nitpick who can or cannot identify as genderqueer, gender-neutral, bisexual or trans, or tell them how to live their lives, and that this is a message the LGBT community should be supporting.[81]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full¬†list...)
Am√©lie of Leuchtenberg(1812‚Äì1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro¬†I. She was the fourth child ofEug√®ne de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Am√©lie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Am√©liawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Am√©lie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Am√©lie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich D√ºrck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
