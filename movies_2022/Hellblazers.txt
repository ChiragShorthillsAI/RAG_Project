Barbeau was born on June 11, 1945, inSacramento, California,[2][3]the daughter of Armene (née Nalbandian) and Joseph Barbeau, who was a public relations executive forMobil Oil.[4]Her mother was ofArmeniandescent and her father's ancestry was French Canadian, Irish, and German.[5][6]She has a sister, Jocelyn, and a half brother on her father's side, Robert Barbeau, who still resides in the Sacramento area.[7]She attendedDel Mar High SchoolinSan Jose, California. After graduating in 1963,[8]she enrolled atFoothill CollegeinLos Altos Hills, California, but dropped out at age 19 to participate in a USO Tour with the San Jose Light Opera.[9]In her autobiography, Barbeau says that she first caught the show business bug while entertaining troops at army bases throughout Southeast Asia, touring with theSan Jose Civic Light Opera.[10]
In the late 1960s, Barbeau moved to New York City and worked "for the mob"[11]as ago-go dancer. She made her Broadway debut in the chorus ofFiddler on the Roofand later took the role of Hodel, Tevye's daughter;Bette Midlerplayed her character's sister Tzeitel. She leftFiddlerin 1971 to play the leading role of Cookie Kovac in the off-Broadway nudie musicalStag Movie. Barbeau, as Cookie Kovac, andBrad Sullivan, as Rip Cord, were "quite jolly and deserve to be congratulated on the lack of embarrassment they show when, on occasion, they have to wander around stark naked. They may not be sexy but they certainly keep cheerful," wroteThe New York Timestheater criticClive Barnesin an otherwise negative review.[12]Barbeau went on to star in more than 25 musicals and plays, includingWomen Behind Bars,The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, andGrease. She received aTheater World Awardand a 1972Tony Awardnomination for her portrayal of tough-girl Rizzo inGrease.[13]
During the 1970s, Barbeau starred as Carol Traynor, the daughter ofBea Arthur'stitle character, on the comedy seriesMaude, which ran from 1972 to 1978 (actressMarcia Roddhad originated the role of Carol in a 1972 episode ofAll in the Family, also titled "Maude," alongside Arthur).[14]In her autobiography,There Are Worse Things I Could Do, Barbeau remarked: "What I didn't know is that when I said [my lines] I was usually walking down a flight of stairs and no one was even listening to me. They were just watching my breasts precede me." During the last season ofMaude, Barbeau did not appear in the majority of the episodes. In a 2009Entertainment TonightTV interview, Barbeau mentioned that she had good on- and off-camera chemistry with Arthur; she said that the two stayed close until Arthur's death on April 25, 2009.[15]Barbeau and Arthur reunited on camera during a 2007 taping ofThe View, reminiscing about their long-running friendship and their years as co-stars onMaude.[16]About her relationship with Arthur, Barbeau said in a 2018 interview withDread Central:
"I was doing an interview for this one-woman show that I am doing and the interviewer asked, 'What do people usually ask you,' and I said, 'They always want to know what it was like working with Bea.' She was fantastic and, you know, I realized years later how much I took it for granted because it was my first experience on television. I just assumed that everyone was as giving as she was, as professional as she was, that everyone who was doing a TV show showed up knowing their lines and showed up on time and was willing to say to the writers, 'I think this line was funnier if Adie had said it or Conrad had said it or Bill had said it.' I mean, she was just the best, she was the best, very funny. She was not Maude when she wasn't saying those lines. I don't know if I'd say she was quiet. She was a homebody. She had her sons, her dog and her cooking and she wasn't into the celebrity scene and she was a great lady. I loved her dearly and we had a great cast and they were my family for six years. I loved each of them and all of them and it was the best experience anyone could've had, being introduced to television like that!"[17]
Barbeau was cast in numerous television films and series such asThe Love Boat,Fantasy Island,Valentine Magic on Love Island, andBattle of the Network Stars. In her autobiography, she claimed: "I actually thoughtCBSasked me to be onBattle of the Network Starsbecause they thought I was athletic. My husband clued me in: who cared if I won the race, as long as I bounced when I ran?"[18]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
