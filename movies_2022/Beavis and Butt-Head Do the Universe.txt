Believing they areat-risk youth, a judge sends them tospace campat theJohnson Space Center, where they become engrossed in adockingsimulator. Impressed, theNASAastronautCaptain Serena Ryan invites them to train as astronauts, which they mistake as an offer forsex. They undergo training and board theSpace ShuttleEndeavourto study amicro black hole.
In space, Beavis and Butt-Head create a catastrophe. When Serena volunteers to sacrifice herself, they mistake this for another offer of sex. They put on their spacesuits, and watch Serena through a window as she prepares to change. Enraged, Serena uses the shuttle controls to fling them into space, where they are sucked into the black hole.
The boys emerge inGalvestonin 2022.The Pentagondetects their arrival and begins tracking them; Serena, now governor of Texas, vows to kill them to cover up her attempted murder. The boys meet intelligent versions of themselves from another universe, Smart Beavis and Smart Butt-Head, who explain that they have two days to enter a portal on top ofMount Everestto prevent the destruction of themultiverse.
Beavis and Butt-Head acquire aniPhoneand accidentally activateSiri, which they mistake for Serena; Beavis develops feelings for her. When Siri offers to set up theirsmart home, they believe Serena is waiting for them in Highland. After Beavis becomes trapped in aport-a-potty, he and Butt-Head are transported to a university. Smart Beavis and Smart Butt-Head urge them to enter the portal, which they have moved nearby, but instead they wander into agender studiesclass, where the professor lectures them onwhite privilege. Taking this to mean they have the right to do whatever they want, they steal a police car and are arrested.

All parties arrive at Beavis and Butt-Head's house. As Serena is about to shoot them, she realizes they are not her enemies, only foolish teenagers. Smart Beavis and Smart Butt-Head urge Beavis and Butt-Head to enter the portal, but Hartson is accidentally sucked in instead, closing the rift and saving the multiverse. Smart Beavis and smart Butthead acknowledge that possibly anything could have worked and they were making it more complicated by saying only Beavis and Butt-head could stop the portal, and acknowledge that while they are the smartest versions they are still not too smart. As Beavis attempts to express his love to Serena, Smart Beavis interrupts and offers to show her the cosmos; she leaves with him and Smart Butt-Head.In exchange for their silence, the government gives Beavis and Butt-Head their home back in its original condition. In another universe, the assembled alternative Beavises and Butt-Heads applaud Smart Beavis for becoming the first Beavis to have sex, although Serena does not return his calls.
Daria Morgendorffer, Principal McVicker, Tom Anderson, Stewart Stevenson, Mrs Stevenson, Coach Buzzcut and Todd Ianuzzi makecameo appearances, most of them silent.
In 2008,Mike Judgestated, "I like to keep the door open onBeavis and Butt-Head, because it's my favorite thing that I've ever done. It's the thing I'm most proud of." However, he stated his reservations regarding the "year and a half [to] two and a half years" that it would take "to do that right," saying that a revival project "comes up every three years." In 2009, while promoting his filmExtract, Judge said he would like to see the characters on the big screen again, and that "I kind of think of them as being either 15 or in their 60s.... I wouldn't mind doing something with them as these two dirty old men sitting on the couch."[1]
In March 2018, Judge toldRotten Tomatoesthat the idea of doing a secondBeavis and Butt-Headmovie had been brought up two months prior, saying "It's just a matter of coming up with an idea that feels like it's worth doing."[2]In July 2019, Judge again reiterated interest in a potential movie, stating, "I've got some ideas. I think it would have to be something that makes it relevant today. I think I might've figured out a way to do that." He further stated that he would probably direct it.[3][4]
In February 2021, it was announced that a newBeavis and Butt-Headmovie was in production forParamount+, with Judge on board. The news came following the announcement of a revival series the year prior, which was originally set to air onComedy Central.[5]Originally, Paramount executives wanted a live-actionBeavis and Butt-Headmovie, with Judge holding auditions over Zoom for the project before eventually talking the company into doing an animated movie instead to reestablish the characters first, with a live-action movie still a possibility.[6]In January 2022, Judge tweeted drawings of older versions ofBeavisandButt-Head.[7]A month later, the film's title was revealed asBeavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe.[8]John Frizzell, who composedDo America, returned to compose the score.[9]The entire production was conducted remotely viaZoomconferencing due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[10]

Judge was born inGuayaquil,Ecuador, and raised inAlbuquerque, New Mexico. He graduated from theUniversity of California, San Diego,[2]where he studied physics.[2]After losing interest in a career in science, Judge focused on animation and short films. His animated shortFrog Baseballwas developed into the successfulMTVseriesBeavis and Butt-Head, and the spin-off seriesDaria(with which Judge had no involvement).
In 1995, Judge and formerSimpsonswriterGreg DanielsdevelopedKing of the Hill, which debuted onFoxin 1997 and quickly became popular with both critics and audiences. Running for 13 seasons, it became one of thelongest-running American animated series. During the run of the show, Judge took time off to write and directOffice Space,IdiocracyandExtract. AsKing of the Hillwas coming to an end, Judge created his third show,ABC'sThe Goode Family, which received mixed reviews and was cancelled after 13 episodes. After a four-year hiatus, he created his fourth show, the live-actionSilicon ValleyforHBO, which has received critical acclaim.[3]In 2017, Judge's fourth animated series, the music-themedTales from the Tour Bus, premiered onCinemax, to acclaim.
Judge has won aPrimetime Emmy Awardand twoAnnie AwardsforKing of the Hilland twoCritics' Choice Television AwardsandSatellite AwardsforSilicon Valley.
Michael Craig Judge[4]was born on October 17, 1962, inGuayaquil,Ecuador.[4][5]He is the middle of three children born to Margaret Yvonne (néeBlue), a librarian, and William James Judge, an archaeologist. At the time of his birth, his father was working for a nonprofit organization in Guayaquil and other parts of Ecuador, promoting agricultural development. Judge was raised from age three inAlbuquerque, New Mexico, where he spent a small portion of his life working on a chicken farm. He attendedSt. Pius X High School[6]and graduated with aBachelor of Sciencein physics from theUniversity of California, San Diego, (UCSD) in 1985.[7]
After graduating fromUCSDin 1985, he held several brief jobs inphysicsandmechanical engineering, but found himself growing bored with science.[2]In 1987, he moved toSilicon Valleyto joinParallax Graphics,[8]astartupvideo cardcompany with about 40 employees based inSanta Clara, California. Disliking the company's culture and his colleagues, Judge quit after less than three months, describing it as, "The people I met were likeStepford Wives. They were true believers in something, and I don't know what it was". Shortly after quitting his job, he became abass playerwith a touringbluesband.[9]He was a part ofAnson Funderburgh's band for two years, playing on their 1990Black Top RecordsreleaseRack 'Em Up,[10]while taking graduate math classes at theUniversity of Texas at Dallas.[9]He was planning to earn amaster's degreeas "a back-up plan" to become a community college math teacher after relocating to the north Dallas area for his then-wife's new job.[11][12][13]In 1989, after seeing animation cels on display in a movie theater, Judge purchased aBolex16 mm filmcamera and began creating his own animated shorts in his home inRichardson, Texas. In 1991, his short filmOffice Space(also known as theMiltonseries of shorts) was acquired byComedy Central, following ananimation festivalin Dallas. Shortly thereafter, he dropped out of school to focus on his career.[9]In the early 1990s, he was playing blues bass withDoyle Bramhall.[14]
In 1992, he developedFrog Baseball,[9]a short film featuring the charactersBeavisandButt-Head, which was to be featured onLiquid Television, a 1990s animation showcase that appeared onMTV. The short led to the creation of theBeavis and Butt-Headseries on MTV, in which Judge voiced both title characters as well as the majority of supporting characters and wrote and directed the majority of the episodes. The show centers on two socially incompetent,heavy metal-loving teenage wannabe delinquents,BeavisandButt-Head, who live in the fictional town of Highland, Texas. The two have no adult supervision, are dim-witted, sex-obsessed, uneducated, barely literate, and lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. Over its run,Beavis and Butt-Headdrew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society.[15]
Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two –Blood Drive/Give BloodandDoor to Door– which he described as "awful, I don't know why anybody liked it ... I was burying my head in the sand."[16]The series spawned the musical singleI Got You Babe(1993) (a humorous cover with participation byCher), a feature-length filmBeavis and Butt-Head Do America(1996) and the spin-off showDaria.[17][18]
After a hiatus of two decades, the series aired a new season on October 27, 2011.[19]The premiere episode was a ratings hit, with an audience of 3.3 million total viewers.[20]On January 10, 2014, Judge said that there is still a possibility thatBeavis and Butt-Headcould be pitched to another network, adding that he wouldn't mind making more episodes.[21]
In early 1995, after the successful first run ofBeavis and Butt-Head, Judge decided to create another animated series,King of the Hill.[22][23]Judge conceived the idea for the show, drew the main characters, and wrote a pilot script.Foxwas uncertain of the viability of Judge's concept for an animated comedy based in reality and set in the American South, so the network teamed him up withThe SimpsonswriterGreg Daniels.[24][22]Judge was a former resident ofGarland, Texas, upon which the fictional community of Arlen was loosely based, but as Judge stated in a later interview, the show was based more specifically on the Dallas suburb ofRichardson.[22][25]Judge voiced charactersHank HillandJeff Boomhauer. The show is about a middle-class Methodist family named the Hills living in a small town called Arlen, Texas. It attempts to retain a naturalistic approach, seeking humor in the conventional and mundane aspects of everyday life while dealing with issues comically. After its debut in 1997, the series became a large success for Fox and was named one of the best television series of the year by various publications, includingEntertainment Weekly,Time, andTV Guide.[26]
For the 1997–1998 season, the series became one of Fox's highest-rated programs and even briefly outperformedThe Simpsonsin ratings.[27]Although ratings remained consistent throughout the 10th, 11th and 12th seasons and had begun to rise in the overallNielsen ratings(up to the 105th most watched series on television, from 118 in season 8), Fox abruptly announced in 2008 thatKing of the Hillhad been cancelled. The cancellation coincided with the announcement thatSeth MacFarlane, creator ofFamily GuyandAmerican Dad!, would be creating aFamily Guyspin-off calledThe Cleveland Show, which would take overKing of the Hill'stime slot.[28]Hopes to keep the show afloat surfaced as sources indicated thatABC(which was already airing Judge's new animated comedy,The Goode Family) was interested in securing the rights to the show,[29]but in January 2009, ABC president Steve McPherson said he had "no plans to pick up the animated comedy."[30]On April 30, 2009, it was announced that Fox ordered at least two more episodes to give the show a proper finale.[31]The show's 14th season was supposed to air sometime in the2009–10 season,[32]but Fox later announced that it would not air the episodes, opting instead for syndication.[33]On August 10, 2009, however, Fox released a statement that the network would air a one-hourseries finale(which consisted of a regular 30-minute episode followed by a 30-minute finale) on September 13, 2009.[34]The four remaining episodes of the series aired in syndication the week of May 3, 2010, and again onAdult Swimduring the week of May 17, 2010. During the panel discussion for the return ofBeavis and Butt-HeadatSan Diego Comic-Conin 2011, Mike Judge said that no current plans exist to reviveKing of the Hill, although he would not rule out the possibility of it returning.[35]
Judge began to develop one of his four animated short films titledMilton, about an office drone named Milton that Judge created, which first aired onLiquid TelevisionandNight After Night with Allan Haveyand later aired onSaturday Night Live.[36]The inspiration came from a temp job he once had that involved alphabetizing purchase orders[37]and a job he had as an engineer for three months in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1980s, "just in the heart ofSilicon Valleyand in the middle of that overachieveryuppiething, it was just awful".[38]Judge sold the completed filmOffice Spaceto20th Century Foxbased on his script and a cast that includedJennifer Aniston,Ron Livingston, andDavid Herman.[36]Originally, the studio wanted to make a film out of the Milton character but Judge was not interested, opting instead to make more of anensemble cast–based film.[38]The studio suggested that he should make a film likeCar Washbut "just set in an office".[38]Judge made the relatively painless transition from animation to live-action with the help of the film's director of photography who taught him about lenses and where to put the camera. Judge says, "I had a great crew, and it's good going into it not pretending you're an expert."[37]Studio executives were not happy with the footage Judge was getting. He remembers them telling him, "More energy! More energy! We gotta reshoot it! You're failing! You're failing!"[39]In addition, Fox did not like thegangsta rapmusic used in the film until a focus group approved of it. Judge hated the ending and felt that a complete rewrite of the third act was necessary.[39]In the film, he made acameo appearanceas Stan (complete withhairpieceand fake mustache), the manager of Chotchkie's, a fictionalized parody ofchain restaurantslikeChili's,Applebee'sandTGI Friday's, and the boss ofJennifer Aniston's character, whom he continually undermines and interrogates over her lack of sufficient enthusiasm for the job and the insufficient quantity of "flair" (buttons, ribbons, etc.) she wears on her uniform. The film was released on February 19, 1999, and it was well received by critics. Although not particularly successful at the box office, it sold well onVHSand DVD, and it has come to be recognized as acult classic.[40]
Beginning in fall 2003, Judge and fellow animatorDon Hertzfeldtcreated an animation festival called "The Animation Show". "The Animation Show" toured the country annually for several years, screening animated shorts.[41]In 2005, Judge was presented with theAustin Film Festival's Outstanding Television Writer Award byJohnny Hardwick.[42]
Judge has made supporting and cameo appearances in numerous films. Judge had a voice cameo as Kenny inSouth Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut(1999), the feature-length film adaptation of the popularComedy Centralseries; he voicedKenny McCormickwhen he was unhooded towards the end of the film. He later acted in the science-fiction family comedy franchiseSpy Kids, where he played Donnagon Giggles in the first three films. His next film appearance wasServing Sara(2002) where he played a motel manager. He later appeared in the comedyJackass Number Two(2006), in which he can be seen during the closing credits. An extended version of his sequence can be seen inJackass 2.5(2007) which was adirect-to-videorelease. Judge also created a video clip of Beavis and Butt-Head ripping intoSteve-Ofor his videoPoke the Puss, where the two try imagining if they would like the video better if they were black. The clip aired as a part ofJackassworld.com: 24-Hour Takeover, a February 23, 2008, television special on MTV to coincide with the official launch of jackassworld.com. The characters appeared again in the third Jackass film, titledJackass 3D, at the beginning of the film, telling viewers to put on their 3D glasses for the film.[43]
Judge's third film,Idiocracy, adystopiancomedy starringLuke WilsonandMaya Rudolph, was given alimited releasetheatrically by20th Century Foxin September 2006, two years after production. The film's original release date was intended to be on August 5, 2005, according to Mike Judge.[44]In April 2006, a release date was set for September 1, 2006. The film was released without atraileror substantial marketing campaign.[45]The film was not screened for critics beforehand as is usually done.[46]Lack of concrete information from Fox led to speculation that the distributor may have actively attempted to keep the film from being seen by a large audience, while fulfilling a contractual obligation for theatrical release ahead of a DVD release, according to Ryan Pearson of theAP.[47]That speculation was followed by open criticism of the studio's lack of support fromAin't It Cool News,Time, andEsquire.[48][49][50]Time's Joel Stein wrote "the film's ads and trailers tested atrociously", but "still, abandoningIdiocracyseems particularly unjust, since Judge has made a lot of money for Fox."[49]Despite the film not being screened for critics, the film received positive reviews and was a minor box-office success.[51]In the U.S., the film was released to DVD in January 2007 and later aired onpremium-television,multiplexchannelsCinemaxin September 2007 andHBOin January 2008. Since then, it has gained acult following.[52]
Judge's fourth directorial effort was 2009'sExtract. Shortly after completingOffice Space, Judge was already about 40 pages into his follow-up script, set in the world of an extract factory, when he was convinced by his representative team that he needed to shelve that and concentrate on something more commercial. Over the next several years, he focused his energy on developingIdiocracy. But years later, by the time of the film's release, audiences had decided thatOffice Spacehad struck a chord, so they were ready to see Judge return to on-the-job humor, and thus theExtractscript was given new life.[53]
Seeking to keepExtractbelow the radar of the studio system, Judge and his producers set up a production company, Ternion Productions, and arranged private financing while partnering with Miramax for domestic distribution of the film. Judge relied heavily on his own personal knowledge of the industrial world to bring the story to life. "I actually worked in a factory a little bit myself ... I hopefully write stuff that is recognizable as the archetypes of this world," Judge stated.[53]
Keeping true to this baseline of reality,Extractwas shot in a working factory, in this case a water bottling plant south of Los Angeles, in the City ofCommerce.[53]He makes an uncredited appearance as Jim, a union organizer.[54]The film premiered on September 4, 2009, and received mixed to positive reviews from critics and was a minor commercial success.[55]

WhileKing of the Hillis often a satire of protagonistHank Hill, identifiable as aconservative,[102]and hisThe Goode Familyis essentially a satire centered around aliberalfamily, Judge avoids discussing his own political leanings.[102]
In reviewingIdiocracy,Salonstated, "Judge'sgimlet eyeis so ruthless that at times his politics seem to border onSouth Parklibertarianism".[103]A writer for thelibertarianmagazineReasonseems to agree, comparingKing of the Hillto the anti-authoritarian point of view ofSouth ParkandThe Simpsons, though he calls the show morepopulist, noting the disdainKing of the Hillseems to have for bureaucrats, professionals, andbig-box chains.[104]
Still, Judge denies having political messages in his shows, saying in 2006 in anIGNinterview aboutKing of the Hill:[102]
I try to not let the show get too political. To me, it's more social than political I guess you'd say, because that's funnier. I don't really like political reference humor that much. Although I liked the episode 'Hank's Bully' where Hank's talking to the mailman and he says, 'Why would anyone want to lick a stamp that hasBill Clintonon it?' To me that's just like more of a character thing about Hank than it is a political joke or anything. I don't want to do a bunch of stuff aboutthe war, particularly.
In June 2016, before thepresidential electionin November,Etan CohentoldBuzzFeedthat he and Judge would produceIdiocracy-themedcampaign advertisementsmockingDonald Trump's presidential campaignif given permission from20th Century Foxto do so.[105]It was later reported byBusiness Insiderthat they would not have been campaign ads, would have mocked all of the candidates, and would not go forward.[106]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
