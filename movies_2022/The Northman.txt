In 895, KingAurvandill"War-Raven" returns to the island of Hrafnsey, reuniting with his wife, Queen Gudrún, and his heir, PrinceAmleth. To prepare Amleth for his eventual accession to the throne, the father and son participate in a ceremony overseen by Aurvandill'sjester, Heimir. Heimir tells Amleth that his destiny is fixed and cannot be escaped, and Amleth vows to avenge his father if Aurvandill is ever slain, rather than live his life in shame. The next morning, Amleth's bastard uncleFjölnirstages apalace coup, beheads Aurvandill, sacks thehillfortand carries away Gudrún. Amleth narrowly escapes Fjölnir's assassins and flees by boat, swearing vengeance.
Several years later, an adult Amleth is aulfhednar(berserker) within a band of Vikings. After attacking a village inGarðaríki, he encounters a Seeress in the temple ofSvetovit; the Seeress orders Amleth to remember his oath of vengeance and tells him that his fate is intertwined with that of a Maiden-King. Soon after, he learns that "Fjölnir the Brotherless" has lost his throne toHarald of Norwayand now lives as a sheep farmer in Iceland. Branding himself as athrall, a slave, Amleth sneaks aboard a ship taking them to Iceland. He encounters an enslavedSlavicwoman named Olga, who claims to be a sorceress. They are taken to Fjölnir's farm, where Amleth learns his mother married Fjölnir and bore him a son named Gunnar.
One night, Amleth follows avixenand encounters a he-witch, who facilitates a seance between Amleth and the skull of Heimir, whom Fjölnir has also murdered. Heimir tells Amleth about Draugr, a magical sword that can only be drawn at night or at the Gates ofHel. Amleth enters abarrowand obtains the blade from its owner, theundead Mound Dweller. He hides the sword upon his return to the farm. The next day, Amleth is selected to compete in a game ofknattleikragainst another farm. The game turns violent when the leader of the opposing team brutalizes the competition until only he and Amleth are left. Gunnar (looking up to Amleth, not knowing he is his half-brother), is almost killed in trying to draw away the opposing player; but Amleth saves him, furiously beating his opponent to death. As a reward, Fjölnir's adult son, Thorir, grants him overseer duties and allows him to choose a woman.
During the evening celebrations, Amleth and Olga make love; they promise to overcome Fjölnir together. Over several nights Amleth kills prominent members of Fjölnir's estate in unnatural ways, arranging their impaled body parts into the shape of a horse in a gruesome display. This makes Fjölnir and the entire estate believe they are under attack from an evil spirit. Olga mixes the food supply withfly agaric, a potenthallucinogen.Christianslaves are believed by Thorir to be responsible. This allows Amleth to enter Fjölnir's house. Amleth reveals his identity to Gudrún, who replies that she was Aurvandill's slave and that Amleth wasconceived by rape. Gudrún also reveals that she masterminded Fjölnir's coup because she wanted both Aurvandill and Amleth dead; she tries to seduce Amleth, who, after a moment, rejects her. Enraged, Amleth kills Thorir, and cuts out his heart.
Gudrún reveals Amleth's true identity to Fjölnir and calls for Amleth's death. Fjölnir decides to kill Olga, but Amleth offers to trade Olga's life for Thorir's heart. Amleth allows himself to be captured, and is tortured for the location of Thorir's heart. Amleth is released from his restraints by a flock of ravens sent byOdinand Olga rescues him. Amleth decides to abandon his quest for revenge, and the two decide to escape by boat to his kinsmen in theOrkney Islands. Aboard the vessel Amleth has a vision, and realizes that Olga is pregnant with twins, one of whom will be the Maiden-King prophesied by the Seeress. Realizing that Olga and their children will never be safe while Fjölnir lives, Amleth, despite Olga's pleas, jumps overboard and swims ashore reasoning that he cannot escape his fate.
Back at the farm, Amleth kills Fjölnir's remaining men and frees the slaves. While searching for Fjölnir, Amleth is attacked by Gudrún and Gunnar and kills them in self-defense after being wounded. Fjölnir, discovering his wife and son dead, coldly tells Amleth to meet him at the Gates of Hel: the crater of the volcanoHekla. Amleth and Fjölnir engage naked in a fierceHolmgang(duel) until Fjölnir is beheaded and Amleth is simultaneously stabbed. As he dies, Amleth has a vision of Olga embracing their two children, whom she tells him are safe, before urging him to let go. Avalkyriecarries Amleth through the gates ofValhöll.
Born to aSwedishfamily, Alexander Skarsgård had been fascinated withVikinghistory andmythologysince childhood, and had long sought a Viking-themed project with the help of producerLars Knudsen.[10]In 2011, Skarsgård was attached to aWarner Bros.epic with theworking titleThe Vanguard, which ultimately did not materialize.[11]Robert Eggers became interested in making a Viking film following a 2016 trip to Iceland with his wife Alexandra Shaker, who is a fan ofOld Norsesagas.[6]During the trip, Eggers metBjörk, who in turn introduced him toSjón.[12]In 2017, Skarsgård met Eggers to discuss future projects, and the discussion turned to aViking Age–themed film.[10][13][14]Eggers subsequently reached out to Sjón, and the two began researching and writing the screenplay.[12]
The story ofThe Northmanwas based primarily on the legend ofAmlethas written by Danish historianSaxo Grammaticus, known as the direct inspiration forWilliam Shakespeare'sHamlet.[15][16]Eggers cited thePoetic Edda, theProse Edda,Egil's Saga,Grettir's Saga, theEyrbyggja sagaand theSaga of Hrolfr Krakias additional influences.[15]ArchaeologistNeil PriceatUppsala University,folkloristTerry Gunnell at theUniversity of Icelandand Viking historian Jóhanna Katrín Friðriksdóttir served as historical consultants on the film.[17][6]Eggers also acknowledged 1982'sConan the Barbarianas a source of inspiration.[15]
In October 2019, it was announced that Eggers would direct an epic Viking revenge saga, which he would also co-write with Sjón. Skarsgård,Nicole Kidman,Anya Taylor-Joy,Bill Skarsgård(Alexander's brother) andWillem Dafoewere in talks to join the film.[18]They would all be confirmed in December, along with the addition ofClaes Bangto the cast.[19]The film was officially in preparation in December 2019, and would begin filming inBelfastin 2020.[20][21]In August 2020, Björk, along with her daughter Ísadóra "Doa" Barney,[22]Kate DickieandEthan Hawkejoined the cast of the film.[23][24][25]In September 2020, Bill Skarsgård announced he had dropped out of the film due to scheduling conflicts and was replaced withGustav Lindh.[26]

The scenes in the Land of the Rus were filmed atPortglenone, theClandeboye Estate,Shane's Castleand on theRiver Bann. The Hightown quarry outside Belfast stood for the volcano Hekla, where the film's climactic fight takes place.[31]Brief sequences were filmed in Iceland at the Svínafellsjökull glacier and the town ofAkureyri.[32]
The film, originally planned to cost around $65 million, ended up costing between $70–90 million to produce. Eggers found the editing process to be the most difficult of his career. Feedback fromtest screeningsindicated that the film's first act was too slow. More feedback showed that audiences found the Old Norse dialogue difficult to understand, which resulted in most of it being replaced inADRsessions. The final cut was eventually approved on November 3, 2021.[5][6]
For the film's score, Eggers brought formerTri Anglerecord label artists,Robin CarolanandVessel(Sebastian Gainsborough), for composition and production. They researched extensively on the history of Viking music, including discussions with ethnographer Poul Høxbro,[33]and used instruments based onNordic folk music, such astagelharpa,langspil, kravik lyre, andsäckpipa. They further experimented with the instruments they had, to create that ethnic Nordic sound,[34]which includes the 40-member string ensemble mimicking the sound of an archaic instrument calledbullroarer.[35]
The score album was released byBack Lot Musicon April 15, 2022, and featured 43 tracks.[36]On July 1,Sacred Bones Recordsreleased the album in CD, vinyl and cassettes.[37][38]
The film's advertising campaign briefly attracted notoriety due to a series of posters commissioned for theNew York subway systemthat neglected to include the film's title.[39]Within a day of the subject goingviralonTwitter, the posters were removed.[40]The film's advertising campaign additionally sponsored an episode of theweb seriesDeath Battle, with the midway segment of the episode featuring its characters interacting with the film and one of its axes.[41]
A 160-page book written by Simon Abrams and Eggers about the film's production and research, titledThe Northman: A Call to the Gods, was originally scheduled to be released on September 6, 2022, but was later pushed back to November 8.[42][43]

Eggers commented on the film's underwhelming box office, stating that "[The film] met the expectations of a bad marketplace ... Am I disappointed that, three to four weeks in, we're on VOD because that's the way things are done in the post-COVID world? Yeah. But it's doing great on VOD, so there you go."[70]In its debut weekend onPVODin the U.S., the film was the top-rented title oniTunes, third onVuduand fourth onGoogle Play, making about the same amount of revenue asThe Bad GuysandThe Lost City, despite grossing much less than both in theaters.IndieWirewrote that "The Northmanlooks like the type of film that, even with lower theatrical returns, is greatly elevated by that exposure."[71]The following week, it finished third on the iTunes and Vudu charts, and fifth on Google Play.[72]
In its debut week on theDVD/Blu-raymarket, the film debuted at the No. 1 spot on both the NPD VideoScan First Alert chart (which tracks combined DVD and Blu-ray disc unit sales) and the Blu-ray disc sales chart for the week ending June 11, 2022.[73][74]
On September 28, 2023,Deadline Hollywoodreported the film "approached breakeven thanks to overindexing on Premium VOD".[75]Focus Features' president of production and acquisitions, Kiska Higgs, also stated that the film was "OK for us in the end", though she noted that costs were shared by New Regency, and Focus Features' wasn't "front and center on production of [the film]".[7]
Thereview aggregatorRotten Tomatoesreported that 90% of 372 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "A bloody revenge epic and breathtaking visual marvel,The Northmanfinds filmmaker Robert Eggers expanding his scope without sacrificing any of his signature style."[76]Metacriticassigned the film aweighted average scoreof 82 out of 100 based on sixty critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[77]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakgave it a 75% positive score (with an average 3.5 out of five stars), with 56% saying they would definitely recommend it.[57]
MovieZine's Alexander Kardelo gave the film a four out of five score and particularly praised Skarsgård's performance and Eggers' direction.[78]The Guardian'sPeter Bradshawgave a five out of five score, praising the film's nihilistic tone and performances by the cast, stating, "It's entirely outrageous, with some epic visions of the flaring cosmos. I couldn't look away."[79]Digital Spy's Gabriella Geisinger also gave a five out of five score, praising Eggers's visionary direction and the film's grisly and surreal atmosphere and claiming, "The world created inThe Northmanis so totally absorbing".[80]IndieWire's David Ehrlich called the film "primal, sinewy, gnarly-as-fuck," "grab-you-by-the-throat intense" and "never dull."[81]Total Film's Matt Maytum commented that the film is a "truly distinctive, unmissable epic" in his review, ultimately giving it a five out of five stars.[82]The Independent's Clarrise Loughrey gave it five out of five stars, and stated in her review that the film was a "beautiful risk".[83]RogerEbert.com's Robert Daniels gave it three out of four, and praised the direction, cinematography and cast performances, but found that the film "often stumbles when it searches for profundity."[84]
The Austin Chronicle's Richard Whittaker called the film an "extraordinary feat of cinema," commending the direction.[85]The New York Times'sA.O. Scottpraised the world-building and cinematography, writing, "Eggers's accomplishment lies in his fastidious, fanatical rendering of that world, down to its bed linens and cooking utensils."[86]The New Yorker'sRichard Brodyfound that the film "offers nosynesthesia, no evocation of any sense beside vision" and criticized Eggers's direction, ultimately concluding, "The Northmanmerely serves up its raw material both half-baked and overcooked."[87]Rolling Stone's K. Austin Collins wrote that "It's an oft-stunning visual feast," but added, "It is also an instructive example of how the most visionary intentions can't always enliven an otherwise rote story."[88]Christopher Howse inThe Spectatorcommends the "great store" Eggers sets "by material authenticity". Howse was less fond of the persistent "slittings, maimings and disembowellings". "Violence in the foreground is like flak concealing what lies behind; perhaps it should have been even longer with less action", is his overall critical assessment.[89]
In December 2024,Colliderranked the film at number 7 on its list of the "10 Best Fantasy Movies of the 2020s," with Robert Lee III writing that it is "a perfect example of how fantasy movies do not always have to be colorful and family-friendly in their execution, being a brutal and striking R-rated fantasy film filled with violence and bloodshed at every corner. Its violence serves a greater purpose than simply being eye-candy, however, as it helps create a sense of realism for this folk tale adventure, treating Amleth's story as a sort of powerful mythos to be passed down across generations of Viking warriors."[90]

Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]

The film was set to be produced by Jay Van Hoy andLars Knudsenfor Studio 8.[12]In November 2016, Eggers expressed surprise that theNosferaturemake was going to be his second film, saying, "It feels ugly and blasphemous and egomaniacal and disgusting for a filmmaker in my place to doNosferatunext. I was really planning on waiting a while, but that's how fate shook out." Eggers had previously directed his high school's performance of theNosferatuplay, and was hired to direct a professional version of the play due to his work. Eggers credited this as the event that inspired him to pursue a career in filmmaking.[13]Eggers eventually opted to delay his version of the film, going on to directThe LighthouseandThe Northmanfirst.The WitchstarAnya Taylor-Joywas attached to the cast alongsideHarry Styles, but both dropped out in 2022.[1][14]In September 2022, it was reported that the film would starBill Skarsgårdinthe title rolealongsideLily-Rose Depp.[15]Thus,Nosferatubecame his fourth film.[1]

Eggers has stated in aRotten Tomatoesinterview that he is never interested in making films set in the contemporary era, claiming that the idea of him photographing modern technology disgusts him. When asked what is the soonest he is willing to film, he answers that he will go as far as the 1950s.[27]

Sigurjón Birgir Sigurðsson(born 27 August 1962), known asSjón(/ʃoʊn/SHOHN;[1]Icelandic:[sjouːn]; meaning "sight" and being an abbreviation of his first name), is an Icelandic poet, novelist, lyricist, and screenwriter. Sjón frequently collaborates with the singerBjörkand has performed withThe SugarcubesasJohnny Triumph. His works have been translated into 30 languages.[2]
Born inReykjavík,Iceland, Sjón grew up in the city'sBreiðholtdistrict, where he lived with his mother.[3]He began his writing career early and published his first book of poetry,Sýnir(Visions), in 1978 at 16.
In his youth, Sjón read and was influenced byThe Hardy Boys,Nancy Drew,Enid Blyton, andHenri Vernes.[4]Later, he describedDavid Bowieas being "like a tutor to me" because he would explore all the bands, authors, and artists that Bowie mentioned in interviews.[4]He spent his teenage years following the cultural scenes inNew YorkandLondon, and he took special interest in the emergence ofpunk subculture.[4]"When you’re on an island up in the North Atlantic," he said, "the need to know what is going on in the cultural centers is very strong, and you do everything you can to feel part of it all."[4]
He was one of the founding members of the neo-surrealist group Medúsa and became significant in Reykjavik's cultural scene.[5]
Active on the Icelandic music scene since the early 1980s, Sjón has collaborated with many of the best-known artists of the era and was featured as guest vocalist on a rareSugarcubes12" single "Luftgitar" in 1987 using the name Johnny Triumph; this was accompanied by a music video of Sjón playingair guitarwithBjörkandEinar Örn Benediktsson. Sjón would occasionally reprise this role for the final encore of The Sugarcubes concerts, including the band's one-off 2006 reunion show in Reykjavík.
Sjón has described rowdy and exuberant events from his youthful era, including a night spent walking around Reykjavik entirely on the roofs of parked cars that ended with him lying face down in a police car reciting from memoryAndré Breton'sSurrealist Manifestoof 1924.[3]
Sjón and Björk first met when they were teenagers, and together they formed a two-person band called Rocka Rocka Drum.[3]Later, when Björk began her solo career in the 1990s, Sjón wrote lyrics for her.[3]The pair teamed up to write the song"I've Seen it All"for the filmDancer in the Darkin 2000,and as a result, Sjón and Björk shared nominations for "Best Original Song" at both the 2001Golden Globesand the 2001Academy Awards.[3]Two years later, Sjón was featured in the documentaryInside Björk. In 2004, Björk performed"Oceania"– a song that the two had written together – at the2004 Summer Olympics Opening CeremonyinAthens, Greece.[6]
In 2007, he contributed the original story and wrote the screenplay for the animated filmAnna and the Moods. He also joined the cast, voicing the character Dr. Artmann.[7]
Sjón co-wrote the featureLambtogether withValdimar Jóhannsson. Lamb premiered in 2021 and was selected as Iceland's contribution to the2022 Academy Awards. Lamb also received a lot of international recognition through festivals around the world. It has been nominated for or received prizes at theCannes Film Festival,Gothenburg Film Festival,Sitges Film Festival,Palm Springs International Film Festival, and Athens International Film Festival, as well as from theEdda Awardsand theAustin Film Critics Association Awards.[citation needed]
From August to December 2021, Sjón was writer-in-residence at the Literaturhaus Zurich and the PWG Foundation inZurich.[8]
Sjón co-wrote the 2022 filmThe Northman,a historical epic and revenge thriller based on the legend of the Viking princeAmleth, with directorRobert Eggers. Björk appears in the film in a supporting role as aseeress.[citation needed]
His writing is characterized by surrealist elements, like unexpected transformations, strange events, and a blurring of boundaries between humans and other animals.[3]His work has received critical acclaim and been praised by other novelists such asHari Kunzru,David Mitchell, andA.S. Byatt, who said that his writing "changes the whole map of literature inside [her] head."[3]Sjón has discussed how, to some extent, his writing is influenced by the nature of Iceland itself as a remote, cold, volcanic island that experiences frequent tectonic activity.[4]"We’re absolutely at the mercy of these magnificent things, the land with its volcanoes and earthquakes, and the sea, which surrounds us and can be either a friend or a monster that devours us," he has commented about his relationship to the land. "As a writer, I love metamorphosis. I think it’s one of the great tools of literature."[4]
He writes in Icelandic.[3][4]
Sjón has lived and worked inLondon, but he currently resides in central Reykjavík with his wife, Ásgerdur.[3]He has two adult children.[3]He does most of his writing in an old fisherman's cottage in Reykjavik.[9]Hanging on the wall inside are the rib and shoulder blade of a large whale that once beached and died a short walk away from the cottage. "If you're here," Sjón says of his writing cottage, "then you're in the belly of the whale."[3]
When Sjón was a teenager, he learned that his grandfather had lived inGermanyduringWorld War IIand worked as aNazispy.[3]After returning to Iceland on aU-boatin 1944, his grandfather was arrested, convicted of treason, and imprisoned for a year. That family history has influenced Sjón's writing, including his 2019 novelRed Milkthat explores theneo-Naziradicalization of an Icelandic youth.[10]
He has been outspoken against the cooptation of traditionalNordicculture and literature by right-wing and nationalist political actors.[3][4]Pushing back against Icelandic critics ofmulticulturalism, Sjón has said that "like everywhere, the hilarious is that the conservative people trying to keep everyone out haven't the first clue what Icelandic culture is made of. Because they’ve never read a book or embraced Icelandic art, and they don’t realize that Icelandic culture is really a hybrid. It has always been."[4]As small immigrant communities have grown in Iceland, he has been an advocate for redefining Icelandic literature to include works written on the island in other languages likePolish,Spanish, andEnglish.[4]
Sjón was nominated for anAcademy Awardand aGolden Globefor the song "I've Seen It All" from the filmDancer in the Dark.[12]
In 2016, Sjón became the third writer chosen to contribute to theFuture Library project.[13]

She and her mother moved into acommune.[15][16]Her stepfather is Sævar Árnason, a former guitarist in the band Pops.[16]
At six, Björk enrolled at Reykjavík schoolBarnamúsíkskóli, where she studiedclassical pianoandflute.[12]After a school recital in which Björk sangTina Charles's 1976 hit "I Love to Love", her teachers sent a recording of her singing the song to theRÚV radio station, which at that time was Iceland's only radio station. The recording was broadcast nationally and, after hearing it, a representative of theFálkinnrecord label offered Björk a recording contract. Her debut record,Björk, consideredjuvenilia,[a]was recorded when she was 11 years old and was released in Iceland in December 1977.[22]
During her teens, after the diffusion ofpunk rockmusic in Iceland, Björk formed theall-girl punk bandSpit and Snot. In 1980, she formed ajazz fusiongroup, Exodus, collaborated in another group, JAM80, and graduated from music school.[12]In 1982, she and bassist Jakob Magnússon formed another group,Tappi Tíkarrass("Cork the Bitch's Ass" inIcelandic), and released theEPBitið fast í vitið("Bite Hard Into the Mind" in Icelandic), in August 1982. Their albumMirandawas released in December 1983. The group was featured in the documentaryRokk í Reykjavík, with Björk being featured on the cover of theVHSrelease.[12][23]Around this time, Björk met guitarist Þór Eldon andsurrealistgroup Medusa, which also included poetSjón, with whom she started a lifelong collaboration and formed a group, Rokka Rokka Drum.[24]She described her time as part of Medusa as "a gorgeous D.I.Y. organic university: extreme fertility!"[25]Björk appeared as a featured artist on "Afi", a track from the Björgvin Gíslason 1983 recordÖrugglega.[16]
Due to the imminent cancelling of radio showÁfangar, two radio personalities, Ásmundur Jónsson and Guðni Rúnar, requested musicians to play on a lastlive radioshow. Björk joined with Einar Melax (from the group Fan Houtens Kókó),Einar Örn Benediktsson(from Purrkur Pillnikk),Guðlaugur Kristinn ÓttarssonandSigtryggur Baldursson(from Þeyr), and Birgir Mogensen (from Spilafífl) to perform in the concert.[26]The group developed agothic rocksound. During this experience, Björk began to develop her vocalisation – punctuated by howls and shrieks.[12]The project performed as Gott kvöld during the concert. When they later decided to keep playing together as a group, they used the nameKukl("Sorcery" in Icelandic).[26]Björk's acquaintance gave the group their studio to record in and released their first single in 1983.[26]Their first big performance at a festival in Iceland was headlined by Englishanarchistpunk bandCrass, whose record label,Crass Recordsoffered the band a record deal.The Eyewas released in 1984, followed by a two-month tour in Europe, which also included a performance atRoskilde Festivalin Denmark. This made Kukl the first Icelandic band to play at the festival.[15][26]During this period Björk published a hand-coloured book of poems.Um Úrnat frá Björkwas distributed in 1984.[12]
Kukl's second album,Holidays in Europe (The Naughty Nought), came out in 1986. The band split up due to personal conflict, with Björk keeping a collaboration with Guðlaugur, which was namedthe Elgar Sisters. Some of the songs they recorded ended up as B-sides to Björk solo singles.[12][27]
Björk had her first acting role onThe Juniper Tree(filmed in 1986, released in 1990), a tale ofwitchcraftbased on theBrothers Grimmstory, directed byNietzchka Keene. Björk played the role of Margit, a girl whose mother has been killed for practising witchcraft.[12]That summer, former band member Einar Örn and Eldon formed the arts collectiveSmekkleysa("Bad Taste" in Icelandic), created with the intention of being both a record label and book publishing company.[12][27]Various friends, namely Melax and Sigtryggur from Kukl, along withBragi Ólafssonand Friðrik Erlingson from Purrkur Pillnikk, joined the group and a band coalesced in the collective solely to make money.[27]They were initially called Þukl, but they were advertised as Kukl (the name of the previous band). At a later concert supporting Icelandic band Stuðmenn, they referred to themselves asSykurmolarnir("Sugarcubes" in Icelandic). Their first double A-side single, "Einn mol'á mann", which contained the songs "Ammæli" ("Birthday") and "Köttur" ("Cat"), was released on 21 November 1986, Björk's 21st birthday.[27]
At the end of that year, the Sugarcubes signed withOne Little Indian.[27]Their first English single, "Birthday", was released in the United Kingdom on 17 August 1987; a week later, it was declared single of the week byMelody Maker.[27]The Sugarcubes also signed a distribution deal withElektra Recordsin the United States and recorded their first album,Life's Too Good, which was released in 1988.[28]After the release of the album, Eldon and Björk divorced soon after the birth of their child despite being in the same group.[29]The album went on to sell more than one million copies worldwide.[28]Björk contributed as a background vocalist on 1987 albumLoftmyndbyMegas, for whom she provided background vocals also on his subsequent album,Höfuðlausnir(1988), andHættuleg hljómsveit & glæpakvendið Stella(1990).[16]
In the last quarter of 1988, the Sugarcubes toured North America to positive reception.[28]On 15 October, the band appeared onSaturday Night Live. Björk alone contributed a rendition of theChristmassong "Jólakötturinn" ("The Christmas Cat") on the compilationHvít Er Borg Og Bær.[16]The band went on hiatus following the lack of reception ofHere Today, Tomorrow Next Week!(1989) and a lengthy international tour.[29]During this time, Björk started working on her solo projects. In 1990 she provided background vocals onGumsby Bless.[16]In the same year, she recordedGling-Gló, a collection of popularjazzand original work, with the jazz groupTríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonar, which as of 2011[update]was still her best-selling album in her home country.[12][28]Björk also contributed vocals to808 State's albumex:el, with whom she cultivated her interest inhouse music. She contributed vocals on the songs "Qmart" and on "Ooops", which was released as a single in the UK in 1991.[16]She also contributed vocals to the song "Falling", on the albumIslandbyCurrent 93andHilmar Örn Hilmarsson.[16]In the same year she metharpistCorky Hale, with whom she had a recording session that ended up as a track on her future albumDebut.[12]
At this point, Björk had decided to leave the band to pursue her solo career, but their contract included the making of one last album,Stick Around for Joy(1992), with a subsequent promotional tour, which she agreed to do.[28]Björk was featured on two tracks of the soundtrack for the 1992 filmRemote Control(known asSódóma Reykjavíkin Iceland).[16]The Sugarcubes split up after they played one last show in Reykjavík.[28]Rolling Stonecalled them "the biggest rock band to emerge from Iceland".[30]
Björk moved to London to pursue a solo career. She began working with producerNellee Hooper(who had producedMassive Attack, among others). Their partnership produced Björk's first international solo hit, "Human Behaviour", a dance track based on a guitar rhythm sampled fromAntônio Carlos Jobim. In most countries, the song was not widely played on radio, but its music video gained strong airtime on MTV. It was directed byMichel Gondry, who became a frequent collaborator for Björk.[31]Her first solo album,Debut, was released in June 1993 to positive reviews; it was named album of the year byNMEand eventually wentplatinumin the United States.[32]
Debutwas the leap Björk made from being in numerous bands during her teens and early twenties to her solo career. She named the albumDebutto signify a start of something new.Debuthad a mix of songs Björk had been writing since she was a teenager, as well as more recent lyrical collaborations with Hooper. Thedance-oriented album varied in instrumentation. One single from the album, "Venus as a Boy", featured aBollywood-influenced string arrangement. Björk covered the jazz standard "Like Someone in Love" to the accompaniment of a harp, and the final track, "The Anchor Song", was sung with only a saxophone ensemble for accompaniment.
At the1994 Brit Awards, Björk won the awards forBest International FemaleandBest International Newcomer.[33]The success ofDebutenabled her to collaborate with British and other artists on one-off tracks. She worked withDavid Arnoldon "Play Dead", the theme to the 1993 filmThe Young Americans(which appeared as a bonus track on a re-release ofDebut), collaborated on two songs for Tricky'sNearly Godproject, appeared on the track "Lilith" for the albumNot for ThreesbyPlaid, and co-wrote the song "Bedtime Story" forMadonna's 1994 albumBedtime Stories. Björk also had an uncredited role as a runway model in the 1994 filmPrêt-à-Porter.
Postwas Björk's second solo studio album. Released in June 1995, the album was produced in conjunction withNellee Hooper,Tricky,Graham Masseyof808 State, and electronica producerHowie B. Building on the success ofDebut, Björk continued to pursue different sounds, taking particular interest in dance andtechno. Production by Tricky and Howie B also provided trip hop/electronica-like sounds on tracks like "Possibly Maybe" and "Enjoy". It was these producers' influence along with older friend Graham Massey that inspired Björk to create material like the stormingindustrialbeats of "Army of Me". The album was ranked number 7 inSpin's"Top 90 Albums of the '90s" list and number 75 in its "100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005" list.[34][35]PostandHomogenicwere placed back to back onPitchfork Media's "Top Albums of the '90s" list at numbers 21 and 20, respectively.[36][37]In 2003, the album was ranked number 373 onRolling Stonemagazine's list ofthe 500 greatest albums of all time.[38]During this period, the press exalted Björk's eccentricity by creating a "pixie" persona around her,[39]a descriptor she later confronted with her following albums.[40]
Although Björk continued to receive more mainstream attention for her videos than her singles,Postincluded several UK pop hits and was eventually certifiedplatinumin the US.[32]Björk also contributed to the 1995Hector Zazoucollaborative albumChansons des mers froides, singing the traditional Icelandic song "Vísur Vatnsenda-Rósu".
Björk left London for Spain, where she recorded the albumHomogenic,[41]released in 1997. Björk worked with producersMark BellofLFOandHowie B, as well asEumir Deodato; numerous remixes followed.Homogenicis regarded as one of Björk's most experimental and extroverted works, with enormous beats that reflect the landscape of Iceland, most notably in the song "Jóga", which fuses lush strings with rocky electronic crunches. The album was certifiedgoldin the US in 2001.[32]The album was backed by string ofmusic videos, several of which received airplay onMTV. The video for "Bachelorette" was directed by frequent collaboratorMichel Gondry, while "All Is Full of Love" was directed byChris Cunningham. The single "All is Full of Love" was also the firstDVDsingle to ever be released in the US, which paved the way for other artists to include DVD video and othermultimediafeatures with their singles. Björk began to write more personally, saying "I realised that I'd come to the end of the extrovert thing. I had to go home and search for myself again."[41]
In 1999, Björk was asked to write and produce the musical score for the filmDancer in the Dark, a musical drama about an immigrant named Selma who is struggling to pay for an operation to prevent her son from going blind. DirectorLars von Triereventually asked her to consider playing the role of Selma, convincing her that the only true way to capture the character of Selma was to have the composer of the music play the character.[42]Eventually, she accepted. Filming began in early 1999, and the film debuted in 2000 at the53rd Cannes Film Festival. The film received thePalme d'Or, and Björk received theBest Actress Awardfor her role.[10]It was reported that the shoot was so physically and emotionally tiring that she vowed never to act again.[43]Björk later stated that she always wanted to do one musical in her life, andDancer in the Darkwas the one.[44]The soundtrack Björk created for the film was released with the titleSelmasongs. The album features a duet withThom YorkeofRadioheadtitled "I've Seen It All", which was nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Original Songand was performed at the 2001 Oscars (without Yorke), while Björk was wearing her celebratedswan dress.[45]
In 2001, Björk released the albumVespertine. It featured chamber orchestras, choirs, hushed vocals, microbeats made from household sounds, and personal, vulnerable themes. For the album, she collaborated with experimental musicians such asMatmos, Denmark-basedDJ Thomas Knak, and harpistZeena Parkins. Lyrical sources included the works of AmericanpoetE. E. Cummings, the American independent filmmakerHarmony Korine, and English playwrightSarah Kane's penultimate play,Crave. To coincide with the album's release,an eponymous coffee table bookof loose prose and photographs was published.[46]Björk embarked on theVespertine world tour. The shows were held in theatres and opera houses in order to have "the best acoustics possible." She was accompanied by Matmos, Parkins and anInuitchoir, whom she had held auditions for on a trip to Greenland prior to the tour.[47]At the time,Vespertinewas Björk's fastest selling album to date, having sold two million copies by the end of 2001.[48]
Vespertinespawned three singles: "Hidden Place", "Pagan Poetry", and "Cocoon".MTV2played the album's first video, "Hidden Place", which was subsequently released as a DVD single. The next video, for "Pagan Poetry", brought Björk to an even higher level of controversy with the channel. The video features graphic piercings, Björk's exposed nipples, and simulatedfellatio.[49]As a result, the clip was banned from MTV. In 2002, it was aired unedited as part of a late night special on MTV2 titled, "Most Controversial Music Videos". The video for "Cocoon" also featured a seemingly naked Björk (actually wearing a close fitting bodysuit), this time with her nipples secreting a red thread that eventually enveloped her in a cocoon. The video was directed by Japanese artistEiko Ishiokaand was not aired by MTV.[50]She was invited to record "Gollum's Song" for the filmThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towersbut declined the invitation, as she was then pregnant; the song was instead recorded by another Icelander,Emilíana Torrini.
In 2002 the CD box setFamily Treewas issued. It comprised selected rarities as well as previously unreleased versions of her compositions, including her work with theBrodsky Quartet. Also released alongsideFamily Treewas the albumGreatest Hits, a retrospective of the previous 10 years of her solo career as deemed by the public. The songs on the album were chosen by Björk's fans through a poll on her website. A DVD edition of the CD was also released. It contained all of Björk's solo music videos up to that point. The new single from the set, "It's in Our Hands" charted in the UK at number 37.[4]The video, directed bySpike Jonze, features a heavily pregnant Björk. She gave birth to daughter Isadora Bjarkardottir Barney on 3 October 2002.[51]Björk and the Brodsky Quartet recorded "Prayer of the Heart", a composition written for her by composerJohn Tavenerin 2001, and it was played then for a slide show presentation in 2003 for the American photographer,Nan Goldin. In 2003, Björk released a box set,Live Box, consisting of four CDs containinglive recordingsof her previous albums and a DVD featuring a video of one track from each CD. Each of the four CDs was later released separately at a reduced price.
In August 2004, Björk releasedMedúlla. During production, Björk decided the album would work best as an entirely vocal-based album. This initial plan was modified, as the majority of the sounds on the album are indeed created by vocalists but several feature prominent basic electronic programming, as well as the occasional musical instrument. Björk used the vocal skills ofthroat singerTanya Tagaq,hip hopbeatboxerRahzel, Japanese beatboxerDokaka, avant-rockerMike Patton,Soft Machinedrummer/singerRobert Wyatt, and severalchoirs. She again appropriated text from E. E. Cummings for the song "Sonnets/Unrealities XI". At the time,Medúllabecame her highest-charting album in the US, debuting at number 14.[52]
In August 2004, Björk performed the song "Oceania" at theOpening Ceremonyof the2004 Summer OlympicsinAthens. As she sang, her dress slowly unfurled to reveal a 10,000 square foot (900 m2) map of the world, which she let flow over all of the Olympic athletes. The song "Oceania" was written especially for the occasion and features the talents ofShlomo, aLeeds-basedbeatboxer, and a London choir. An alternative version of the song began circulating on the Internet with additional vocals byKelis. It originally appeared on the promotional "Oceania" single released to radio stations and later became available to the public as aB-sideof the "Who Is It" single, which charted at number 26 in the UK.[53]This was followed in early 2005 by "Triumph of a Heart", charting at number 31.[54]A video for the potential next single, "Where Is the Line", was filmed in collaboration with the Icelandic artistGabríela Friðriksdóttirin late 2004. This was initially a sequence from an art installation movie of the artists but was released exclusively on theMedúlla VideosDVD as an official promo for the track.
In 2005, Björk collaborated with partnerMatthew Barneyon the experimental art filmDrawing Restraint 9, a dialogueless exploration ofJapanese culture. Björk and Barney both appear in the film, playing two occidental guests on a Japanese factory whaling vessel who ultimately transform into two whales. She is also responsible for the film's soundtrack, her second afterSelmasongs. Björk also appeared in the 2005 documentaryScreaming Masterpiece, which delves into the Icelandic music scene. The movie features archive footage of the Sugarcubes andTappi Tíkarrassand an ongoing conversation with Björk herself. During this era, Björk earned anotherBRIT Awardsnomination for Best International Female Solo Artist.[55]She was also awarded the Inspiration Award at the AnnualQ MagazineAwards in October 2005, accepting the prize from Robert Wyatt, with whom she collaborated onMedúlla.[56]In 2006, Björk remastered her first three solo studio albums (Debut,Post,Homogenic) and her two soundtrack albums (SelmasongsandDrawing Restraint 9) in 5.1 surround sound for a re-issue in a new box-set titledSurrounded, released on 27 June.VespertineandMedúllawere already available in 5.1 as either DVD-A or SACD but are also included in the box set in repackaged format. TheDualDiscswere also released separately.[57]Björk's former band, the Sugarcubes, reunited for a one-night-only concert in Reykjavík on 17 November 2006. Profits from the concert were donated to the Sugarcubes' former label,Smekkleysa, who according to Björk's press statement, "continue to work on a non-profit basis for the future betterment of Icelandic music".[58]
Björk contributed a cover ofJoni Mitchell's song "The Boho Dance" to the albumA Tribute to Joni Mitchell(2007).[59]Director and previous collaboratorMichel Gondryasked Björk to star in his filmThe Science of Sleep, but she declined. The role was played byCharlotte Gainsbourginstead.[60]Björk starred in Gunar Karlsson's 2007 animated filmAnna and the Moods, along withTerry JonesandDamon Albarn.
Björk's sixth full-length studio album,Volta, was released on 1 May 2007. It features 10 tracks.

Announced via aneBayauction, a new Björk track was revealed under the title "Náttúra". Björk commented the song was intended "to encourage active support for a more environmental approach to Iceland's natural resources."The song was initially labelled as a new single by Björk, with backing vocals from Radiohead frontmanThom Yorke.

She gave a live performance ofVulnicura'sfinal song "Quicksand", and the footage was incorporated into the "Quicksand" VR experience.Björk Digitalhas travelled the world with stops in London, Montreal, Houston, Los Angeles and Barcelona.
On 2 August 2017, Björk announced with a handwritten note on her social media the imminent release of a new album. The announcement coincided with an interview forDazed's autumn 2017 cover issue in which Björk talked about the new album.[98][99]The lead single, "The Gate", was released on 15 September 2017.[100]Its video was directed byAndrew Thomas Huang.[101]The same day of the single's release, Björk announced the album title,Utopia, during an interview withNowness.[102]
Utopiawas released on 24 November 2017.[103]She described it as her "Tinderalbum" and stated that "it's about that search (for utopia) – and about being in love. Spending time with a person you enjoy is when the dream becomes real."[104][105]Björk added that her previous album was "hell" – it was like divorce!", stating, "So we [were] doing paradise [...] We have done hell, we have earned some points."[106][107]She produced the album withArca, whom she collaborated with onVulnicura. Björk has described her collaborative journey with Arca as "the strongest musical relationship [she's] had", likening it to that ofJoni MitchellandJaco Pastoriusduring the albumsHejiraandDon Juan's Reckless Daughter("It's that synergy when two people lose their ego"), which have both been praised by Björk.[101]Three additional music videos were released in 2017: "Blissing Me", "Utopia" and "Arisen My Senses" with the former and latter also receiving limited edition remix EPs.[108][109][110]Utopiawas nominated forBest Alternative Music Albumat the61st Annual Grammy Awards, making Björk's fifteenth nomination at the Grammys.[111]
On 22 May 2018, Björk appeared as the headlining musical guest onLater... with Jools Holland, her first time on theBBCseries since 2011.[112]She sang a set of four songs, including a flute rendition of "The Anchor Song" from 1993'sDebutbefore embarking on the briefUtopia tour, playing in several European music festivals during the summer.[113][114][115]On 12 November 2018, Björk announced a new concert production centered around herUtopiaalbum, entitledCornucopia.[116][117]Cornucopia opened in May 2019 at the newly builtThe Shedin New York and was described as Björk's "most elaborate staged concert to date."[118][119]Theresidency showthen traveled to Mexico and Europe for further dates in 2019.[120][121]Following the performances, Björk released music videos for "Tabula Rasa" and "Losss", both directed by Tobias Gremmler and used as backdrop during the shows.[122][123]On 16 August 2019, Björk announced theUtopia Bird Call Boxset, a box set meant to celebrate the end of the album cycle which 14 wooden flutes that imitate various bird calls and a USB stick featuring the digital albums, music videos and remixes, alongside an unreleased instrumental track, "Arpegggio".[124][125]On 6 September 2019, two remixes of "Features Creatures" were released as digital singles, one byFever Rayand the other bythe Knife. Both remixes, as well as Björk's own remix of Fever Ray's 2017 song, "This Country", were collected onCountry Creatures.[126]
On 27 September 2019, Björk made a surprise appearance duringMutant;Faith, Arca's performance-art piece at the Shed, to debut "Afterwards", a new collaboration which Björk performed in a combination of Spanish and gibberish.[127]The song is included on Arca's fourth studio album,KiCk i, which was released on 26 June 2020.[128]Björk then embarked on her eleventh concert tour, calledBjörk Orkestral, in which she performed orchestral arrangements of songs from her career.[129][130]Due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, the tour was postponed several times before taking place from 2021 to 2023.[131]
In August 2020, Björk joined the cast ofThe Northman, the third feature film byRobert Eggers, co-written withSjón, alongside her daughter Ísadóra Bjarkardóttir Barney, in her debut film role.[132][133]It was released on 22 April 2022 in the United States.
In an interview withThe Mercury Newspublished on 19 January 2022, Björk mentioned that she was wrapping up work on her upcoming tenth studio album.[134]She revealed in an interview withThe Guardian, published on 19 August 2022, that the new album is calledFossora, a Latin word for "digging".[135]Fossorawas released on 30 September 2022. It was supported by four singles: "Atopos" on 6 September 2022, "Ovule" on 14 September, "Ancestress" on 22 September and the album's title track on 27 September. Also in September 2022 Björk ventured into podcasting, hostingBjörk: Sonic Symbolismwhich, according to a press release, features her "discussing the textures, timbres and emotional landscapes of each of her albums" with friends writerOddný Eirand musicologist Ásmundur Jónsson.[136]
Björk released the single "Oral", featuringRosalíawith production fromSega Bodega, on 21 November 2023. A reworked demo written betweenHomogenicandVespertine, the song is intended to support the inhabitants ofSeyðisfjörðurin the campaign against Norwegian-ownedfish farmingoperations that threaten to degrade local ecosystems. The proceeds from this song were donated to Aegis, an environmental organization Björk founded with other Icelandic activists to stop the intensive fish farming that is destroying the fjords.[137][138]
In 2024, Björk appeared on the April/May cover ofVogue Scandinavia, her first everVoguecover, photographed by Viðar Logi wearingMaison Margiela.[139][140]In October, a newly discovered large butterfly species was namedPterourus bjorkaein honour of Björk.[141][142]In 2025Cornucopia, aconcert filmchronicling a performance inLisbonduring the last leg of the Cornucopia tour, directed byÍsold Uggadóttir, premiered onApple TV+as part of theApple Music Liveseries, with a full-length version receiving a theatrical release.[143][144]
Over her three-decade solo career, Björk has developed aneclecticandavant-garde[145][146]musical style that incorporates aspects ofelectronic,[145][147][148][149]dance,[149][150]alternative dance,[151]trip hop,[152]experimental,[1][153][154]glitch,[146]jazz,[146][155]alternative rock,[156][157]instrumental,[145]andcontemporary classical music.[148][154]Her music has since been subject to critical analysis and scrutiny, as she consistently defies categorisation in a musical genre.[158]Although she often calls herself apopartist,[1]she is considered a "restlessly experimental creative force".[159][160]According toThe New Yorker'sTaylor Ho Bynum, "no contemporary artist so gracefully bridges the divide [between music experimentalist and pop celebrity] as Björk".[161]Her albumDebut, which incorporated electronic,house, jazz, and trip hop, has been credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic music into mainstream pop.[162][163]Her work has been described as "frequently explor[ing] the relationship between nature and technology".[164]Broadly summarising her wide-ranging integration of art and popular music, Joshua Ostroff suggested that "there is no better descriptor for what Björk does thanartpop".[151]TheNMEalso called her output a "consistentlyprogressive popagenda."[165]
Björk's work isidiosyncraticallycollaborative, having worked with various producers, photographers, fashion designers and music video directors. She however believes that her male collaborators have received more credit than her, which Björk attributes to her being a female artist.[166]
During her career beginnings, Björk performed in bands from various musical genres:punk rockin Spit and Snot,jazz fusionin Exodus,post-punkin Tappi Tíkarrass andgothic rockinKukl.[12]When working with Tappi Tíkarrass, she was heavily influenced byBritish new wavebands such asSiouxsie and the Banshees,[167]Wire,the Passions,the Slits,Joy Division,[168]andKilling Joke.[169]The studio albumGling-Gló(1990) was recorded withTríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonarand featured jazz and popular standards sung "very much in the classicElla FitzgeraldandSarah Vaughanmould."[170]The Sugarcubes' style has been described asavant-pop[147]and alternative rock.[171]Although Björk was in various post-punk and alternative rock bands during the late1980s, her contact withLondon'sundergroundclub culturehelped her find her own musical identity.[172]
Debut, released in 1993, has been credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic music into mainstream pop.[173][174]Being a fan ofdance musicsince the early days ofacid house, Björk used dance music as the framework for her songs inDebut, stating in 1993 that it was the only "pop music that is truly modern" and "place where anything creative is happening today."[175]However, in aRolling Stoneinterview she also stated that she was more influenced by the sensual and groundbreakingambient musicformerly found inChicagoandDetroit.[176]The music ofDebutreflects the contemporarymusical environment of London, where [Björk] lived in the early1990s, especially the burgeoning trip-hop scene of bands likePortisheadandMassive Attack.[177]Michael Cragg ofThe Guardianhas described it as an "indefinable conflation ofelectronic pop, trip-hop,world musicand otherworldly lyrics";[178]whileThe Face's Mandi James said it was "a delightful fusion ofthrash metal, jazz,funkandopera, with the odd dash ofexoticathrown in for good measure."[179]
The 1995 albumPost, known for its eclecticism,[180]is considered to be the "quintessential Björk" release, due to itsproteanform – more than any of her albums – and its "wide emotional palette".[181]The entirety of the album was written after Björk's move to England, and intended to reflect the faster pace of her new urban life.[182]The Guardianwrote that "Posttapped into the vortex ofmulticulturalenergy that was mid-90s London, where she had relocated and where strange hybrids such asjungleand trip-hop were bubbling."[183]Postbuilt on thedance-popblueprint ofDebut, but pushed its production andbeatsto the fore, with influences from all over the world.[184]While the "distant echoes" ofIDMand trip-hop were present inDebut,Postis characterised by Björk's fuller incorporation of these styles.[174]Referred to as a "genreroulette" by theSan Francisco Chronicle,[185]it touches on various musical styles, includingindustrial music,[186]big-band jazz, trip-hop,chillout,[186]and experimental music.[187]The balance between synthetic and organic elements in the album – generated through the combination ofelectronicand"real" instruments– is a recurring characteristic in Björk's output.[188][189]
With her 1997 albumHomogenic, Björk intended to make a simple, one-flavoured record, in contrast with her previous releases.[190]Conceptually focused on her native Iceland,[190]the album is a "fusion of chilly strings (courtesy of the Icelandic String Octet), stuttering,abstractbeats, and unique touches likeaccordionandglass harmonica".[191][192]Björk incorporated a traditional singing method used by Icelandic choir men, a combination of speaking and singing as illustrated in the song "Unravel".[193]WhileHomogenicstill showed Björk's inclination towardselectronic dance-musicandtechno-futurism, Neva Chonin ofRolling Stonereflected on how the album has steered away from the "sweet melodies and peppy dance collages of her earlier releases."[194]
On the 2001 albumVespertine, Björk continued with her idiosyncratic general meshing of organic and synthetic textures, once again via the combination of electronic sounds andstring arrangements.[195]However,Vespertinediffered fromHomogenicin its greater interest in intimacy and sexuality (the result of her new relationship with artistMatthew Barney),[1][196][197]with sharper melodies,minimalisticproduction and explicit lyrics inspired by poetry ofE. E. CummingsandSarah Kane's playCrave.[195][198]Vespertineis also characterised by a newfound obsession with the auditory of analog technology, with a prevalent usage ofloops, static andwhite noise, paradoxically contrasting the advancement of digital technology occurring in the 21st century;[199]thus, elements of glitch music have been identified.[200][201]Unlike previous albums likeDebutandPost, electronic sounds has gained more prevalence, while the acoustic sounds are used as interjections.[199]Björk also stepped away from her signature shrieking singing style; her vocals often appear to be recorded close to the microphone and with little treatment, and sung in a sometimes "unstable whisper", conveying a sense of close proximity and reduced space suitable for the lyrics that have grown to be more intimate.[202]
Björk's 2004 studio album,Medúlla, is almost entirely constructed with human vocals,[1]with a vast scope of influences ranging from elements offolktomedieval music.[203]Wondering Soundwrote that despite "its comparative starkness, [Medúllais] every bit as sensual as [Vespertine]."[195]The publication also added: "The electronic treatments range from industrialdistortiontopercussiveglitchesand dreamy layering, rarely descending into novelty."[195]The album combinesbeatboxing, classical choirs that suggest composers likePendereckiorArvo Pärt, and "mews, moans, counterpoint and guttural grunts" provided by Björk and guests likeMike Patton,Robert WyattandTanya Tagaq.[204]Medúllaincludes "vocal fantasias" that lean towardchamber music, alongside tracks that "are obviously but distantly connected tohip-hop."[204]Glimpses ofBulgarianwomen's choirs, thepolyphonyofcentral Africanpygmies, and the "primal vocalisms" ofMeredith Monkwere also noted.[204]
Volta, released in 2007, received coverage after the inclusion ofR&BproducerTimbaland; however,NMEwrote that "this is not Björk 'going hip-hop' or having a late-breaking pop reinvention."[205]It has been said that the album achieves the perfect balance between her vibrant, poppier works in the '90s and her experiments in the2000s.[206]Björk wanted the album's beats to be "effortless, primitive,lo-fistyle", in contrast withVespertine.[207]It combines a largebrassensemble with live andprogrammeddrumsand "ethnic instruments" likelikembé,pipaandkora.[207]Voltaalternates between potent, joyful songs, and moodier, more contemplative tracks, "all of which are tied together by found-sound and brass-driven interludes that give the impression that the album was recorded in a harbor".[206]
Biophilia, of 2011, showcases Björk's more avant-garde tendencies, drawing comparisons toStockhausenandNico's 1969 album,The Marble Index.[145][208]The track "Moon" mesmerisingly encapsulates the comprehensive progress made across her previous works with metaphorical lyrics of natural phenomena and their impact on humans.[209]
The music inVulnicura, her 2015 album, is centered on Björk's voice,orchestralstrings and electronic beats.[1][210]This combination was already present inHomogenic, certainly the consequence of the common topics treated by both albums: "heartbreak and perseverance".[1]
In 2017, Björk releasedUtopia, which harkened back to previous works such asVespertineandHomogenic, combining organic and electronic elements. It has been referred to as Björk'sflutealbum, akin to the heavy prevalence ofVespertine'sceleste,Volta's brass,Medúlla's voices andBiophilia's choir.[211]Arcaand Björk closely collaborated in the album's production, and more consistently than her work with the lateMark Bell. The Venezuelan producer also takes a lead role in production.[212]
In September 2022, Björk premiered the podcastBjörk: Sonic Symbolismwhere she reviewed her sound experiences, accompanied by some of her collaborators in a conversation about the moods, timbers, and tempos through each of her ten albums.[213]
While Björk said that she was influenced by "everything",[214]she has name-droppedStockhausen,Kraftwerk,Brian Enoand Mark Bell as some of the people who influenced her the most.[215]Some "confessional singer-songwriters" Björk commends includeAbida Parveen,Chaka Khan,Joni MitchellandKate Bush; with the latter being a definitive influence in her career.[166]Mitchell also inspired her to write her own songs, saying that Mitchell "created her own [female musical universe]", and found it "very liberating".[216]According toPulse: "a lot of Björk's early influences were books (Georges Bataille'sStory of the Eye,Mikhail Bulgakov'sThe Master and Margarita) and films (Tampopo,Star Wars,The Tin Drum) available internationally. [...] But talk about Iceland and you're getting to the heart of the matter, the source of her spirited outlook on life."[217]
During her formative years at music school, Björk became interested in avant-garde,classical, and minimalistic music;[145][218]also becoming a "jazz freak".[219]Although her music is more consistently tonal and has more crossover appeal, she is considered indebted to avant-garde composers Karlheinz Stockhausen, Meredith Monk,Sun RaandPhilip Glass.[161][220]In a 2008 article forThe Guardian, Björk considered Stockhausen as the root of electronic music, writing "he sparked off a sun that is still burning and will glow for a long time".[221]Early in her career, Björk citedSir David Attenboroughas her biggest musical influence, saying "she identified with his thirst for exploring new and wild territories".[222]In 1996, Björk showed her appreciation for expressionist composer Arnold Schoenberg, as she coveredPierrot Lunaire, originally from 1912.[223]She also stated that she "[likes] to discover sounds I had never heard before".[224]
Björk is asoprano, with arangespanning fromE3toD6.[225][226][227][228]Her singing voice has been described as both "elastic" and "somersaulting" in quality as well as being praised for herscattingability, unique vocal stylings and delivery.[229]In a review for her live performance at the 2011Manchester International Festival, Bernadette McNulty ofThe Daily Telegraphcommented, "the 45-year-old still uses electronic dance beats with a full-bloodedraver's passion and the elementaltimbreof her voice has grown more powerful with age".[230]
In late 2012, it was reported that Björk had undergone surgery for apolypon her vocal cords. Commenting on the success of the procedure after years of maintaining a strict diet and using vocal exercises to prevent vocal injury, she "stayed quiet for three weeks and then started singing and definitely feel like my cords are as good as pre-nodule".[231]However, in a review forBiophilia,Kitty EmpireofThe Guardianstated that pre-surgery Björk still sounded strong, commenting that her voice was "spectacular and swooping", particularly on the song "Thunderbolt".[232]
In a similar vein, Matthew Cole ofSlant Magazineadds that her voice has been "preserved quite well"; however also noting that her voice has become too hoarse and shouty, adding "it's only where her most dramatic vocal pyrotechnics are concerned that there's any question of physical ability".[233]National Public Radiocounted Björk among its list of "50 Great Voices" and MTV placed her at number 8 on its countdown "22 Greatest Voices in Music". She has been ranked 60th as one of the 100 greatest singers ever, and 81st as one of the 100 greatest songwriters ever byRolling Stone, who praised her voice as being unique, fresh and extremely versatile, fitting and being influenced by a wide range of influences and genres.[234][235][236]
Musicians from a wide array of genres have expressed admiration or cited Björk as an inspiration. These artists include:Solange Knowles,[237]Danny Brown,[238]Beyonce[239]Perfume Genius,[240]Travis Scott,[241]SZA,[242]Ellie Goulding[243]Missy Elliot,[244]Mike ShinodaofLinkin Park,[245]Mitski,[246]Christine and the Queens,[247]AURORA,[248]Kali Uchis,[249]Kelela,[250]Prince,[251]Maggie Rogers,[252]Amy Lee,[253]Poppy,[254]Corinne Bailey Rae,[255]Jeff Buckley[256]Hayley WilliamsofParamore,[257]Geddy LeeofRush,[258]Willow Smith,[259]andCaroline Polachek.[260]
In 2023,Rolling Stoneranked her at 64 on their list of 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[261]
When formingthe Sugarcubes, Björk was briefly married to guitarist Þór Eldon. They had a son, Sindri Eldon Þórsson, born 8 June 1986, the same day that the band was formed.[29]They had divorced before the end of 1986, but continued to work together in the band.[262]
Following the breakup of the Sugarcubes, Björk moved toLondon, where she was immediately offered a record deal. She became engaged to London-based DJGoldie,[263]but broke up with him in 1996.[264]She also had a brief relationship with musicianTrickyin the 1990s.[265]During this period, she became involved with thetrip hopscene with which Goldie and Tricky were associated. Björk also began her work with fashion designerAlexander McQueen. As a result of her time spent in London, Björk developed acockneyaccent, evident in her interviews given in English at the time.[266]
In London, Björk grew tired of public life and the constant harassment from the paparazzi, in particular over a murder attempt by a stalker,Ricardo López, and her relationships with Tricky and Goldie. She moved to Spain after receiving an offer to stay there from Trevor Morais, her tour drummer, who had a residential studio atMarbella,Andalusia,[267]where she producedHomogenic(1997).
In February 1996, Björk arrived atBangkok International Airportwith her nine-year-old son at the time, Sindri, after along-haul flight. Reporters were present, despite Björk's early request that the press leave her and her son alone until a press conference. As Björk attempted to walk away from thepaparazzi, television reporter Julie Kaufman approached Sindri and said, "Welcome to Bangkok!" In response, Björk lunged at Kaufman, knocking her to the ground and tossing her until security intervened. Björk later apologised to Kaufman, who declined to press charges.[268]Her record company later stated that Kaufman had been pestering Björk for four days before the incident.[269]
On 13 January 2008, Björk attacked a photographer who had photographed her arrival atAuckland International Airportfor her scheduled performance at theBig Day Outfestival.[270]Björk allegedly tore the photographer's shirt down the back, and in the process she fell to the ground.[271]Neither the photographer nor his employer,The New Zealand Herald, lodged a formal complaint, and Auckland police did not investigate further.[272]
On 12 September 1996,Ricardo López, a mentally ill, obsessed American fan of Björk, mailed aletter bombloaded withsulfuric acidto Björk's London home. He wanted to "punish" Björk for being in a relationship withGoldieat the time. He returned home and filmed his suicide in the final part of a video diary[273]that later became public after being released to journalists and caused a media sensation that temporarily halted the sessions in makingHomogenic.[274][275][276]
In her few public comments on this event, Björk said she was "very distressed" by the incident,[277]and said, "I make music, but in other terms, you know, people shouldn't take me too literally and get involved in my personal life."[278]She sent a card and flowers to López's family.[279]She left for Spain, where she recorded the remainder of her third album,Homogenic, away from media attention.[280]She also hired security for her son, Sindri, who was escorted to school with a minder.[281]A year after López's death, Björk discussed the incident in an interview: "I was very upset that somebody had died. I couldn't sleep for a week. And I'd be lying if I said it didn't scare the fuck out of me that I could get hurt and, most of all, that my son could get hurt."[282]López subsequently became known in the press as "Björk's stalker".[283][284]
In the late 1990s, Björk lived in New York, where she met artistMatthew Barneyin the art scene. The pair formed a relationship and started living together, moving toBrooklyn Heightsin 2000.[285]Their daughter Ísadóra Bjarkardóttir Barney was born in 2002. Barney and Björk initially kept their work separate, but then collaborated on Barney's art filmDrawing Restraint 9, a long-term project released in 2005; Björk acted in the film and also contributed musical elements.[286]The couple broke up in 2013. At the time, she described the breakup as "the most painful thing" that she had ever experienced. The albumVulnicura, and in particular the track "Black Lake", were written about the breakup.[287]Björk began to reside half of each year in the US and the other half in two residences in Iceland with her daughter.[288][289]
After thetsunamithat struckSoutheast Asiain late 2004, Björk began work on a new project titledArmy of Me: Remixes and Coversto help raise money for a relief fund. This project recruited fans and musicians from around the world to either cover or remix the 1995 track "Army of Me". From over 600 responses, Björk and her co-writer Graham Massey picked the best 20 versions to appear on the album. The album was released in April in the UK and in late May 2005 in the US. By January 2006, the album had raised about £250,000 to helpUNICEF's work in the southeast Asian region.[290]Björk visitedBanda Acehin February 2006 to view some of UNICEF's work with the children who were affected by the tsunami.[291]
On 2 July 2005, Björk took part in theLive 8series of concerts, headlining theJapan showwithDo As Infinity,Good CharlotteandMcFly. She performed eight songs withMatmos, aJapanesestringoctet, andZeena Parkins.[292][293]
Björk's years inKuklaligned her with theanarchistCrass Collective.[294]While she has since been hesitant to be seen as an overtly political figure, and has said so on her website,[295]she is supportive of numerousliberation movements, includingindependence for Kosovo.[296]
She dedicated her song "Declare Independence" toGreenlandand theFaroe Islands, which caused a minor controversy in the Faroes. After Björk twice dedicated "Declare Independence" to the people ofKosovoduring a concert in Japan,[297]her upcoming performance atSerbia'sExit Festivalwas cancelled, reportedly for safety concerns. In 2008, Björk created international controversy after she dedicated "Declare Independence" to theInternational Tibet Independence Movementduring aShanghaiconcert, chanting "Tibet! Tibet!" during the song.China's Ministry of Cultureissued a denunciation through state news agencyXinhua, stating that Björk "brokeChinese law" and "hurtChinese people's feelings" and pledged to further tighten control over foreign artists performing in China. A later statement accused Björk of "whipping upethnic hatred."[298]In 2014, Björk created aFacebookpost dedicating the song to thepeople of Scotlandas they neared thereferendum on their independence.[299]In October 2017, she posted atweetdedicating the song toCataloniaon the occasion of theCatalan independence referendum.[300]In November 2023, during theIsrael–Hamas war, in whichIsraelwasaccused of committing genocide against Palestinians, she posted to her social media accounts criticising theIsraeli occupation of Palestine.[301]
Björk has also taken an interest in environmental issues in Iceland. In 2004, she took part in the Hætta concert in Reykjavík, organised in protest against the building ofAlcoaaluminiumsmelters in the country, which would make Iceland the biggest smelter in Europe.[302][303]She founded the organisation Náttúra, which aims to promote Icelandic nature and grassroots industries.[304]In October 2008, Björk wrote an article forThe Timesabout theIcelandic economyand provided her opinion on the proposed use of natural resources to rescue the country from debt.[305]In collaboration withAudur Capital, she set up a venture capital fund titled BJÖRK to support the creation of sustainable industries in Iceland.[306]
In 2008, Björk wrote theforewordto the English translation ofAndri Snær Magnason's bestseller book titledDreamland – A Self Help Manual For A Frightened Nation.[307]
On 21 May 2010, Björk wrote an open letter inThe Reykjavík Grapevinecalling on theIcelandic governmentto "do everything in its power to revoke the contracts withMagma Energy", the Canadian company that owns Icelandic geothermal companyHS Orka.[308][309]
In 2014, Björk helped to organise Stopp, Let's Protect the Park, an event organised to raise money and awareness for the preservation of Icelandic nature. This included a show atHarpa Concert Hall, at which she performed three songs. The concert initially raised $310,000[310]and went on to raise £3 million overall, with plans to use the money to establish a national park.[311]
In 2022, Bjork stated her reasoning for going back to Iceland was because ofAmerica's gun violence.[312]
Over her extensive career, Björk has frequently used her position and influence to help launch new acts ormentorthem as they establish themselves as recording artists.
The first example was the Iranian-bornelectronicaproducerLeila Arab, who was initially recruited to playkeyboardsand provide backing vocals on Björk's first international solotourin 1993 in support ofDebut. In 1995, Björk recalled Arab for her second touring band for tour in support ofPost. This time, Arab was given her first opportunity to experiment with live output mixing from the stage rather than playing keyboards. This would later form the basis of Arab's own solo music career, in which she has integrated live mixing into her own compositions and live shows. Arab went on to release three international solo albums throughout the 1990s and appears on the influentialelectronicalabelsRephlex Records,XL RecordingsandWarp Records.[313]
In 1998, Björk established her own short-lived record label, Ear Records, which operated under theOne Little Indian Recordsumbrella. Her only signee that received a release was her longtime friend Magga Stína, who recorded her debut solo album under the production of Björk's longtime collaboratorGraham Massey(of the British electronica act808 State). The album was simply titledAn Albumand featured just one single release, "Naturally". In 1998, Björk invited Magga to perform as her support act on the Homogenic tour, and in 2004 Magga contributed to the production ofMedúlla. Magga still performs and records in Iceland.
In 2001, Björk became aware of CanadianInuk throat singerTanya Tagaqand invited her to perform on several dates of Björk'sVespertine world touras a special guest. In 2004, Tagaq was invited to collaborate on thea cappellaalbumMedúlla, in which the duet "Ancestors" was recorded. "Ancestors" was later featured on Tagaq's first solo album,Sinaa, in 2005.
In 2004, Arab discovered the work of Finnish multimedia artist Heidi Kilpeläinen, who had taken her combination oflo-fi, homemadeelectropop with her own self-producedmusic videosand combined them under thealter egocharacterHK119.

In his first of three film appearances in 1996, Dafoe made a cameo appearance as an electrician in the biographical dramaBasquiat.[51]Next, he played an operative in the romantic war dramaThe English Patient.The English Patientwas filmed inTuscany, where Dafoe said he particularly enjoyed the "quiet moments in the monastery between shoots".[52]In the period dramaVictory—which was filmed in 1994 and premiered in Europe in 1996, but was not released until 1998—Dafoe played a European living on an island in the Southeast Asia who becomes the target of redemption after preventing a woman, played byIrène Jacob, from being raped.[53]
"I really made a conscious effort to mix it up, not because in itself it's not the job of an actor to do all different things, but for me that's what I'm interested in. You've got to be careful because you've got to work with what you have, not just for vanity's sake, but I think the best part of being an actor sometimes is the opportunity to transform yourself superficially, and deeply."
In 1997, Dafoe returned to playing a villainous role in the action thrillerSpeed 2: Cruise Control, expressing the necessity of appearing in both independent andblockbusterfilms.[55]The film starredSandra BullockandJason Patricas a couple vacationing on a luxury cruise that has been hijacked by Dafoe's character, Geiger, a hacker that has programmed the ship to crash into an oil tanker.Speed 2was met with negative reviews from critics,[56]with Dafoe himself receiving aRazzie Awardnomination forWorst Supporting Actor.[57]For his next film,Affliction(1997), Dafoe worked with Paul Schrader for a second time, playing the brother ofNick Nolte's character and served as the film's narrator.[58]Also in 1997, Dafoe took on a voice acting role in an episode of the animated sitcomThe Simpsonstitled "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", voicing the commandant of a military academy thatBartandLisa Simpsonare attending.[59]Following a villainous supporting role in the romantic mystery dramaLulu on the Bridge,[60]Dafoe starred alongsideChristopher WalkenandAsia ArgentoinAbel Ferrara'scyberpunkdramaNew Rose Hotelin 1998.

Much of the film's critical praise went to Dafoe; Roger Ebert wrote that Dafoe "embodies the Schreck ofNosferatuso uncannily that when real scenes from the silent classic are slipped into the frame, we don't notice a difference".[69]TheChicago ReadercriticJonathan Rosenbaumfelt the film's "only redeeming quality" was Dafoe's "enjoyably over-the-top, eye-rolling performance".[70]Dafoe received numerous awards and nominations for his performance, including his secondAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actornomination.[71]Dafoe took on two leading roles in 2001, both of which were as priests.

O. Scottwrote that his performance was "uninspired and secondhand".[77]IGN'sRichard George commented that Green Goblin's armor, particularly the helmet, was "almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression".[78]Steven Scaife atVicewrote that Dafoe's Goblin "represents everything that's fun about superhero villains, as well as everything that's great about Raimi's campy films", also commending Dafoe's voice and body language, which helped overcome the bulky Green Goblin costume that he compared to that of aPower Rangersvillain.[79]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
