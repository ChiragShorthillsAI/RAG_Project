In a smallItalianvillage in 1895, a vagrant cricket namedJiminy Cricketenters the home of a widowed elderly woodcarver namedGeppetto, who lives with his pet kitten Figaro and goldfish Cleo. Geppetto has completed work on apuppetbased on his young deceased son, which he namesPinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes awish on a star. Later that night, the star magically brings Pinocchio to life and he is soon visited by theBlue Fairywho tells him that if he acts brave, truthful and selfless, he can be a real boy. The Blue Fairy appoints Jiminy the responsibility of being Pinocchio's conscience to teach him right from wrong. When Geppetto awakens and finds Pinocchio alive, he is at first shocked, but becomes overjoyed.
After a few days, Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school. The fox con-artist,"Honest" John, and his cat partner, Gideon, soon approach Pinocchio. He convinces Pinocchio that he should live a life of fame to truly be a real boy when he really plans to sell him to the puppet masterStromboli. With the help of aseagullnamed Sofia, Jiminy convinces Pinocchio to go to school, but theheadmasterthrows Pinocchio out of the school because he is a puppet. Pinocchio decides to go to Stromboli's after all while Honest John places a glass jar over Jiminy. Geppetto, Figaro, and Cleo go out to look for Pinocchio when he fails to come home for dinner. At Stromboli's theater, Pinocchio befriends one of Stromboli's employees, Fabiana and her puppet Sabina. Pinocchio puts on a good show for the crowd, but Stromboli locks him in abird cageto prevent him from ever leaving. Stromboli's coach ends up freeing Jiminy from the jar and Pinocchio has him reach the keys for the cage's lock by telling lies to make his nose grow longer.
Soon, Pinocchio is swiped up by a coach full of children driven by a charismaticCoachman, who is taking them toPleasure Island, where misbehavior is encouraged. Once there, Pinocchio is disturbed by some of the brutality the kids display, but befriends an irresponsible boy namedLampwickand manages to enjoy some of the attractions. Later on, Jiminy finds that all of the children have turned into donkeys and that the Coachman sells them to the salt mines with help from hisVapor Monsters. Pinocchio witnesses Lampwick's transformation at abilliard hallas Pinocchio gains a donkey's ears and tail. Pinocchio and Jiminy escape the island before the Coachman and his goons can get them.
Pinocchio and Jiminy make it back to Geppetto's, but find that Sofia gave him a flyer of Pleasure Island to let him know where Pinocchio was and that he sold all of his clocks to buy a boat to go there. Pinocchio reunites with Fabiana and Sabina who tell him that Stromboli has been arrested by theCarabinierilast night for cruelty against his employees, and they have taken over his puppet show. They offer Pinocchio to join them, but Pinocchio declines, wanting to save his father, which makes his donkey parts disappear. Sofia pulls a rope for Pinocchio to hold out to theMediterranean Sea, where they soon find Geppetto in his boat. Just as they reunite, they are swallowed by a giantsea monsternamedMonstro. They take refuge in a giant boat in Monstro's stomach and Pinocchio gets the idea to make him sneeze by starting a fire within him. The plan works, and Monstro sneezes them out, but he gives chase that ends with the group crashing on dry land and apparently killing Geppetto.
Believing his father has died, Pinocchio mourns over him and a magical tear falls from his eye on Geppetto, reviving him. Geppetto tells Pinocchio that despite being a puppet, he has proven himself to be a true boy at heart. As Pinocchio and Geppetto depart for home, Jiminy narrates that stories have been told of Pinocchio becoming a real boy, but doesn't confirm them (even as Pinocchio's limbs appear to turn human), stressing that, in his heart, Pinocchio is already a real boy.
Non-speaking animal characters include Geppetto's petkittenFigaro andgoldfishCleo, andMonstro, an enormous, chimericsea monsterwho devours anything that crosses his path.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 27% of 179 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The website's consensus reads: "Visually dazzling but soulless, the largely inertPinocchioreaffirms that you should always let your conscience be your guide… away from unnecessary remakes."[41]Metacriticassigned the film a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[42]
Adrian Horton ofThe Guardiangave the film three out of five stars, saying, "A live-action take on the classic animation has effective visual moments and an impactful turn from Tom Hanks but never quite justifies its existence."[43]Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film three stars out of four, writing, "Every frame ofPinocchiois filled with rich and lush detail — at times this almost looks like a 3-D film — and the performances, whether live action or voiced, are universally excellent."[44]Danny Leigh of theFinancial Timesthought that "The animation is now so hyper-advanced, the landscape of the movie so eerily both this and that, it is easy to get confused about where reality stops and ones and zeros take over."[45]Jennifer Green ofCommon Sense Mediagave the film three out of five stars and felt it "boasts an impressive mix of CGI animation and live actors and settings, but the final product feels a little jumbled".[46]
Amy Nicholson ofThe New York Timeswas critical of the script: "Geppetto [sings] about his freshly concocted dead son. Someone wished to burden the old whittler with more motivation, and tacked on a dead wife to boot."[47]Christy LemireofRogerEbert.comcalled Key's performance "by far the film's highlight", but felt other updates to the story "too often feel empty and add no insight".[48]Alex Godfrey ofEmpiregave the film two stars out of five, saying, "It's hard to invest much in Geppetto and Pinocchio's relationship when they spend barely any time together. Ultimately, it's all a bit flat, and feels like an exercise. It exists because it can."[49]In a "C" review, Christian Zilko ofIndieWirewrote, "While the original story remains undeniably excellent,Pinocchiofails at re-telling it because it ignores its own advice. ... If Disney truly believed that timeless virtue and character were more important than having a shiny new exterior, this remake would never have been made."[50]Patrick Cremona of theRadio Timesthought it "never does enough to justify its own existence, failing to improve on the tremendous 1940 animation in any meaningful way."[51]Andrew Barker ofVarietywas similarly negative, saying, "There may be no strings on thisPinocchio, but there isn't much of a heart in him either."[52]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle. Its first film appearance was with the release ofStrange World.[60]The logo received widespread praise from critics and audiences and won Gold in the "Theatrical | Film: Design" medium at the 2023Clio Entertainment Awardsin November 2023. The standard version of the logo premiered theatrically withThe Beach Boys.[61]

In the early 1990s, Zemeckis signed a production deal withUniversal Pictures, to release films under the South Side Amusement Company banner. There, it is one of the producers ofDeath Becomes Her,Trespass,The Public Eye,The FrightenersandContact.
In 1997, it was announced that South Side Amusement Company was rebranded as ImageMovers, and hiredCreative Artists AgencyemployeeJack Rapkeand producerSteve Starkey(who was a producer on Zemeckis's films since his stint as associate producer on 1988'sWho Framed Roger Rabbit) came on board to join the company. It was also announced that ImageMovers signed a non-exclusive feature film deal withDreamWorks Pictures.[2]
In 2001, ImageMovers tried to sign a deal withWarner Bros., but they ultimately failed.[3]After the Warner Bros. deal collapsed, ImageMovers reupped a first-look deal withDreamWorksto produce more films from that time.[4][5]
ImageMovers's first eight films under the name wereWhat Lies Beneath(withHarrison FordandMichelle Pfeiffer),Cast Away(withTom Hanks),Matchstick Men(withNicolas Cage),The Polar Express(also withTom Hanks),The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio(withJulianne Moore),Last Holiday(withQueen Latifah),Monster House(withMitchel Musso,Sam Lerner,Spencer Locke, andSteve Buscemi), andBeowulf(withRay Winstone,Anthony Hopkins,John Malkovich,Robin Wright Penn, andAngelina Jolie).
In 2007, ImageMovers andThe Walt Disney Companyset up ajoint ventureanimation facility known asImageMovers Digital, based inMarin County-based film company whereZemeckiswould produce and direct3Danimated films using CGIperformance-capturetechnology.[6]
On November 6, 2009, ImageMovers Digital released their first CGI filmA Christmas Carol, a CGI performance capture film based on theCharles Dickensbook of the same nameand starringJim Carrey,Gary Oldman,Colin FirthandCary Elwes. On March 12, 2010, Disney and ImageMovers announced that ImageMovers Digital would close operations by January 2011 after movie production onMars Needs Momswas completed. Resulting in a lay-off of approximately 450 employees,[7]Walt Disney Studios president Alan Bergman said, "...given today's economic realities, we need to find alternative ways to bring creative content to audiences and IMD no longer fits into our business model."[8]The company had previously been reported to haveCalling All Robots,[9]a remake ofYellow Submarine,[10]aRoger Rabbitsequel[11]andThe Nutcracker[12]in development. Disney dropped all of these projects following the box-office failure ofMars Needs Moms.[13]
In August 2011, it was announced that ImageMovers has entered a two-year first-look producing deal withUniversal Pictures.[14]
ImageMovers's first foray into television production wasThe Borgias, which aired onShowtimefrom 2011 to 2013. On August 25, 2016, Compari Entertainment, the company's television division, was founded, withNBC'sManifest, which premiered on September 24, 2018, as their first television series.[18]
Thismotion captureremake ofthe 1968 Beatles filmwas developed byRobert Zemeckis. Disney canceled the project due to the box office failure of the Zemeckis-produced motion capture filmMars Needs Momsand aesthetic concerns about the technology.[24]After its cancellation at Disney, Zemeckis then tried to pitch the film to other studios, before eventually losing interest in the project.[25]
On March 26, 2008,Michael Doughertywas set to direct the animated sci-fi adventure filmCalling All Robotswith Zemeckis producing the film throughImageMovers DigitalforWalt Disney Pictures.[26]
In December 2007, Marshall stated that he was still "open" to the idea,[27]and in April 2009, Zemeckis revealed he was still interested.[28]According to a 2009MTV Newsstory, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were writing a new script for the project, and the animated characters would be in traditional two-dimensional, while the rest would be inmotion capture.[29]However, in 2010, Zemeckis said that the sequel would remain hand-drawn animated and live-action sequences will be filmed, just like in the original film, but the lighting effects on the cartoon characters and some of the props that the toons handle will be done digitally.[30]Also in 2010, Hahn, who was the film's original associate producer, confirmed the sequel's development in an interview withEmpire. He stated, "Yeah, I couldn't possibly comment. I deny completely, but yeah... if you're a fan, pretty soon you're going to be very, very, very happy."[31]In 2010,Bob Hoskinsstated he was interested in the project, reprising his role as Eddie Valiant.[citation needed]However, he retired from acting in 2012 after being diagnosed withParkinson's diseasea year earlier, and died frompneumoniain 2014.[32]Marshall confirmed that the film would be a prequel, similar to earlier drafts, and that the writing was almost complete.[33]During an interview at the premiere ofFlight, Zemeckis stated that the sequel was still possible, despite Hoskins' absence, and the script for the sequel was sent to Disney for approval from studio executives.[34]
On November 26, 2009, Zemeckis had signed on to produce and direct the motion capture animated film adaptation ofE.T.A. Hoffmann’sThe NutcrackerthroughImageMovers DigitalforWalt Disney Pictures.[35]On July 21, 2016,Universal Picturesrevived the adaptation, which may or may not use motion capture, with Zemeckis only set to produce the film andEvan Spiliotopouloswas hired to write the script.[36]There has been no information since.
On April 14, 2011, Zemeckis had signed on to produce and potentially direct the live-action/animated hybrid film adaptation of Chuck Sambuchino's bookHow to Survive a Garden Gnome Attackalong withThe Gotham GroupandSony Pictures Animation.[37]In November that year, Chad Damiani and JP Lavin were hired to write the script.[38]

Robert Lee Zemeckis(born May 14, 1952)[3]is an American filmmaker known for directing and producing a range of successful and influential movies, often blending cutting-edgevisual effectswith storytelling. He has received several accolades including anAcademy Awardand aGolden Globe Award, as well as nominations for fiveBritish Academy Film Awardsand aDaytime Emmy Award.
Zemeckis started his career directing the comedy filmsI Wanna Hold Your Hand(1978),Used Cars(1980), andRomancing the Stone(1984). He gained prominence directing the science-fiction comedyBack to the Futuretrilogy (1985–1990), the fantasy comedyWho Framed Roger Rabbit(1988), and the comedy-dramaForrest Gump(1994), the latter of which wonAcademy AwardsforBest PictureandBest Director.[4]
He has also directed the satirical black comedyDeath Becomes Her(1992), the science fiction filmContact(1997), and the drama filmsCast Away(2000),Flight(2012),The Walk(2015), andAllied(2016). His exploration ofmotion capturetechniques can be seen in the animated filmsThe Polar Express(2004) andA Christmas Carol(2009) as well as the action fantasy dramaBeowulf(2007), and the dramaWelcome to Marwen(2018). He has collaborated with film composerAlan Silvestrisince 1984, and directedTom Hanksin five films.
Robert Lee Zemeckis was born on May 14, 1952, inChicago,[5]the son of Rosa (née Nespeca)[6]and Alphonse Zemeckis.[7]His father wasLithuanian-Americanwhile his mother wasItalian-American.[6]His father's parents, Kazimieras Žemeckas (1877–1960) and Marijona Dantaitė-Žemeckienė (1887–1945), were born inLithuaniaand later emigrated to theUnited States.[8]
Zemeckis grew up on theSouth Sideof the city in aworking classfamily.[9][8]He attended aCatholicgrade school andFenger Academy High School.[10]Zemeckis has said "the truth was that in my family there was no art. I mean, there was no music, there were no books, there was no theater ... The only thing I had that was inspirational, was television—and it actually was."[10]
As a child, he loved television and was fascinated by his parents'8 mm filmhome movie camera. Starting off by filming family events like birthdays and holidays, he gradually began producing narrative films with his friends that incorporatedstop-motionwork and other visual effects. Along with enjoying movies, Zemeckis remained an avid TV viewer. "You hear so much about the problems with television," he said, "but I think that it saved my life." Television gave Zemeckis his first glimpse of a world outside of his blue-collar upbringing;[10]specifically, he learned of the existence offilm schoolson an episode ofThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.
After seeingBonnie and Clydewith his father,[11]Zemeckis decided that he wanted to go to film school. His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, "But only in the sense that they were concerned ... for my family and my friends and the world that I grew up in, this was the kind of dream that really was impossible. My parents would sit there and say, 'Don't you see where you come from? You can't be a movie director.' I guess maybe some of it I felt I had to do in spite of them, too."[10]
Zemeckis first attendedNorthern Illinois Universityin DeKalb, Illinois, and gained early experience in film as a film cutter for NBC News in Chicago during a summer break.[12]He also edited commercials in his home state.[13]Zemeckis applied to transfer from NIU to theUniversity of Southern California'sSchool of Cinematic Artsin Los Angeles, California, and went into the Film School on the strength of an essay and a music video based onThe Beatlessong. Not having heard from the university itself, Zemeckis called and was told he had been rejected because of his average grades. He gave an "impassioned plea" to the official on the other line, promising to go to summer school and improve his studies, and eventually convinced the school to accept him.
Arriving at USC that fall, Zemeckis encountered a program that was, in his words, made up of "a bunch of hippies [and] considered an embarrassment by the university". The classes were difficult, with professors constantly stressing how hard the movie business was. Zemeckis remembered not being much fazed by this, citing the "healthy cynicism" that had been bred into him from his Chicago upbringing.[10]At USC Zemeckis met a fellow student, writerBob Gale. Gale later recalled, "The graduate students at USC had this veneer of intellectualism ... So Bob and I gravitated toward one another because we wanted to make Hollywood movies. We weren't interested in theFrench New Wave. We were interested inClint EastwoodandJames BondandWalt Disney, because that's how we grew up."[14]Zemeckis graduated from USC in 1973,[15]and he and Gale cowrote the unproduced screenplaysTankandBordello of Blood, which they pitched toJohn Milius, the latter of which was later developed into a film which was released in 1996.[16][17][18]
As a result of winning aStudent Academy Awardat USC for his filmA Field of Honor,[19]Zemeckis came to the attention ofSteven Spielberg. Spielberg said, "He barged right past my secretary and sat me down and showed me this student film ... and I thought it was spectacular, with police cars and a riot, all dubbed toElmer Bernstein's score forThe Great Escape."[14]Spielberg became Zemeckis's mentor and executive produced his first two films, both of which Gale and Zemeckis co-wrote.
Spielberg producedI Wanna Hold Your Hand(1978, starringNancy Allen) andUsed Cars(1980, starringKurt Russell); both were critical, but not commercial, successes.I Wanna Hold Your Handwas the first of several Zemeckis films to incorporate historic figures and celebrities into his movies; he used archival footage and doubles to simulate the presence of the Beatles. After the failure of his first two films, and the Spielberg-directed1941(1979) (written by Gale and Zemeckis), the pair gained a reputation for writing "scripts that everyone thought were great [but] somehow didn't translate into movies people wanted to see."[14]
As a result of his reputation within the industry, Zemeckis had trouble finding work in the early 1980s, though he and Gale kept busy. They wrote scripts for other directors, includingCar PoolforBrian De PalmaandGrowing Upfor Spielberg; neither ended up getting made. Another Zemeckis-Gale project,Back to the Future, about a teenager who travels back in time to the 1950s, was turned down by every major studio.[20]The director was jobless untilMichael Douglashired him in 1984 to directRomancing the Stone. A romantic adventure starring Douglas andKathleen Turner,Stonewas expected to flop (to the point that, after viewing a rough cut of the film, the producers of the then-in-the-worksCocoonfired Zemeckis as director),[20]but the film became a sleeper hit. While working onRomancing the Stone, Zemeckis met composerAlan Silvestri, who has scored all his subsequent pictures.
AfterRomancing the Stone, Zemeckis had the clout to direct his time-traveling screenplay. StarringMichael J. Fox,Lea Thompson,Crispin Glover, andChristopher Lloyd, the 1985 film was wildly successful upon its release and was followed by two sequels, released asBack to the Future Part IIin 1989 andBack to the Future Part IIIin 1990. Before theBack to the Futuresequels were released, Zemeckis collaborated with Disney and directed another film, the madcap 1940s-set mysteryWho Framed Roger Rabbit, which combinedlive-actionandtraditional animation; its $70 million budget made it one of the most expensive films made up to that point. The film was both a financial and critical success and won threeAcademy Awards. In 1990, Zemeckis commented, when asked if he would want to make non-comedies, "I would like to be able to do everything. Just now, though, I'm too restless to do anything that's not really zany."[20]
In 1992, Zemeckis directed the black comedyDeath Becomes Her, starringMeryl Streep,Goldie Hawn, andBruce Willis. Although his next film would have some comedic elements, it was Zemeckis's first with dramatic elements and was also his biggest commercial success to date,Forrest Gump. StarringTom Hanksin the title role,Forrest Gumptells the story of a man with a lowI.Q., who unwittingly participates in some of the major events of the twentieth century, falls in love, and interacts with several major historical figures in the process. The film grossed $677 million worldwide and became the top-grossing US film of 1994; it won six Academy Awards, includingBest Picture,Best Actor(for Hanks) andBest Director(for Zemeckis). From this point, Hanks and Zemeckis became frequent collaborators.[21][22]In 1997, Zemeckis directedContact, a long-gestating project based onCarl Sagan's 1985novel of the same name. The film centers on Eleanor Arroway (Jodie Foster), who believes she has made contact with extraterrestrials. In the early 1990s, he founded South Side Amusement Company, which later becameImageMovers.[23]
During this same time period, Zemeckis was an executive producer ofHBO'sTales from the Crypt(1989–1996) and directed three episodes. In 1999, Zemeckis donated $5 million towards the Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts at USC, a 35,000-square-foot (3,300 m2) center. When the Center opened in March 2001, Zemeckis spoke in a panel about the future of film, alongside friends Steven Spielberg andGeorge Lucas. Of those (including Spielberg) who clung to celluloid and disparaged the idea of shooting digitally, Zemeckis said, "These guys are the same ones who have been saying thatLPssound better than CDs. You can argue that until you're blue in the face, but I don't know anyone who's still buying vinyl. The film, as we have traditionally thought of it, is going to be different. But the continuum is man's desire to tell stories around the campfire. The only thing that keeps changing is the campfire."[24]The Robert Zemeckis Center currently hosts many film school classes, much of theInteractive Media Division, andTrojan Vision, USC's student television station, which has been voted the number one college television station in the country.
In 1996, Zemeckis had begun developing a project titledThe CastawaywithTom Hanksand writerWilliam Broyles Jr.The story, inspired byRobinson Crusoe, is about a man who becomes stranded on a tropical island and undergoes a profound physical and spiritual change.[25]While working onThe Castaway, Zemeckis also became attached to aHitchcockianthriller titledWhat Lies Beneath, the story of a married couple experiencing an extreme case ofempty nest syndromethat was based on an idea by Steven Spielberg.[26]Because Hanks's character needed to undergo a dramatic weight loss over the course ofThe Castaway(retitledCast Awayfor release), Zemeckis decided that the only way to retain the same crew while Hanks lost the weight was to shootWhat Lies Beneathin between. He shot the first part ofCast Awayin early 1999, and shotWhat Lies Beneathin fall 1999, completing work on the former in early 2000.[26]Zemeckis later quipped, when asked about shooting two films back-to-back, "I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."[25]What Lies Beneath, starringHarrison FordandMichelle Pfeiffer, was released in July 2000 to mixed reviews, but did well at the box office, grossing over $155 million domestically.Cast Away, starring Hanks andTwisteractressHelen Hunt, was released that December and grossed $233 million domestically;[27]Hanks received an Oscar nomination forBest Actorfor his portrayal of Chuck Noland.
In 2004, Zemeckis re-collaborated with Hanks forThe Polar Express, based onChris Van Allsburg'schildren's book of the same name.The Polar Expressutilized thecomputer animationtechnique known asmotion capture, where the movements of the actors are captured digitally and used as the basis for the animated characters. As the very first film to use motion capture,The Polar ExpresscausedThe New York Timesto write that, "Whatever critics and audiences make of this movie, from a technical perspective it could mark a turning point in the gradual transition from an analog to a digital cinema."[28]Zemeckis served as an executive producer forMonster House(2006), a family-friendly horror comedy that used motion capture.[29]
In February 2007, Zemeckis andWalt Disney StudioschairmanDick Cookannounced plans for a new motion capture film company devoted to CGI-created, 3-D movies.[30]The company,ImageMovers Digital, created films using the motion capture technology, with Zemeckis directing most of the projects which Disney distributed and marketed worldwide. Zemeckis used the motion capture technology again in his film,Beowulf, to retell the Anglo-Saxonepic poem of the same name. It featuredRay Winstone,Angelina Jolie, andAnthony Hopkins.Neil Gaiman, who co-wrote the adaptation withRoger Avary, described the film as a "cheerfully violent and strange take on the Beowulf legend."[31]The film was released on November 16, 2007, to mostly positive reviews and grossed $196 million worldwide. In July 2007,Varietyannounced that Zemeckis had written a screenplay forA Christmas Carol, based onCharles Dickens's 1843short story of the same name, with plans to use motion capture and release it under the aegis of ImageMovers Digital. Zemeckis wrote the script withJim Carreyin mind, and Carrey agreed to play a multitude of roles in the film, includingEbenezer Scroogeas a young, middle-aged, and old man, and the three ghosts who haunt Scrooge.[32]The film began production in February 2008 and was released on November 6, 2009, to mixed reviews[33]and grossed $325 million at the box office. ActorGary Oldmanalso appeared in the film.[34]Zemeckis is an avid supporter of 3-D Digital Cinema and has stated that since the 3-D presentations ofBeowulf, all of his future films would be done in 3-D using digitalmotion capture. He has reportedly backed away from that statement and said that the decision to use 3-D will be on a film-by-film basis.[citation needed]
On August 19, 2009, it was reported that Zemeckis and his company were in talks withApple Corps Ltd.to remake the animated filmYellow Submarineutilizing motion capture. However, on March 12, 2010, with Zemeckis's biggest Disney ally, former chairman Dick Cook, gone, and amid drastic cost-cutting by the new management team, Disney announced that it was ending its relationship with ImageMovers Digital.[35]The studio's final film, 2011's Zemeckis-producedMars Needs Moms, was the second-worst box office failure in history, with a net loss of roughly $130 million. Zemeckis made his comeback to live-action filmmaking withFlight, a 2012 drama for Paramount, starringDenzel Washington. On January 31, 2014, it was announced that astagemusicaladaptation of Zemeckis's firstBack to the Futurefilm was in production.[36]The show would be co-written by original writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale.[37]According to Gale, the musical would be "true to the spirit of the film without being a slavish remake".[38]
In August 2008,IGNrevealed in an interview withPhilippe Petitthat Zemeckis was working with Petit to turn Petit's memoirTo Reach the Cloudsinto a feature film.[39]In 2015, he directedThe Walk, about Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his ambition to tightrope walk between the towers of New York City's World Trade Center.Paramount PicturesandNew Regencyannounced in February 2015 that Zemeckis would directBrad PittinAllied, a romantic thriller set during World War II.[40]The film was released on November 23, 2016. Next, Zemeckis directed the fantasy dramaWelcome to Marwen, starringSteve Carell, which was released in December 2018 to mixed reviews and flopped at the box office.[41]Zemeckis's filmThe Witches, an adaptation of the Roald Dahlnovel of the same name, premiered on October 22, 2020, onHBO Max, also to mixed reviews.[42]
On October 18, 2019, it was announced that Zemeckis is in talks to direct Disney'slive-action adaptationofPinocchio.[43]Zemeckis was officially announced as the film's director and co-writer of the script in January 2020.[44]In addition,Tom Hankswas reportedly announced as playingMister Geppettoin the film, marking the fourth collaboration with Hanks sinceForrest Gump,Cast Away, andThe Polar Express.[45]The film was later released, as part ofDisney+ DayonDisney+, on September 8, 2022, to highly negative reviews from critics, nominated for sixRazzies, includingWorst PictureandWorst Directorfor Zemeckis ("winning"Worst Remake), losing toBlonde. Despite this, it also received aVisual Effects Society Awardnomination for Outstanding Animated Character in a Photoreal Feature.
On February 17, 2022, Zemeckis signed on to directHere, an adaptation of thegraphic novelbyRichard McGuire, withTom Hanksset to star andForrest GumpscreenwriterEric Rothworking on the screenplay with Zemeckis.[46]On May 11, it was announced thatRobin Wrighthad been cast and thatTriStar Pictureshad acquired distribution rights for the United States, withMiramaxhandling international sales and production expected to begin in September 2022 for a theatrical release in 2024.[47]On October 31, 2024, Zemeckis, during an appearance on Josh Horowitz'sHappy Sad Confusedpodcast to promoteHere, hinted at his plans to produce and direct a film adaptation of the stage musical version ofBack to the Futurethat would also serve as a remake of the original film. Universal has yet to green-light the project after an initial rejection of Zemeckis' pitch to the studio.[48]
Zemeckis is regarded as an innovator invisual effects.[49][50]His exploration of state-of-the-art visual effects includes the early use ofcomputer graphics inserted into live-action footageinBack to the Future Part II(1989) andForrest Gump, the insertion of hand-drawn animation into live-action footage inWho Framed Roger Rabbit, and themotion capturetechniques seen inThe Polar Express(2004),Beowulf(2007),A Christmas Carol(2009), andWelcome to Marwen(2018). He is known for his collaboration with composerAlan Silvestri, with whom he has worked sinceRomancing the Stone.David Thomson, a prominent film critic, wrote that "no other contemporary director has used visual effects to more dramatic and narrative purpose."[5]
Zemeckis has said that, for a long time, he sacrificed his personal life in favor of a career. "I won an Academy Award when I was [42] years old," he explained, "but I paid for it with my 20s. That decade of my life from film school till 30 was nothing but work, nothing but absolute, driving work. I had no money. I had no life."[10]In the early 1980s, Zemeckis married actressMary Ellen Trainor, with whom he had a son, Alexander Francis.[citation needed]He described the marriage as difficult to balance with filmmaking,[10]and his relationship with Trainor eventually ended in divorce. On December 4, 2001, he married Leslie Harter, an actress,[51]with whom he has three children.[7][52][53]
Zemeckis is aprivate pilotwho has logged approximately 1,600 hours of flight time, as of October 2012[update],[54]flying aCirrus SR22.[55]

Christopher John Weitz(/waɪts/; born November 30, 1969) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, and actor. He is best known for his work with his brotherPaulon the comedy filmsAmerican PieandAbout a Boy; the latter earned the Weitz brothers a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.[1]Among his other main works, Weitz directedthe film adaptationof the novelThe Golden Compassand thefilm adaptationofNew Moonfrom the series ofTwilightbooks, wrote the screenplay for Disney's 2015 live-action adaptation ofCinderella, and co-wroteRogue OnewithTony Gilroy.
Weitz was born inNew York City, the son of actressSusan Kohnerand Berlin-born novelist/menswear designerJohn Weitz.[2]His brother is filmmakerPaul Weitz. Weitz is the grandson ofCzech-born agent and producerPaul Kohnerand actressLupita Tovaron his maternal side.[3][4]Tovar, who was fromOaxaca,Mexico,[5]starred inSanta,Mexico's firsttalkie, in 1932, as well as a Spanish language version ofDrácula.[6]Weitz' paternal grandparents escapedNazi Germany, before which his grandfather was a successful textile manufacturer, with the family being intimates of writerChristopher Isherwoodand actressMarlene Dietrich.[4]
Weitz's father and maternal grandfather wereJewish,[7][8][9][10][11]whereas his maternal grandmother wasCatholic; he was raised in a nonreligious household.[12][13]He has also described himself as a "lapsed Catholic crypto-Buddhist."[14]
As a young boy, Weitz attendedAllen-Stevenson Schoolwith his brother and was a member of theKnickerbocker Greys, a long-standingNew York Cityyouth marching corps that has been in existence since 1881.[1]
When he was 14 years old, Weitz went to the boarding schoolSt Paul's Schoolin London, which his father had attended.[1]He graduated with a degree in English fromTrinity College, Cambridge.[12]
Weitz' early career involved many collaborations with his brother.[15][16][17]Some of the work they have done as screenwriters has been both credited and uncredited.[18]
Weitz began his film career as a co-writer on the animated filmAntz(1998). He followed this with work on various sitcoms such asOff Centreandthe 1998 revivalofthe 1977 TV seriesFantasy Island. In 1999, he and Paul directed and producedAmerican Pie, which was written byAdam Herz, and became a major box office success. Weitz returned as executive producer on the film's two theatrical sequels. In 2001, along with his brother, he co-directed his second film, the Chris Rock comedyDown to Earth.
In 2002, the Weitz brothers co-wrote and co-directedAbout a Boy, theHugh Grantfilm based on the book byNick Hornby.[19][20]The film was originally set up atNew Line CinemawithRobert De Niroproducing, and the main character as an American. The brothers felt that it was important that the character is British. Inspiration came from the 1960 filmThe Apartment.They were nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.[6]
Weitz has produced a number of films includingIn Good CompanyandAmerican Dreamz, both of which were directed by his brother, Paul.
In 2003, Weitz was hired to directNew Line Cinema's adaptation of the first book inPhilip Pullman'sHis Dark Materialsseries,The Golden Compass, after approaching the studio with an unsolicited 40-page treatment. He was subsequently invited by directorPeter Jacksonto visit the set ofKing Kong, in order to gain insight into directing a big-budget film and advice on how to deal with New Line. In 2005, Weitz announced his departure from the film, citing the enormous technical challenges involved, and the fear of being denounced by both the book's fans and detractors;[21]he was subsequently replaced by British directorAnand Tucker. Tucker left the project in 2006 over creative differences with New Line, and Weitz returned to the director's chair after receiving a letter from Pullman asking him to reconsider.
Duringpost-production, New Line had Weitz'seditorreplaced, and the studio made the final cut with severe differences from Weitz's vision, trimming the originally unhappy ending and watering down the religious theme.[22]Weitz stated:
The film was released in 2007 and was met with mixed reviews. Its U.S. grosses have been described as disappointing[24]in relation to film's US$180 million budget, although it was a "stellar performer" outside the U.S. with a "stunning" box office likely to hit $250 million.[25]When questioned about a possible sequel, New Line studio co-headMichael Lynnesaid that "The jury is still very much out on the movie..."[26]The second and third screenplays have been written but because of the economic recession and the protest by the Catholic Church, the two sequels never got made and was later rebooted into atelevision seriesthat was released in 2019. Its worldwide box office gross stands at $372,234,864.[27]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
