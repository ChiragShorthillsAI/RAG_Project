It was released onNetflixon September 16, 2022, and received generally positive reviews from critics.
Robinson pays homage to several1990shigh school films and other teen classics such asHeathers(1989)  andMean Girls(2004).[3][4]
Drea is a popular student attending Rosehill Country Day High School, an elite private school in Miami, on a scholarship. A "conniving, selfish sociopath" who uses people to get what she wants, Drea later becomes a social outcast after anintimate videoshe sent to her equally popular boyfriend, Max, is leaked online. Max claims he was hacked, but Drea blames Max for thevideo's releaseand punches him in the face, ultimately leading to their break up.
That summer, Drea works at a tennis camp where she meets Eleanor, a shy tomboy from a wealthy background who is transferring to Rosehill in September. Eleanor tells Drea about also becoming an outcast when a false rumor spread that she forcibly kissed Carissa, another Rosehill student, at a summer camp years earlier.
Realizing they will not get justice on their own, the two plan to exact revenge on each other's enemy: Drea on Carissa and Eleanor on Max. After a makeover, Eleanor slowly infiltrates Drea's old clique of popular students, while Drea tries to get close to Carissa by working at the school farm, also befriending Russ, an unpopular student and Carissa's friend.
Eleanor is invited to a party thrown by Max, where she discovers he is cheating on his new girlfriend, Tara – Drea's former best friend. Drea steals Carissa's keys to the farm's locked greenhouse, finding themarijuanaandmagic mushroomsthat Carissa is storing.
At the school's Senior Ring Ceremony, Drea places the drugs from the greenhouse in their classmates' dinner so she can steal Max's phone to obtain evidence of his wrongdoings. She anonymously tips off the headmaster about the greenhouse, getting Carissa expelled and sent to rehab. While searching through Max's texts messages, Drea and Eleanor find photos and messages from other girls at school stretching back years.
At a school assembly, Eleanor shares Max's texts to the entire student body, but Max and Tara then pretend to be apolyamorouscouple, which in turn becomes the school's latest trend. Drea is rejected fromYale, due to her declining schoolwork and Max creating a false allegation about Drea abusing him during their relationship. Spiraling emotionally, she concocts a new plan to destroy all her popular former friends at the upcoming Admissions Party, which can only be attended by those accepted byIvy Leagueschools.
Eleanor enjoys her new popularity and Drea's old friends, beginning a relationship with Max's twin sister Gabbi. When Max and his friends surprise Eleanor for her birthday, Drea crashes the party and nearly jeopardizes their revenge scheme. They fight, going their separate ways after Eleanor asserts that there is no evidence that Max leaked Drea's video. Gabbi overhears this and breaks up with Eleanor for taking Max's side.
Learning someone sabotaged her car at tennis camp, Drea, suspicious of Eleanor, visits Carissa at the rehab facility. Carissa reveals that Eleanor is actually "Nosey" Nora Cutler, the girl at summer camp whom Drea spread the false rumor about andoutedas alesbian; an event she had selfishly forgotten, which prompted Eleanor to change her name and undergo arhinoplasty. Drea confronts Eleanor, who reveals she had been playing her all along, aiming to cause the same pain she endured from the rumor. Eleanor threatens to frame Drea's mother, a nurse, for drug possession if she refuses to expose her old friends at the Admissions Party. EleanorT-bonesDrea's car, sending her to the hospital, to create a sob story that earns Drea access to the Admissions Party, and tells Russ about Drea's involvement in framing Carissa's for drug possession and Max's leaked text messages. When Drea refuses to turn herself, he calls her out for being selfish and ends their budding relationship.
During the party, Eleanor pressures Drea to take ketamine with Max and friends, but Drea reveals her true identity as "Nosey Nora", but immediately regrets it and apologizes to Eleanor, who in turn apologizes to her. Their emotional reconciliation is interrupted when Max appears and learned of their plot against. He plans to expose them and confesses to releasing Drea's video, as he found her selfish behavior a risk to his own sociopathy, unaware that Eleanor is secretly filiming his confession. The girls quickly project his confession video at the party, turning everyone against Max and tarnishing his reputation.
As a result, Max is expelled from Rosehill and his spot at Yale is offered to Drea, who rejects it. Drea apologizes to Russ and they kiss, while Eleanor reconciles with Gabbi, and Max joins a support group to address histoxic masculinity.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
