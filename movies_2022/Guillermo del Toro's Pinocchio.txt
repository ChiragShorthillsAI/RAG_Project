Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchiois a 2022stop-motion animateddark fantasymusical film[7]directed byGuillermo del ToroandMark Gustafson, from a story byMatthew Robbinsand del Toro, and a screenplay by del Toro andPatrick McHale. It is loosely based onCarlo Collodi's 1883 Italian novelThe Adventures of Pinocchio, with the title character's design strongly influenced by illustratorGris Grimly's work. The story followsPinocchio, a wooden puppet who comes to life as the son of his carver,Geppetto. Set inFascist Italyduring theinterwar period, the film stars the voice of Gregory Mann as Pinocchio andDavid Bradleyas Geppetto, alongsideEwan McGregor,Burn Gorman,Ron Perlman,John Turturro,Finn Wolfhard,Cate Blanchett,Tim Blake Nelson,Christoph Waltz, andTilda Swinton.Pinocchiowas the final film credited to Gustafson before his death in 2024.
A longtime passion project for del Toro, who considers that no other character ever "had as deep of a personal connection to [him]" as Pinocchio, the film is dedicated to the memories of his parents. It was originally announced in 2008 with a release in 2013 or 2014. However, it went intodevelopment hell. In January 2017, McHale was announced to co-write the screenplay, but production was suspended in November 2017 as no studios were willing to provide financing. It was revived the following year after being acquired byNetflix.
Pinocchiopremiered at the66th BFI London Film Festivalon October 15, 2022. It was released inselect theaterson November 9, and beganstreamingon Netflix on December 9. The film received widespread critical acclaim for its direction, writing, voice performances, animation, production design, musical numbers, and faithfulness to the source material. Amongits numerous accolades,Pinocchiowon Best Animated Feature category at theAcademy Awards,BAFTA Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Critic's Choice AwardsandPGA Awards.
InItaly, woodcarverGeppettoloses his son Carlo to anaerial bombardmentbyAustro-Hungarianforces duringWorld War I. Twenty years later, he uses the pine wood planted in Carlo's grave to create a puppet in drunken despair. TheWood Spriteappears in the middle of the night and brings it to life, christening himPinocchiodue to the puppet being made of pine, and assignsSebastian J. Cricket, who formerly lived inside the pine wood, to guide him morally, promising him a wish in exchange. Geppetto wakes up and is frightened by Pinocchio exploring and destroying his home. He becomes fed up with Pinocchio's antics due to his newborn lack ofself-control, and he decides to send the boy to school. He gifts Pinocchio a schoolbook that used to belong to Carlo.
On his way, Pinocchio is intercepted by showmanCount Volpe and his monkey Spazzatura, who bring Pinocchio to their circus to perform. Geppetto arrives to take him back, resulting in a confrontation that causes them to fight over him and ends with Pinocchio being fatally hit by thePodestà's truck. In the afterlife, he meets the Wood Sprite's sister,Death, who explains that he is immortal and revives when an hourglass empties, cautioning that the more he dies, the more time he will spend in the afterlife.
After returning to Earth, an army officer hears about Pinocchio and meets up with Geppetto. The officer tells Gepetto that Pinocchio may be a distraction by others and should to be sent to military youth camp by law. Geppetto is conflicted to send Pinocchio to youth camp or send him to perform in the circus. Seeing Geppetto upset, Pinocchio decides to earn money for him by performing in the circus, and to avoid being conscripted into theArmyby the Podestà, who thinks his immortality makes him the ideal soldier. A jealous Spazzatura, the former star, reveals to Pinocchio that Volpe has been lying to him about sending half their profits to Geppetto. Hearing this, Volpe viciously beats Spazzatura as a result, upsetting Pinocchio, who performs a song ridiculingBenito Mussoliniwhile he is in attendance. Mussolini has Pinocchio executed and the circus burned down.
Once revived, Pinocchio is taken by the Podestà tomilitary recruit training, where other boys are trained for war. He befriends the Podestà's mistreated son,Candlewick. At a training game, Pinocchio and Candlewick win in a tie; the Podestà orders Candlewick to shoot Pinocchio, but he refuses and finally stands up to his father. The training camp is then bombed byAlliedaircraft, killing the Podestà, while the boys flee. Pinocchio is captured by Volpe, who tries toburn him to deathas revenge for ruining his career. Spazzatura saves Pinocchio and attacks Volpe, resulting in all three falling off a seaside cliff, which kills Volpe.
Lost at sea, Pinocchio and Spazzatura are swallowed bythe Terrible Dogfish. Inside its belly, Pinocchio and Spazzatura find Geppetto and Sebastian, also swallowed during their search for Pinocchio. Ideated by Sebastian, Pinocchio lies to make his nose grow into a large branch, forming a bridge leading out of the monster's blowhole. As the dogfish attempts to eat them again, Pinocchio sacrifices himself by detonating anaval mineinside the dogfish, killing them both. Upon meeting Death again, Pinocchio demands to be sent back early to save Geppetto from drowning. Aware that it will make him mortal, Pinocchio breaks the hourglass to return, and dies saving his father. The Wood Sprite reappears to a mourning Geppetto and Sebastian, who uses his wish to make her revive Pinocchio.
Pinocchio, Geppetto, Sebastian, and Spazzatura return home to live together as a family. Outliving all of them, Pinocchio decides to travel the world and find his own place in life.
In 2008,Guillermo del Toroannounced that his next project, a darker adaptation of the Italian novelThe Adventures of Pinocchio(1883), was in development.[11]He has calledPinocchiohis "passion project", stating: "No art form has influenced my life and my work more than animation, and no single character in history has had as deep of a personal connection to me as Pinocchio", and "I've wanted to make this movie for as long as I can remember".[12]When he was a child, del Toro saw and likedWalt Disney's1940 animated film adaptationinGuadalajara, Mexico, partially because he felt it was like a "horror movie" in its own way due to a few intense moments it included. Since his teen years, he had longed to make his own version of the story. In 2003, del Toro discoveredGris Grimly's illustrations for the 2002 edition ofCarlo Collodi's book, portraying Pinocchio as a puppet with a long, pointed nose and spindly limbs, with gestures that del Toro felt captured the energy of an unruly but otherwise goodhearted puppet. He concluded that Grimly's illustrations reflected the setting he had in mind for his own, more somber version of Collodi's tale.[13]When del Toro asked Grimly why Pinocchio looked the way he did, Grimly said it was because Geppetto was drunk when he made him. This thought evolved into an important part of Geppetto's backstory.[14]
On February 17, 2011, it was announced that Grimly and Mark Gustafson would co-direct astop-motion animatedPinocchiofilm written by del Toro and his long-time collaboratorMatthew Robbins, and that it would be visually based on Grimly's designs. Del Toro would produce the film along withThe Jim Henson CompanyandPathé.[15]Grimly devised Pinocchio's look for the film, depicting him as unfinished wood.[8]Though Grimly was initially set to direct the film and del Toro was set to produce it,[13]on May 17, 2012, del Toro took over as director.[16]He then teamed up with Gustafson, a stop-motion veteran who had experience in similar stop-motion features likeFantastic Mr. Fox(2009), to assist him in achieving his ambitious vision for the project.[13]In February 2012, del Toro released some concept art ofPinocchio,Geppetto, theTalking Cricket,Mangiafuoco, andthe Fox and the Cat.[17]On July 30, 2012, it was announced that the film would be produced and animated byShadowMachine. It was originally scheduled to be released in 2013 or 2014,[18]but went intodevelopment hell, with no further information forthcoming about it for years.
On January 23, 2017,Patrick McHalewas announced to co-write the script with del Toro.[19]On August 31, 2017, del Toro toldIndieWireat the74th Venice International Film Festivalthat the film would need a budget increase of $35 million or it would be cancelled.[20]On November 8, 2017, he reported that the project was not happening because no studios were willing to finance it.[21]At one point, Matthew Robbins considered making a 2D-animated version of the film with French artistJoann Sfarto bring the costs down, but del Toro decided that it had to be stop-motion, even if the higher budget made it harder to get itgreenlit.[22]On October 22, 2018, it was announced that the film had been revived, withNetflixacquiring it, and Pathé no longer involved.[23]
Almost all the years of development were spent by del Toro and Gustafson defining the designs for the principal characters, basing them on either Grimly's designs or letting del Toro's frequent collaboratorGuy Davis, who joined the project as co-production designer with art director Curt Enderle, to design them. They then gave the animation models to England's Mackinnon & Saunders stop-motion puppet firm, which is considered by del Toro to be the "best in the world", and they fabricated the designs of Pinocchio, Geppetto, Sebastian J. Cricket, Count Volpe, and Spazzatura the Monkey.[13]Most of the key characters have mechanical heads to create facial expressions, but for Pinocchio, a metal 3-D printed puppet, 3000 replacement faces were used.[24]
The antagonist Count Volpe is a combination of Mangiafuoco and the Fox from the original story. Mangiafuoco was originally supposed to appear in the movie as an antagonist, but he was removed halfway through production as del Toro disliked the character and thought he was acliché; as a character model had already been made for Mangiafuoco, to not waste the model, Mangiafuoco's original design was used as a background character for Volpe's circus as a strongman.[25][26]The Cat, who was shown in a concept art, was replaced by Spazzatura, while theLand of Toyswas replaced with an Italian kids training camp.[27]At first, the fairy with blue hair was a dead girl from the same cemetery where Carlo was buried. This was changed into two angel-like beings, which ended up as the two sisters of life and death, and Carlo was no longer buried in a cemetery;[28]their design as supernatural winged beings with multiple eyes harkens back to the biblicalseraphimas well as to the Angel of Death fromHellboy II: The Golden Army(2008).[10]
To me, it's essential to counter the idea that you have to change into a flesh-and-blood child to be a real human. All you need to be human is to really behave like one, you know? I have never believed that transformation [should] be demanded to gain love.
Guillermo del Toro was intrigued by similarities between Collodi'sThe Adventures of PinocchioandMary Shelley's novelFrankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus(1818). Both tell of a childlike figure, brought to life and thrown into the world by a father figure who expects him to discover, on his own, the qualities that make us human, such as love and the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong.  These themes reminded del Toro of his childhood.Frankensteinpartly inspired del Toro to give hisPinocchioagothicdirection, but the film was still crafted to be family friendly. He sought to make  connections across generations, and convey compassion, a value del Toro feels is essential for children faced with the tremendous complexity of today's world.[8]
In del Toro'sPinocchio, the wood used to construct the puppet is carved from a tree that grows over the grave of Carlo, Geppetto's son. Pinocchio's arrival provides his grief-blinded father another opportunity for fatherhood. However, Pinocchio is rowdy, exuberant, and wild, in contrast to the well-behaved and docile Carlo. The characterization of Sebastian J. Cricket, the talking cricket, is also changed. Sebastian somewhat ponderously takes on the role of Pinocchio's conscience.  His self-importance annoys Pinocchio, causing him to escape Sebastian's supervision. The cricket comes to see that Pinocchio must discover certain things for himself, such as love, humility, and how to behave. As in the original book, Sebastian is "killed" a number of times over the duration of the film, but always comes back in order to fulfill hischaracter arc.[8]Del Toro did not wish to overly rely upon magical creatures in the film.  Desiring more realism, he reworked the Fox into a human, naming him Count Volpe and having him replace Mangiafuoco as an homage to and amalgamation of both characters. The Cat was omitted and the Land of Toys was transformed into an Italian children's training camp. In the donkey subplot,the Coachmanis replaced by thePodestà, afascistofficial who, realizing that Pinocchio cannot be killed, strives to recruit him intoItaly's military.Candlewickis changed into a bully who eventually redeems himself.[8]
Most versions of the story take place in afairy taleenvironment. Del Toro's film resituates the story inFascist ItalybetweenWorld War IandWorld War II, during the rise ofBenito Mussolini. Pinocchio thus awakens in a society of people who behave like obedient puppets. By contrast, Pinocchio is independent and irrepressible.[8]He cannot bring himself to abide by the rules or submit to authority figures, even when he encounters Mussolini himself, and then the spirit ofDeath, inlimbo. Gustafson was drawn to this characterization of Pinocchio, newly born, arriving in the world fresh and unaware of consequences. Over the course of the narrative, Pinocchio awakens to his latent humanity, and in the end chooses to become mortal in order to save the life of Geppetto.[13]Del Toro chose to move away the original book's apparent agenda, which can be interpreted as a moral tale that seeks to repress the spirits of children, encouraging blind obedience to parents and other authority figures. Del Toro, however, saw the development of Pinocchio's autonomy as a virtue. Del Toro's film is oriented around self discovery and moral agency. Del Toro's sought to explore aspects of father-son relationships, such as Geppetto's initial inability to accept Pinocchio as his own being, more than just Carlo's replacement. Geppetto struggles with guilt about the disruptiveness of the "freakish monster" that the town rejects initially.[8]Some themes of this work may seen in previous works such asThe Devil's Backbone(2001),Pan's Labyrinth(2006), andThe Shape of Water(2017). These three films also explore the humanity of those, like Pinocchio, who are perceived as different.[13]
Most previous renditions of this story feature the necessity of physical transmutation from wooden puppet to flesh and blood. Del Toro explicitly rejects this concept, that Pinocchio must physically change in order to be loved by his father and find happiness. The film asserts that the essence of humanity lies in the feelings of interiority and the expressions of exteriority, especially as behavior.[8]Pinocchio is therefore unconcerned with whether or not he turns into a "real boy". The basis of the transformation is instead Geppetto's journey to accepting and loving Pinocchio for who he is. In the end, he loves him as fiercely as he did Carlo. This reminded del Toro of his relationship with his father Federico.[13]
In assembling the film's voice cast, del Toro and Gustafson selected multipleAcademy Awardwinners and gifted performers with past creative ties with the former.[13]Daniel Radcliffe,Tom WaitsandChristopher Walkenwere originally considered to star in the film. Waits was reportedly considered to voice Geppetto and del Toro was reported by/Filmto be floating up casting Walken as the Fox, though he was also consideringDonald Sutherlandfor that part. Radcliffe would later instead remain as executive producer of the film.[29]Early on during the film's development, del Toro first approachedJohn Hurt, with whom he had worked onHellboy(2004) andHellboy II: The Golden Army, to voice Geppetto, but Hurt eventually died in 2017 long before any recordings for the film could begin.[30]
On January 31, 2020, it was announcedRon Perlman,Tilda Swinton,Ewan McGregor,Christoph WaltzandDavid Bradleyhad joined the cast of the film.[31]Bradley was chiefly cast due to his previous collaborations with del Toro on the television seriesThe StrainandTrollhunters: Tales of Arcadia. He considered his role as Geppetto to be a "real emotion rollercoaster" of a part, feeling it to resemble moreKing Learthan thePinocchiostory he had heard as a child.[13]Perlman was originally cast to voice Mangiafuoco, but once del Toro decided to remove the character in favor of Count Volpe, Perlman was recast as the Podestà while Waltz was cast as Volpe, who del Toro regards as the film's closest character to theDevil, a more over-the-top character than the Fox and the Cat and a comically evil man who seems like taken out from the cartoonish and fantastical tone of the original book.[26]
On August 19, 2020, Gregory Mann,Cate Blanchett,Tim Blake Nelson,Finn Wolfhard,John TurturroandBurn Gormanwere added to the cast.[32]For Pinocchio, del Toro sought a child actor who sounded like an ordinary boy instead of a cute one, which led him to cast Mann for his phenomenal vocal range that made him sound like a natural child, yet one absolutely emotional.[13]Mann's vocal performance provided a "silly and sunny" personality for the titular character who longs to learn about the world and meet everyone, but given how he was created with the wood of the tree next to Carlo's grave, his roots are somewhat sad.[8]Wolfhard, who is not particularly fond of voice acting due to feeling himself not as proficient as professional voice actors, was nevertheless relaxed enough to record some of his lines as Candlewick together with Mann, as he felt that he performs voice-over better with people around instead of alone in a recording booth, crediting del Toro and Gustafson for allowing him that.[33]Blanchett approached del Toro about joining the film as they worked together onNightmare Alley(2021); he told her that all roles had already been cast minus that of Spazzatura the Monkey, which Blanchett gladly accepted as long as she could work with del Toro again. She also suggested that the monkey was her spirit animal as del Toro prepared to commence production ofPinocchioto ensure her casting. Blanchett recorded her voice-over shot-by-shot instead of making different emotion sounds to be edited later on like it is usually done in other productions.[34]
Filming commenced at thePortland, Oregonoffices of ShadowMachine by January 31, 2020.[13][31]Production continued through early summer 2022, with some select sequences being handled by del Toro's own Centro Internacional de Animación (CIA) local studio, settled onGuadalajara, Mexicosince 2019 to foster local talent from Mexico. All sets, props and character costumes were crafted to the same historical and realistic standards del Toro's live-action work has often contained, hence the production's decision to not overly stylize buildings through methods like stylizing them in a curvy, stretched and leaning way, leading to a mix of stop-motion and live-action styles that support the film's themes. Animators were also encouraged to achievenaturalisticperformances from the puppets by making them "commit mistakes" like itching, sneezing or looking away if embarrassed or scared in order to shoot the characters thinking and listening, traits not usually shot in animation.[13]For Count Volpe'scarnival, Davis and Enderle drew from the reference material library collected for del Toro's previous filmNightmare Alley, which prominently starred a 1930s carnival and in which Davis had previously worked as a concept artist, even though that film's carnival was one settled in theAmerican Midwestrather than inEurope, so despite the great overlap between American and European carnivals, the filmmakers developed looks for both carnivals that were similarly downtrodden and threadbare. SomeNightmare Alleyearly shots featuringBradley Cooper's Stanton Carlisle arriving at the carnival inspired the sequence that establishes Volpe's carnival.[35]The afterlife sequences and the end credits scene were animated by studio El Taller de Chucho in Guadalajara,Mexico.[36]
The film's production quality was formed through the ornate detail of the sets and characters with their own textures in order to reinterpret Collodi's work in a way that differed from theDisneyanimated version. Del Toro toldVanity Fair: "I have been very vocal about my admiration and my great, great love for Disney all my life, but that is an impulse that actually makes me move away fromthat version. I think it is a pinnacle ofDisney animation. It's done in the most beautiful,hand-drawn 2D animation".[8]He saw as "beautiful" the idea of using puppets to create a movie about a puppet, while pushing the boundaries of stop-motion as much as possible to create a "heartfelt" movie any audience could watch.[13]Moving Picture Companyworked on the visual effects, with Bot VFX and Mist VFX.
On January 8, 2020,Alexandre Desplatstarted composing the film's score and original songs.[1]It is Desplat's and del Toro's second collaboration, afterThe Shape of Water.[1]Roeban Katz was thelyricist.[13]On August 23, 2012,Nick Cavewas attached to compose the score, but he was replaced by Desplat eight years later.[37]
In November 2018, Netflix set the film's release date for 2021.[38]In January 2021, Netflix CEOTed Sarandosrevealed that the release could be moved to 2022 or later, with Netflix's notion of releasing six animated films a year.[39]In December 2021, del Toro stated it will be released in the last quarter of 2022.[40]In January and July 2022, with the release of the film's first teaser, it was announced for a December release.[41]Over its first seven days of digital release, the film logged over 10.91 million hours viewed worldwide.[42]
Pinocchiopremiered at the66th BFI London Film Festivalon October 15, 2022.[43][3]It debuted in the United States at the 2022AFI Feston November 5, 2022.[44]It was released in select cinemas on November 9, 2022, and began streaming on Netflix on December 9, 2022.[45][46]One of the theatres scheduled to show the film on November 11, 2022, was theTIFF Bell LightboxinToronto,Ontario.[47]
In Mexico, the director's country, theCinemexmovie theater chain – one of the largest exhibitors – suspended the screenings that were scheduled, causing protests by del Toro, who wanted most of the people in his country to see the film. In response, on November 25, the filmmaker made a call on his Twitter account to show the film in independent theaters throughout the country. Some thirty independent theaters and clubs joined the call to show the film, including the country's Cineteca Nacional, where an exhibition of the figures used in the film was also set up in its central courtyard.[48]On December 18, it was announced that, on December 30, a massive screening would be held in Mexico City's main square, theZócalo.[49]The event was attended by 1,400 people.[50]
From December 4, 2022, through January 4, 2023, the film played at theMuseum of Modern Artin New York City in the Debra and Leon Black Family Film Center.[51]This coincided with a multi-floor exhibition at the MoMa called "Guillermo Del Toro: Crafting Pinocchio", which ran through April 15, 2023 and showcased various aspects of the film's inspiration and production.[52]
The Criterion Collectionreleased the film onUltra HD Blu-ray,Blu-ray, andDVDon December 12, 2023.[53][54]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 96% of 290 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's consensus reads: "Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchiodelivers fully on its title – which is to say it's a visually stunning adaptation that embraces its source material's darkness."[55]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 79 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[56]
The Hindu's Gautam Sunder wrote, "Having more in common with del Toro's ownPan's Labyrinththan any Pinocchio adaptation before this, the modern-day Mexican auteur reimagines the children's tale into something much more sinister, serious and politically inclined."[57]TheBBC's Caryn James said, "You've probably never seen a Pinocchio who dances for Mussolini, but Guillermo del Toro's dark, stirring, yet life-affirming take on the classic tale of the puppet who becomes a real boy has more in common withPan's LabyrinthandThe Shape of Water... than withthe familiar Disney version."[58]Peter BradshawofThe Guardiangave the film 3/5 stars, saying it "certainly has its moments of poignancy and sadness and McGregor's droll tones as the longsuffering cricket provide some grace notes of fun."[59]
Brian Lowry ofCNNwas more critical, writing, "beyond answering the streaming giant's wish for another marquee attraction carved from a beloved property, any praise comes with a few strings attached, depriving it of the consistent sense of wonder that would qualify as a dream come true."[60]The New York Times's Manohla Dargis wrote, "As weird as the story is, it's been made all the stranger by the decision to turn it into a metaphor aboutfascism, a conceit that is as politically incoherent as it is unfortunately timed."[61]
In December 2024,Colliderranked the film at number 5 on its list of the "10 Best Fantasy Movies of the 2020s," with Robert Lee III calling it "a story all its own while still adhering to the same magic and strengths of the original novel, creating what can easily be considered one of the best adaptations of the fairy tale. The stop-motion animation is a breathtaking sight to behold, with exceptional character design and charm exuding from each setting and facial expression."[62]
With the win of theAcademy Award for Best Animated Feature,[63]Pinocchiowas the first animated film for a streaming service under the animation studioNetflix Animation, who have also competed with three previous nominations for the same category, as well as the seventh non-Disney/Pixarfilm to win and the first non-Disney/Pixar film sinceSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the second stop-motion animated film afterAardman'sWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, andThe Adventures of Pinocchio's second adaptation to win any category from theAcademy Awardsafter Disney's animatedPinocchio.[64][65][66]

The Jim Henson Company, Inc., formerly known asMuppets, Inc.,Henson Associates, Inc., andJim Henson Productions, Inc.(commonly referred to asHenson), is an American entertainment company located in Los Angeles, California. The company is known for its innovations in the field ofpuppetry, particularly through the creation ofKermit the Frogand theMuppetscharacters.[1]
Brian Hensonis chairman andLisa Hensonis CEO. Since 2000, The Jim Henson Company is headquartered at theJim Henson Company Lot, the historic former Charlie Chaplin Studios, inHollywood.
The company was established in November 1958 bypuppeteersJimandJane Henson,[2]and is currently independently owned and operated by their children. Henson has produced many successful television series, includingThe Muppet Show(1976–1981),Fraggle Rock(1983–1987), andBear in the Big Blue House(1997–2006); as well, the company designed the Muppet characters forSesame Street(1969–present).
The company has also produced theatrical films, includingThe Muppet Movie(1979),The Dark Crystal(1982) andLabyrinth(1986). Henson also operatesJim Henson's Creature Shop, ananimatronicsandvisual effectsstudio which has created characters and effects for both Henson productions and outside projects.[3]In 1989, the company entered merger negotiations withThe Walt Disney Company, which were canceled following Jim Henson's death in 1990.
Subsequently, control of the company was assumed by Henson's children:Lisa,Cheryl,Brian,John, andHeather. In 2000, Henson was sold to German media companyEM.TV & Merchandising AG; by the end of that year, however, EM.TV's stock collapsed, and the Henson family re-acquired the company in 2003.
In the interim, EM.TV sold the rights to theSesame StreetMuppets toSesame Workshopin early January 2001,[4]following a December 2000 announcement. Henson sold The Muppets andBear in the Big Blue Houseproperties to Disney in 2004, but retains the remainder of its program library and assets.
As of 2025[update], Brian, Lisa, Cheryl, and Heather Henson maintain control of the company. Their mother, Jane Henson, died in April 2013 and brother, John Henson, died in February 2014.
JimandJane Hensonofficially founded Muppets, Inc. on November 20, 1958, three years afterSam and Friendsdebuted onWRC-TVin Washington, D.C. Aside fromSam and Friends, the majority of its work until 1969 was in advertising; appearances on late-night talk shows; and short "meeting films" primarily for enterprise use, produced from 1965 to 1996. In 1968, the company began designing characters and producing short films for the fledglingSesame Street, which premiered onNET(succeeded byPBS) in November 1969.
One of the company's first characters to appear regularly on television,Rowlf the Dog, originated in commercials forPurina Dog Chowand became a regular character onThe Jimmy Dean Showfrom 1963 to 1966. During this time, the show's host,Jimmy Dean, refused an opportunity to own 40% of the company, assuming that he did not attain that right. Jim Henson also pitched several different projects to the major American television networks, to little avail. Some ideas became unaired pilots, while others were never produced.
In 1976, producerLew Gradeapproached Henson to produce a weekly series in Grade's native United Kingdom. This series becameThe Muppet Show, produced byAssociated Television(ATV) for theITVnetwork. The success ofThe Muppet Showled to the Muppets becoming an enduringmedia franchise. Another company controlled by Grade,ITC Entertainment, originally ownedThe Muppet Show, among other Henson productions, but Henson acquired the rights to these productions in the 1980s. During this time, Henson formedJim Henson's Creature Shop, a special effects studio partially responsible for the filmsThe Dark CrystalandLabyrinth; and television seriesThe StoryTeller,Farscape, andDinosaurs.
Later in his life, Henson producedFraggle RockandThe Jim Henson Hour. In August 1989, Henson andDisneyCEOMichael Eisnerbegan merger discussions reportedly valued at $150 million, which also included a fifteen-year contract for Henson's personal "creative services."[5]However, the deal did not include the rights to theSesame Streetcharacters, which were owned by Henson, although merchandising revenue was split between Henson and theChildren's Television Workshop.
Also during the negotiations, management of the company's Henson International Television distribution unit based in the United Kingdom purchased their unit from the company, leading to the establishment ofHIT Entertainment.[6]On May 16, 1990, as negotiations continued, Jim Henson died oftoxic shock syndrome. Following Henson's death, neither Disney nor Jim Henson Productions could come to an accord. Negotiations officially ended in December 1990, and Henson remained an independent company.[7][8]
The Henson family assumed management of the company, and Brian Henson was named president, chairman, and CEO in January 1991.[9]In the following years, Henson entered into deals with several companies, including television rights to the Henson library withDisney ChannelandNickelodeon; a record label withBMG Kidz; and a home media label withBuena Vista Home Video.[10]In 1995, Henson entered into an agreement withABCto produce primetime television series, leading toMuppets TonightandAliens in the Family.
Following the releases ofThe Muppet Christmas CarolandMuppet Treasure IslandbyWalt Disney Pictures, Henson formedJim Henson PictureswithSony Pictures Entertainment. In 1998, the company signed a deal withColumbia TriStar Home Videoto launch Jim Henson Home Entertainment.[11]By 1999, Henson held partial interests in two cable channels: TheKermit Channel(broadcasting in Asia) and Odyssey Network (broadcasting in the United States), both jointly owned with Hallmark Entertainment. After Hallmark (throughCrown Media Holdings) assumed full ownership of these networks, the Kermit Channel was discontinued and Odyssey was renamed theHallmark Channel.
In 2000, the Henson family sold the company to the German media companyEM.TV & Merchandising AG, for $680 million.[12][13]That summer, EM.TV sold Henson's stakes in the Odyssey and Kermit cable channels in exchange for an 8.2% stake in Hallmark-controlled Crown Media Holdings.[14]By the end of 2000, after EM.TV subsequently experienced major financial problems, EM.TV sold the company's ownership of theSesame StreetMuppets and Henson's small interest in theNoggintelevision network to Sesame Workshop,[15]and by early 2001, Henson itself was marked for sale.[16]Disney,[17]Viacom,[18]HIT Entertainment,[19]AOL Time Warner,[20]Haim Saban,[21]Classic Media,[22]as well as Henson management, among others, were all parties reportedly interested in acquiring the company.
In December 2002, a deal was announced in which EM.TV would sell a 49.9% stake in Henson to an investment group led by Dean Valentine, a former executive at Disney andUPN.[23]However, in March 2003, the deal was canceled, citing financial issues on Valentine's part.[24]In May 2003, EM.TV was reportedly nearing an agreement to sell Henson to aconsortiumbetween Classic Media and Sesame Workshop (with financing from Sony Pictures Entertainment),[25]until the Henson family re-acquired the company for a closing price of $84 million.[26]
In February 2004, Henson sold the Muppets andBear in the Big Blue Houseto Disney,[27]who subsequently formedThe Muppets Studio(known at that time as The Muppets Holding Company). The term "Muppet", likewise, became a legal trademark of Disney; Sesame Workshop retained permission to use the term for itsSesame Streetcharacters under a perpetuity license from Disney.
On April 1, 2004, Henson andHIT Entertainmentagreed to a five-year global distribution and production deal which included distribution of 440 hours of the company's remaining library includingFraggle Rock,[28]Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas,[29]The HoobsandJim Henson's Mother Goose Stories. In addition, the agreement also included the production of new properties, includingFrances, in which both companies co-produced and also both co-own the copyright to the series.[30]After that deal expired, Henson entered into similar agreements withLionsgate Home Entertainmenton August 10, 2009[31]and later withGaiam Vivendi Entertainmentthree years later on October 25, 2012.[32]As well, the company became involved with computer-animated projects, including the direct-to-videoUnstable Fablesseries;Sid the Science Kid;Dinosaur Train; andSplash and Bubbles, as well as the puppet seriesPajanimals.
Henson later formed Henson Alternative, which specializes in adult content, including the live shows known alternatively asPuppet Improv,Puppet Up!,[33]andStuffed and Unstrung. In recent years, theFraggle Rockcharacters have made several appearances, usually at special events. The characters appeared withBen Folds Fivein the music video for "Do It Anyway";[34]and in 2013, Gobo and Red Fraggle hosted aFraggle Rockmarathon on theHub Network.
In 2019,The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,[35]a prequel toThe Dark Crystal, premiered onNetflix.[36]In 2022,Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock, a reboot ofFraggle Rock, premiered onApple TV+.
On August 10, 2022, the company signed a worldwide distribution agreement withShout! Factorywhich would allow Shout! to distribute thirteen series and specials from the Henson catalog on home entertainment and streaming platforms across all territories.[37]A similar worldwide distribution agreement went into effect on January 5, 2024, for streaming, video on demand, broadcast, digital download, packaged media and certain non-theatrical rights for the filmsLabyrinthandThe Dark Crystal, as well as behind the scenes specialsInside the LabyrinthandThe World of the Dark Crystal.[38]
On June 20, 2024, the company announced they were planning to sell the Jim Henson Company Lot off La Brea Avenue in Hollywood, which it purchased in 1999, as “part of a much longer-term strategy to have The Jim Henson Company and our renowned Burbank-based Jim Henson’s Creature Shop under one roof, which is not feasible in Hollywood due to the space the Shop requires.”[39]In November of 2024, film producerMcGand musicianJohn Mayerbought the lot for $40 million.[40][41][42]
On February 25, 2025, the company appointed DeAPlaneta Entertainment as its distributor and licensor for several Henson properties such asFraggle Rock,Dinosaur Train,Dot.andPajanimalsin European territories.[43]
From 1969 to 2000, Henson was contracted to design and create Muppet characters forSesame Street. With the exception of occasional appearances in the Muppets franchise, the characters were used exclusively forSesame Street, but Henson legally owned these characters prior to their acquisition by Sesame Workshop. The only exception wasKermit the Frog, who was featured in other projects prior toSesame Street. Sesame Workshop retains the rights to use anySesame Streetfootage featuring the character.
The sale ended any direct affiliation between The Muppets andSesame Street, although the series retains use of the term "Muppet" under license from Disney. Many of the puppeteers continue to perform with both The Muppets andSesame Streetfranchises. While no longer owning theSesame Streetcharacters, Henson continues to design them.[51]This list excludes pre-2001Sesame Streetco-productions outside the United States.
The following list contains projects of The Jim Henson Company under its Henson Alternative banner.
The first eight series are produced under its Henson Alternative banner exclusively inNorth Americabefore premiering worldwide in 2015.

Del Toro is close friends with fellow Mexican filmmakersAlfonso CuarónandAlejandro G. Iñárritu, and they are collectively known as "The Three Amigos of Mexican Cinema".[6]He has receivedseveral awardsincluding threeAcademy Awards, threeBAFTA Awards, twoGolden Globe Awards, aDaytime Emmy Award, and aGolden Lion. He was included inTimemagazine's list ofthe 100 most influential people in the worldin 2018,[7]and he received amotion picture staron theHollywood Walk of Famein 2019.[8]
Guillermo del Toro Gómez[9]was born inGuadalajaraon 9 October 1964, the son of Guadalupe Gómez Camberos and automotive entrepreneur Federico del Toro Torres.[10]Del Toro is ofSpanish,Irish, andGermandescent.[11]Raised in a strictCatholichousehold,[12]he attended theUniversity of Guadalajara's Centro de Investigación y Estudios Cinematográficos (Film Studies Center).[13]
When del Toro was about eight years old, he began experimenting with his father'sSuper 8camera, making short films withPlanet of the Apestoys and other objects. One short focused on a "serial killer potato" with ambitions of world domination; it murdered del Toro's mother and brothers before stepping outside and being crushed by a car.[14]Del Toro made about 10 short films before his first feature, including one titledMatilde, but only the last two,Doña LupeandGeometria, have been made available.[15]He wrote four episodes and directed five episodes of thecult seriesLa Hora Marcada, along with other Mexican filmmakers such asEmmanuel LubezkiandAlfonso Cuarón.[16]
His first movie was supposed to be a stop-motion sci-fi feature calledOmnivore, about a lizard-man born in a savage land where everything tries to eat everything else.[17]He and his team built sets and about 100 puppets over a three-year period prior to filming. Vandals burglarized the studio one night and destroyed the puppets and sets, which put an end to his project as del Toro decided to switch to a live-action film,Cronos.[18][19]
Del Toro studiedspecial effectsand make-up with special-effects artistDick Smith.[20]He spent 10 years as a special-effects make-up designer and formed his own company, Necropia. He also co-founded theGuadalajara International Film Festival. Later in his directing career, he formed his own production company, the Tequila Gang.[21]
In 1997, at the age of 33, Guillermo was given a $30 million budget fromMiramax Films(then owned byDisney) to shoot another film,Mimic. He was ultimately unhappy with the way Miramax treated him during production, which led to his friendJames Cameronalmost coming to blows with Miramax co-founder and ownerHarvey Weinsteinduring the70th Academy Awards.[22]
Del Toro has directed a wide variety of films, fromcomic bookadaptations (Blade II,Hellboyand its sequelHellboy II: The Golden Army) to historical fantasy andhorror films, two of which are set in Spain in the context of theSpanish Civil Warunder theauthoritarianrule ofFrancisco Franco. These two films,The Devil's BackboneandPan's Labyrinth, are among his most critically acclaimed works. They share similar settings, protagonists and themes with the 1973 Spanish filmThe Spirit of the Beehive, widely considered to be the finest Spanish film of the 1970s.[23]
I cannot pontificate about it, but by the time I'm done, I will have done one movie, and it's all the movies I want.
People say, you know, "I like your Spanish movies more than I like your English-language movies because they are not as personal," and I go "Fuck, you're wrong!"Hellboyis as personal to me asPan's Labyrinth. They're tonally different, and yes, of course you can like one more than the other—the other one may seem banal or whatever it is that you don't like. But it really is part of the same movie. You make one movie.Hitchcockdid one movie, all his life.
Del Toro views the horror genre as inherently political, explaining, "Much like fairy tales, there are two facets of horror. One is pro-institution, which is the most reprehensible type of fairy tale: Don't wander into the woods, and always obey your parents. The other type of fairy tale is completely anarchic and antiestablishment."[24]
He is close friends with two other prominent and critically praised Mexican filmmakersAlfonso CuarónandAlejandro González Iñárritu.[25]The three often influence each other's directorial decisions, and have been interviewed together byCharlie Rose. Cuarón was one of the producers ofPan's Labyrinth, while Iñárritu assisted in editing the film.

In 2012, del Toro participated in theSight & Soundfilm poll. Held every 10 years to select the greatest films of all time, contemporary directors are asked to select their 10 favorite films. Del Toro chose:[76]
Del Toro updated his list for the 2022 edition of the poll:[77]
Del Toro met and began dating Lorenza Newton, cousin of singerGuadalupe Pineda, when they were both studying at the Instituto de Ciencias in Guadalajara. They were married in 1986 and had two daughters together[78]before divorcing in September 2017.[79]In 2021, he married Kim Morgan, an American film historian who was formerly married to Canadian filmmakerGuy Maddin.[80]
Del Toro maintains homes inTorontoandLos Angeles, and returns to his nativeGuadalajaraevery six weeks to visit his family.[81]He also owns two houses devoted exclusively to his collection of books, poster artwork, and other belongings pertaining to his work. He explained, "As a kid, I dreamed of having a house with secret passages and a room where it rained 24 hours a day. The point of being over 40 is to fulfill the desires you've been harboring since you were 7."[24]
In a 2007 interview, del Toro described his political position as "a little tooliberal". He pointed out that the villains in most of his films (such as theindustrialistinCronos, theNazisinHellboy,Italian FascisminPinocchio, and theFrancoistsinPan's Labyrinth) are united by the common attribute ofauthoritarianism: "I hate structure. I'm completely anti-structural in terms of believing in institutions. I hate them. I hate any institutionalized social, religious, or economic thing."[82]
RaisedCatholic, del Toro toldCharlie Rosein a 2009 interview that his upbringing was excessively "morbid" and said, "I mercifullylapsedas a Catholic... but asBuñuelused to say, 'I'm an atheist, thank God.'" He insists that he is spiritually "not with Buñuel" and that he is "once a Catholic, always a Catholic, in a way". He concluded, "I believe in Man. I believe in mankind, as the worst and the best that has happened to this world."[83]He has also responded to the claim that he views his art as his religion: "It is. To me, art and storytelling serve primal, spiritual functions in my daily life. Whether I'm telling a bedtime story to my kids or trying to mount a movie or write a short story or a novel, I take it very seriously."[24]Nevertheless, he became a "ragingatheist" after seeing a pile of human fetuses while volunteering at a Mexican hospital.[84]He also said that he was horrified by the way the Catholic Church complied withFrancoist Spain, and even had a character in one of his films quote what actual priests would say toRepublican factionmembers in concentration camps.[85]Upon discovering the religious beliefs of English writerC. S. Lewis, del Toro stated that he could no longer relate to Lewis and his work, despite having done so beforehand.[86]He described Lewis as "too Catholic" for him, despite the fact that Lewis was never a Catholic.[87]
Del Toro is not entirely disparaging of Catholicism, and his background continues to influence his work. While discussingThe Shape of Water, he mentioned the Catholic influence on the film: "A very Catholic notion is the humble force, or the force of humility, that gets revealed as a god like figure toward the end. It's also used in fairy tales. In fairy tales, in fact, there is an entire strand of tales that would be encompassed by the title 'The Magical Fish'. And [it's] not exactly a secret that afish is a Christian symbol." In the same interview, he said, "I don't think there is life beyond death, I don't. But I do believe that we get this clarity in the last minute of our life. The titles we achieved, the honors we managed, they all vanish. You are left alone with you and your deeds and the things you didn't do. And that moment of clarity gives you either peace or the most tremendous fear, because you finally have no cover, and you finally realize exactly who you are."[88]
In an interview for his book and exhibitionGuillermo del Toro at Home with Monsters, del Toro stated in 2016, "A lot ofMexican Catholicdogma, the way it's taught, it's about existing in a state of grace, which I found impossible to reconcile with the much darker view of the world and myself, even as a child. I couldn't make sense of impulses like rage or envy and, when I was older, more complex ones, you know. I felt there was a deep cleansing allowing for imperfection through the figure of a monster. Monsters are the patron saints of imperfection."[89]
Del Toro is highly skeptical ofAI in filmmaking, telling theBritish Film Institutein September 2024, "I saw a demo of AI [being used for animation] and I thought, 'Oh, that's what people think animation is: giving prompts and the computer does it. [...] AI has demonstrated that it can dosemi-compellingscreensavers—that's essentially that. And I think the value of art is not how much it costs and how little effort it requires, it's how much you would risk to be in its presence. Are [screensavers] going to make [viewers] cry because they lost a son, a mother? Because they misspent their youth? No. [AI is] in the hands of people that don't think about it as a tool but as a solution. [...] It should be, if at all, optional."[90]
While studying at university, del Toro published his first book when he wrote a biography of English filmmakerAlfred Hitchcock, whom he has long praised and admired.[91]
In 2010, del Toro revealed that he was a fan of video games, describing them as "the comic books of our time" and "a medium that gains no respect among theintelligentsia". He referred to the video gamesIcoandShadow of the Colossusas masterpieces.[92]He later citedAsteroids,Cosmology of Kyoto,Gadget: Invention, Travel, & Adventure, andGalagaas his personal favorite games.[93]
Del Toro's favorite film monsters areFrankenstein's monster, theXenomorph,Gill-man,Godzilla, andthe Thing.[94]Frankenstein in particular has a special meaning for him, in both film and literature, as he claims he has a "Frankenstein fetish to a degree that is unhealthy". He said, "It's the most important book of my life, so you know if I get to it, whenever I get to it, it will be the right way."[95]He usually watches three films a day,[96]and listsBrazil,Nosferatu,Freaks, andBram Stoker's Draculaamong his favorite horrors.[97][98]
Del Toro is also a fan of Japanesemangaandanime, having called the animeDoraemon"the greatest kids series ever created".[99]He has citedHayao Miyazakias one of his influences and one of his favorite storytellers in any medium, having identified with his style and influence through hisToei AnimationandStudio Ghibliprojects likeThe Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots,Heidi, Girl of the Alps,My Neighbor Totoro, andThe Boy and the Heronfrom childhood to adulthood, praising how he evokes the emotion of recognizing an impossible beauty only existing in films and realistically depicting brutal themes that affect the best and the worth of humanity, deeming Miyazaki an entirely genuine one-of-a-kind creator who exists fully in his art.[100]
Del Toro is highly interested in theculture of Victorian England. He said, "I have a room of my library at home called 'The Dickens Room'. It has every work byCharles Dickens,Wilkie Collins, and many other Victorian novelists, plus hundreds of works about Victorian London and its customs, etiquette, architecture. I'm aJack the Ripperaficionado, too. My museum/home has a huge amount of Ripperology in it."[101]
In 2019, del Toro paid for the flights of the Mexican teams to attend the 60thInternational Mathematical Olympiad(IMO) in South Africa and the United Kingdom, after the Mexican chapter of the IMO announced the government had suspended financing for the youngsters.[102][103]
Del Toro has an honorary doctorate from theNational Autonomous University of Mexico(UNAM). In November 2022, UNAM awarded him theHonoris CausaDoctorate for his "contributions to culture and his support for the youth".[104]
Del Toro's father, Federico del Toro Torres, was kidnapped in Guadalajara around 1997. Del Toro's family had to pay twice the amount originally asked for as a ransom ($1 million). Immediately after learning of the kidnapping, fellow filmmakerJames Cameron, a friend of del Toro since they met after the production ofCronos, offered to help del Toro pay for the ransom, which del Toro accepted.[105]72 days after Federico was kidnapped, the ransom was paid and he was released. The culprits were never apprehended, nor was the money ever recovered.[106]The event prompted del Toro, his parents, and his siblings to move abroad. In a 2008 interview withTimemagazine, he mentioned the kidnapping of his father: "Every day, every week, something happens that reminds me that I am in involuntary exile [from my country]."[107][24]
Additionally, del Toro has written or co-written unproduced screenplays for adaptations ofJustice League Dark(titledDark Universe),Beauty and the Beast(titledBeauty),At the Mountains of Madness,The Count of Monte Cristo(titledThe Left Hand of Darkness),Spanky(titledMephisto's Bridge),Superstitious,The Coffin,Drood,The List of Seven,The Wind in the Willows, as well as ones for potential remakes ofFantastic VoyageandThe Haunted Mansion.[109]

Waltz was born in Vienna to an Austrian mother and German father. Upon his birth his German father only requested a citizenship certificate of Germany. Being born to an Austrian mother, Waltz was Austrian by birthright, and formally requested his Austrian citizenship certificate in 2010, thus holding citizenships of both Austria and Germany, but considers the fact that he also has a German passport a "legal, citizenship law banality".[3]Asked whether he felt Viennese, he responded: "I was born in Vienna, grew up in Vienna, went to school in Vienna, graduated in Vienna, studied in Vienna, started acting in Vienna — and there would be a few further Viennese links. How much more Austrian do you want it?"[42]He received American citizenship by naturalization in 2020 noting that he strongly believed "in this old dictum of no taxation without representation" as he was living in Los Angeles since 2010.[43]
Waltz has three children with his former wife, Jacqueline (néeRauch), a dance therapist originally from New York.[44]The two lived in London and their marriage lasted 17 years.[7][8]Waltz married his second wife, German costume designer Judith Holste, with whom he has a daughter.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
