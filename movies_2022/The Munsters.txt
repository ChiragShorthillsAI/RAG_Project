A lifelong fan of the series, Rob Zombie had pursued developing aMunstersfilm withUniversal Picturesbefore the release of his debut feature in 2003, and was attached to several related projects before confirming a film adaptation of the television series in 2021. Zombie wanted the film to be in black and white, but the studio refused, and the director opted for a highly saturated look instead. Principal photography began in November 2021 inBudapest.
The Munstersis aco-productionofUniversal 1440 Entertainmentand Spookshow International Films. It was released on Digital,Blu-ray, andDVD, and also available to stream onNetflixin the US on September 27, 2022. It received mixed reviews from critics.
Mad scientistDr. Henry Augustus Wolfgang and hishunchbackedassistant Floop rob graves for body parts to build an experimental creation including the fingers of the zombie pianist Franz Pennywhacker who Wolfgang strikes in the head to render him dead. Floop accidentally steals the head of hackycomedianShecky Von Rathbone instead of Shecky's astrophysicist brother Shelly, whom Wolfgang wanted. Wolfgang uses electricity to give life to his Frankenstein creation, which Floop names "Herman Munster".
Seeking revenge on her ex-husband, the Count,RomaniZoya Krupp entrances the Count's werewolf son Lester to come to her tent as she states that Lester owes her money. Under threat of Zoya's brother Bela beheading him, Lester agrees to Zoya's plan to have the Count sell her his Transylvanian castle so she can turn it into a casino and theme park. Lester calls his father with the proposal, but the Count immediately dismisses it.
Over breakfast served by faithful servant Igor, the Count talks with his 150-year-old vampire daughter Lily Gruesella about her unsatisfying love life and disappointing recent date with Count Orlock. Lily and the Count watch the TV showGood Morning Transylvaniawith host Ezra Mosher. Ezra's guest Dr. Wolfgang unveils Herman Munster live on the air. Wolfgang is disgusted to discover Herman is a bumbling brute with a goofy sense of humor when he begins performing a stand-up comedy routine. However, Lily falls in love with Herman's unusual personality.
Herman becomes a celebrity with Floop acting as his manager and Lily goes to see him perform with his band "The Punk Rods" at Zoya's nightclub. Lily is directed to him by Lester after he received another warning from Zoya. Herman immediately falls for Lily when they meet. The two agree to a dinner date the following night at the Count's castle. The Count takes an instant disliking to Herman due to his dimwittedness and begins scheming with Igor to use a magic spell to get rid of him. The Count later tries to conjure a new mate for Lily, but his potion inadvertently summons a semi-sentient chimpanzee instead.
A week of dating culminates in Herman and Lily vacationing at Devil's Island Penal Colony. Lily accepts Herman's wedding proposal. Herman meets Lester for the first time at his wedding. With Herman as the new head of the household, Lester manipulates him into signing over the castle's deed to Zoya by promising a lucrative business venture. Herman and Lily are married as Wolfgang states to the Count that Herman is now his problem.
Herman and Lily honeymoon in Paris, where Herman captures a reptilian creature that had been haunting the city's sewers. Herman and Lily adopt the monster as a pet whom they name Spot. After Zoya serves him with an eviction notice, the Count angrily confronts Herman in Paris. Lily learns that Herman fell for one of Lester's schemes, costing them their home. Lily states that she will call the lawyer Shady MaGoon when they get back to Transylvania.
After Lily hears some comments from the incarcerated Shady MaGoon confirming that they don't have a case against Zoya, Herman watches a TV personality named Zombo and decides that they can get a fresh start by moving to Hollywood so he can become a famous star. Realtor Barbara Carr gives them a brief tour of Hollywood before taking them to Mockingbird Heights. Barbara shows the Munsters a model home, but the trio insists on buying a dilapidated old house at the 1313 address.
The family join their neighbors for a Halloween block party. Unaware of the holiday's customs, the Munsters assume they are partying with other freaks and weirdos. The residents assume the Munsters are wearing costumes, and award them a $1,500 contest prize.
Herman leaves the house for his first day of work carrying corpses at the Gateman, Goodbury, and Graves funeral parlor. Getting his first look at Mockingbird Heights outside of Halloween, Herman retreats in shock when he sees that they live among normal people in an idyllic suburb. Lily and the Count are equally horrified.
Lester arrives at the house unexpectedly. Although the Munsters are initially unhappy to see him after what Zoya made him do, Lester presents Herman with a check for his portion of gambling money that Lester won in Las Vegas using Zoya's payment for the Count's castle. Herman and Lily excitedly realize they are now rich.
A lifelong fan of the 1960s television series, Rob Zombie had pursued developing a film before the release of his debut feature,House of 1000 Corpses(2003), which first began as a Universal production. Zombie expressed his enthusiasm for the property to the studio's chairmanStacey Snider, only to learn a new take was already in development. In 2016, the director learned of anotherMunstersproject for Universal, and became involved. He began to overhaul a film "aimed at preschoolers" that originally focused on Herman and Lily's son, Eddie, but Universal eventually cancelled to explore television options instead.[3][4][5]
In March 2021, it was reported that Zombie was developing a feature film adaptation of the television series.[6]This was confirmed by Zombie in June.[7]In April of the same year, it was also reported that the project was being developed as a simultaneous theatrical andPeacock-exclusive film, but these reports turned out to be erroneous. The movie's budget was also rumored to be $40 million but Rob Zombie said that was untrue.[8][9]
Zombie flew toBudapestin June 2021 to begin location scouting.[10]On July 2, 2021,Sheri Moon Zombieconfirmed that the film was in the pre-production stage.[11]Zombie shared numerous pre-production materials through his social media accounts, including designs for the Munsters' house on Mockingbird Lane and early sculpting forHerman Munster's head prosthetic.[12][13]
On July 26, 2021, Rob Zombie shared the first costume designs for Lily and Herman.[14]Further costume designs were revealed later that month.[15][16]Wayne Toth's Ex Mortis special effects studio worked on special effects make-up for the film.[17][18]Toth has regularly collaborated with Rob Zombie, including on the filmsHalloween,House of 1000 CorpsesandThe Devil's Rejects.[19][20]In September 2021, Zombie returned to the US for a series of tour dates but continued to share updates from the construction of Mockingbird Lane on hisInstagram.[21][13]
Rob Zombie used social media to bring casting and character updates to fans during the production ofThe Munsters. His first announcement came in October 2021, when he revealed the main cast membersâ€”this includedJeff Daniel Phillips, who would be playing Herman Munster;Sheri Moon Zombie, who would be playing Lily Munster; andDan Roebuck, who would be playing the Count.[22]All three actors were veterans of Rob Zombie movies, and Zombie explained, "I couldn't risk getting on set in Budapest and going, my leads aren't getting along, they have no chemistry. So that's why I chose the cast I chose. Jeff Daniel Phillips and Sheri Moon Zombie and Daniel Roebuck, they work together a lot and I knew they would just fall right into it."[23]
ActorRichard Brakewas cast as Dr. Henry Augustus Wolfgang, "Transylvania's most popular mad scientist".[24]This was the fourth Rob Zombie movie that Brake has been cast in, previously appearing inHalloween,31and3 from Hell. Brake finished filming in May 2022.[25]Scottish actorSylvester McCoywas cast as Igor, "the loyal servant to the Munsters". McCoy wrapped in April 2022.[26]In early 2022, Rob Zombie shared the first photo from the set ofCatherine Schell, who would be playing Zoya Krupp.[27][28]American actor and comedianJorge Garciaplayed Floop, "Dr. Wolfgang's hunchback assistant and Herman Munster's best buddy".[29][30]Cassandra Peterson, better known as the horror hostess character Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, was cast as Barbara Carr, "the number 1 real estate agent in all of Mockingbird Heights".[31]Peterson said the role was "so so different from what I normally do, I'm playing a super straight character".[32]ActressDee Wallacewas cast as "the voice ofGood Morning Transylvania". Wallace has appeared in several Rob Zombie movies, includingHalloween,The Haunted World of El Superbeasto,The Lords of Salemand3 from Hell.[33]British actor Jeremy Wheeler would join the cast as "Mr. Gateman, Herman's boss at the one and only Gateman, Goodbury and Graves Funeral Parlor".[34][35]Actor Tomas Boykin was cast as Lily's brother Lester. Boykin had previously appeared in Rob Zombie's3 from Hell.[36]
Following speculation about originalMunsterscast members, Rob Zombie revealed thatPat Priest, who playedMarilyn Munsterfrom 1964 to 1966, had joined the cast of his movie.[37]AnotherMunstersoriginal actor,Butch Patrick, who playedEddie Munsterfrom 1964 to 1966, was revealed to be playing the Tin Can Man, a robot built by Eddie on the series.[38]Several minor characters were announced to appear with no casting information: Uncle Gilbert, who was in the original episode "Love Comes to Mockingbird Heights" and was played byRichard Hale,[39][40]and Zombo, originally featured in the second season.[41]Count Orlock also returned, and Zombie hinted that the character was a former beau of Lily's before she met Herman.[42]
Principal photographyofficially began in November 2021, in Budapest.[43]The producers felt a black and white film would be difficult to market. Zombie noticed the actors in makeup off set looked like "cartoon characters come to life", and decided to light the film in the same colorful "hyper-real" fashion.[23][3]Because ofCOVID-19 lockdowns, the cast lived together in the same building for three months and got to know each other.[44]Filming had wrapped by July 7, 2022.[45]
Rob Zombie revealed that long-time collaboratorZeusswould be composing the music forThe Munsters.[46][47]Zeuss had previously scored the music for Zombie's3 from Helland31.
In July 2022, two original songs forThe Munsterswere released, "It's Zombo" and "The House of Zombo", which feature performances by Rob Zombie, Jeff Daniel Phillips and Sheri Moon Zombie.[48][49]"I Got You Babe", a cover of theSonny & Chersong performed by Sheri Moon Zombie and Phillips, was released in August. The three tracks were made available on streaming platforms and a limited edition12-inch singlefromWaxwork Records.[50][51]
On September 23, 2022, the full soundtrack was released on streaming platforms, featuring original songs from the film, including the previously released singles, and the original score music by Zeuss. It was also released as a double vinyl LP by Waxwork Records.[52]In total there are 56 tracks with a runtime of 1 hour and 15 minutes.[53][54]
The track "They Are The Munsters", written by Rob Zombie and Zeuss, was nominated for aHollywood Music in Media Awardsin November 2022.[55][56]
The first trailer was released on July 13, 2022, revealing elements of the plot, while also indicating the film's scheduled release month; it was met with a mixed-to-negative reception.[57][58]
On July 18, 2022, Zombie announced thatThe Munsterswould be released on the streaming platformNetflixin the fall, around the same time as Netflix'sWednesday, a spin-off ofThe Addams Family.[59]A date of September 27, 2022, was given in late August for the film's Netflix premiere.[60]
On July 20, it was announced thatThe Munsterswould be released onBlu-ray,DVDand digital platforms, starting on September 27, 2022. The "Collector's Edition" includes an hour-long behind the scenes feature calledThe Munsters: Return to Mockingbird Lane, plus feature-length commentary from the director.[61]The film grossed $1,470,601 in home video sales.[62]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 52% of 54 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The website's consensus reads: "The Rob ZombifiedMunstersrevival shows clear affection for the source material, but it never translates into a compelling update on the classic series."[63]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 57 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[64]
Leigh Monson, ofThe A.V. Club, gave the film a Bâˆ’, writing "As a movie, it's nothing but loose ends, a lukewarm stew of concepts that haven't been stirred enough to combine in the cauldron. But as a faux television pilot, the actors, the sketches, the sight gags, and the puns mesh together endearingly."[65]Matt Donato ofIGNcalled it "a wholesome labor of love that's probably for the most diehard sitcom fans because for better and worse, Rob Zombie makes the Munsters reboot he wants to see."[66]Owen Gleibermanwrote "The Munsters, the family-of-ghouls '60s sitcom that Zombie is adapting, was such a ticky-tacky piece of gothic bat-house surrealism that the movie, broad and slovenly as it is, works more than it doesn't."[67]
Steve Schneider, ofOrlando Weekly, gave the film a 1 out of 5 rating, writing, "Zombie has zero ability to structure a story: While his flick feels nearly interminable at 110 minutes, entire sections of plot seem to be missing, or at least glossed over. And he doesn't know how to tell a joke."[1]William Bibbiani, ofTheWrap, also gave a negative review: "It's the kind of film you'd expect to see on a television set in the background of any other Rob Zombie film ... The appeal is understandable, but it doesn't make for much of a movie."[68]Screen Rantgave it a 2-star rating, stating, "Rob Zombie's mismanagement of nostalgia and modern expectations leaves us with a half-baked attempt that was brimming with great potential."[69]

The division also had distribution deals withThe Film Arcade,Aviron Pictures,STX Entertainment(save for films fromEuropaCorp Films USA, which Lionsgate holds the video rights to[3]),Mattel Creations(for the long-runningBarbiedirect-to-video film series),[4]101 Studios, Sovereign Films,Open Road Films,Briarcliff Entertainment,Pinnacle Peak Pictures,Picturehouse,Blumhouse Tilt,NeonandBleecker Street(until 2021),Funimation(in the United States and Canada; until 2018, after whichSony Pictures Home Entertainmenttook over) andEntertainment One(in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Spain, Germany and the United States; until 2024, after whichLionsgate Home Entertainmenttook over).[5]
Since 2021, their releases are currently distributed byStudio Distribution Services, a joint venture between UPHE andWarner Bros. Home Entertainment, with select titles distributed by Allied Vaughn through itsManufacture on demand(MOD) solutions.
The company was founded in 1980 as MCA Videocassette, Inc. with Gene Giaquinto as president of the division. It released 24 films onBetamaxandVHSin May 1980, includingJaws,Animal HouseandThe Deer Hunteras well as classic films such asDracula,Animal Crackers, andScarface.[6]Jaws 2and1941were also released that year. Before 1980Castle Films(known as Universal 8 after 1977) had served as Universal's home film distribution unit. In late 1983, both theLaserdiscsister label MCA Videodisc and the MCA Videocassette label were consolidated into a single entity, MCA Home Video, alternating with the MCA Videocassette, Inc. name until December 1983.
In the mid-1980s, MCA Home Video began to license catalog titles to smaller, independent video firms with a focus on sell-through product. The first was in 1986 withKartes Video Communications.[7]The deal was followed with a similar agreement withGoodTimes Home Videoin 1987.[8]
Also in 1986, the company made agreements withMotown Productions[9]and with children's book publisherPrice Stern Sloan.[10]Both deals were intended to expand MCA's non-theatrical product.
1987 was a busy year for MCA Home Video; the company underwent an executive shuffle, signed an exclusive three-year deal withInternational Video Entertainmentfor video distribution, and began offering new content fromRingling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus.[11][12]
In 1990, with the 75th anniversary of Universal Studios, it became MCA/Universal Home Video and used that name alternating with the MCA Home Video name from 1990 until 1997. On December 9, 1996, the company was renamed as Universal Studios Home Video when MCA was reincorporated as Universal Studios, which would then later be merged intoVivendi Universal Entertainmentin 2000.[2]
Universal's first titles on the DVD format, in 1997, were licensed toImage Entertainmentfor distribution. These early, bare-bones editions quickly fell out-of-print when Universal started making their own DVDs.[citation needed]
In 2004, due to the merger of Universal Studios andNBCto formNBC Universal, Universal started releasing DVDs of shows from the newly establishedNBC Universal Television Distribution. Before 2004, NBC shows were distributed on DVD byLions Gate Home EntertainmentandA&E Home Videounder the label NBC Home Entertainment (formerly NBC Home Video underTrimarkuntil it was bought by Lions Gate). NBC's home entertainment on-screen logo was simply theNBC Enterprisessyndication logo.
In 2005 (by which point the Universal Studios Home Entertainment name was in use), the group was restructured; Universal 1440 Entertainment was formed as an internal production arm, while the London-based Universal Pictures Visual Programming (formerlyPolyGram Visual Programming) unit was folded into Universal Pictures International;Universal Cartoon Studioswas absorbed into the Family Productions unit.[13][14]The year after, UPHE acquired distribution rights to theBarbiefilm seriesafter negotiations between Mattel and their previous domestic distributor,Lionsgate Home Entertainment, fell apart (Universal had already been distributing these films internationally).[15][16][17]
Universal was also the worldwide video distributor forDreamWorkstitles using theDreamWorks Home Entertainmentmoniker until 2006, when DreamWorks was sold toParamount Pictures' parent company,Viacom, and as a result,Paramount Home Entertainmenttook over distribution. After Viacom spun off DreamWorks in 2008, Universal Studios Home Entertainment planned to resume distributing DreamWorks' movies, but this deal fell through. Until Lionsgate formed theirhome video division, Universal distributed their releases with the exception ofDogma, which was distributed byColumbia-TriStar Home Video. In 2007, it was signed on as home video distributor of releases bySummit Entertainment(ironically, Summit was later bought by Lionsgate).[18]
In addition to DVDs, Universal was a major supporter of theHD DVDformat untilToshibadiscontinued the format. Since July 22, 2008, UPHE releasedBlu-raysand it was the last major Hollywood movie studio to do so. The first three Blu-ray releases to come out in the U.S. wereThe Mummy, its sequelThe Mummy ReturnsandThe Scorpion King. Since August 9, 2016, UPHE has releasedUltra HD Blu-rays.
In 2015,Funimation(now known asCrunchyroll, LLC), formed a multi-year home video distribution deal with UPHE.[19]Two years later,Sony Pictures Televisionacquired a 95% stake in Funimation, which resulted inSony Pictures Home Entertainmenttaking over distribution after the UPHE deal expired.[20]
Starting on June 5, 2018, because NBCUniversal acquiredDreamWorks Animationin 2016, Universal began re-releasing all of DWA's film library on home video after their deal with20th Century Fox Home Entertainmentended.
On February 28, 1999, Universal signed a multi-year deal withColumbia-TriStar Home Videoto allow the latter to distribute Universal DVDs outside North America, although a few years later, Universal started self-distributing all of its DVDs internationally.[21]
In theNetherlands, UPHE used to distribute mostDVDsof films released theatrically byIndependent Filmsand TV shows and films fromStudio 100until 2006, although this is now limited to catalog releases, as more recent films are now released through Warner Bros. Home Entertainment and later on,Belga Home Video.
InSouth Africa, UPHE distributes films on DVD and VHS throughCIC Videoin the 1980s and 1990s. In 1999, the company was moved toSter-Kinekor Home Entertainmentuntil 2007 after CIC Video was dissolved in the same year. In 2008, it was moved later toNu Metro Home Entertainmenton DVDs until 2013, when Next Entertainment took over until 2019.
UPHE also formerly distributedStudioCanaltitles on home media inFrance(until 2024 when distribution moved to ESC Distribution), most of theRepublic Pictureslibrary in theUKand most of theCarolco Pictureslibrary in Australia, Latin America, and several European countries (along with otherStudioCanalproperties) until StudioCanal's global distribution deal with Universal expired in January 2022.[22]In the 1980s until the late 1990s, they also distributed tapes released byCineplex Odeonin Canada.
In theUK, UPHE previously distributed its films on video internationally throughCIC Video(a division ofCinema International Corporation, laterUnited International Pictures) alongsideParamount Pictures. In Japan, releases from both Universal and Paramount appeared on CIC-Victor Video, Ltd. (a joint venture between CIC Video andJVC) for VHS and onPioneer LDC, Inc.for Laserdisc.Following Universal's then-parentSeagram's acquisition ofPolyGramin 1998, UPHE pulled out of CIC in 1999 and began distributing its films throughPolyGram Video(which had international operations) which was then renamed Universal Pictures UK Ltd.[23]
In June 2002, Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment formed a new joint-venture with Universal Pictures UK Ltd called UCA (Universal Columbia Alliance), under which Universal would distribute both new and back catalogue Columbia-Tristar titles through retail, though Columbia-Tristar Home Entertainment would continue self-distributing through rental.[24]
UPHE's international operations are a carryover from the PolyGram Video days,[25]but UPHE operates a joint venture inAustralia,New ZealandandScandinaviawithSony Pictures Home Entertainmentcalled Universal Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. The venture distributes UPHE and SPHE titles on home media in those countries and also licensedanimeseries and films from the anime library ofNBCUniversal Entertainment Japan, theJapanesedivision of UPHE's sister company, Universal Pictures International Entertainment, formerly known as Pioneer LDC from 1981 to 2003, Geneon Entertainment from 2003 to 2009 and Geneon Universal Entertainment from 2009 to very late 2013, the year they switched to their current name. The name of the joint venture is Universal Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Australia. Before that, though,NBCUniversal Entertainment Japanhad a marketing and distribution division inNorth Americacalled Geneon USA, which, like UPHE, also distributed home video. At the time, NBCUEJ was known as Geneon Entertainment. Geneon USA shut down in late 2007, and Universal has licensed all of NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan's catalog to other companies rather than directly distributing them themselves. Starting on March 26, 2022, NBCUEJ (through UPHE) distributes and licenses anime series and films.
From 2017 to 2018,Funimationbegan directly distributing a select number of its titles in Australia and New Zealand through Universal Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Australia.

His music and lyrics are notable for their horror and sci-fi themes,[2][3]and his live shows have been praised for their elaborateshock rocktheatricality.[4][1][5][6]He has sold an estimated 15 million albums worldwide.[7]He rose to fame as a founding member and the frontman ofheavy metalbandWhite Zombie, with whom he released four albums.
His first solo effort, the 1996 song "Hands of Death (Burn Baby Burn)" (withAlice Cooper), was nominated for aGrammy Award for Best Metal Performance.

Zombie followed the film with two sequels in hisFireflytrilogy:The Devil's Rejects(2005) and3 from Hell(2019). After the success of his first two films he directedHalloween(2007), a remake of the classic1978 horror film.

Zombie has also directed the filmsThe Haunted World of El Superbeasto(2009),The Lords of Salem(2012),31(2016), andThe Munsters(2022).
Zombie was born Robert Bartleh Cummings inHaverhill, Massachusetts,[8]on January 12, 1965,[9]the oldest son of Louise and Robert Cummings.[10]His younger brother, Michael, uses the stage nameSpider Oneand is the lead singer ofPowerman 5000.[11][12][13]Growing up, he had a fascination withhorror filmsand "always wanted to beAlice Cooper,Steven Spielberg,Bela Lugosi, andStan Lee".[14][15]He has said of his childhood, "I didn't aspire to be anything. I was just a dopey kid. Basically everyone seemed amazing to me as a kid. I grew up in some nowhere town... anybody that even seemed remotely famous just seemed like they were on another planet."[16]
Zombie's parents worked at a carnival.[17]In 1977, when he was 12, his parents chose to leave after a riot broke out at the carnival and tents were set on fire.[18][19]He said of the experience, "Everybody's pulling out guns, and you could hear guns going off. I remember this one guy we knew, he was telling us where to go, and some guy just ran up to him and hit him in the face with a hammerâ€”just busted his face wide open. My parents packed up real quick, and we took off."[20]He later elaborated, "I think someone just got ripped off for a lot of money on the gambling tents and they came back later and set the tents on fire [and] it turned into this big riot. [...] It was super violent and crazy and I think that was when my parents were like, 'You know what? We might be able to find something better to be doing here.' Because me and my brother are in the middle of this. Things are on fire, people beating the crap out of each other."[16]
Cummings graduated fromHaverhill High Schoolin 1983.[21]He moved toNew York Cityand began attendingParsons School of Design,[22]where he met eventual bandmate and girlfriendSean Yseult.[23][24]Before the success of White Zombie, he worked as a production assistant for the children's showPee-wee's Playhouse.[25]He took the stage name "Rob Zombie" from Bela Lugosi's 1932 horror filmWhite Zombie, from which he also took White Zombie's band name.

Percy James Patrick Kent-Smith(born 20 August 1943), known professionally asSylvester McCoy, is a Scottish actor. Gaining prominence as aphysical comedian,[1][2]he became best known for playing theseventh incarnationofthe Doctorin the long-runningscience fiction televisionseriesDoctor Whofrom 1987 to 1989â€”the final Doctor of the original runâ€”and briefly returning in atelevision film in 1996. He is also known for his work asRadagastinThe Hobbitfilm series (2012â€“2014).
McCoy was born Percy James Patrick Kent-Smith[3]inDunoon, on theCowalpeninsula, to an Irish Catholic mother and an English father who had died in action duringWorld War IIa couple of months before McCoy was born;[4]he met his father's family at the age of 17.[3]His mother suffered amental breakdownwhen McCoy was eight years old, and was institutionalised thereafter.[5]Prior to adopting his stage name, McCoy was known as Kent Smith; he was unaware of his given names until he was eleven.[5]
McCoy was raised primarily in Dunoon,[3]where he attended Saint Mun's School; he then studied for the priesthood atBlairs College, aseminaryin Aberdeen between the ages of 12 and 16,[3]but gave this up and continued his education atDunoon Grammar School.[4]After school he moved to London where he worked in the insurance industry for five years.[6]He worked in the box office ofThe Roundhousefor a time, where he was discovered byKen Campbell.[7]
McCoy came to prominence as a member of the experimental theatre troupe "The Ken Campbell Roadshow". His best known act was as astuntmancharacter called "Sylveste McCoy" in a play entitledAn Evening with Sylveste McCoy(the name was coined by actorBrian Murphy, who worked beside Kent-Smith at theRoundhouse Theatreand originated in the Wolfe Tones version of "Big Strong Man"[8]), where his stunts included putting a fork and nails up his nose and stuffingferretsdown his trousers, and setting his head on fire. As a joke, the programme notes listed Sylveste McCoy as played by "Sylveste McCoy" and, conscious that he may have needed to distinguish himself from the American actorKent Smithas his career progressed, Kent-Smith maintained the stage name. Canadian criticMilton Shulmanbelieved McCoy's name and fictionalised biography were genuine in his review of the Roadshow.[5]
Notable television appearances before he gained the role of the Doctor included roles inVision On(where he played Pepe/Epep, a character who lived in the mirror), an O-Man inJigsawandTiswas. Every episode of the innovativeATVschools maths programmeLeapfrogfeatured McCoy as "Bert" in wordless sequences filmed out of doors, as he attempted to form regular geometric patterns from different numbers of logs or carpet squares. He also appeared inEureka, often suffering from the effects of inventions ofWilf Lunn, and as Wart, assistant to StarStrider in the Children's ITV seriesof the same name. McCoy also portrayed, in one-man shows on the stage, two famous movie comedians:Stan LaurelandBuster Keaton. While playing Laurel, who had adopted his stage name due to the perceived bad luck of his real name containing thirteen letters, McCoy realised his stage name also had thirteen letters and added an "r" to the end of "Sylveste".[5]He also appeared asHenry "Birdie" Bowersin the 1985 television serial aboutScott'slastAntarctic expedition,The Last Place on Earth.
McCoy also had a small role in the 1979 filmDraculaoppositeLaurence OlivierandDonald Pleasence, and has sung with theWelsh National Opera.
McCoy became theSeventh Doctorafter taking over the lead role inDoctor Whoin 1987 fromColin Baker. He remained on the series until it ended in 1989, ending withSurvival(his twelfth and final serial as the Doctor). As Baker declined the invitation to film the regeneration scene, McCoy briefly wore a wig and appeared, face-down until the last moment before the regeneration commenced as the Sixth Doctor, with his face concealed by regeneration special effects. He played the Doctor in the 1993 charity specialDimensions in Time, and again in 1996, appearing in the beginning of theDoctor Whotelevision movie starringPaul McGannas theEighth Doctor.
In his first season, McCoy used his background inphysical comedyto portray the character with a degree of clown-like humour, butscript editorAndrew Cartmelsoon changed that when fans argued that the character (and plots) were becoming increasingly lightweight. The Seventh Doctor developed into a much darker figure than any of his earlier incarnations, manipulating people like chess pieces and always seeming to be playing a deeper game. A distinguishing feature of McCoy's performances was his manner of speech. He used his natural Scottish accent and rolled hisrs. At the start of his tenure he used proverbs and sayings adapted to his own ends (e.g. "There's many a slap twixt cup and lap" â€“Delta and the Bannermen), although this characteristic was phased out during the later, darker series of his tenure. In 1990, readers ofDoctor Who Magazinevoted McCoy's Doctor "Best Doctor", over perennial favouriteTom Baker.[9]Since 1999 he has continued acting in the role of the Seventh Doctor in a series of audio plays forBig Finish Productions.
In November 2013 McCoy co-starred in the one-off 50th anniversary comedy homageThe Five(ish) Doctors Reboot.[10]
In January 2021, McCoy returned to the role of the Doctor alongsideBonnie LangfordasMel Bush, in "A Business Proposal for Mel!" This short, acted as an announcement trailer for 'The Collection: Season 24' Blu-Ray set, which was released later that year.[11]
McCoy reprised the role of the Doctor in the2022 special"The Power of the Doctor", and again in the seriesTales of the TARDIS.[12]
McCoy's television roles sinceDoctor Whohave includedMichael Samsin the 1997 dramaBeyond Fear, shown on the first night of broadcast ofChannel 5.

Cassandra Gay Peterson[1](born September 17, 1951) is an American actress best known for her portrayal of thehorror hostesscharacterElvira, Mistress of the Dark. Peterson gained fame onLos Angelestelevision stationKHJ-TVin her stage persona as Elvira, hostingElvira's Movie Macabre, a weeklyB moviepresentation. A member of the Los Angeles-basedimprovisationalandsketch comedytroupeThe Groundlings, Peterson based her Elvira persona in part on a "Valley girl"-type character she created while a member of the troupe.
The popularity ofElvira's Movie Macabreled to the 1988 filmElvira: Mistress of the Dark, and later the 2001 filmElvira's Haunted Hills, both starring Peterson as Elvira. The television show was revived in 2010, featuring Elvira hostingpublic domainfilms, and airing onThis TVuntil 2011. Elvira returned as a horror hostess in 2014 with13 Nights of Elvira, a 13-episode series produced byHulu, and again in 2021 for a one-night 40th Anniversary Special that aired onShudder.
Peterson has madecameo appearancesas Elvira in a number of films and television programs, including appearing as a guest commentator duringWrestleMania 2and as a guest judge onRuPaul's Drag Race,The Boulet Brothers' Dragula, andHalloween Wars.
Peterson was born on September 17, 1951[3]inManhattan, Kansas. When she was a toddler, she was scalded by boiling water, which required skin grafts to cover over 35% of her body to heal, resulting in her having to spend three months in the hospital.[4][5]
In a 2011 interview, Peterson stated that as a child, she was more fascinated by horror-themed toys while other girls were occupied withBarbie dolls.[6]In elementary school, she watchedHouse on Haunted Hill, which was the firsthorror filmshe ever saw.[7]During her teens, Peterson worked as adrag queengo-go dancerin aColorado Springs, Coloradogay bar[8]and as a go-go dancer atClub A-Go-Go, a nightclub in Colorado Springs, and for soldiers atFort Carson.[9]She graduated fromPalmer High Schoolin Colorado Springs.
Inspired byAnn-Margretin the filmViva Las Vegas, while on a trip toLas Vegas, Nevada, during high school, she persuaded her parents to let her see a live show where she was noticed by the production staff; despite being only 17 years old, she persuaded her parents to let her sign a contract.[10]Immediately after graduating high school, she drove back to Las Vegas, where she became ashowgirlinFrederic Apcar's pioneering "Vive Les Girls!" atThe Dunes; there, she metElvis Presley, with whom she went on a date.[11]She had a small role as a showgirl beside Shady Tree (Leonard Barr) in theJames BondfilmDiamonds Are Forever(1971) and played a topless dancer in the filmThe Working Girls(1974).
In the early 1970s, Peterson moved toItalyand became lead singer of the Italianrockbands I Latins 80[12]and The Snails. After being introduced to film directorFederico Felliniby the producer of a documentary on Las Vegas showgirls in which she had appeared, she landed a small part in the filmRoma(1972).[13]When she returned to the United States, she worked at thePlayboy ClubinMiamias a showgirl in the 1973 revueFantasies of Love au Natureland later signed up withHugh Hefner's Playboy Modeling Agency, working as a hostess and model.[14]She also toured nightclubs and discos around the country with a musical/comedy act, Mama's Boys.[15]
In her 2021 memoirYours Cruelly, Elvira, she writes, "Perhaps the biggest mistake I made in my twenties was posing nude for a husband-and-wife photography team, who bullshitted me into doing what they said was a 'test shoot' forPenthousemagazine.  They guaranteed me it would never be seen anywhere publicly."[16]She adds, "I never saw or heard from them again, and as far as I knew, that was the end of that... until 1981 when I became famous. Those photos, pubic hair and all, appeared in every sleazy men's magazine on the stand and there wasn't a damn thing I could do about it."[16]However, Peterson appeared in severaladult magazinesin the 1970s includingModern Man,Playgirl, andSwank, among others.[17][18][19][20]
In 1979, she joined the Los Angeles-basedimprovisationaltroupeThe Groundlings, where she created aValley girl-type character upon whom the Elvira persona is largely based.[21]
Peterson was one of two finalists for the role ofGinger Grantfor the thirdGilligan's Islandtelevision movie in 1981, but was dropped before filming.[22]Shortly after that,KHJ-TVoffered her thehorror hostposition.[23]
In 1981, six years after the death ofLarry Vincent, who starred as host Sinister Seymour of a Los Angeles weekend horror show calledFright Night, show producers began to bring the show back.[24]
The producers decided to use a hostess. They asked 1950s'horror hostessMaila Nurmito reviveThe Vampira Show. Nurmi worked on the project for a short time, but quit when the producers would not hireLola Falanato play Vampira.[25]The station sent out acasting call, and Peterson auditioned and won the role. Producers left it up to her to create the role's image. She and her best friend, Robert Redding, came up with the sexygoth/vampirelook after producers rejected her original idea to look likeSharon Tate's character inThe Fearless Vampire Killers.[26]They created the Elvira look by drawing inspiration from aKabukimakeup book and the hairstyles ofThe Ronettes.[27][28]
Shortly before the first taping, producers received acease and desistletter from Nurmi. Besides the similarities in the format and costumes, Elvira's closing line for each show, wishing her audience "Unpleasant dreams," was notably similar to Vampira's closer: "Bad dreams, darlings..." uttered as she walked off down a misty corridor. The court ruled in favor of Peterson, holding that "'likeness' means actual representation of another person's appearance, and not simply close resemblance." Peterson claimed that Elvira was nothing like Vampira aside from the basic design of the black dress and black hair. Nurmi claimed that Vampira's image was based onMorticia Addams, a character inCharles Addams's cartoons that appeared inThe New Yorkermagazine.[29]
Peterson's Elvira character rapidly gained notice with her tight-fitting, low-cut, cleavage-displaying black gown. Adopting the flippant tone of aCalifornia"Valley girl", she brought a satirical, sarcastic edge to her commentary. She reveled in dropping risquÃ© double entendres and making frequent jokes about her cleavage. In anAOLEntertainment Newsinterview, Peterson said, "I figured out that Elvira is me when I was a teenager. She's a spastic girl. I just say what I feel and people seem to enjoy it." Her camp humor, sex appeal, and good-natured self-mockery made her popular with late-night movie viewers and her popularity soared.[30]
The Elvira character soon evolved from an obscurecult figureto a lucrative brand. She was associated with many products through the 1980s and 1990s, includingHalloweencostumes, comic books,[31][32]action figures, trading cards, pinball machines, Halloween decor, model kits, calendars, perfume and dolls. She has appeared on the cover ofFemme Fatalesmagazine five times.[30]In 1984, she hosted her own six-hour Halloween special onMTV, which included skits and music videos and returned to host another four hour Halloween special in 1986.[33]That same year, she also was a guest commentator atWrestlemania 2in the Los Angeles segments alongsideJesse VenturaandLord Alfred Hayes. Elvira's popularity reached its zenith with the release of the 1988 feature filmElvira: Mistress of the Dark, on whose script, written directly for the screen, Peterson collaborated withJohn Paragonand Sam Egan.[34]From 1989 through 1991, Peterson appeared as Elvira in a series of commercials promotingWorld Championship Wrestling's annualHalloween Havocpay-per-viewevents.[35][36][37]
After several years of attempts to make a sequel toElvira: Mistress of the Dark, Cassandra and her manager and then-husband Mark Pierson decided to finance a second movie. In November 2000, Peterson wrote, again in collaboration with Paragon, and co-producedElvira's Haunted Hills.The film was shot inRomaniafor just under one million dollars. With little budget left for promotion, Cassandra and Mark screened the film atAIDScharity fund raisers acrossAmerica.[38]For many people in attendance, this was their first opportunity to see the woman behind the Elvira character. On July 5, 2002,Elvira's Haunted Hillshad its official premiere inHollywood. Elvira arrived at the premiere in her Macabre Mobile. The film was later screened at the 2003Cannes Film Festival.[39]
In September 2010,Elvira's Movie Macabrereturned totelevision syndication, this time with public domain films.[40]In October 2014, it was revealed that a new series of thirteen episodes had been produced,13 Nights of ElviraforHulu. The show premiered on October 19, 2014, running through to Halloween.[41]
As of September 2018, Peterson was working to develop a direct sequel to 1988'sElvira: Mistress of the Dark, as well as an animated Elvira project.[42]
In 1985, Elvira began hosting a home video series calledThrillerVideo, a division ofInternational Video Entertainment (IVE). Many of these films were hand-selected by Peterson. Choosing to stay away from the more explicitcannibal,slasherandzombiefilms of the time, these were generally tamer films such asThe Monster ClubandDan Curtistelevision films, as well as many episodes of theHammer House of Horrortelevision series. Since she had refused to hostMake Them Die Slowly,Seven Doors of Death, andBuried Alive, however, the videos were released on theThrillerVideolabel without Elvira's appearance as hostess. After this, several extended episodes[43]of the British namesake seriesThriller(i.e.,The Devil's Web,A Killer in Every Corner,Murder Motel) were also released without an appearance by Elvira; in some, such asBuried Alive, the cast replaced her.
The success of theThriller Videoseries led to a second video set,Elvira's Midnight Madness, released throughRhino Home Video. In 2004 a DVD horror-film collection calledElvira's Box of Horrorswas released, marking Elvira's return to horror-movie hostessing after a ten-year absence.
In 1993, she filmed a pilot forCBScalledThe Elvira Show.An expansion of the 1988 film with a sitcom setting, the premise had Elvira and her family moving into a new neighborhood with her older aunt and dealing with nosy neighbors and uptight conservatives who all want them to move out. It also starredKatherine Helmond,Phoebe Augustine,Cristine Rose,Ted Henning,Lynne Marie Stewart,Claudette Wells,John Paragon, Laurie Faso, andBasil Hoffman. It was not picked up by a TV network.[44][45]
In an interview with Josh Korngut onDread Central'sDevelopment Hellpodcast, Peterson revealed cancelled plans for an Elvira "buddy comedy" where the Mistress of the Dark took a road-trip to hell. She also detailed plans for anEdward Scissorhands-inspired animated feature film revealing Elvira's origins with the holiday of Halloween.[46]
Peterson has also portrayed non-Elvira roles in many other films, most notablyPee-wee's Big Adventurein 1985 alongside friend and fellowGroundlingPaul Reubens, who starred as hisPee-wee Hermancharacter;Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, released in 1987, which starredRichard ChamberlainandSharon Stone; and 2010'sAll About Evil, as a mother named Linda Thompson who says not to go to the old theater to watch scary movies. Peterson also appeared inRob Zombie'sThe Munstersmovie in 2022.[47][48]
In the 1970s, Peterson had a liaison withJon Voightas well as withRobert De Niroduring the filming ofThe Godfather Part II.[49]Peterson married musician Mark Pierson in 1981, and he soon became her personal manager. They had one daughter. They divorced in 2003.[50]
Peterson released her memoir,Yours Cruelly, Elvira: Memoirs of the Mistress of the Dark, on September 21, 2021. She revealed in the book that she has been in a relationship with a woman, Teresa "T" Wierson, since 2002. They began their romantic relationship following Peterson's separation from her husband.[51]In the book, she also accused basketball playerWilt Chamberlainof raping her during a party at hisBel Airmansion in the 1970s.[52][53][54]
Peterson was avegetarianfor many years; as of 2021, she continues to maintain a "mostly vegetarian" diet.[55]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (FullÂ list...)
AmÃ©lie of Leuchtenberg(1812â€“1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor PedroÂ I. She was the fourth child ofEugÃ¨ne de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with AmÃ©lie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria AmÃ©liawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and AmÃ©lie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of AmÃ©lie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich DÃ¼rck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
