The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances, action sequences, visual effects, and its inspiration from1980s movies, but criticized its writing and storyline. The film ranks as the third most popular movie on Netflix worldwide, accumulating 157.6 million views in its first 28 days.
In a dystopian 2050, fighter pilot Adam Reed steals a time jet to escape to 2018 to save his wife, Laura, who was ordered by Sorian to be assassinated. During his escape, he is injured and crash-lands in 2022, where he encounters his 12-year-old self, who has been suspended after being bullied in school and is distant from his mother Ellie after the death of his father Louis Reed the previous year.
At first, Young Reed distrusts his future self but realizes he's telling the truth when 2050 Adam mentions his life and knows his dog. 2050 Adam decides to bring his younger self along to find Laura in 2018 once his injuries are healed. Both Adams are soon attacked by Maya Sorian, the leader of the dystopian world, and her assistant Christos. However, they are saved by Laura, who has faked her death and stayed off-grid in an unknown location via agunand theplasmicMAG/CYL.
After briefly losing the pursuers, Laura and the Adams realize that after the invention of time travel by Louis and his subsequent death, Sorian has monopolized the discovery. They find Sorian frequently came and advised her 2018 self to secure her future wealth and power. Laura's hideout is discovered by Christos. Laura holds them off while the two Adams escape, sacrificing herself as she is vaporized by Sorian.
The Adams escape into 2018, where they visit Louis Reed and attempt to enlist his help, but he refuses out of concern for the effects on the time stream. Meanwhile, the 2050 Sorian warns her 2018 self about Adam.
The following day, the two Adams set off to destroy the particle accelerator located underground at Sorian Technologies. They come under attack by Sorian's soldiers waiting for them but are saved by Louis, who has changed his mind and agrees to guide them. He reveals that destroying the machine will not destroy time travel as long as Sorian has his algorithm with the math and constraints to control the process, so decides to destroy the memory unit instead.
Meanwhile, 2050 Sorian captures the younger Adam and holds him hostage as Louis and 2050 Adam remove an algorithm memory unit. 2050 Adam distracts Sorian and Christos enough for younger Adam to free himself, resulting in damage to the electromagnetic seal around the accelerator, which tears the facility apart.
The Reeds manage to take out Christos after a lengthy fight, but the older Sorian threatens to kill Louis, who remains adamant and refuses to hand over the memory unit. She shoots at Louis. However, the armor-piercing bullet is altered by the electromagnetic field and hits 2018 Sorian instead, killing her and hence wiping 2050 Sorian out of existence.
The Reeds barely manage to escape the facility's implosion and return home, where they reconcile by playing a game of catch before the Adams fade out and return to their respective time periods. In 2022, the younger Adam has not been suspended, has let go of his anger, and hugs his mother.
Sometime in the future, an older and much happier Adam meets Laura during a flight training lecture where she realizes, to Adam's amusement, that she has entered the wrong building on the campus. Adam offers to walk her to her building, stating that he has time, and they depart together.

WhileAliaswas airing, Garner continued to work in film intermittently. She had an "other-worldly" experience whenSteven Spielbergcalled to offer her a role as a high-class call girl in the crime comedy-drama filmCatch Me If You Can(2002).[47]After seeing her inAlias, Spielberg was sure that "she would be the next superstar".[48]She filmed her scene oppositeLeonardo DiCaprioduring a one-day shoot.[49]Garner's first co-starring film role was in the action superhero filmDaredevil(2003), in which she playedElektratoBen Affleck's Daredevil.[50]The physicality required for the role was something Garner had discovered "an aptitude for" through her work onAlias.[47][51]Elvis Mitchell ofThe New York Timeswrote that she "realizes Elektra more through movement than by way of her lumpy, obvious lines. She hasn't mastered the combat skill of tossing off bad material."[52]WhileDaredevilreceived mixed reviews, it was a box office success.[53]Also in 2003, she voiced herself in an episode ofThe Simpsons.
Garner's first leading film role, in the romantic comedy13 Going on 30(2004), was widely praised. She played a teenager who finds herself trapped in the body of a thirty-year-old. Garner choseGary Winickto direct the film[54]and they continued to look for other projects to do together until his death in 2011.[55][56]Manohla Dargis of theLos Angeles Timesfound her to be "startling": "Whenever she's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else."[57]Owen Gleiberman ofEntertainment Weeklycalled it an "utterly beguiling" performance, writing, "You can pinpoint the moment in it when Garner becomes a star."[58]Ann Hornaday ofThe Washington Postremarked: "Garner is clearly cut out to be America's next Sweetheart; she has the same magic mix of allure and accessibility that the job calls for."[59]13 Going on 30grossed $96 million worldwide.[60]Garner reprised the character of Elektra in the 2005Daredevilspin-off filmElektra; it was a box office and critical failure.[61]Claudia Puig ofUSA Todayconcluded that Garner "is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in13 Going on 30".[62]Garner next starred in the romantic dramaCatch and Release. Although filmed in 2005 in between seasons ofAlias, it was not released until early 2007 and failed to recoup its production budget.[63]Peter Travers ofRolling Stonepraised Garner's ability "to blend charm and gravity"[64]but Peter Hartlaub of theSan Francisco Chroniclefelt that, while her "natural beauty and likability are still assets, [she] seems occasionally challenged by what should be an easy role".[65]

Her supporting role inJunoas a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan ofNew York Magazineas a turning point in her career: "She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ... WriterDiablo Codyand directorJason Reitmanexpertly deploy Garner's innate humanity as a trump card."[66]Lisa Schwarzbaum ofEntertainment Weeklysaid Garner had never "been lovelier or more affecting".[67]Also that same year, she played an FBI investigator in the action thrillerThe Kingdom.[68][69]She was nursing her baby during filming in Arizona and was hospitalized on two occasions with heatstroke.[70]

In preparation for the role, Garner worked with vocal and movement coaches and took French lessons.[28]Ben Brantley ofThe New York Timesdescribed her performance as "captivating": "Ms. Garner, I am pleased to report, makes Roxane a girl worth pining over ... [She] speaks Anthony Burgess's peppery rhymed translation with unaffected sprightliness. If she's a tad stilted in the big tragic finale, her comic timing is impeccable."[71]The New Yorker's theater critic was impressed by her "feistiness" and "lightness of comic touch".[72]The play was recorded before a live audience and aired onPBSin 2008. In 2007, Garner became a spokesperson of skin care brand Neutrogena.[73]

While the film received lukewarm reviews, it grossed $102.2 million worldwide.[74]Michael Phillips ofThe Chicago Tribunefound Garner "easy to like and sharp with her timing"; he was disappointed to see her as "the love interest, which is not the same as a rounded character".[75]Similarly, Manohla Dargis ofThe New York Timeswas dismayed to see Garner appear as "less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words "enter generic female lead" in [the] screenplay)".[76]
Garner's second performance of 2009 was in comedianRicky Gervais's directorial debutThe Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner—"always happy and always pleasant to everyone"—against type.[77]In the film, she played the love interest of the first human with the ability to lie in a world where people can only tell the truth. Reviews for the movie were mixed and it made $32.4 million worldwide.[78]David Edelstein ofNew York Magazinesaid Garner "proves again (the first time was13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on,"[79]while Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chroniclesaid Garner "has never been better onscreen ... Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before."[80]

Garner reunited withMatthew McConaugheyin the 2013 biographical dramaDallas Buyers Club, portraying the role of a doctor treatingAIDSpatients in Texas during the mid-1980s.[96][97]The film received significant acclaim and was a box office success.[98]Peter Travers ofRolling Stonedescribed Garner as "a radiant actress of rare spirit and sensitivity"[99]and Betsy Sharkey of theLos Angeles Timessaid: "Garner is once again cast as a quintessentially decent, all-American girl, albeit a doctor. But the question of whether the actress has deeper emotional layers to bring to the screen is not answered here."[100]David Edelstein ofNew Yorkmagazine said: "It's not a well-shaped role, but I've gotten to the point where I'm happy to see Garner in anything. She's incapable of phoniness."[101]Also in 2013, Garner became the first celebrity spokesperson of the Italian fashion brandMax Mara.[102]

The film made $2.2 million worldwide,[106]and Christopher Orr ofThe Atlanticsaid: "Garner does what she can as the Snooping Mom from Hell, but ultimately it's not much.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
