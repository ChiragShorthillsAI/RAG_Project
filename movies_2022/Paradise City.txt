In 2006, co-writer and producerCorey Largecame up with the idea to reunite actorsBruce WillisandJohn Travolta, who both starred inPulp Fiction(1994).Paradise Citywas announced twenty-seven years later in May 2021.[6][7][8]Filming began on May 17, 2021, inMaui, Hawaii, and wrapped after three weeks.[9]Maui County Film Commissioner Tracy Bennett said, "Usually on a big action movie like [Paradise City], it takes about three months of prep — and they did it in two weeks. There were some restrictions on this one because of the short notice where they could not film exactly where they wanted to or what they wanted to so they were constantly re-writing the script."[10]Stephen DorffandBlake Jennerwere announced to star in June.[11]Paradise Cityis one of the last films to star Willis, who retired from acting because he was diagnosed withfrontotemporal dementia.[12][13]
Paradise Citywas released bySaban Filmsin limited theaters andVODon November 11, 2022,[4][14]followed by its release onDVDandBlu-rayon December 20, 2022.[15]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 14% of 14 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.4/10.[16]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 31 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[17]
Glenn Kenny, ofThe New York Times, gave a scathing review, saying it "sounds like one of those fake movies joked about onSeinfeldor30 Rock. And yetParadise Cityis a reality of sorts, albeit an uncomfortable reality."[18]Noel Murray, of theLos Angeles Times, gave the film a negative review, commenting on the film's "TV-cop-show-level stuff, shot in some of Hawaii's least scenic locations. The stars can't save it."[19]Todd Jorgenson, ofCinemalogue, also gave a negative review, highlighting that "despite its capable cast, the film never generates much suspense amid a parade of cliched genre twists."[20]Robert Kojder, ofFlickering Myth, gave the film a 1.5/5 rating, writing "audiences will be begging, "oh, won't you please take me home.""[21]Casey Chong, ofCasey's Movie Mania, gave a 1/5 rating, summarizing the film as "painful, tedious and worst of all, relies heavily on expository-heavy scenarios to drive the movie forward."[22]Leo Brady, ofA Movie Guy, also gave a one star rating, explaining that the film "has a capable cast working with a script that was concocted overnight. At best it feels like a free paid trip to Hawaii for everyone involved."[23]Brian Orndorf, ofBlu-ray.com, rated the film 2 out of 5 stars, saying "the stars are here to enjoy a Hawaiian vacation and trade a few lines of dialogue. Screen intensity is not encouraged."[24]Jeffrey M. Anderson, ofCommon Sense Media, also gave a 2 star rating, concluding that "beautiful Hawaiian locations, a veteran genre director, and nostalgic stunt casting can't overcome the general low energy level and lazy attitude that permeate this crime drama from start to finish."[25]
In a rare positive review,Owen Gleiberman, ofVariety, said " I'm not sure if what Willis, Travolta, and Dorff do here rises to what you'd call integrity, but all three seem to be enjoying themselves. They slum with style."[5]Brittany Witherspoon, ofScreen Rant, wrote in a mixed review, "the film contains entertaining components, but these elements quickly run their course thanks to a predictable script, wonky dialogue & pacing issues."[26]Mark Hanson, ofSlant Magazine, praised John Travolta's performance, but otherwise criticized the film for not "living up to its title."[27]Josh Bell, ofCrooked Marquee, gave the film a "C-", saying, "the occasional flashes of competence only make the rest ofParadise Citymore disheartening, though, and just because it's slightly less of a slog than Willis' other recent work doesn't mean it's worth watching."[28]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
