The School for Good and Evilis a 2022 Americanfantasy filmdirected byPaul Feigfrom a screenplay he co-wrote withDavid Magee, based on the 2013 novelof the same namebySoman Chainani.[8][9][10]The film stars anensemble castled bySophia Anne Carusoas Sophie andSofia Wylieas Agatha, two best friends who are sent to the Schools for Good and Evil. After their fortunes are seemingly reversed, their friendship is put to the test.[11][12][13]
The film's development began in 2013, when the rights to the novel were acquired byRoth/Kirschenbaum Filmsand Jane Startz Productions, withUniversal Picturesinitially set to release the film. After the project languished indevelopment hell,Netflixtook over in 2017, and Feig was hired to direct three years later.Principal photographytook place inNorthern Irelandbetween January and July 2021.
The School for Good and Evilwas released on October 19, 2022, by Netflix. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the narrative and storytelling, but praised its cast and visuals.
Twin brothers Rhian and Rafal founded the School for Good and Evil to groomfairy taleheroes (called "Evers") and villains (called "Nevers") respectively. Dissatisfied with evil's constant submission to good, Rafal attacks Rhian using blood magic. They both seem to fall off a cliff, but presumably Rafal dies.
Years later, in the village of Gavaldon, best friends Sophie and Agatha learn about the legendary school from the bookshop owner. While Agatha is skeptical, fairy tale-obsessed Sophie dreams of escaping ordinary life and becoming aprincess. Nights later, Sophie attempts to run away from Gavaldon in secret. When Agatha finds out and tries to intervene, a giantstymphsnatches them both, flying them to the magical School for Good and Evil.
To their dismay, however, Agatha is dropped at the School for Good while Sophie is delivered to the School for Evil. Agatha protests, wishing to return to Gavaldon, while Sophie insists she belongs in Good. Both girls seek out School Master Rhian and the magical Storian pen. He says he will only allow Sophie to switch schools if she can prove herself an Ever by attaining true love's kiss. She casts Prince Tedros, the son ofKing Arthur, as her true love and enlists Agatha's help.
Agatha and Sophie struggle in their respective classes and are outcast by their peers. Though Agatha is vocally critical of Good's superficiality, Ever Dean Clarissa Dovey argues her sense ofempathymakes her the first true princess in a long time. Meanwhile, Rafal manifests as awaspswarm and defends Sophie from another student's attack. Never Dean Leonora Lesso interprets this as Sophie's unique potential for winning a victory for Evil, something thought impossible for centuries.
When Sophie tries to get close to Tedros, Lesso cuts her hair to break her spirit. Under Rafal's influence, Sophie undergoes a radical change in appearance and personality; gaining the favor of the Nevers and rising to the unofficial position of leader of Evil's student body. Though she diverges from Agatha, the latter still tries to aid Sophie by using magic to bring her and Tedros together.
An Ever and a Never being together causes chaos between both schools; Rhian determines a "Trial by Tale" to settle the issue. During the Trial, Sophie ends up proving inept in defending herself and Tedros, prompting an infiltrating Agatha to save him in her stead. This results in him rejecting Sophie for choosing self-preservation over him, with the prince starting a relationship with Agatha.
Convinced by Rafal that Agatha is her enemy, Sophie accepts his offer of blood magic. Sophie incapacitates Dovey, Lesso, and the other school staff, and crashes the Evers' Ball, now physically transformed into ahag. She threatens Agatha and goads Tedros into attacking the School for Evil. However, by attacking, the Evers break the law of "Good defends, Evil attacks"; resulting in the Nevers and Evers magically switching appearances and a battle breaking out.
Sophie attempts to seek revenge on Rhian, who reveals himself to have been Rafal all along, having survived the fall and killed Rhian, assuming his identity and manipulating Good's stories to weaken it from within, favoring Evil. He then proposes he and Sophie rule together, declaring her his true love.
As they kiss, both Schools start collapsing, horrifying Sophie. When Agatha arrives, Rafal tries to impale her with the Storian, which he had forced to put in the story it has written. Sophie pushes Agatha out of the way and takes the fatal hit; her sacrifice undoes both Rafal's spell and already written fate on Agatha, saving everyone. Agatha, with a dying Sophie and Tedros's help, kills Rafal withExcalibur. She then kisses the dying Sophie goodbye; this demonstration of true love revives Sophie.
The Evers and Nevers reconcile, and the restored school staff decide to unite the two schools into one. A portal to Gavaldon opens, and Agatha kisses Tedros before crossing over with Sophie, returning to their old lives. However, a portal opens piercing the veil between worlds and an arrow flies through, with Tedros pleading he needs Agatha; the Storian then states that "this is only the beginning."

In 2011, studios reportedly considered a film adaptation based onThe School for Good and Evilseries.[37][38]Shortly after the publication of thefirst bookof the series in 2013,Roth Filmspartnered with Jane Startz Productions to acquire rights to produce a film based on the novel.[6]Universal Pictureswon the auction in a seven-figure deal for book and scriptwriting fees. Roth, Startz and Palak Patel were appointed producers. Chainani andMalia Scotch Marmowere hired to write the screenplay, with the former writing the initial two drafts.[39][40][41]In July 2015, Chainani stated he and Scotch Marmo finished writing the script.[42]
After the film languished indevelopment hell,[38]Netflixpurchased the rights with a new team that includedDavid MageeandLaura Solonas screenwriters in 2017.[41]The streaming service expressed interest in live-action family films since most family films were animated. Other studios frequently rejected big-budget productions because of the expenses or the risks of releasing a family film that was not based on preexisting intellectual property; however, Netflix's ambition to find films that appeal to all ages led it to buy those productions, such asThe School for Good and Evil.[43]
Paul Feigwas offered a spot as director, but he was hesitant due to the film's contrasts with his style and unfamiliar genre. However, he reconsidered after he read the script, in which he enjoyed the characters, story, and opportunities for world-building.[44]He was also interested in the relationships between the characters, as well as good and evil.[45]Feig aimed to depict the lead characters' female friendship interestingly, as such relationships were often portrayed contentiously onscreen.[46]Feig joined in 2020, with Roth,Jeffrey Kirschenbaum, Startz, Laura Fischer and Feig as producers, and Zack Roth,Patricia Riggenand Chainani as executive producers.[5][41]Netflix was supportive of Feig's rewrites and changes.[47]
Chainani said the film would be a "very different animal" from the book.[48]Feig stated that he is "very against any movies where you have to know things before you go there".[49]The scenes were retrofitted so that they would still be unique from the books, but in a way that would hopefully please the fans.[49]They often had to examine certain passages very closely to ensure they were not just recreating clichés.[44]While the novels are targeted towards young adults, Feig set out to create "an anti-Disney" film that, while reinterpreting fairy tales, also probed genuine issues and darkness. In the books, the students are in their mid-teenage years; Feig, however, believedThe School for Good and Evildid not necessarily need to be set at a high school. In the film, the students are approximately 18 to 19 years old.[45]As the film developed, the team required more money for various things; Netflix subsequently increased the budget.[47]
Fiona Weirwas appointed casting director.[50]Feig made note to select talented, nice, and cooperative actors;[51]Chainani stated casting was based on talent, not looks. Characters were reinterpreted to "make sure [their] spirit ... is best embodied in that particular actor".[52]According to Chainani, casting Hester was difficult due to her "very, very specific energy".[53]Laurence Fishburnejoined the cast as the School Master due to his daughter's love for the books, which she started reading as atween.[54]
ActressesSophia Anne CarusoandSofia Wyliewere cast in the roles of Sophie and Agatha, respectively.[14]Caruso learned ofThe School for Good and Evilafter a general meeting with Feig. The script was sent to her shortly after; Caruso was impressed by the writing. However, Feig's collaborative and optimistic attitude, as well as his acting experience, was what ultimately persuaded Caruso to join the cast.[55]Wylie auditioned for Agatha through a series of self-tapes and a chemistry read with Caruso.[56]Feig said she submitted the "most amazing audition" and wanted to cast her immediately.[57]According to Caruso, Wylie was clearly "easy to talk to and friendly", with the two having "an immediate connection".[56]
AfterCharlize Theronhad completed work onF9(2021), Kirschenbaum spoke to her about portraying "a different kind" of villain.[58]She previously acted in many fantasy films, such asSnow White and the Huntsman(2012). Feig, who had worked with her onArrested Development(2005),[57]expected her to decline the role due toThe School for Good and Evil'ssimilarities to her other films. However, Lady Lesso differed from her other roles as a teacher who relished evil, allowing Theron to "have much more fun in a way than some of those movies where you have to be very serious".[44]
Feig had long sought to collaborate withKerry Washington, but their schedules had never allowed it. He knew as soon as he read Professor Dovey's role that he wanted only Washington to play the part, partially due to her comedic skills.[44]Compelled by the idea of working with Feig and Theron, Washington accepted. After readingThe School for Good and Evil, she realized that Dovey was different from any character she had portrayed, being "so larger than life and filled with light, and [having] a lot of comedic beats". For the character's foundation, Washington made the decision to draw on real-life examples. She gave considerable thought to thearchetypeof fairy godmothers andfinishing schools, as well as one of her instructors atSpence School, anall-girls schoolin New York that she had attended.[58]
Feig did not want the film to look similar to theHarry Potterfilm seriesand thus chose Andy Nicholson as production designer.[44]Due to Feig's dislike ofgreen screensand hope for "the characters and the actors to be performing in that world so they become part of it",[44]much of the scenery was constructed, including the Schools for Good and Evil.[59]The twosound stagesconstructed atBelfast HarbourStudios played a crucial role in that.[45]The only scenes that used green screens were those in the beginning and those including Rafal, since the skies had to be altered.[60]The film's style takes inspiration fromArt Nouveau, which Feig noticed while filmingSpy(2015) inBudapest, Hungary. Feig stated that this avoided comparisons to other films, being "both garish and over the top".[21]Nicholson subsequently incorporated elements from other architects, includingAntoni GaudíandVictor Horta, creating "this big melting point of design".[45]The team was allowed to "take over"St Anne's Cathedral. During the two weeks they worked there, the crew transformed the area into "this big, almost sound-stage type space ... with so much detail".[61]
Over 800 costumes and 600 pairs of shoes were produced by more than 70 costumers.[45]The costumes maintained the design's individuality and distinctiveness, with Reneé Kalfus and Feig designing them. For the creative team, it felt fitting that each character would bring their own sense of style and culture given that many of the characters are the children of well-known fairy tale characters. Feig said he allowed Kalfus creative freedom with this concept.[45]The costumes were inspired by a variety of media, including classic fairy tales andBeyoncé.[62]The actors were encouraged to contribute to their costumes. In particular, Theron wanted Lesso to have a tailored and severe silhouette; she also suggested the ginger hair and showed Feig various reference photos.[44]Caruso discussed Sophie's evolution of style with Kalfus, including with "princessy" dresses and "potato sack" uniform at the School for Evil. She eventually transitions intopunkglam costumes, which Caruso felt needed "such a specific type of hot that suits her fiery spirit".[56]Wylie insisted on keeping her curly hair, wanting to show such hair can still be associated with princesses.[a][62]Professor Dovey's blondbouffantwig took seven weeks to produce, including one to create its color; designer Linda Villalobos chose its look to highlight her goodness and prevent her from looking evil, as well as demonstrate texture.[63][64]The wolf characters are portrayed by men in suits wearinganimatronicheads so the actors had something to act against.[60]
According to Feig, filming on location was essential in order to avoid overusing special effects.[61]Netflix was unable to shoot the production at itsShepperton StudiosinSurrey, because it was too small; they decided to instead film at Northern Ireland for the first time. Feig selected its cityBelfastas the filming location, as he had friends who had shot there, including production members fromGame of Thrones(2011–2019). He also cited its close proximity to London, which would make travel between the two cities easy, though this was not the case due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[47]The film was shot at several locations in Belfast, including Belfast Harbour Studios[65][66]and Loop Film Studios.[67][68][69]At the former, the full 125,000 sq ft (11,600 m2) of the studio, workshop and office space was used.[65]Derrywas also considered as a filming location but was rejected for numerous reasons.[70][71]Local sitesThe School for Good and Evilwas filmed at includeSt Peter's Church;[72]St Anne's Cathedral;Mount Stewart;Ulster Folk Museum;Clandeboye Estate; Woodburn Forest;Castle Archdale;[1]andAntrim Road.[73]
Production followed the British Film Commission safe working protocols due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[74][75]Feig was particularly pleased to film at Big Dog Forest inFermanagh, since he thought building such a place would be impossible.[45]Some crew members tried to persuade him against filming there,[b]but he insisted because the forest was unlike anything he had ever seen.[76]In January 2021, it was reported filming had begun.[77]The crew encountered difficulties with shooting on the first day, as it rained heavily, creating puddles of mud.[45]Roughly 350 to 500 crew members worked onThe School for Good and Evil, the majority of whom were locals.[78][79]Filming wrapped at the end of July 2021.[38][80]
"[Norby and I wanted to] mak[e] sure that this all feels like it's real world, even though there's magic in this world, we want to make sure everything plays by the rules of physics, because I have no interest in creating something that's just all magic and has no grounding in the real world."
After the film wrapped, Feig began editing,[51]with Erik Nordby as effects supervisor.[44]The film'svisual effectswere provided by British companiesDNEG,Framestore, andCinesite.[81][82][83]Feig hoped for the film's world to have a sense of realism, despite its magical aspects, which he tried to keepelemental;[44][84]an example is the stymph. In the books, it is a bird made of bones that takes children to the Schools for Good and Evil. The team wanted it to be sentient while retaining its bones. They researched bird skeletons and decayed birds, studying the way the tissue and feathers stay on the bones, and the interactions of these three things.[44]The team usedcomputer-generated imageryto add expressions and emotions to the animatronic characters.[84]
The film's score was composed byTheodore Shapiro.
Film marketer Lee Schroder served asThe School for Good and Evil'spublicist.[85]In May 2021, three first-look images were posted on Washington, Theron and Feig's social medias, featuring the former two dressed in their respective roles.[86][87][88]Hundreds of responses were posted on Twitter; many fans were impressed and conveyed desires for sequels.[89]In June of that year, during Netflix's virtual fan event Geeked Week, the first teaser was released. It depicted a coven of witches walking towards the screen.[29]The School for Good and Evilwas announced as part of Netflix's 2022 film slate and appeared in a "movie preview" video.[90][91]Washington and Theron are featured in their costumes,[92]in addition to female characters fighting and a shot of the fantasy setting.[93]

GamesRadar+,GoldDerby, andThe Cinemaholicdescribed reviews as "mixed",[130][131][132]whileTimeandHuffPostsaid they were "mostly negative".[133][134]According toThe Independent, journalists were "quick to tear apart" the film.[135]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 37% of 67 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "The cast is game and the visuals are dazzling, but a deeply derivative narrative meansThe School for Good and Evilflunks on the storytelling front."[136]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 30 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[137]Many reviewers thoughtThe School for Good and Evil'sstory would work better as a television series,[135]and they compared the film to theHarry Potterfilm series.[133]

Others found fault with the writing, such as the deviations from the book's plot, and disliked Tedros's dark hair, which is blond in the books.[133][140]Viewers praised the actors, however,[133]particularly Wylie.[140]

In a 2008 interview, she maintained that she was "an actor who sings", and thankful she "had a voice".[17]

As Jolly, a part inspired by Mr. Mamet's real-life sister and his realized female character, Ms. LuPone finds conflicting layers of past and present selves in practically every line.

It was like Beirut, and I fought like a banshee."[30]Despite the trouble, LuPone won her firstTony Awardfor Best Actress in a Musical.[31]"Don't Cry For Me, Argentina", a song she performed for the show, became one of her signature songs throughout her career.[32]It was not until she had reprised the role in a production inSydneywhen she had finally enjoyed the part and felt comfortable singing the score.[33][34]LuPone and her co-star,Mandy Patinkin, remained close friends both on and off the stage.

Nowadays Ms. LuPone generates more raw excitement than any other performer on the Broadway and cabaret axis, with the possible exception ofLiza Minnelli.... And her brilliant show, conceived and directed by her long-time collaborator, Scott Wittman, deserves many lives, perhaps even a Broadway run in an expanded edition. It certifies Ms. LuPone's place in the lineage of quirky internationalchanteuseslikeLotte Lenya,Marlene DietrichandEdith Piaf, who, like Ms. LuPone, conquered show business with forceful, outsize personalities while playing by their own musical rules.[122]
She also appeared as the inaugural act at the Sharon L. Morse Entertainment Center inThe Villages, Florida, on April 30, 2015, to a sold-out audience of residents mainly 55 years-of-age and older.[123]
LuPone is widely regarded as one of the greatest Broadway performers of her generation,[29][124][125][126]and one of the most influential actors in musical theater.[127]The London Timesonce nicknamed her the "first lady of the theater",[29]and American-British journalistHadley Freemandeclared her "the queen of Broadway" and "the goddess of the modern musical".[128]In 2010, theatre criticCharles McNultywrote that her stage presence demonstrates a ferocity that, when paired with the right material, resembles "a return to agolden agewhen powerhouses ruled Broadway".[124]AllMusicbiographer William Ruhlmann noted that, unlike her predecessorsMary MartinandEthel Merman, LuPone was never afforded the luxury to seamlessly transition between musical productions, instead using lulls in her Broadway career to diversify her endeavors by appearing in plays, films, television, nightclubs, concert tours, and recording solo studio albums.[125]According to Susan Vaughn of theLos Angeles Times, LuPone is mostly known for playing "larger-than-life characters" on stage,[29]whereas Adam Sandel ofThe Advocateobserved "she's often played women who've fought like hell to overcome obstacles through the sheer force of indomitable will".[129]She has also played many Jewish women, both on stage and screen, despite not identifying as Jewish herself.[13][130][131]LuPone believes she is often cast in ethnic parts because of her Italian heritage andprominent facial features, which allow her to play more interesting female roles.[130]At the same time, she has expressed frustration at frequently being overlooked for roles she believes she is best suited for, often in favor of less qualified actors,[126]and insists she has been bullied by Broadway professionals for much of her career.[132]
Music and theatre critics have described LuPone as amezzo-soprano,[133][134][135]whichThe Seattle Timessaid can equally "blast a big showtune out of the park, or sweetly murmur a lullaby".[136]Vocally, she is known for her powerful, emotive style of belting,[128]and according to Nerelle Harper ofQNewsset a new standard "for a modern generation of high-belt thrill trillers".[137]To cope with some vocally demanding roles such asEvita, during which she lost her voice several times, she remained silent when not performing and limited social activities.[138]After undergoing surgery to treatvocal nodulesduring the 1990s,[139]she learned how to sing in a moreoperaticmanner to preserve her voice, prior to which she admitted to relying on "sheer guts and willpower" to belt.[29]She credits vocal coachJoan Laderwith saving her career and teaching her "a technique to allow me to continue to sing with the strength and the clarity".[139]LuPone has performed some operatic roles, despite having no formal operatic training.[140]She has performed in severalSondheim musicals, and credits the composer with making her a better singer due to the difficulty of his material.[141]In return, Sondheim has praised her singing, acting, and attention to detail, and thanked her for "enhancing my shows — and everyone else's for that matter".[55]According to Andrew Gans ofPlaybill, LuPone belongs to a handful of singing actors who "are masters of stillness, bringing songs to full life with an inner well of emotions that seep out in unexpected and heartbreaking moments".[142]However, her trademarkdictionhas been criticized for sounding unclear,[143][144][145][146]including by collaboratorsAndrew Lloyd WebberandJohn Houseman, the latter of whom reportedly strangled her over her enunciation.[132]LuPone admitted that her emotional acting choices can compromise her diction.[132]In addition to Sondheim, LuPone has identified performersEdith Piaf,Bette Davis, andDavid Mametas influences,[147]and expressed admiration for stage actressesAngela Lansbury,Zoe Caldwell, andElaine Stritch, all of whose signature roles she would eventually play herself.[13]
The media has described LuPone as a polarizing entertainer,[124]equally praised and criticized for her talent and unfiltered opinions.[147][148]McNulty observed that critics have alternated betweenpigeonholingher into specific genres or underappreciating her vibrancy.[124]She has been labeled adivafor much of her career,[128][149]which journalists attribute to both her talent and high standards,[128][137]and perceived demanding temperament on and off-stage.[138][132]Ruhlmann said her reported "cold, dark" persona allowed her to excel playing "the kinds ofanti-heroineswho peopled the musicals of the later decades of the 20th century".[125]LuPone has been described by some as difficult to work with,[124][138]a reputation she attributes to sexism and the way assertive women are often perceived in the industry.[55]Theatre criticBen Brantleyreported that the fallout fromSunset Boulevarddamaged LuPone's public image and relegated her Broadway appearances to one-woman and non-musical shows, until she returned to musical theater in the early 2000s.[150]Meanwhile, herEvitaco-starMandy Patinkindefended her as a sensitive performer who "can't let certain feelings go, which is a burden and a blessing. She fights through it all and gives everything, until there's nothing left in her".[55]Herfanbasehas been nicknamed "LuPonistas",[29][151][152]and she has often been hired to play exaggerated versions of herself in television and film, representing "the symbol of Broadway musical theater", according toTime Out's Adam Feldman.[126]
LuPone is known for her candid and outspoken nature,[129]a trait she attributes to her upbringing.[13]She has stated that her forthrightness has occasionally led to professional setbacks, beginning with her time promotingEvita.[13]Her unfiltered remarks and actions have often made headlines, including instances ofgoing off-scriptduring performances.[127]A vocal critic of the commercialization of Broadway, LuPone has likened its current state to Las Vegas,[13][132][126][153]arguing that shows should have limited runs to allow space for fresh, innovative productions.[13]She has also expressed a disdain for red carpet events, noting that her tendency to "speak [her] truth" can be at odds with the expected decorum of such occasions.[128]Additionally, LuPone has been outspoken about theater etiquette, frequently voicing concerns over disruptive behavior by some audience members.[154]She is widely regarded as agay icon,[155]which LuPone attributes to fans recognizing that she has "had to fight, like the LGBTQ community has had to fight for identity. For a simple way to live. For acceptance".[156]
LuPone is married to Matthew Johnston. The couple's wedding ceremony was on the stage of theVivian Beaumont Theaterat Lincoln Center on December 12, 1988, after filming the TV movieLBJ; Johnston was a cameraman.[157]They have one child.[50]They reside inEdisto Beach, South Carolina,[158]andKent, Connecticut.[159]In the 1970s, LuPone dated actorKevin Klinefor seven years, after the two met as students atJuilliard.[160]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
