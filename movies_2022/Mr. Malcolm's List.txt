The beautiful Julia Thistlewaite attends the opera with the most eligible bachelor of the season, Mr. Jeremy Malcolm. After she fails to impress him, she is widely mocked in acaricature. Julia employs her cousin, the feckless Lord Cassidy, to see what she has done to offend Mr. Malcolm. Malcolm reveals to Cassidy that he has a list of requirements for a wife that Julia did not meet. Cassidy lets this slip to Julia, who is offended.
Julia decides to invite her friend, Selina Dalton, to London to try and exact revenge on Mr. Malcolm, training her reluctant friend to act as the perfect potential bride.
On the night she is to meet Malcolm, Selina accidentally runs into him in theorangery. There, the two debate philosophy and are immediately attracted to one another. When they are formally introduced, Malcolm invites Selina to the museum with him, where he pleads his case that he and Julia had a very weak connection. While there, the two run into Captain Ossery, with whom Selina was previously acquainted, having served as his aunt's companion in Bath.
The following day, Ossery invites Selina to walk with him and formally announces his intention to court her, as his aunt's final letter to him expresses her desire for the two of them to be matched.
Malcolm does not stop his pursuit of Selina, who, aided by Julia's machinations, continues to present as his perfect woman. When Julia and Selina accidentally run into Selina's vulgar cousin, Gertie Covington, Julia claims her as her relation. Malcolm later privately tells Selina he is glad she is not related to someone so crass, and Selina is upset by the news. When Malcolm learns the truth, he privately apologizes to Selina and even extends an invitation to Gertie to join him and the rest of the party at his country estate, where he intends to propose to Selina.
Julia decides that Malcolm is suitably in love with Selina and decides it is time for her to reject him. However, Selina reveals she no longer wants to proceed with the plan, as she believes Malcolm is honourable and has no intention of hurting Julia.
At a masquerade, where Malcolm plans to propose to Selina, Julia has her maid call away Selina and lock her in a room before sending a message to Malcolm to meet him in secret while posing as Selina. When Malcolm proposes, Julia rejects him and runs away, only to be immediately found out by Selina, Malcolm, and Ossery. She reveals Malcolm's rejection still hurts her and that Selina was a participant in her scheme, causing Malcolm to become upset and reject Selina as well.
The following day, a guilt-ridden Julia tries another scheme to reunite Malcolm and Selina but is dissuaded by Ossery, who confesses he has fallen in love with her. Malcolm and Selina later find themselves alone in the garden, and Malcolm accuses Selina of trying to trap him in an engagement. Infuriated, she wishes him luck with his list.
After Julia apologizes, Selina decides to leave for home. As she does, Malcolm's mother blames her son for Selina's departure, revealing that she was the one who plotted to leave the two alone in the garden. Malcolm chases after Selina and gives her a new list of everything he is looking for in a wife, the sole line reading "Selina Dalton."

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
