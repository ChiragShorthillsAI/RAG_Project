"South Park The Streaming Wars"[a]is a 2022 Americanadult animatedcomedytelevision specialepisode written and directed byTrey Parker. It is the thirdSouth Parktelevision special produced forParamount+and was released on June 1, 2022.[2][3]It also serves as the 318th overall episode of the television series.
Denveris experiencing a large drought caused byManBearPig, resulting in drying streams and discussions about reinstituting watering restrictions. The protesting citizens, includingwaterparkownerPi Pi, are told that the city's water sees use in agriculture.
In South Park,Stan MarshandTolkien Blackare concerned about the former's father,Randy, who is derisively referred to as "Karen". Randy andSteve Black's arguing is interrupted by a Denver water commissioner examining the water supplies at their respective farms. Meanwhile,Eric Cartmanis despondent over residing in the abandoned hot dog stand. He is intrigued when he notices construction on a house across the street for golf course owner Talnua Cussler. Cartman suggests to his mother,Liane, that she getbreast implantsto attract Cussler. Liane refuses, Cartman says he doesn't want to continue living like this, Liane points out he is the one who made her quit her job, but Cartman completelyignoringhis fault, Liane informs Cartman of the cost of such a surgery is $10,000.
Steve learns that he can sell some of his water supply if the stream reaches Denver'sreservoir. At Stan and Tolkien's suggestion, they craft a small boat and send it downstream. The experiment is successful, and Steve begins accepting subscriptions to his streaming service, including Pi Pi. When Steve is told to send boats downstream daily, he pays Stan and Tolkien to increase their production. Randy becomes frustrated at Steve's success, so Stan and Tolkien agree to build him craft boats as well. They recruitKyle Broflovski,Kenny McCormickandButters Stotchto help them as demand increases; they initially refuse to recruit Cartman, but relent when Cartman tells them his mom needs surgery (leaving out the crucial detail of the type of surgery). Cussler offers Stan and Tolkien $15,000 for 10,000 boats, thus covering the surgery's cost. Cartman tries to surprise Liane with the surgery, but she stands by her earlier decision, as making her quit her job was the last straw she no longer giving in to his demands. He threatens to have the surgery done to himself, but Liane remains unfazed, allowing the surgery to proceed.
When Steve sees a report about ManBearPig's environmental damage, he hikes up the mountains to see for himself. He approaches a dying real estate agent, who tells Steve that a large swath of land near the streams has been sold to a wealthy buyer. When Randy sails one of his boats downstream, it is sunk by Cussler Industries boats. Randy confronts Stan about Cussler's boats and demands that he end their deal. When they visit Cussler's house, they find that he was killed by ManBearPig, and Randy wonders if Stan is in danger. At Pi Pi's Splashtown, Steve tells Pi Pi that he will have to cancel the waterpark's streaming rights to provide water to his farm. Pi Pi refuses, revealing that he is collaborating with the water commissioner and ManBearPig. Steve realizes that Pi Pi purchased the land in the mountains when ManBearPig attacks, stabbing Steve and throwing him out a window down awater slide. Pi Pi later reveals to the water commissioner his plan to replace all of Denver's water with his park's urine-contaminated water. He betrays the commissioner and has ManBearPig attack him in a similar fashion to Steve.
At school, Stan warns the others of Cussler's death when Cartman arrives with his breast implants. Tolkien's mother, Linda, calls him to inform him of Steve's disappearance. The people of Denver waste their water supply as the reservoir is slowly draining, while Randy investigates Cussler and the commissioner's histories.
On August 5, 2021,Comedy Centralannounced that Parker and Stone had signed a $900 million deal for extending the series to 30 seasons through 2027 and 14 feature-length films, exclusive to Paramount+.[4]It was eventually confirmed that they would be rolled out as two "events" per year.[5]Parker and Stone would later state that the projects would not be feature films, and that it wasViacomCBSwho decided to advertise them as movies.[6]Subsequent advertising and branding has indicated that these are more properly classified as television specials.
"The Streaming Wars"' release date and synopsis was released on May 11, 2022.[2]
John Schwarz ofBubbleblabberrated the episode a 9 out of 10, stating that the episode "continues to showcase the franchise creators' advanced forward thinking that seems to just be far beyond reach of what we deem reality". Schwarz also compared the episode to the episode "Dead Kids", stating it "also features a litany of hilarious gags that, like 'Dead Kids', help you forget the seriousness of the matter at hand, but the signs are still all there."[7]
Kayla Cobb ofDecidernoted in her recap that the ongoing references of the water streams from the various farms was a reference to the abundance ofstreaming services. As Cobb recapped a speech given by Butters about the state of streaming services, she commented "It's unknown if the monologue is something(Matt) Stoneand(Trey) Parkerhave personally experienced or if they're reading the industry room, so to speak. For example, we don’t know ifParamount's reshuffling caused the company to lose a key player in one of South Park's deals or if there have been creative disputes between Stone, Parker,Paramount+, and this Paramount Global-owned version of Viacom. However, it's rare for the duo to get this specific and longwinded unless they're personally infuriated. It just goes to show that even TV's $900 million men have no idea what's happening."[8]
Spencer Legacy ofComingsoon.netrated the episode a 7 out of 10, and stated in the review the episode "juggles a few too many elements later on, as the introduction of ManBearPig in relation to streaming is seemingly random. There’s probably an argument to make about streaming services contributing to climate change, but that’s not a recent or major news story, so the connection seems odd. But even if the link is hazy at best, it's still quite funny to drag out that long-running bit." The website explains that the rating equates to "Good" and "A successful piece of entertainment that is worth checking out, but it may not appeal to everyone."[9]
Cathal Gunning ofScreen Rantwrote about the ending of the episode, and stated the ending "is a bleak one that will be familiar to fans of the classicfilm noirChinatown. The evil Pi Pi ends up achieving all of his goals, with ManBearPig tearing down the dam holding Denver's water supply in reserve while the local citizens unknowingly waste their precious, limited water. The true meaning of theSouth Parkspecial is that real-life companies are doing the same thing, with Pi Pi standing in for corporations profiting offwater scarcitywhile ManBearPig acts as an allegory for climate change."[10]

Comedy Centralis an Americancablechannelowned byParamount Globalthrough itsnetworkdivision'sMTV Entertainment Groupunit, based inManhattan. The channel carries comedy programming in the form of both original, licensed, andsyndicatedtelevision series,stand-up comedyspecials, andfeature films.
As of November 2023[update], Comedy Central is available to approximately 68,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2011 peak of 99,000,000 households.[1]
On November 15, 1989,Time-Life, the owners ofHBO, launchedThe Comedy Channelas the firstcable channeldevoted exclusively to comedy-based programming. On April 1, 1990,Viacom(who ownedMTV,VH1, andNickelodeon) launched a rival channel calledHa![2]that featured reruns ofsituation comediesand some originalsketch comedy.
The Comedy Channel's programs were broadcast from the HBO Downtown Studios at 120 East 23rd Street in Manhattan. The format prior to the merger with Ha! included several original and unconventional programs such asOnion WorldwithRich HallandMystery Science Theater 3000, as well as laid-back variety/talk shows hosted by comedians, includingThe Sweet LifewithRachel Sweet,Night After Night with Allan Havey,Sports Monster, andThe Higgins Boys and Gruber, the latter of whom performed sketches in between showings of vintage television series likeSupercar,Clutch Cargo, andLancelot Link, Secret Chimp.
The standard format for The Comedy Channel's shows usually involved the various hosts introducing clips culled from the acts of stand-up comedians as well as classic comedies of the 1970s and 1980s, such asYoung FrankensteinandKentucky Fried Movie, presented in a style similar to music videos. In the early days, certain hours of the day when clips were shown without "host segments" were dubbedShort Attention Span Theater. In 1990, hosts under this title,Jon StewartandPatty Rosborough, were introduced. ComedianMarc Maronalso hosted the series.
While The Comedy Channel broadcast mostly low-budget original programming,[3]Ha!'s schedule featured sitcom and sketch comedy reruns (many of which had been previously licensed for sister networkNick at Nite) as well as complete 90-minute reruns ofSaturday Night Livefrom the sixth through 16th seasons.
After two years of limited distribution, the two channels merged into one, relaunching onApril 1, 1991, asCTV: The Comedy Network. On June 1, 1991, the network changed its name to Comedy Central[4]to prevent issues with theCanadianbroadcast television networkCTV, which would eventually be its Canadian content partner throughThe Comedy Networkwhen that channel started operations six years later.
Around this time, the network introduced their now-iconic logo, which is a globe showing theAmericaswith tall buildings on theNorth Americanpart and a black marquee ring (see below).
Comedy Partners was originally a partnership ofHome Box Office, Inc., the subsidiary ofTime Warnerthat owned The Comedy Channel and HBO's half and Viacom Hearty Ha! Ha!LLC, the subsidiary that owned Ha! and Viacom's half of the network during its first years on air.[5]Viacom bought out AOL Time Warner's half in April 2003 for $1.23 billion.[6]Despite HBO's exit from the venture, the Viacom Media Networks division in charge of Comedy Central is still called Comedy Partners, currently being apartnershipofParamount Global Content Distribution, the operating subsidiary of Paramount of whichParamount Media Networksis a division and Viacom Hearty Ha! Ha!LLC, the subsidiary that owned Ha! and Viacom's original half of the network.[7]
From the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, much of theprogrammingon Comedy Central and its predecessors consisted ofcomedy films, sitcom reruns, half-hour specials, and clip shows featuring comedians. Except for the cult favoriteMystery Science Theater 3000, the channel had a relatively small viewership. A notable early success wasPolitically IncorrectwithBill Maher, which after showing promise on Comedy Central was quickly snapped up byABC. Additionally,The Daily Showhad got its start with original hostCraig Kilborn, although it would take a few more years for the show to reach high popularity (and a shift toward a focus on political humor) with the introduction ofJon Stewartin 1999[8](who was former co-host ofShort Attention Span Theaterfrom 1991).
Dr. Katz, Professional Therapistwas also a notable original program from this era, as well as the game showWin Ben Stein's Money. Successful non-original programming included Canadian comedy groupThe Kids in the Halland British shows such as the UK edition ofWhose Line Is It Anyway?(the predecessor of the U.S. version, featuring much of the same American cast as would later be seen in the U.S.) and the sitcomAbsolutely Fabulous. Some later seasons ofAbFab, as it was informally known, were partially financed by Comedy Central. Comedy Central also had the national rights to broadcast reruns of Seattle'sAlmost Live!between 1992 and 1993.
The channel made a breakthrough whenSouth Parkpremiered in 1997. Being one of the first major basic cable shows to carry theTV-MArating for mature audiences, the show was considered too controversial to be picked up by any mainstream network;[9]For example,Fox(known forThe Simpsons) refused to pick up the series due to the over-the-top offensive content at the time. Asword of mouthspread, the number of people who requested that Comedy Central should be added to their cable providers increased, and the channel became available in over 50% of American homes by 1998.
On October 30, 2000, Comedy Central introduced a modernized version of its globe logo, by straightening and modernizing the buildings as well as removing the transmitter and marquee. The management of the network said that the transmitter of the 1991 logo was said to "communicate the 1950s broadcast era". In 2002,Comedy Central Recordswas formed as a means of releasing albums by comedians that have appeared on the network.[10]
By 2003,Viacomgained full ownership of Comedy Central, and since 2003, Comedy Central has created atraditionof roasting comedians in the style of theNew York Friars' Clubroasts. During these roasts, friends of the roastee, along with other comedians, take turns making fun of the roastee, the other roasters, and occasionally audience members. So far, the roastees have includedDenis Leary,[11]Jeff Foxworthy,[12]Pamela Anderson,[13]William Shatner,[14]Flavor Flav,[15]Bob Saget,Larry the Cable Guy,Joan Rivers,Rob Reiner,David Hasselhoff,Donald Trump,Charlie Sheen,Roseanne Barr,James Franco,Justin Bieber,Rob Lowe,Bruce Willis, andAlec Baldwin.
The success ofSouth Park, despite its mature content, encouraged the network to continue to push the limits on adult language. Every late Friday (early Saturday morning) and Saturday night (early Sunday morning) at 1 a.m.ET/PT, a movie, comedy special, or animated program is shown unedited for language as part of a block called theSecret Stash. It premiered on July 4, 2003, with the unedited cable television debut ofSouth Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.[a]Though no language is censored on the Secret Stash, most nudity in the programs is still edited out, except for limited nudity allowed in animated programs such asDrawn Together, andrear nudity.
In late 2004, it was reported that the four highest-rated shows on Comedy Central were, in descending order,South Park,Chappelle's Show,The Daily ShowandReno 911!. Shortly thereafter,Dave Chappellebacked out of the much-anticipated third season ofChappelle's Show.[16]Meanwhile,The Daily Showcontinued to climb in the ratings. In October 2005, on the occasion of a new three-year contract forSouth Parkand the launch ofDaily Showspin-offThe Colbert Report, it was reported thatSouth ParkandThe Daily Showwere the two highest-ratedshows on Comedy Central. Comedy Central chiefDoug Herzogwas reported as saying that he hoped to continue to air new seasons ofSouth Parkforever, and thatThe Colbert Reportfulfilled a long-held plan to extend theDaily Showbrand.
On April 5, 2006, in a controversial two-part episode arc titled "Cartoon Wars Part I" and "Cartoon Wars Part II",South Parktouched the issue of therecent protestover the Danish cartoon drawings depicting the Muslim prophetMuhammad. The image of Muhammad did not appear in the episode. The episode also mocked fellow cartoonFamily Guy. On April 13, 2006, Comedy Central issued a statement[17]which appears to confirm that the network prohibited the show's creators from airing an image of Muhammad. The statement reads,"In light of recent world events, we feel we made the right decision."An anonymous source close to the show indicated[citation needed]thatSouth ParkcreatorsTrey ParkerandMatt Stonewere informed of the policy several weeks earlier and wrote this story arc in protest. This was a change of policy for Comedy Central, having allowedSouth Parkto portray an image of Muhammad in an earlier episode, "Super Best Friends". Oddly enough, an image of Muhammad was still briefly visible in the opening credits of the "Cartoon Wars" episodes (the image had been there as a call-back to "Super Best Friends").
On January 15, 2007, MTV Networks International launched Comedy Central in Germany which is available for free throughout Europe. The channel airs 33 shows either dubbed in German or subtitled while also airing locally produced shows.[18]On April 30, Dutch channelThe Boxwas relaunched as the Dutch version of Comedy Central during theprimetimeand overnight hours timesharing withNickelodeon.[19]On May 1, 2007, Comedy Central expanded to Italy, replacing Paramount Comedy.[20]
On June 27, 2007,CTVglobemedia-owned networksCTVandThe Comedy Networkobtained the exclusive Canadian rights to the entire Comedy Central library of past and current programs on all electronic platforms, under a multi-year agreement withViacom, expanding on past programming agreements between the two channels. Canadian users attempting to visit Comedy Central websites were redirected to The Comedy Network's website. The Canadian channel retains its brand name, but the agreement is otherwise very similar to the earlier CTV–Viacom deal forMTV in Canada.[21]As of 2011, this geocaching no longer applies and both the Comedy Central and The Comedy Network websites can be accessed worldwide, except for videos which remain only accessible within each respective country.
In December 2007, Comedy Central picked up a show hosted byLewis BlackcalledLewis Black's Root of All Evil,[22]which debuted in March 2008. On January 9, 2008, it was announced the Comedy Central and MTV would allow the streaming its programs online for free starting in February that year.[23]On January 24, Scott Landsman became the Vice President of Original Programming and Development at the network.[24]

The grant allowed Comedy Central to broadcast on theterrestrialtelevision network between January 1, 2009, and March 31, 2014, after which a new request had to be submitted to continue broadcasting.[25]Comedy Central's U.S. flagship network picked up a remake ofThe Gong Showhosted byDave Attell,[26]star of his former self-titled Comedy Central seriesInsomniac, which debuted in July 2008. Another new show calledReality Bites Back[27]premiered afterThe Gong Show with Dave Attell.

The network also played a role in the revival of the animated seriesFuturama, whichFoxhad canceled in 2003. New episodes began airing on Comedy Central in 2010. But in May 2013, Comedy Central released a statement saying that the contract betweenFuturamaand Comedy Central would not be renewed and that the summer of 2013 would beFuturama's final season on the air. However, episodes continue to run weekly on Comedy Central.[33]
In 2009, Comedy Central launched a1080ihigh definitionsimulcastfeed,[34]which was available on all major cable and satellite providers. The standard definition Comedy Central downscales the HD feed and broadcasts in 16:9 letterboxed to fit the 4:3 ratio. The network also introduced the Internet viral video reaction showTosh.0, hosted by comedianDaniel Tosh. During its second year in the summer of 2010, it became the most viewed show; overtakingThe Daily ShowandThe Colbert Reportfor male audiences aged 18–49.[citation needed]Segments fromTosh.0's past seasons have received more views on Comedy Central'sYouTubechannel than any other show.
South Parkepisodes "200" and "201" aired in April 2010, revisiting the issue of the Islamic religious figureMuhammad's perceived immunity to parody, for fear of violent retaliation. The Super Best Friends returned, but Muhammad was entirely covered by a black bar reading "CENSORED" through all of his screen time. By the second episode of the two-parter, Comedy Central decided to censor every instance of his name, as well as three entire monologues, from the end of the show. The monologues dealt with the subjects of censorship and intimidation but did not use Muhammad's name.Trey ParkerandMatt Stonehave since issued a statement to the press, confirming that the "bleeps" were added weeks after the show was finished and that Comedy Central has refused to let them post the original version ofSouth Park, in addition to retroactively removing the original "Super Best Friends" episode.Trey Parkerthreatened to quit the show after this incident.[35]
On December 9, 2010, Comedy Central introduced a new logo for the network that launched on January 1, 2011, which left behind the previous theme of a world-sized "tower" broadcasting the network/skyscrapers, in favor of an image of two "C"'s, with one of them and the word "Central" turned upside-down within the new logomark. The new logo was designed to represent the network's unique brand of comedy (with some drawing comparisons to thecopyright symbolas inspiration for its design and use), and to provide the network with a logo that could be easily used across different platforms, such as social media. However, the "bars" version of the logo used from 2000 to 2011 was intended to be Comedy Central's new logo as part of a planned rebranding in 2010, and the network used it short-lived until the network started a logo nicknamed the "Comedymark".[36][37]The logo's resemblance to the one used by theFederal Communications Commissionwas also pointed out.[38][39]It went on to win several industry awards.[40]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
