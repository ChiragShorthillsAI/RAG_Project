Prey for the Devilis a 2022 Americansupernatural horror filmabout a nun who trains as anexorcistunder theRoman Catholic Churchand confrontsdemonic possession. The film is produced under the studioLionsgateand is directed byDaniel Stamm. It starsJacqueline Byers,Colin Salmon,Christian Navarro,Lisa Palfrey,Nicholas Ralph,Virginia Madsen, andBen Cross. Lionsgate distributedPrey for the Devilin theaters in the United States and Canada on October 28, 2022. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed $44.7 million worldwide.
In response to a global rise in demonic possessions, theCatholic Churchreopens exorcism schools to train priests in the Rite of Exorcism.
Although nuns are forbidden to perform exorcisms, Father Quinn recognizes Sister Ann's gifts, including empathy with possessed victims of demons, and agrees to train her. Thrust onto the spiritual frontline with fellow student Father Dante, Ann finds herself in a battle for the soul of a young girl, Natalie, who she believes is possessed by a demon who tormented Ann's mentally unstable mother years ago.
Ann attends classes, against some resistance from staff members and amusement by some priests. Frightening events begin to happen to her, such as disturbing visions and memories, and an elderly, possessed male patient harassing her and dancing with her against her will when she is trapped in his room. However, Ann persists in her quest, delving into secret archives with the help of Dante, and looking into the histories of "terminal cases" likely to die, and of one woman who was released from the institute.
Ann helps exorcise Dante's troubled sister, apparently successfully. However, the school's leadership and the Cardinal tell her next morning that the woman killed herself. Ann unhappily concludes that she will go back to her old convent in response to the tragedy. However, Dante drops by and says that Natalie, who had recovered and left the school, has had a relapse and is likely to be sent to the Vatican as a "terminal case". He convinces her to sneak into the school with him and exorcise Natalie.
Ann is shocked to find that Natalie is her own daughter, whom Ann gave up for adoption years ago, when she was pregnant as a teenager. The anguish of abandonment has made Natalie subject to demonic possession. Eventually, the demon leaves Natalie, but possesses Ann, who falls into a large pool of holy water and, fighting through the anguish of her troubled history, eventually frees herself from the demon.
The school's leadership reward her with an academic fellowship to the Vatican; however, while in a cab, Ann finds that the driver is the old man who had harassed her under demonic influence. The cab stops in the street, and a sinister-looking woman, who was the one released from the institute, stares at her from the street. Ann arms herself with a crucifix as the driver snarls and lunges at her.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 15% of 34 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The website's consensus reads: "There's no dearth of possession stories within the genre, and potboilerPrey for the Devilmay leave completists needing a truly horrific — or at least fun — exorcist palate cleanser."[19]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 38 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[20]
Leigh Monson ofThe A.V. Clubgave the film a D grade, writing, "Its dominant thematic threads are at war with one another, shambling around as one story wears the flesh and appearance of another, leaving neither premise wholly intact in a film with the meat stripped from its bones."[21]TheSouth China Morning Post's James Marsh gave it 1/5 stars, saying it "seems content to congregate crowds of stern-faced priests around a shrieking bedridden child and have them spout erroneous incantations for 90 minutes. Even with the most forgiving of horror fans, it doesn't have a hope in hell."[22]A.A. Dowd of theHouston Chroniclecalled the film "a piously dull and scare-free addition to the ever-growing canon ofExorcistwannabes" and "just another regurgitation of yesterday's devout scare tactics, spewing diet 'Exorcism' clichés as freely asLinda Blaironce painted the walls in pea soup."[23]
Dennis Harvey ofVarietywas more positive, writing, "even if it falls short of being particularly memorable or scary, this is a decently entertaining possession potboiler."[24]

But, having said that, with the children being older I do have more time when Iamat home these days. So we have been able to do some rehearsing together.

Nicholas Ralph(born 13 April 1990 inCape Town) is a Scottish actor. He playsJames Herriotin theChannel 5andPBSMasterpiecetelevision seriesAll Creatures Great and Small, a remake of the long-runningBBC series.[1]
Ralph was born inCape Town,South Africaand grew up inNairn, a town in theScottish Highlands.  He had family inGeorgiaandTexas, and traveled to the U.S. a couple of times in childhood.[2]As a young man, Ralph played association football, for Ross County from primary school until age 17, then for Nairn County under-19s.[3]
The actor studied drama atInverness Collegeand then, at theRoyal Conservatoire of Scotland.  The audition forAll Creatures Great and Smallcame two years after graduation.  He had previous roles on stage which included plays with the Royal Conservatoire, the Citizens Theatre and National Theatre of Scotland.  He also appeared on the BBC Radio Scotland productionKidnapped.[4][5]
After graduating in 2017, he initially worked in live theatre with theCitizens Theatrefor just under a year.  His first lead role was withNational Theatre of Scotlandin a play calledInterference.Before starting to filmAll Creatures Great and Small, Ralph did a tour with a Citizens Theatre/Wonder Fools production:549: Scots of the Spanish Civil War.[6][7]
For his role as veterinary surgeon James Herriot inAll Creatures Great and Small, the actor required training in vet procedures for accuracy in the show.[8]"Straight off the bat with our on-set vet adviser Andy Barrett, we were up close and personal with horses, sheep, kind of going through the procedures and things that we would be doing. Learning how to approach the animal and everything like that. Using the stethoscope on the cow's heart, then lungs, then stomach..." the actor later recalled.[9]
Previously, Ralph had limited exposure to livestock: "I grew up in a small town in the Highlands of Scotland, and where we lived, there was our back garden, a fence, and then a field that was always full of cows and sheep... "[8]
Much of the programme was filmed on location in all kinds of weather. The actor recalled, that "we were in Yorkshire during winter and autumn, and it was freezing, with long, cold, dark days and rainy days, sometimes, so if you had people that were downers, it could really bring everyone down. But we were very fortunate—we had a great group that really pushed each other on and kept each other's spirits high."[10]
Although the author of the Herriot books, Alf Wight, had a "soft, lilting Scottish accent," according toChristopher Timothy, who played Herriot inAll Creatures Great and Small(1978),[11]the actor was instructed to keep his speech "neutral" for universality when the BBC series was being filmed. That did not apply to Nicholas Ralph when filming the 2020 series for Channel 5; the actor used his genuine Scottish accent.[12]

Harry Bernard Cross(16 December 1947 – 18 August 2020) was an English actor. He was best known for his portrayal of the British Olympic athleteHarold Abramsin the 1981 filmChariots of Fireand for playingBilly Flynnin the originalWest Endproduction of the musicalChicago.
Harry Bernard Cross was born in London on 16 December 1947, to a working-class family.[1]He was the son of Catherine (née O'Donovan), a cleaner, and Harry Cross, a doorman.[2]His father died oftuberculosiswhen Cross was aged eight. While his father was a member of theChurch of England, Cross grew up in hisIrishmother's Catholic faith,[3]in theTulse Hillneighbourhood of London.[4]
Cross started his career by taking manual jobs, including working as awindow cleaner, waiter, and joiner. He also worked as a carpenter for theWelsh National Opera, and was the Property Master atThe Alexandratheatre inBirmingham.[2]
In 1970 at the age of 22, he was accepted into London'sRoyal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), but later expressed little interest in pursuing the classical arts route.[5]
After graduating from RADA, Cross performed in several stage plays atThe Dukestheatre inLancasterwhere he was seen inMacbeth,The Importance of Being EarnestandArthur Miller'sDeath of a Salesman.He then joined theProspect Theatre Companyand played roles inPericles,Twelfth Night, andThe Royal Hunt of the Sun. Cross also joined the cast of the musicalJoseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoatand played leading roles inPeter Shaffer'sEquus,Mind Your Head, and the musicalIrma la Douce— all at theLeicester Haymarket Theatre.[6]
Cross's first big-screen film appearance came in 1976 when he went on location toDeventer,Netherlands, to play Trooper Binns inJoseph E. Levine'sSecond World WarepicA Bridge Too Far, which starred an international cast, includingDirk Bogarde,Sean Connery,Michael CaineandJames Caan.[6][7]
In 1977, Cross became a member of theRoyal Shakespeare Company; he performed in the premiere ofPrivates on Paradeas "Kevin Cartwright" and played Rover in a revival of a Restoration play titledWild Oats. Cross's path to international stardom began in 1978 with his performance in the musicalChicago, in which he played Billy Flynn, the slick lawyer of murderess Roxie Hart.[6][7]
During Cross's performance inChicagohe was recognised and recommended for a leading role in the multipleOscar-winning filmChariots of Firein 1981. The film was based on the true story of two athletes in the1924 Olympics:Eric Liddell, a devout Scottish Christian, andHarold Abrahams, an English Jew who runs to overcome prejudice.[7]Cross trained hard for his role as Abrahams; his co-starIan Charlesonplayed Liddell. The pair were shown in the opening scene running barefoot with a group of others along a Scottish beach, accompanied by Vangelis's music. Considered "one of the most memorable opening scenes in film history", Cross acknowledged the scene's effectiveness but remembered the water was freezing.[2]For their performances in the film, Cross and Charleson both won "Most Promising Artiste of 1981" awards from the Variety Club Awards in February 1982.[8]Cross's starring role inChariots of Firehas been credited with continuing a transatlantic trend in elegant young English actors that had been set byJeremy IronsinBrideshead Revisited.[9]The film went on to win multipleAcademy Awards, including the one forBest Picture.[10]
Cross followed upChariots of Firewith performances as a Scottish physician, Dr Andrew Manson, struggling with the politics of the British medical system during the 1920s, inThe Citadel, a 10-partBBC Televisiondramatisation ofA. J. Cronin's novel, and as Ashton (Ash) Pelham-Martyn, a British cavalry officer torn between two cultures in the HBO/Goldcrest miniseriesThe Far Pavilionsfirst broadcast in the UK by Channel 4.[11]
In 1982, the U.S. unionActors' Equity, in a landmark reversal of a previous ruling, allowed Cross to appear inJohn Guare'soff-BroadwayplayLydie Breeze. The decision was tied to a joint effort by Actors' Equity, the League of New York Theatres and the British unionEquityto allow British and U.S. actors unrestricted opportunities to work in both countries.[12]The agreement eventually led to regular equal exchange agreements for equivalent acting jobs between London and New York City.[13]
During the 1984Summer Olympic Games, Cross appeared in a commercial forAmerican Express('Don't leave home without it')[14]with the 87-year-oldJackson Scholz, a sprinter for the 1924 American Olympic team whose character was featured in the filmChariots of Fire. When Cross talks about beating Scholz, the latter remarks, "Youdidn't beat me!" with mock indignation. Proving he is 'still pretty fast', Scholz beats Cross to the draw in picking up the tab with his credit card.[14]
He subsequently replacedJames Garneras the featured actor endorsing thePolaroidSpectra camera in 1986.[15]Cross was also featured inGQ Magazineas one of the annual "Manstyle" winners in January 1985 followed by a featured photo shoot in March 1985.[16]
In 1985, he played Barney Greenwald in a revival ofHerman Wouk's courtroom dramaThe Caine Mutiny Court-Martialat theQueen's Theatre, London, alongside castmatesCharlton Heston(asCaptain Queeg) andJohn Schuck.[17][18]
In a 1985 interview, the actor admitted he preferred American roles because of their emotionalism, saying of English acting: "Over here, people hide behind mannerism and technique and don't come up with any soul. American actors are much freer with the emotions. It's pretty hard in Europe not to have experience of Americans because we're exposed to a lot of American product."[5]Cross also said that he was sympathetic to the American dream of success: "I am ambitious. There's no point of being ashamed of the fact that one has ambitions. Despite what a lot of people think in our profession, you can have ambitions and still turn in good work and still earn a living. There's no clash there."[5]Cross expressed the hope that his reputation would "span the Atlantic," and that those in the industry would not ignore him because he did not live in Los Angeles or New York City. "A prospective director would have to convince me that I could bring something new, fresh and exciting to a classical part that hundreds of other people have played," he said.[5]
During this time, Cross' career included several roles in made-for-television productions, as well as the stage. In the 1988HBOspy filmSteal the Skyhe played Munir Redfa, an Iraqi pilot blackmailed into flying aMiGaircraft from Iraq to Israel. InIan Sharp's 1989 NBC-TV miniseriesTwist of Fate, he played GermanNaziSScolonel andwar criminalHelmut von Schraeder, who has his face and voice surgically changed to pose as a Jew in aconcentration campto avoid both Hitler's retaliation for his role in the failed20 July plotagainst him and war's end capture and post-warwar crimestrial and punishment by the approachingAllies, then after his liberation at the war's end by the title's name becomes aZionistand one of Israel's early founders and leading military generals. He twice portrayed avampire, first in the 1989USA NetworkfilmNightlife, then again asBarnabas Collinsin the 1991MGMremakeof the cult classic TV soap operaDark Shadows. Cross also appeared as Sir Harold Pearson in the 1994 Italian productionCaro Dolce Amore (Honey Sweet Love),Solomonin the 1997Trimark PicturesproductionSolomonandCaptain Nemoin the 1997CBSfilm20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.[11]
Cross played Ikey Solomon in theAustralianproductionThe Potato Factoryin 2000. In 2005, Cross, an anti-death penalty campaigner, starred as adeath-rowprisoner in Bruce Graham's playCoyote on a Fence, at theDuchess Theatre.[19]He playedRudolf Hessin the 2006BBCproductionNuremberg: Nazis on Trial.[6]
In November 2007, Cross was cast in the role ofSarekin the 2009Star Trekfilm directed and produced byJ. J. Abrams.[20]Cross spoke toStar Trekmagazine following the film's release, saying:
My agent put me forward forStar Trek, and he sent a couple of films to J.J. I'm sure he was too busy to watch the whole ofSpecies, but when we were on the set, he mentioned to me that there was one particular shot in it where I turned to the camera, and in that moment, it came to him how perfect it would be for me to play Sarek.[21]
In order to prepare for the role, Cross drew on his experience as a parent as well as Sarek's previous on-screen appearances. Having been present when his daughter was born, he was able to "call on all sorts of things" in the scene where Amanda has baby Spock, a scene which did not make it into the theatrical cut of the film.[21]While he found the emotionless trait of aVulcana challenge to play, he found the father/son relationship between Sarek and Spock easier to play. According to Cross:
As Sarek, I had to be true to the Vulcan cultural ethic, which in the beginning, I found very difficult. I got a lot of help with that from J.J. Dealing with the adult Spock (played byZachary Quinto) was a much more mature relationship, and I found the father/son aspect one of the easier things to play.[21]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
