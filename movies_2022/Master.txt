Gail Bishop becomes the newly appointed and first Blackmasterof Ancaster, an elite university inNew England. The school is rumored to be cursed by the ghost of Margaret Millett, who was accused of witchcraft and hanged nearby. African American student Jasmine Moore moves in as a freshman and is assigned to room 302 along with her white roommate, Amelia. Their room was once occupied in 1965 by Louisa Weeks, Ancaster's first Black undergraduate, who committed suicide by hanging in her dorm.
Jasmine initially makes friends with Amelia's clique of wealthy, white students, although they ask her to clean up spilled drinks and don't pay her back for a pizza she orders. She also experiences variousmicroagressionsfrom staff and students. At a party, Amelia's crush kisses Jasmine and Amelia sees them. Amelia whispers to Jasmine that she hates her despite the roommates telling Gail everything is fine between them. Gail's new residence develops a maggot infestation.
Jasmine starts having nightmares in which she is attacked by a presence and believes that her English professor, Liv Beckman, is purposely giving her bad grades. She files a dispute, which impacts Liv's application fortenure. Jasmine receives racist threats by an unknown person, including a noose being placed on her door and across burningon campus. Her nightmares intensify, and she begins researching Louisa Weeks and discovers that she, too, was being tormented by a presence prior to her suicide.
One night, Gail discovers Amelia crying outside after two unseen guys run off abruptly. Amelia suggests she may have beensexually assaultedby a student but refuses to go to a hospital or speak out. She also becomes increasingly disturbed by Jasmine’s nightmares, as well as the ominous atmosphere at school, and eventually drops outs.
Jasmine is chased by a figure in a black cloak, causing her to fall out of a window and be hospitalized. She tells Gail about the presence and expresses her desire to leave Ancaster; however, Gail rejects the notion of a supernatural presence and believes she is being harassed by a racist student. Jasmine returns to school and is found a few days later dead in her room, hanged.
Gail is contacted by Liv’s mother, Esther Bickert, an Amish woman, who informs her that Liv was actually born white and named Elizabeth. But Liv left the community, changed her name, and began to present herself as Black. Esther implies it must have been a possession by the devil to make her do this. When confronted at a faculty party, Liv denies these claims and tells Gail that she was actually the daughter of a Black man, leaving it to the audience to decide what is the truth. Liv eventually leaves, putting on a black cloak that resembles the figure that was terrorizing Jasmine.
Gail criticizes the all-white faculty for enabling thecovertly racistculture at Ancaster and realizes that she was not truly the school's master, but rather the “maid” who was meant to clean up the school's diversity problems. Gail notices that history has repeated itself, with no changes to Ancaster's diversity, and she resigns from her position.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 74% of 155 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.5/10.

Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkerwrote that the film was "a passionate and melancholy fantasy that employs supernatural elements for a bracingly realistic view of college life and American institutions."[13]Alissa Wilkinson of Vox wrote: "The movie is so full of ideas that it can be hard to chase down the threads. But Diallo crafts a compelling and smart tale nonetheless, and an engrossing one at that."[14]Ben Travis ofEmpiremagazine gave the film 4/5 stars, writing: "Well-performed, especially by Regina Hall, and directed with real flair and intention by Mariama Diallo, Master transcends its two-dimensional opening to become a complex, character-driven horror with much on its mind."[15]Peter BradshawofThe Guardiangave the film 3/5 stars, describing it as "a pointed and intensely pessimistic horror-satire on racism and identity politics on the American campus", and added: "It could be that its material isn't fully absorbed into the screenplay, but there is real claustrophobia and unease in each insidious microaggression."[16]Writing forPrime Movies, Albert Nowicki praised the film for being "nihilistic but real" and added: "Its message makes sense, the conclusions are accurate, its horror will turn out to be very personal and comprehensible for many."[17]
Kevin MaherofThe Timesgave the film 2/5 stars. He noted some similarities toGet Outin Gail's storyline, but wrote: "Gail's story flops about aimlessly while idealistic new student Jasmine... is hounded by genre clichés... and a hooded figure striding spookily across the campus."[18]Ann HornadayofThe Washington Postgave the film 2/4 stars, writing: "Although Diallo makes some trenchant observations about diversity-equity-inclusion initiatives and cultural appropriation, she jams too many plot beats, characters and polemical points into the narrative for all of them to pay off satisfactorily."[19]

I could've gone to school until I was 75 years old as long as somebody would've paid my rent. I would've been a professional student."[5]
She wanted a career with impact and envisioned a career in writing or journalism, but Hall's first semester of graduate school changed drastically when her father died of astroke.[8]"It was sudden. And I think when sudden events that are painful happen in your life, you know, they redirect your course," Hall reflected. "When you're young, you don't grasp the gravity of life. But when you lose someone that you spend most of your life with, and you're young, you do. And so I think that started me thinking about what I really wanted to do in life. And I know my father would have wanted me to finish school. So I did that."[9]She began a career in the entertainment industry, starting off with a guest appearance onSadat X's 1996 albumWild Cowboyson the track, "The Interview".
In 1997, Hall appeared in her firsttelevision commercialat the age of 26.

I metSanaa Lathanon it, and we didLove and Basketballtogether, which was my second film. And then, at that point, I was visiting L.A. to stay and it led to a third film and a fourth film. And it was really a big deal because I'd never been on a set before."[10]
Hall gained more recognition with her role in the comedy-horror-spoofScary Movie(and the sequelsScary Movie 2,Scary Movie 3, andScary Movie 4) portraying the sex-crazed Brenda Meeks, and the TV movieDisappearing Acts.

Hall felt the first film had "the joy of the wedding" and in the sequel "they come together for the holidays, but it's deeper than that. This one's definitely different, but we still laughed. There was so much laughter behind the scenes."[10]Hall joked about how all of the male members of the cast were married while all of the women were not, stating thatMorris Chestnutwas happily married while walking around "with his shirt off!"[15]

They play the couple you know all too well: fiery, able to press one another's buttons and always caught in the makeup to breakup game." Negative reviews of the film also praised the pairing of Hall with Kevin Hart. Mick LaSalle ofThe San Francisco Chronicleexpressed that Hart was "well paired for Hall, who matches him for comedy."[19]At the time of the film's release, both Hall and Hart expressed interest in working on other projects together.[20]About Last Nightwas her third ensemble film and Hall reflected that she learned from actors she worked with in ensembles.[21]

Bob had made a television movie about scleroderma years ago because his sister had died from it. That was back when they didn't even know what it was. Anyway, Bob had a group called theScleroderma Research Foundation, so I donated to that and my mother even went to the doctor Bob had suggested, who happened to be over atJohns Hopkins."[31]Hall announced in November 2010 that she would be writing forAbility.[32]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
