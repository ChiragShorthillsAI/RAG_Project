After marrying thebaronetSir Clifford Chatterley, Constance "Connie" Reid moves from London to the impressive Chatterley estate inWragby. When her sister Hilda expresses disapproval of the marriage, Connie tells her that she loves Clifford for how progressive he is. They consummate the marriage and Clifford returns to fight in World War I the following day.
Weeks later, Clifford comes home, paralysed from the waist down, causing him to need full-time care and unable to have an erection. He demands that only Connie help him with his daily acts of living. Clifford rebuffs her attempts to engage in other forms of sex that would pleasure her.
Connie does her best but, over time, the burden of caregiving and starvation from physical and emotional intimacy begin to wear on her. In his grief after losing control over his body, Clifford becomes controlling and focused on how he can amass more power and wealth. All love disappears between them as Clifford grows more and more conservative and controlling, making sexist comments and trying to prevent her from leaving the house to visit loved ones or even go on walks. Connie is disgusted to see him subjugating mine workers, their servants, and her.  As Clifford wants an heir, he suggests Connie have an affair purely to impregnate her. When her sister Hilda visits, she notices Connie's exhaustion and hires Mrs Bolton to be Clifford's caretaker.
One afternoon after being sent to check on some pheasant chicks at the nearby cottage, Connie meets Oliver Mellors, the reserved lower class gamekeeper who also returned from the war to find his wife had left him. There is an instant connection between them, which soon turns into passionate sex. Using the chicks, reading at the cottage and long walks as her excuses, Connie visits the cottage more and more. Taken aback by Oliver's surprising tenderness, they begin a fervent love affair.
Noticing signs of early pregnancy, Connie suggests the idea of traveling to Venice with Hilda in order to have the supposed affair, while the rumour that they are actively trying to conceive spreads through town. Oliver is furious, believing Connie used him to have a child, but she tells him she only wants him. Hilda comes to collect Connie for the trip and is told about Oliver. She is disappointed, but leaves to let Connie spend the night with him. Oliver's wife's new partner, Ned, comes by the cottage, seeking part of Oliver's war pension as they are not yet divorced. There, he finds evidence of Connie.
Ned spreads rumours about Oliver and Connie in the pub. When Clifford hears, he sacks Oliver just as Connie is about to leave for Venice. The pair promise to reunite when they can, and she returns to the manor to confront Clifford, explaining his lack of affection drove her away. Connie reveals she is in love with Oliver and pregnant with his child; Clifford declares he will never give her a divorce. As she leaves London for Venice, Mrs Bolton promises to put the word out that she is looking for Oliver.
News has spread by word of mouth that a Lady gave up her status and wealth for a gamekeeper because she loves him. After some months in Venice, Connie tires of judgmental gossip and returns to England. A letter arrives to Connie from Oliver, who has since found another house and a job, calling for her to join him in Scotland. She drives there, finds him and they embrace.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
