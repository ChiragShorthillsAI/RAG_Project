At Christmas, both men present their Tiffany gifts. When Ethan realizes the mix-up, he says nothing, because his girlfriend Vanessa likes the earrings.

Next day, Ethan tries to meet Gary to retrieve the ring so he can propose to Vanessa. He waits with Rachel, who's wearing it, but Gary stays late at work. Ethan and Rachel end up spending the whole evening together, but he leaves abruptly .
The day after, Gary refuses to return the ring when Ethan confronts him. When Rachel goes to Tiffany's to get advice on how to clean her ring, the saleswoman says she made the sale and describes the man and daughter who bought it. Rachel recognizes Ethan from the description and understands what must have happened.
Confronted by Rachel, Gary admits he suspected the ring wasn’t his, but realized he wanted to marry her, so he went through with the proposal—and he still wants to marry her. Rachel meets Ethan at her bakery and tells him Gary will return the ring.
On New Year's Eve, one of Gary's friends reveals that when Rachel met Gary, he was on his way to a hook-up. She breaks up with him. Ethan and Vanessa simultaneously arrive.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
