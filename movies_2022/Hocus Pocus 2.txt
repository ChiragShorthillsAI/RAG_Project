Filming took place from October 2021 to January 2022 inRhode Island, replacingSalem, Massachusetts. It was released onDisney+on September 30, 2022.[4]The film received mixed reviews from critics. It earned three nominations at the75th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, includingOutstanding Television Movie. A third film is in development, with Anne Fletcher and Jen D'Angelo returning as director and screenwriter, respectively.
In 1653Salem, Massachusetts, Reverend Traske banishes 16-year-old Winifred Sanderson after she 'defied church authority' by refusing to marry John Pritchett. Rather than be away from her sisters, Mary and Sarah, Winnie takes them to a nearby forest. There, they meet with Mother Witch, who gives Winifred a magic, human-skin-bound book, with a living eyeball embedded in the cover, for her birthday; she also explicitly warns the trio against ever casting theMagicae Maximaspell, which makes the user 'all-powerful'. Mother Witch also teaches the trio how to keep their youth, using children. The sisters get revenge on the Reverend by cursing his home, which is engulfed in flames.
In 2022, 29 years afterthe sisters were resurrected by the Black Flame Candle, local Salem teenagers Becca and Izzy prepare to celebrate Halloween and Becca's 16th birthday, but turn down a party invite from their former friend, Cassie Traske. Becca and Izzy visit a magic shop, housed in the Sandersons' former cottage; the owner, Gilbert, gives Becca a candle for an annual birthday that is another Black Flame Candle. As there is a full moon, and the girls are both virgins, the candle resurrects the Sanderson sisters, yet again. The girls outwit the sisters in a localWalgreensand flee to the magic shop, where they find that Gilbert tricked them into reviving the witches, having seen them on Halloween in 1993 and having read how to make the candle in the spell book.
The sisters catch up to the girls and see a campaign flyer belonging to Mayor Jefry Traske, Cassie's father and Reverend Traske's direct descendant. Winifred decides they will cast theMagicae Maximaspell to eliminate him and take revenge on all of modern Salem. The sisters trap Izzy and Becca in the basement and leave to hunt down the mayor, whose blood is needed to complete the spell. They force Gilbert to collect the other ingredients.
The girls escape and head to the Traske house to warn the mayor while the sisters find their way to the town's Halloween carnival and enchant the citizens to help them find the mayor. Meanwhile, Gilbert digs up Billy Butcherson, who has been awake but entombed since 1993. He needs Billy's head for the spell, but tricks him into helping him collect the other ingredients first. The girls reunite with Cassie and trap the sisters in a salt circle in Cassie's garage before Mayor Traske returns home. The three girls make up, but their reunion is interrupted when the sisters escape the circle and kidnap Cassie to use her blood instead. Becca and Izzy follow them to the forbidden forest where Gilbert has assembled the ingredients and soon discover that Becca, like the sisters, is a natural witch.
The sisters partially cast the spell and increase their power, but Becca distracts them while Izzy rescues Cassie. Becca convinces Book that it does not have to answer to Winifred, and she and Book flee further into the forest. Book shows them the warning against theMagicae Maximaspell, stating that whoever casts it must give up what they cherish most as the price for the power. The girls agree to warn Winifred of the price of the spell, but are too late, and she becomes all-powerful as Mary and Sarah fade to dust. Winifred grows despondent and begs the girls to use their newfound powers to save her sisters. While they cannot save them, Becca, Cassie and Izzy join in a coven and cast a reuniting spell, so Winifred happily fades away to be with her sisters.
Gilbert and Billy rejoin the girls, and Billy starts to fade away, realizing that all of Winifred's spells have been undone. The girls decide to give Book a new home and continue practicing magic as they walk off into the night, similar to how the Sanderson sisters did. As they leave, acrow, identical to one that the Mother Witch shapeshifted into, flies overhead.
In apost-credit scene, it is revealed that inside Gilbert's shop there is another Black Flame Candle.

However,Deadline Hollywooddebunked rumors that the film was a sequel toHocus Pocus.[9]In November 2014, Bette Midler said in aReddit"Ask Me Anything" that she was ready and willing to return for a sequel as Winifred Sanderson. She also said her co-starsSarah Jessica ParkerandKathy Najimywere interested in reprising the roles of Sarah and Mary Sanderson as well, but stressed that Disney had yet to greenlight any sequel, encouraging fans of the original film to persuade Disney to make one.[10]In November 2015, Midler stated in aFacebookQ&A that "after all these years and all the fan demand, I do believe I can stand and firmly say an unequivocal no" in response to a question about a sequel.[11]

Her response was "I would love that. I think we've been very vocal that we're very keen", yet she insisted that fans should encourage Disney to develop a sequel.[13]InHocus Pocus in Focus: The Thinking Fan's Guide to Disney's Halloween Classic,author Aaron Wallace identifies several potential approaches for a sequel, but notes that the project's biggest challenge is the Walt Disney Studios' interest in tentpole projects that promise very high box office returns.[14]

In February 2018, Jones revealed that there had been talks to do a sequel set twenty years after the original film and that he was approached to be involved on it, though he admitted that he was still interested on reprising his role as Billy Butcherson.[19]In July 2018, a book titledHocus Pocus and the All-New Sequelwas released, containing a novelization of the film and a sequel story. The sequel focuses on Max and Allison's daughter, Poppy, who grew up hearing the family story of the original film and parents who avoid Halloween as much as possible. Poppy is skeptical of the tale and ends up in the Sanderson house on Halloween, twenty-five years to the day after the movie, in an attempt to prove there is nothing to the story.[20]

On October 29, 2020, Midler stated that a story outline for the sequel has been completed, which she praised as "pretty great" along with Najimy and Parker.[36]On November 3, Midler revealed that the producers were trying to re-hire several members of the first film's production team that are alive and had not retired, as they felt much of the success of the first film came from the work of the behind-the-scenes team.[37]In April 2021,Anne Fletcherreplaced Shankman as the director due to his directing duties withDisenchanted, although he did remain as an executive producer on the film.[38]

Thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoesreported an approval rating of 65% based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Hocus Pocus 2is basically a boiling cauldron of nostalgia, but that's more than enough for this belated sequel to cast a reasonably effective spell."[70]Metacriticgave it aweighted averagescore of 56 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[71]
Ani Bundel ofNBC Newsstated that the film is a joyful experience, appealing to both young children just discovering Halloween and teenagers who still enjoy family movies. However, Bundel emphasized that the film is primarily aimed at viewers aged 25 and older, whom Disney has spent the last two decades cultivating to appreciate a new installment of this emerging cult classic franchise.[72]Claire Shaffer ofThe New York Timesnoted that, despite the film being a clear effort by Disney to bolster its Disney+ platform, it successfully captures the nostalgic charm of the original while also offering a creative update to its humor.[73]Jennifer Green ofCommon Sense Mediaawarded the movie four out of five stars, praising its positive messages, role models, and diverse character representations. She described the film as a "campy but entertaining sequel."[74]Amelia Emberwing ofIGNrated the film 7 out of 10, noting that while the returning Sanderson sisters capture the magic of the originalHocus Pocus, and new characters provide fresh appeal, Hannah Waddingham's role was underutilized. Emberwing pointed out that despite some subpar greenscreen effects, the film retains a charming Disney Channel Original Movie feel.[75]
Lovia Gyarkye ofThe Hollywood Reporterobserved that the Sanderson sisters maintain their sharp wit and humor as they navigate modern-day Salem on Halloween, making playful remarks about contemporary life. However, Gyarkye noted that while they still embody a thirst for evil and a disdain for children, their edge is softened by the film's approach to toning down their villainous nature.[76]Nell Minow ofRogerEbert.comrated the film three and a half stars out of four, stating thatHocus Pocus 2successfully appeals to fans of all generations. Minow noted that the sequel honors the original while incorporating modern updates and welcome diversity, reducing violence and adding a slightly sweeter tone.[77]Jude Dry ofIndieWiregave the sequel a "B-" score and described it as a "totally satisfactory" return for the Sanderson sisters, though the plot largely mirrors the original, with updated jokes. Dry noted that the sisters’ once sharp edge has softened, with the film leaning on a contrived sisterly bond to conclude the story. The review also pointed out that the script introduces a saccharine tone and an overt teen feminist message, suggesting that some elements might have been better left in the past.[78]
Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardianrated the film two out of four stars, expressing disappointment in the sequel. Lee remarked that while Bette Midler returns alongside her child-killing sisters, the follow-up falls flat, largely due to its excessive efforts to soften the villains.[79]Helen O'Hara ofEmpirerated the movie two out of five stars, criticizing it for being as unevenly plotted as the original while lacking the element of surprise. O'Hara remarked that the film is not "good" and suggested that there should be better options between its "gooey and ghoulish" tone.[80]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.

BornAnne Marie Fletcherin Detroit,Michigan, Fletcher lived with her family in the local lakefront suburb ofSt. Clair Shores, Michiganuntil her 1984 graduation with honors fromLake Shore High School.[1]Fletcher began taking dance lessons at a local dance studio, Turning Point School of the Performing Arts, at age 12 after watching her mother take a dance class. At age 15, she appeared in the local showSalute to the Superstarsat the now-defunct Mr. F's Beef & Bourbon dinner club inSterling Heights,Michigan. Upon graduation from high school, Fletcher moved to Los Angeles, California, where she received further training from renowned choreographer Joe Tremaine,[2]and began working as a professional dancer; including performing as aLaker Girl.[1]
In 1990, Fletcher metAdam Shankmanwhen they were hired to perform as dancers at the62nd Academy Awards. Shortly thereafter, Shankman hired Fletcher to become his assistant choreographer. This sparked a longtime personal friendship and professional affiliation.[3]
Fletcher worked closely with Shankman both during his career as a choreographer and later as a film director and has credited her collaborations with Shankman for allowing her to both develop her own set of choreographic and film directorial skills and to achieve a similarly successful career path.
In her first film roles, Fletcher appeared as a dancer, includingThe Flintstones(1994),The Mask(1994),Tank Girl(1995),Casper(1995) andTitanic(1997). Fletcher later developed choreography for the Oscar-nominated drama filmBoogie Nights(1997) starringMark Wahlberg,Burt Reynolds,Julianne MooreandHeather Graham, in which she also appeared as a dancer, as well as for the comedy filmA Life Less Ordinary(1997) withEwan McGregorandCameron Diaz.
After acquiring numerous professional choreography credits, often in collaboration with Adam Shankman, Fletcher, with encouragement from Shankman, began to consider a directorial career. She worked alongside Shankman, who himself had moved from choreography to directing with films such asHairspray(2007) andThe Wedding Planner, for both of which she was an associate producer,[4]as well asStep Up.
Although Fletcher began to break into the production side of filmmaking throughout the early 2000s, she continued to choreograph in films such as theIce PrincessandThe Pacifierin 2005.[5]She also did choreograph work in other films likeScooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed(2004),The 40-Year-Old Virgin(2005) andHairspray(2007).[5]
Fletcher directed the 2006 romantic dance film,Step UpstarringChanning TatumandJenna Dewan. The film was nominated for twoTeen Choice Awards(2007) and oneYoung Artist Award(2007). Fletcher turned down the offer to direct the sequel to this film, fearing that if she directed another dance film, she would not be able to branch out into other genres in the future.[6]Although she did the choreography onStep Up 2: The Streets(2008), the role of director was given toJon M. Chu. Panned by critics, the film was well-received by audiences and grossed $65 million at the domestic box office.
Her work onStep Upearned Fletcher a second successful director credit on the popular 2008 romantic comedy film,27 Dresses, starringKatherine HeiglandJames Marsden. This film was nominated for eight awards: onePeople's Choice Awards(2008), twoTeen Choice Awards(2008), threeGolden Trailer Awards(2008), oneArtios Award(2008) and oneEDA Special Mention Award.27 Dresses is celebrated as an iconic 21st-century romantic comedy film, thanks in large part to Fletcher's directing. Former president of MGM Jonathan Glickman emphasized how important Fletcher was to the success of the film, stating that she and the main character are very similar people. The writer of the film, Aline Brosh McKenna, mentioned in an interview that Fletcher was known on set as "Mama", and credits her for capturing the story so well.[7]
Based on the success of her first two features, Fletcher went on to direct the popular 2009 romantic comedy film,The Proposal, starringSandra BullockandRyan Reynolds. This film was nominated for twenty-seven awards; out of the twenty-seven nominations, the film won seven. For her performance, Bullock received a Golden Globe nomination for best actress and a Women's Image Network Award for Outstanding Actress.[8]The Proposal is Fletcher's highest-grossing film as a director, and it stands as the 7th highest grossing romantic comedy of all time.[9]
Following the success ofThe Proposal, Fletcher directedThe Guilt Trip(2012) starringSeth RogenandBarbra Streisand. She followed this by directingHot Pursuit(2015) starringReese WitherspoonandSofía Vergara. Both of these films performed significantly worse than her previous films, with the former receiving only oneRazzie Awardnomination[10]and the latter earning an 8% on Rotten Tomatoes.[11]

In the late 1990s, during the release of her albumBathhouse Betty(1998), Midler commented on her time performing there, "Despite the way things turned out [with the AIDS crisis], I'm still proud of those days. I feel like I was at the forefront of the gay liberation movement, and I hope I did my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of 'Bathhouse Betty' with pride."[21]
Midler starred in the first professional production ofthe Who'srock operaTommyin 1971, with directorRichard Pearlmanand theSeattle Opera.[22]It was during the run ofTommythat Midler first appeared onThe Tonight Show.

Midler told Carson in an interview that she always wanted to move like the sisters, and Patty Andrews remembered: "When I first heard the introduction on the radio, I thought it was our old record. When Bette opened at the Amphitheater in Los Angeles, Maxene and I went backstage to see her. Her first words were, 'What else did you record?'"[25]During another Midler concert, Maxene went on stage and presented her with an honorary bugle. Bette recorded other Andrews Sisters hits, including "In the Mood" and "Lullaby of Broadway".[25]

In 1998, Midler released her ninth studio album,Bathhouse Betty, named after the nickname she was given for performing at bathhouses early in her career. In 1999, she appeared in an episode of theCBSsitcomMurphy Brownand was featured in the animated musical filmFantasia 2000.
Midler starred in her own sitcom in 2000,Bette, which featured Midler playing a version of herself, a divine celebrity who is adored by her fans. Airing onCBS, initial ratings were high, marking the best sitcom debut for the network in more than five years, but viewers percentage soon declined, resulting in the show's cancellation in early 2001.[48]Midler openly griped about the show's demanding shooting schedule, while the show itself was also reportedly rocked by backstage turmoil, involving the replacement of co-starKevin Dunnwhose departure was attributed by the media to his behind-the scenes bickering with Midler.[48]However, Midler, critically praised, was awarded aPeople's Choice Awardfor her performance in the show and received aGolden Globe Awardnomination the following year.[49]Also in 2000, Midler made an uncreditedcameo appearanceinNancy Meyers' fantasy rom–comWhat Women Want, starringMel GibsonandHelen Hunt.[50]In the film, she portrayed a therapist who realizes that central character Nick, played by Gibson, is able to understand women'sthoughts.[50]Released to generally mixed reviews, it became the then-most successful film ever directed by a woman, taking in $183 million in the United States, and grossing upward of $370 million worldwide.[51][52]
The same year Midler starred inIsn't She GreatandDrowning Mona. InAndrew Bergman'sIsn't She Great, a highly fictionalized account of the life and career of authorJacqueline Susann, she played alongsideNathan LaneandStockard Channing, portraying Susann with her early struggles as an aspiring actress relentlessly hungry for fame, her relationship withpress agentIrving Mansfield, her success as the author ofValley of the Dolls, and her battle with and subsequent death from breast cancer. The dramedy garnered largely negative reviews by critics, who dismissed it as "bland material [that] produces entirely forgettable comic performances."[53]For her performance in the film, Midler received her secondGolden Raspberry Awardnomination for Worst Actress at the 21st ceremony.[54]InNick Gomez's dark comedyDrowning Mona, Midler appeared along withDanny DeVitoandJamie Lee Curtis, playing title character Mona Dearly, a spiteful, loud-mouthed, cruel and highly unpopular woman, whose mysterious death is investigated. Another critical fiasco, reviewers noted that the film "drowns itself in humor that never rises above sitcom level."[55]
After nearly three decades of erratic record sales, Midler was dropped from theWarner Music Groupin 2001. Following a reported long-standing feud with Barry Manilow, the two joined forces after many years in 2003 to recordBette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook. Now signed toColumbia Records, the album was an instant success, being certified gold byRIAA. One of theClooney Songbookselections, "This Ole House", became Midler's first Christian radio single shipped by Rick Hendrix and his positive music movement. The album was nominated for a Grammy the following year.[56]
Throughout 2003 and 2004, Midler toured the United States in her new show,Kiss My Brass, to sell-out audiences. Also in 2004, she appeared in a supporting role inFrank Oz'science fictionsatireThe Stepford Wives, aremakeof the1975 film of the same namealso based onthe Ira Levin novel. Also starringNicole Kidman,Matthew Broderick,Christopher WalkenandGlenn Close, Midler played Bobbie Markowitz, a writer and recovering alcoholic. The project underwent numerous production problems that occurred throughout its shooting schedule, with reports of problems on-set between director Oz and the actors being rampant in the press. Oz later blamed Midler—who was amid recording her next album and rehearsing for her tour—for being under a lot of stress by other projects and making "the mistake of bringing her stress on the set."[57]While the original book and film had tremendous cultural impact, the remake was marked by poor reviews by many critics, and a financial loss of approximately $40 million at the box office.[58][59]
Midler joined forces again with Manilow for another tribute album,Bette Midler Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook. Released in October 2005, the album sold 55,000 copies the first week of release, returned Midler to the top ten ofUSBillboard200,[60]and was nominated for a Grammy Award.[61]
Midler released a new Christmas album titledCool Yulein 2006, which featured a duet of Christmastime pop standards "Winter Wonderland"/"Let It Snow" withJohnny Mathis. Well-received, the album garnered aGrammy Award nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Albumin 2007.[62]The same year, Midler returned to the big screen, appearing inThen She Found Me,Helen Hunt's feature film directorial debut. Also starring Hunt along withMatthew BroderickandColin Firth, the comedy-drama film tells the story of a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher, who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show, played by Midler, who introduces herself as her biological mother. Critical response to the film was mixed; whereas some critics praised the film for having strong performances, others felt the film was bogged down by a weak script and technical issues.
Midler debuted herVegasshow titledBette Midler: The Showgirl Must Go OnatThe Colosseum at Caesars Palaceon February 20, 2008. It comprisedThe Staggering Harlettes, 20 female dancers called The Caesar Salad Girls and a 13-piece band.

An updated version of theGeorge Cukor-directed1939 film of the same namebased on a1936 playbyClare Boothe Luce, the film was widely panned by critics, who found it "...a toothless remake of the 1939 classic, lacking the charm, wit and compelling protagonists of the original."
Midler appeared on theBravoTV showMy Life on the D-ListwithKathy Griffinin an episode that aired in June 2009. In December of the same year, she appeared in theRoyal Variety Performance, an annual British charity event attended byQueen Elizabeth II.

Jones was born inIndianapolis, the youngest of four brothers, and attendedBishop Chatard High School. He graduated fromBall State University,[1]where he parlayed his background as amimeinto portraying the school mascot "Charlie Cardinal."[4]
Jones started his career in the television and movie industry as a 1980sadvertisingcharacter, "Mac Tonight".[5]He worked as acontortionist, saying, "You'd be surprised how many times that comes into play in commercials. They'll want somebody to hold a box ofTidefunny or something. I once squished into a box for acommercialfor relaxed fit jeans."[6]In 1994, he appeared in an episode ofUnsolved Mysteriesas Gordon Page, Jr., a young man with autism who disappeared from a treatment center in 1991.
Although known mostly for his work underprosthetic makeup, such as the zombie William "Billy" Butcherson in theWalt Disney PicturesHalloween filmHocus Pocus, or thelead spy Morlockin the2002 remakeof the 1960 filmThe Time Machine, he has also performed without prosthetics in such films asAdaptation,Mystery Men, andBatman Returns, and indie projects such asStefan Haves'Stalled, AntiKaiser Productions'Three Lives, Phil Donlon'sA Series of Small Things, and as Cesare in David Fisher's2005 remakeof the 1920 silent classicThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.[7]
Jones playedAbe SapieninHellboy; the voice was performed by an uncreditedDavid Hyde Piercein the first film, but Jones's voice was used in the sequel. Explaining the challenge of working so often in rubber suits and prosthetics, he notes, "I have to make that a part of my being and my physicality and again, acting is a full-body experience and that's a part of it when you're doing a costumed character."[8]
In 2005, he worked again with Mexican directorGuillermo del Toro, starring as the Faun in del Toro's multiple-Academy Award-winning Spanish-language fantasy/horror projectPan's Labyrinth. He also has a secondary role in the film as the Pale Man, a gruesome creature with a penchant for eating children.

He played two other roles in the film: the Angel of Death and the Chamberlain, both under heavy prosthetics. In 2009, del Toro announced onBBC Radiothat Jones would be playing the monster in his upcoming version ofFrankenstein.[11]
In 2007, Jones was disappointed to learn that his voice part of the Silver Surfer had been dubbed by another actor (Fishburne) when the film was released. Upon inquiry, he determined that studio pressure had been imposed in order to add more "names" to the movie. As Jones gained greater clout in the industry, he eventually was able to add a clause to his contracts ensuring that no English dialogue of his characters would be dubbed. Roles that include other languages may be dubbed, however. This came into play inPan's Labyrinth– Jones learned enough Spanish to voice his characters. Still, the decision was made to use a native speaker in order to access the language's nuances adequately.[12]

As inPan's Labyrinth, Jones performed his lines phonetically, this time speaking in French; his voice was redubbed byÉric Elmosnino, who also played Gainsbourg. Director Joann Sfar liked Jones's speech patterns so much that he asked Elmosnino to mimic them when he performed the creature's lines.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
