On June 23, 2018, twelve boys of the junior football team "Wild Boars" and their assistant coach Ekkaphon Chanthawong leave practice to explore theTham Luang cave. When the team fails to arrive at a birthday party organized by their parents, their families head to the caves, only to find them flooded and the boys missing, their bikes left at the entrance. The parents immediately alert emergency services.
Royal Thai Navy SEALs, led by Captain Arnont, arrive to search for the missing boys, but find the dive too difficult to locate the team.Vernon Unsworth, a local British caver, shares his extensive knowledge of the complex and dangerous cave and suggests the authorities get in touch with the British Cave Rescue Council. British caversRick StantonandJohn Volanthentravel to Thailand and attempt the dive, finding the boys and coach four kilometres from the entrance. During an attempt to deliver air tanks to the boys to keep them alive in preparation for the rescue, former Thai Navy SEALSaman Kunandrowns.
Meanwhile, as hundreds of volunteers try to mitigate poor weather conditions, a water technician from Bangkok gains the permission of local farmers to divert water from the mountain onto their fields, destroying their crop.
Realising the boys will have to be removed through the cave, via a six-hour dive, knowing what the risks are, Stanton and Volanthen contact Dr.Richard Harris, plus supporting divers Chris Jewell and Jason Mallinson.  With permission from the regional governor and minister, the divers sedate the boys and, with one diver per boy, carry each member out of the cave safely. The coach is removed last.
The end scene is the boys celebrating the birthday party that was supposed to happen on the day they went into the cave. The end credits reveal that the coach and three of the boys, who were all stateless, are given Thai citizenship.
The film is dedicated to Saman Kunan, the Thai Navy SEAL who died on July 6, 2018, during the rescue operation, and Beirut Pakbara, a Thai Navy SEAL who later died from a blood infection.[2]
It was announced in April 2020 thatRon Howardwas to direct the film, withWilliam Nicholsonwriting the screenplay.[3]Metro-Goldwyn-Mayeracquired the rights to the film the following month.[4]In March 2021,Viggo Mortensen,Colin FarrellandJoel Edgertonwere among the cast announced to star in the film.[5]Filming began on March 29, 2021, mostly done inQueenslandwith the support of Queensland and Gold Coast governments.[6]Scenes depictingChiang Rai Provincewere shoot at lush tropical tree-lined roads, hotels and golf courses acrossMudgeeraba,Yatala,Numinbah ValleyandCarrarain Queensland.[6]Two warehouses in Yatala were sourced for the production offices, as well as the construction of a custom-built water tank and cave interiors.[6]The hospital scene was filmed atGriffith UniversityLogan Campus.[6]
The film's original score was composed byBenjamin Wallfisch.[7]When Howard approached his usual collaboratorHans Zimmerfor the score, the latter strongly recommended his protégéBenjamin Wallfischfor the job.[8]Wallfisch had a 20-minute suite ready before Howard had started shooting inThailand.[citation needed]
Thirteen Liveswas released byUnited Artists Releasingin select theaters in the United States on July 29, 2022, before streaming onAmazon Prime Videoon August 5.[9]The film was originally scheduled for a fully theatrical release by United Artists Releasing on April 15, 2022,[10]and was then postponed to November 18 (to contend during awards season) in response to the besttest scoresin MGM's history.[11]In May 2022, however, the film was brought to its current release date due to Amazon's acquisition of MGM in March.[12]Mortensen criticized the decision, given the film was considered an awards contender, and said, "I think Amazon could certainly have respected the deal, as they said they were going to, and released it widely in theaters and let it have its run. But they figured it would be more cost-effective if they didn't have to bother with spending money on promoting it and putting in theaters, and sharing that money with theaters, frankly. That's what it comes down to. To me, it's greed."[13]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 178 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's consensus reads, "Steadily helmed by director Ron Howard,Thirteen Livesoffers an incomplete but still gripping dramatization of an incredible true story."[14]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[15]

Imagine Entertainment, formerlyImagine Films Entertainment, also known simply asImagine(stylized asIMAGINE), is an Americanfilmandtelevisionproduction companyfounded in November 1985 by producerBrian Grazerand directorRon Howard.
Brian Grazer and Ron Howard met in 1982 onNight Shift, with Howard directing and Grazer co-producing. They followed it up by working on 1984'sSplash.[8]
The company was originally founded in November 1985, following the success of the motion pictureSplash. It was originated from a merger of two production companies,Ron Howard's Major H Productions andBrian Grazer's self-titled production company Brian Grazer Productions.[9]The company went public the following year. At first, the company set a deal withTri-Star Picturesto produce feature films and television shows. Imagine granted Tri-Star the right of first refusal to syndicate their off-network shows produced by Imagine. Its offering was sold toAllen & Co.for 1,667,000 units for common stock and warrant it to purchase additional one-third of its stock. The net proceeds were used for development and production of theatrical films, television series, mini-series and made for television movies, although "the company does not presently intend to develop game shows or daytime soap operas." Imagine however has its prospectus having negotiations withParamount Televisionfor a commitment withABCfor a half-hour pilot and five episodes based on the comedy filmGung Ho.[10]
Later the same year, Imagine had a five-year deal withShowtime/The Movie Channel, Inc.and it was able to develop projects for the channelsShowtimeandThe Movie Channel. The agreement would kick-off with 1989 pay television availabilities and include pay-per view exhibition rights to all Imagine-produced films and about 30 motion pictures and "an unspecified number of original products" are also covered by the agreement. "There was the option of developing "long-form dramas" or series as part of the original material to be developed and aired exclusively onShowtime, adding that it could also acquire the syndication rights to these films and original products.[11][12]
In April 1987, producers Philip and Mary Ann Hobel had inked a pact with Imagine Films Entertainment to develop and produce theatrical fare for the company through Hobel Productions, and expected to serve as the eyes and ears of Imagine of New York, and will be backed by a development fund for the purchase of books, plays, scripts and ideas to be developed as film projects, and plans to do both comedy and drama projects with a concentration on contempo themes and issues through a first-look agreement.[13]
On July 29, 1987,Tri-Star Picturesand Imagine Films Entertainment announced the termination of obligations by Imagine to offer Tri-Star distribution rights for all of its television programming and feature films. Imagine, which received more than $1.7 million from Tri-Star, made a $1.3 million payment to Tri-Star, the companies said and advances from Tri-Star were eliminated. The companies said they "intend[ed] to work together on a project-by-project basis" and that projects already in development were not affected. Imagine said the modified agreement "provide[d] it with the flexibility to pursue certain financing and distribution opportunities which were not anticipated when the companies entered the original agreement."[14]
In November 1987, Imagine Films Entertainment announced its plans to move its financial and administrative activities fromNew YorktoLos Angeles, and Neil Braun, who was president and chief-executive officer of the company would not be part of the move, and instead would leave the company and is expected to reveal of his plans shortly and his personal commitments would keep him from making the shift, but he called the consolidation "the right decision for the company" while expressing his disappointment at not being able to stay on.[15]
On December 1, 1987, the company sealed a production and distribution deal withUniversal Picturesvia a "long-term multiple picture agreement" that they distributed Imagine's films for three to five films a year and the agreement "contemplates the possibility" that Universal acquired a 20% share in Imagine[16][8]and it ran through November 1992 for financing 50% of 30 films. Imagine had an IPO in 1986 at $8 for a package of one share and one warrant. Shares rose to $19.25 before falling in the stock market crash in 1987 to $2.25. In the summer of next year, Imagine struck a deal withMCA TVto handle distribution of its television material. MCA and Imagine had a joint television venture which MCA had the exclusive network and home video distribution rights. Imagine retained domestic distribution rights for now and was banking on those rights becoming more valuable in the future as its theatrical and television programs gained exposure. Imagine's television division focused on half-hour comedies, whereas MCA focused on one-hour programs for the networks.[17][18]
In September 1988, Robert Harris who was employee ofMCA, and president ofUniversal Television Groupjoined the company as president of motion pictures and television. Harris said the studio was also taking original feature cable projects withShowtime,HBO,TNT,USAandMTV Network(which includesNickelodeonandVH-1, in addition to projects with on-air networks).[18]

Under the deal, the new joint venture would produce between four and six television films and mini-series a year.MCAwho owned about 20% of Imagine and had worldwide distribution rights to its television series as well as to its long-form programs on a project-by-project basis would also have first consideration on international distribution rights to the joint venture's programs. Imagine andCentralretained rights in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively. The Imagine-Central joint venture was separate from MCA's own ongoing exploration of a joint venture with a European company for Europe-based long-form co-production. The company was in discussions with two or three potential partners, but a deal was not expected soon. Its projects required U.S. and UK presales to go forward, although the venture intended to seek U.S. buyers going beyond the three big commercial networks to includeFox, as well as cable networksTNT,USA Network,ShowtimeandHBO. The deal also allowed for theatrical distribution, although such co-productions were not in the planning.[19]
Imagine andSecond Citysigned a joint venture deal in May 1989. In September 1989, Imagine is entering syndication production business and signed a long-term co-production deal with Second City Entertainment, for a late night talk/comedy strip that was distributed by MCA TV. It used the ready talent pool of Second City comedians. The result wasMy Talk Show, which aired in the 1990–91 season.[18]As HA!: The Comedy Network is ready to air in 1990, they stuck deals with Imagine Films Entertainment, for series featuring the Second City Repertory Company, as well asMTM Enterprises.[20]
In 1990, Imagine Films Entertainment launched a brand new family film label Imagine Family Films, designed to compete with Disney for a family film audience, in order to produce G-rated and PG-rated feature films, and has plans to produce three family films per year, with an eye on the holiday release schedule. The first film planned to be developed for the branding was a remake of the 1963 family feature filmFlipper, and an adaptation of the book seriesCurious George. Both MCA/Universal and Imagine agreed to an extension that Universal would handle theatrical distribution, network, foreign and home video rights, whileUniversal Studios Floridahandled the theme park rights to the properties that were proposed by Imagine Family Films.

The duo agreed to a new six-picture deal with Universal while concurrently offering $9 a share to buy the company's public outstanding share to start a new company with its assets. If not, they planned to leave the company at their contract expiration in November to start the new company anyway. Universal was providing the cash for a buyout of an equity stake in the new company.[12]By January 21, 1993, it approved a $9 share offer made by its founders and co-chief executives, and IFE Acquisition Co. could render the offer for the deal.[23]

Because of their weak financial pact renewal with Universal in January 2012, Imagine laid off 5 employees, including production executive Jeremy Steckler.[27]This also moved Imagine from exclusive to afirst-look deal. By 2013, Imagine was considering other funding methods for the company's films including crowdfunding for aFriday Night Lightsfilm.[28]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
