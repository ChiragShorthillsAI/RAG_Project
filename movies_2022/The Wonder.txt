O'Byrne,David Wilmot,Ruth Bradley, Caolán Byrne,Josie Walker,Ciarán Hinds,Toby Jones, andKíla Lord Cassidy.

In 1862, Elizabeth "Lib" Wright, an English nurse who served in theCrimean War, is sent to a rural village in Ireland where she is tasked with closely watching Anna O'Donnell, afasting girlwho, according to her family, has not eaten for four months. She is to be assisted by a nun, Sister Michael, and the two are to report their findings independently to a council of local dignitaries.
The trauma of theGreat Faminestill looms over the community, and many locals are wary of the English nurse. Lib meets Anna's deeply religious family: her mother Rosaleen, her father Malachy and her elder sister Kitty. At dinner, Lib learns that Anna's elder brother died of an unknown illness. Anna herself appears in good health and says she has been kept alive by consuming "mannafromHeaven".
At her lodgings, Lib encounters William Byrne, a man who grew up locally and whose family perished in the Great Famine while he was away at boarding school. Now a journalist for theDaily Telegraph, William is reporting on the story – which he believes to be a hoax. Lib and William begin a relationship.
Lib's observations initially reveal no evidence of deception. Anna prays many times a day and speaks of the fate of the damned inHell. Lib, who is grieving the death of her only child, takeslaudanumto help her sleep.
Noticing that her mother kisses Anna goodnight on her mouth while cupping her face, Lib deduces that chewed food is being covertly passed to Anna. She forbids the family from touching her. Anna does not deny that this is her "manna", and she discloses to Lib the reasons for her fast: her elder brother had repeatedly raped her, and she attributes his death toGod's wrath. Anna believes that by her fasting and prayers she will free her brother's soul.
Separated from her family's touch, Anna's condition worsens. William files a report to his paper in which he lays the blame for Anna's expected death on her family and the community.
Lib informs the council of her findings, but they refuse to believe her. Sister Michael states that she has found no evidence of Rosaleen feeding Anna. Members of the council question Anna, but she repeats that she is sustained solely by "manna from Heaven".
Knowing that Anna will inevitably die unless she eats soon, Lib pleads with the family to take action, or at least for her mother to resume the kisses. Rosaleen refuses, saying that after Anna's sacred death, both her children will be in heaven. Lib persuades William to assist with a rescue plan.
While the family are atmass, Lib brings Anna, now near death, to a nearby holyclootie well. She tells her that although "Anna" will die, she will be reborn as a new girl named "Nan". Anna closes her eyes and appears to die. When she revives, Lib is finally able to feed her. Lib returns to the house alone and sets it ablaze, at the same time deliberately destroying her laudanum bottle.
Lib tells the council that Anna died of natural causes, and that the fire was an accident. Concerned for their own possible culpability for Anna's death, and the absence of a body within the charred remains of the house, they terminate her employment without pay. Sister Michael tells Lib that, after leaving mass early, she saw a vision of Anna and an angel leaving the area on horseback. She asks Lib to promise that Anna has gone to a better place, which Lib does.
InDublin, Lib reunites with William and Nan, who has recovered her health. The three pose as a family named Cheshire and set sail forSydney. On board, Lib and William watch as Nan eats a full meal.

Fís Éireann / Screen Ireland, formerly known asBord Scannán na hÉireannorthe Irish Film Board, isIreland's state development agency for the Irish film, television and animation industry. It provides funding for the development, production and distribution of feature films, feature documentaries, short films, TV animation series and TV drama series.
The Irish Film Board (IFB) was established to develop filmmaking in Ireland under the provisions of the Irish Film Board Act 1980. Over the following seven years, it funded or co-funded a total of 10 feature films, includingEat the Peach,Anne DevlinandAngel,before its activities were suspended by Taoiseach Charles Haughey.[1]After its closure, the success of several externally funded Irish films, such asMy Left Foot,The Crying GameandThe Commitments, motivated local lobbyists to push for its re-establishment, which occurred in 1993. The board was reconstituted under the chairmanship ofLelia Doolanin 1993 by theMinister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht,Michael D. Higgins, who said "The whole reasoning behind my decision to develop the industry by means of a two-pronged approach – namely, the reactivation of the Irish Film Board and my proposals in relation to independent television production contained in the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill 1993 – is precisely to exploit the technical facilities available in Ireland at present and the imaginative and creative skills which exist in that industry which have been underemployed".[2]
In 2015,Heather Humphreys, theMinister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, announced a decision to change the name of the agency,[3]saying that the name-change "recognises the body's increasing interests beyond the world of cinema and reminds us how, in this digital age, filmmakers now rarely work in the medium of 'film'."[citation needed]On 10 April 2018, at a press conference for the publication ofInvesting in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018–2027(published as part of Project Ireland 2040),Josepha Madigan, theMinister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, announced that from 18 June 2018, the agency would become known as Fís Éireann/Screen Ireland.[4][5]
From 1993 to 2004, the organisation supported an indigenous industry which produced over 100 feature films. Irish film talent was recognized internationally and industry collaboration of Irish producers, writers and directors was well underway producing such work asAilsa(1993),I Went Down(1997),About Adam(1999),Disco Pigs(2000),Bloody Sunday(2002),Intermission(2003),The Magdalene Sisters(2003),Omagh(2004),Man About Dog(2004),Adam & Paul(2004),Breakfast on Pluto(2005),The Wind that Shakes the Barley(2006)Once(2007),Garage(2007),The Secret of Kells(2009),His & Hers(2009)The Guard(2011),Albert Nobbs(2012),What Richard Did(2012),The Stag(2014),Calvary(2014),Song of the Sea(2014),The Lobster(2015),Brooklyn(2015) andRoom(2015).
Notable Irish box office successes for Irish film includeIntermissionwhich grossed over €2 million at the Irish box office in 2003,Man About Dogwhich in 2004 grossed over €2.5 million at the Irish box office,The Guardwhich grossed over €18 million at the international box office andBrooklynwhich had earned over €2 million at the Irish box office and €11 million at the US box office as of December 2015.[citation needed]
IFB-funded productions featured at major international awards includeSix Shooter(Best Live Action Short Film,Academy Awards2006),The Wind that Shakes the Barley(Palme d’Or,Cannes Film Festival2006),Once(Best Original Song,Academy Awards2008),The Secret of Kells(nominated for Best Animated Feature,Academy Awards2010),Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God(Exceptional Merit in documentary Filmmaking,Emmy Awards2013),Song of the Sea(nominated for Best Animated Feature,Academy Awards2015),The Lobster(Jury Prize,Cannes Film Festival2015),Room(People's Choice Award,Toronto International Film Festival2015),The Killing of a Sacred Deer, andThe Breadwinner(Academy Awards nomination).[citation needed]
From 1994 to 2004 there were high levels of international film productions choosingIrelandas a location for filming as a result of the Irish tax incentive for film and television in section 35 of the Finance Act 1987 (later section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997). This film production tax incentive made Ireland more competitive for film production than its international competitors.[citation needed]As a result of the high levels of incoming production into Ireland, the craft and skills base of Irish crews improved, and those crews were then also available to work on Irish films.[citation needed]Major international films shot in Ireland during this period includeBraveheartandReign of Fire.
In the 21st century Ireland has become the base for a number of high-end international TV dramas includingThe Tudors(2007–2010),Ripper Street(2012–2016),Penny Dreadful(2014–2016),Vikings(2013–present),Into the Badlands(2017–present), andNightflyers(2018–present).[citation needed]
The agency did not initially have a policy of fundinganimation. In 1991, a group of animators and animation students established theAnamú Animation Base, promoting the growth of independent Irish animation. Along with other groups, Anamú successfully lobbied for the film board to support animation projects. From the late 1990s, the film board has provided support to Ireland's animation industry.[6]
As of 2017[update], the board was chaired by Annie Doona,[citation needed]the president ofDún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology, where the National Film School is located. At that time, the board also consisted of producer Katie Holly, the managing director of Blinder Films;Larry Bass, founder and CEO ofShinAwil Productions; Mark Fenton, founder and CEO of Masf Consulting; Rachel Lysaght, founder and lead creative producer of Underground Films; Kate McColgan, producer and managing director of Calico Productions and Marian Quinn, writer, director and founder of Janey Pictures.[citation needed]
In 2021 the Board consisted of Susan Bergin (Chair Designate), Zelie Asava, John McDonnell, Ray Harman, Eoin Holohan, Marian Quinn, and Kate McColgan.[7]In 2024 Susan Bergin resigned and Ray Harman assumed the role of Chairperson of the Board, with Catherine Magee as a new appointee to the board and Désirée Finnegan having a five year contract extension.[8]
In 2025 Screen Ireland hired Kate McColgan as its Head of Television; which includes being responsible for the management of the Screen Ireland slate across television and animation series, from development to production.[9]
Screen Ireland operates under the aegis ofDepartment of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. Its annual budget is decided byDáil Éireannand it has a budget of €39.2m for 2024, €1.5m more than its budget in 2023.[10]Screen Ireland provides funds for the development, production and distribution of feature films, feature documentaries, short films, TV animation series and TV drama series.[11][12]

Sebastián Lelio Watt(born 8 March 1974) is a Chilean director, screenwriter, editor and producer.[1]He received critical acclaim for directing the filmsGloria(2013) andA Fantastic Woman(2017), the latter of which won anAcademy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.
Lelio was born in Mendoza, Argentina and moved to Viña del Mar, Chile at the age of 2 with his Chilean mother Valeria. He describes his early life as "nomadic": "Up to the age of 21, I was moving between different cities in Chile. I lived for a time in the United States, and also in Viña del Mar; my maternal family is from Viña...essentially I was never more than two or three years in the same city."[2]
After some years in Viña, his mother moved toConcepción; later, they lived for one year in North America; from the age of 12 to 17, he lived in Cholguán (Yungay, Chile).[citation needed]
Born with the surname Lelio, he changed his surname to that of his adoptive father Campos, but after having attained some fame with his first film, Lelio again took his biological father's name.[2]
After studying journalism for one year atAndrés Bello University, Lelio graduated from the Chilean Film School (Escuela de Cine de Chile). He has directed many short films and musical videos. In 2003, he releasedCero, a documentary based on unedited material from the 2001September 11 attacksin New York, co-directing with Carlos Fuentes. He directed two seasons of the successful documentary seriesMi mundo privado(My private life) together with Fernando Lavanderos. The series followed the private lives of Chilean families from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and was nominated twice for theAltazor Awardsand also theEmmy Awards.[3][4]
In 2005, his debut feature filmLa Sagrada Familia(The Sacred Family) premiered at theSan Sebastián International Film Festival. Filmed over three days and edited over a period of almost one year, the film screened in over one hundred festivals and received a number of national and international awards. In 2009, his second feature film,Navidad(Christmas), premiered at theCannes Film Festival.[5]
The Year of the Tiger(Spanish:El Año del Tigre), Lelio's third feature film, premiered at theLocarno International Film Festivalin 2011.[6]The film is set in the aftermath of the2010 Chile earthquakeand follows an escaped prisoner as he journeys through areas hit hardest by the quake.[7]
As with his first two films,The Year of the Tigerexplores religious faith and how it influences people's behaviours. Lelio told an interviewer fromThe Clinic(magazine), "What I find fascinating is the interplay between the question of meaning that religion poses - a basic question - with the fact that in Chile, in Latin America, the Judeo-Christian version of reality is dominant. Everything is defined in relation to this view: whether you are for or against it, whether or not you escape it."[8]
Lelio's fourth feature film,Gloria, won theSan Sebastián International Film FestivalFilm in Progress award in 2012.[9]The film premiered at theBerlin International Film Festivalin 2013, to excellent reviews, with lead actressPaulina Garcíareceiving the festival's prestigiousBest Actressaward.[10]
In his fictional work, Lelio favours the use ofdigital cinematography. Using improvisation, montage work, and scripts without dialogue, he created the short filmsCiudad de maravillas,Carga vital, and2 minutos.[citation needed]
Lelio has been awarded theGuggenheim Fellowship[11]and a GermanDAADgrant to develop his new projects. As a scriptwriter, Lelio has written or co-written all of his films (including short films), exceptThe Year of the Tiger.[citation needed]
In 2018,A Fantastic Womanwon theOscarforBest Foreign Film, making it the first Chilean film to win that honor.[12]
The Chilean Lelio's Oscar success was reported by the Argentinian press as the "Argentinian Director who won the Oscar".[13][14]In an interview withClarínin February 2018, he stated: "I was born in Argentina but technically I am not Argentinian, I am Chilean. My biological father is Argentinian but I was raised in Chile. I have a relationship with him and Argentina, place where I go often but in strict sense I am not Argentinian."[15]
In 2024, Lelio and other filmmakers signed a letter againstJavier Milei'splans to cut funding of theINCAA.[16][17]
In 2022, Lelio participated in theSight & Soundfilm polls of that year. It is held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, by asking contemporary directors to select ten films of their choice.[18]

He always wants to know a character's needs, and what's beneath those needs. Then he takes all that material and somehow embeds it into the character and physically inhabits the character, so that you never think he's playing the character. It's fascinating to watch him close up. He carries the emotional complexities in every tiny gesture that his character makes so that you immediately can see what his character is like. A character like Roger is full of contradictions, a city banker with an air of entitlement but also a little insecurity picking away at him. Toby can portray that in his walk alone. That's what's great about him, he can portray cold he can portray warm and he can portray both of those things at once."[14]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
