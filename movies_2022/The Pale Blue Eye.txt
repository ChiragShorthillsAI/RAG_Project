In October 1830, alcoholic retired detective Augustus Landor is asked by the military to investigate the hanging ofCadetLeroy Fry at theUnited States Military Academy. Landor is awidowerwhose daughter Mattie ran off a few years ago.
After Fry was hanged, his heart was removed from his body. Examining the corpse, Landor finds a small fragment of a note in Fry's hand. Marks suggest that he did not hang himself but was murdered. Landor secretly enlists the help ofEdgar Allan Poe, another cadet at the academy. Poe and Landor deduce that the note was summoning Fry to a secret meeting. After a cow and a sheep are found butchered with their hearts removed, it is suspected that the murder could be linked toblack magicrituals.
Another cadet, Ballinger, is found hanged with his heart and genitals removed. A third cadet, Stoddard, disappears; Landor presumes Stoddard had reason to believe he was next in line to be killed. Landor and Poe suspect the family of Dr. Daniel Marquis, who performed theautopsyon Fry. Particular suspicion is on his son Artemus and his daughter Lea, who suffers fromrandom seizures. Landor confronts Dr. Marquis, who admits that he resorted to black magic to cure Lea of her seizures.
Poe is drugged and finds Artemus and Lea about to cut out his heart in accordance with the ritual. Landor rescues Poe, but the building catches fire and Lea and Artemus die. Thinking that the case is solved, the military thanks Landor for his service. However, Poe confronts Landor with his realization that the handwriting on the note fragment in Fry's hand matches that of Landor. It becomes apparent that Landor was the killer of the cadets.
Two years earlier, Landor's daughter Mattie wasrapedby Fry, Ballinger, and Stoddard after attending her first ball. Traumatized, she killed herself by jumping off a cliff. Landor pretended that she ran away. Distraught, he set out to avenge his daughter. He left the note for Fry, luring him to a lonely spot before hanging him. A patrol happened to walk by so he was forced to leave the body there. Lea and Artemus stole Fry's heart for their ritual. After killing Ballinger, Landor mutilated his corpse to make it appear that the cadet had been murdered by the same "madman" who desecrated Fry's body.
Poe tells Landor he has two notes with handwriting samples that link Landor directly to the murders, but burns them instead. Landor later stands at the cliff where his daughter leapt to her death. He lets her hair ribbon float away in the wind, saying "Rest, my love".

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 63% of 182 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6/10. The website's consensus reads: "The Pale Blue Eyelacks its source material's piercing gaze, but this well-cast mystery is just intriguing enough to investigate."[15]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 56 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[16]
Matthew Monagle ofThe Austin Chroniclewrote, "The Pale Blue Eyeholds together remarkably as a gothic piece of horror... right up to the point that it doesn't," and that it "seems to lose its nerve in its final minutes, when Cooper's script reverts to a procedural story and reshuffles our relationships to both main characters, relying too heavily on red herrings – and ugly tropes of sexual violence – to bring the narrative home. Indeed, the entire film damn near falls apart."[17]
James Verniere of theBoston Heraldcalled it an "over-acted, badly written, murder mystery dud."[18]Peter TraversofABC Newswrote: "Even when the murderer kills again and characters start daubing their faces with blood and howling at the moon or whatever's handy, the film keeps circling its convoluted plot without finding a satisfying place to land."[19]
The film was nominated forOutstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Photoreal Featureat the21st Visual Effects Society Awards.[20]

We got a lot of letters all the time, and I was told quite frequently by girls who were going into the medical world or the science world or the FBI world or other worlds that I reigned, that they were pursuing those pursuits because of the character of Scully. And I said, 'Yay!'

Duvall was born January 5, 1931, inSan Diego, California,[6][7][8]to Mildred Virginia Duvall (néeHart), an amateur actress, andVirginia-born Rear Admiral William Howard Duvall,[9]United States Navy.[10][11]The second of three sons, he has an elder brother, William Jr. and a younger brother, John (1934–2000), who was an entertainment lawyer.[12]His mother was a relative ofAmerican Civil WarGeneralRobert E. Lee, and a member of theLee Family of Virginia, while his father was a descendant of settlerMareen Duvall.[13]
Duvall was raised in theChristian Sciencereligion and has stated that, while it is his belief, he does not attend church.[14]He grew up primarily inAnnapolis, Maryland,[6]site of theUnited States Naval Academy. He recalled: "I was aNavy brat. My father started at the Academy when he was 16, madecaptainat 39 and retired as arear admiral." He attendedSevern SchoolinSeverna Park, Maryland, andThe PrincipiainSt. Louis, Missouri. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama fromPrincipia CollegeinElsah, Illinois, in 1953.[6][15]
His father had expected him to attend the Naval Academy, but Duvall said "I was terrible at everything but acting—I could barely get through school". He again defied his father by serving in theUnited States Army[16]after theKorean War, from August 19, 1953, to August 20, 1954, leaving the Army asprivate first class.[17]"That's led to some confusion in the press," he explained in 1984, "Some stories have me shooting it out with theCommiesfrom afoxholeover in Frozen Chosin.Pork Chop Hillstuff. Hell, I barely qualified with theM-1 rifleinbasic training".[6]While stationed at Camp Gordon, nowFort Eisenhower, inGeorgia, Duvall acted in an amateur production of the comedyRoom Servicein nearbyAugusta, Georgia.[15]
In the winter of 1955, Duvall attended theNeighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatrein New York City,[6]underSanford Meisner, on theG.I. Bill. During his two years there,Dustin Hoffman,Gene HackmanandJames Caanwere among his classmates.[6][18][19][20]While studying acting, he worked as a Manhattan post office clerk. Duvall remains friends today with fellow California-born actors Hoffman and Hackman, whom he knew during their years as struggling actors.[21]In 1955, Duvall roomed with Hoffman in a New York City apartment while they were studying together at the Playhouse.[22][23]Around this time, he also roomed with Hackman, while working odd jobs such as clerking atMacy's, sorting mail at the post office, and driving a truck.[15]
Duvall began his professional acting career with theGateway Playhouse, anEquitysummer theater based inBellport,Long Island, New York. Arguably his stage debut was in its 1952 season when he played the Pilot inLaughter in the Stars, an adaptation ofThe Little Prince, at what was then the Gateway Theatre.[24]

The playbill ofDark of the Moonindicated that he had portrayed the Witchboy before and that he would "repeat his famous portrayal" of this character for the 1955 season's revival of this play.

While appearing at the Gateway Theatre in the second half of the 1950s, Duvall was also appearing at the Augusta Civic Theatre, the McLean Theatre inVirginiaand theArena StageinWashington, D.C.. The 1957 playbills also described him as "a graduate of the Neighborhood Playhouse" (indicating that he had completed his studies there by the summer of 1957), "a member of Sanford Meisner's professional workshop" and as having worked with Alvin Epstein, amimeand a member ofMarcel Marceau's company. By this time, also July 1957, his theatrical credits included performances as Jimmy inThe Rainmakerand as Harvey Weems inHorton Foote'sThe Midnight Caller.[26][27]

AfterTo Kill a Mockingbird, Duvall appeared in a number of films during the 1960s, mostly in midsized parts, but also in a few larger supporting roles. Some of his more notable appearances include the role of Capt. Paul Cabot Winston inCaptain Newman, M.D.(1963), Chiz inCountdown(1968), and Gordon inThe Rain People.

He drew a considerable amount of attention in 1970 for his portrayal of the malevolent MajorFrank Burnsin the filmMASHand for his portrayal of the title role inTHX 1138in 1971 where he plays a fugitive trying to escape a society controlled by robots.

By the mid-1970s Duvall was a topcharacter actor;Peopledescribed him as "Hollywood's No. 1 No. 2 lead".[16]Duvall received another Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and won both a BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award for his role as Lt. Colonel Kilgore inApocalypse Now(1979). His line "I love the smell of napalm in the morning" fromApocalypse Nowis regarded as iconic in cinema history. The full text is:
You smell that? Do you smell that?Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for twelve hours. When it was all over I walked up. We didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' dink body. But the smell! You know – that gasoline smell... the whole hill! Smelled like... victory. (Pause) Some day this war is going to end...
Duvall received a BAFTA Award nomination for his portrayal of detestable television executive Frank Hackett in the critically acclaimed filmNetwork(1976) and garnered an Oscar nomination forBest Actor in a Leading RoleinThe Great Santini(1979) as the hard-boiledMarineLt.

He also co-starred with Laurence Olivier andTommy Lee JonesinThe Betsy(1978) and portrayed United States PresidentDwight D. Eisenhowerin the television miniseriesIke(1979).
Francis Ford Coppolapraised Duvall as "one of the four or five best actors in the world". Wantingtop billingin films, in 1977 Duvall returned to Broadway to appear as Walter Cole inDavid Mamet'sAmerican Buffalo, stating "I hope this will get me better film roles".[16]He received aDrama Desk Awardnomination forOutstanding Actor in a Play.
"You can't concoct or push ahead something other than what you have at that moment as yourself, as that character. It's you at that moment in time. ... Between action and cut, it's a nice world, but you can't force that any more than you can force it in life."
Duvall continued appearing in films during the 1980s, including the roles of a detective inTrue Confessions(1981), a disillusioned sportswriter Max Mercy inThe Natural(1984) and Los Angeles police officer Bob Hodges inColors(1988).

ActressTess Harper, who co-starred, said Duvall inhabited the character so fully that she only got to know Mac Sledge and not Duvall himself. DirectorBruce Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable to him that he could feel his skin crawling up the back of his neck the first day of filming with Duvall. Beresford said of the actor, "Duvall has the ability to completely inhabit the person he's acting. He totally and utterly becomes that person to a degree which is uncanny."[37]Duvall and Beresford did not get along well during the production and often clashed during filming, including one day in which Beresford walked off the set in frustration.[37]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
