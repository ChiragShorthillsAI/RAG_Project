The film starsRyan Gosling,Chris Evans,Ana de Armas,Jessica Henwick,Regé-Jean Page,Wagner Moura,Julia Butters,Dhanush(in his Hollywood debut),Alfre Woodard, andBilly Bob Thornton. Produced by the Russo brothers' companyAGBO, it is the first film in a franchise based upon Greaney'sGray Mannovels. The plot centers onCIAagent "Sierra Six" (portrayed by Gosling), who is on the run from sociopathic ex-CIA agent andmercenaryLloyd Hansen (Evans) upon discovering corrupt secrets about his superior.
An adaptation of Greaney's novel was originally announced in 2011, withJames Grayset to directBrad Pitt, and laterCharlize Theronin a gender-swapped role, though neither version ever came to fruition. The property lingered indevelopment helluntil July 2020, when it was announced the Russo brothers would direct, with both Gosling and Evans attached to star. Filming took place inLos Angeles,ParisandPraguebetween March and July 2021. With a production budget of $200 million, it is among the most expensive films made byNetflix.
The Gray Manbegan alimited theatrical releaseon July 15, 2022, followed by its digital release onNetflixon July 22, 2022. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for theensemble castand action sequences, but criticism toward the "clichéd script and breakneck pacing."[3]The film is being followed by a sequel, with Gosling and Dhanush reprising their roles, as well as a spin-off.[4]
In 2003, seniorCIAofficial Donald Fitzroy visits a prisoner named Courtland Gentry in Florida. Eight years earlier, Courtland was a minor convicted of killing his abusive father to protect his brother. Fitzroy offers him his freedom in exchange for working as an assassin in the CIA'sSierraprogram, an elite black ops unit, which will allow him to exist in the gray.
In 2021, Courtland, now known asSierra Six, is working with fellow CIA agent Dani Miranda to assassinate a target named Dining Car suspected of selling offnational securitysecrets inBangkokduring the nationalSongkranfestival. Unable to do so stealthily without harming civilians, he attacks Dining Car directly, mortally wounding him. Before dying, he reveals he was also in the Sierra program as Sierra Four. He hands Six an encrypted drive detailing the corruption of CIA official Denny Carmichael, the lead agent on the assassination mission.
Carmichael is elusive about the true purpose of the mission and the contents of the drive when confronted by Six, and Six refuses evacuation from Bangkok with Carmichael's men. Sending the drive to former Sierra Program handler Margaret Cahill in Prague, he calls a now-retired Fitzroy to request extraction.
Carmichael hiresmercenaryLloyd Hansen, a former CIA agent kicked out for hissociopathictendencies, to track down Six and retrieve the drive. Hansen does so by kidnapping Fitzroy's niece Claire, forcing Fitzroy to authorize Six's murder by the extraction team. However, Six kills them and escapes.
Frustrated, Carmichael sends his subordinate Suzanne Brewer to oversee Hansen and keep him in line. Hansen keeps Claire hostage in a mansion in Croatia, at his base of operations. He also puts a massivebountyon Six's head to get mercenaries and assassins to hunt him down.
Six heads toViennato find the serial number of Claire's pacemaker from Laszlo Sosa, but he betrays him for the bounty. Six escapes from Sosa's entrapment just as Hansen arrives with his team (and Hansen kills Sosa), while Six kills all of Hansen's teammates and is rescued by Miranda from Hansen. Her reputation is shot thanks to the Bangkok mission and she initially plans to bring him in to salvage her CIA career.
Six convinces her to drive him to Cahill's apartment in Prague, where she decrypts the drive. It reveals the extent of Carmichael's corruption on behalf of a mysterious benefactor working for ashadow government. Hansen sends several teams of assassins to Cahill, and a terminally ill Cahill blows up her home, so Six and Miranda can escape.
Six is arrested and handcuffed in the square. A massive shootout in Prague results in all the police officers present slaughtered and Six escapes on a tram. After a long chase and gun battle, Six is once again saved by Miranda, in Cahill's bulletproof car. They infiltrate a hospital to track down Claire through her pacemaker's wireless signal.
Subsequently, an Indian mercenary, code-named "Lone Wolf", hired by Hansen, tracks and overcomes Six and Miranda, retrieves the drive, and then brings it to Hansen for the offered bounty. Six and Miranda follow the pacemaker to Hansen's base. She creates a distraction while he infiltrates the mansion rescuing Fitzroy and Claire. Mortally wounded as they flee, Fitzroy sacrifices himself attempting to kill Hansen. Miranda manages to reclaim the drive after Lone Wolf, disgusted by Hansen's sociopathy and amoral tendencies, surrenders the drive to her before leaving.
Hansen takes Claire hostage and drags her into ahedge maze. After a standoff, he lets go of Claire and fights with Six. Before Six can kill him, Brewer shoots Hansen. She then tells Six that she plans to pin Carmichael's actions on Hansen to gain leverage over him. Furthermore, Brewer pledges for Claire's safety, but only if Six continues to work for the CIA.
Six and Miranda are forced to cooperate in the cover-up, where ultimately no action is taken against Carmichael. After the debriefing at the CIA headquarters, Miranda threatens to kill Carmichael if any harm comes to Claire. Six escapes custody and tracks Claire down to a secret location. The two of them drive away to an unknown location.
In addition,Callan Mulveyappears as Dining Car ("Sierra Four") at the start of the film, setting the plot in motion whilstShea Whighamappeared as Six's father in flashbacks.Robert KazinskyandDeobia Opareiappear as Perini and Dulin respectively, two henchmen.

With encouragement from her newly hired Hollywood agent, she decided to move to Los Angeles.[13]When de Armas first arrived in Los Angeles in 2014,[31]she had to start her career again "from scratch."[15]She spoke very little English and, during early auditions, she often "didn't even know what [she] was saying."[6]She spent four months in full-time education to learn English,[32][28]not wanting to be confined to playing characters written specifically for Latina actresses.[8]She starred oppositeKeanu Reevesin her first Hollywood release—Eli Roth's erotic thrillerKnock Knock(2015)—and learned her lines phonetically.[33]Despite giving a positive review of the film, Randy Cordova of theArizona Republicfound de Armas to be "unconvincing" in her role.[34]Reeves then telephoned de Armas to invite her to star in a Spanish-language role in the thrillerDaughter of Godwhich he acted in and produced.[35]Producer Mark Downie hoped the film would be a star vehicle for de Armas, but due to executive meddling,Daughter of Godwas severely edited with de Armas' former starring role reduced. The film was ultimately released asExposedin 2016.[36][37]Frank ScheckofThe Hollywood Reporternoted that while she was "appealing" in her part, de Armas was unable to demonstrate her "character's intense emotional demands."[38]

InDenis Villeneuve's futuristic thrillerBlade Runner 2049(2017), de Armas had a supporting role as Joi, theholographicAIgirlfriend ofRyan Gosling's character, a blade runner. Mark Kermode ofThe Guardiansaid she "brings three-dimensional warmth to a character who is essentially a digital projection."[42]Anthony Lane ofThe New Yorkerfound her to be "wondrous": "Whenever Joi appears, the movie's imaginative heart begins to race."[43]While the performance was initially discussed as a breakthrough role,[44][31]the film underperformed commercially, and de Armas spent much of the following year in her native Cuba, where she purchased a house.[33]For her performance, she earned a nomination for theSaturn Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Among his accolades, he has aGolden Globenomination for playingPablo EscobarinNarcosand anAnnie Awardnomination for his voice-acting performance inPuss in Boots: The Last Wish.
He has starred in multiple feature films inBrazilandHollywood, including box office hits likeElite Squad,which won theGolden Bearat the58th Berlin Internacional Film Festival.Elite Squadoverseas success boosted Moura’s international recognition. In 2013 he debuts in Hollywood with the science fiction feature filmElysium, oppositeMatt DamonandJodie Foster.[1][2]In 2015, he went on to star in the seriesNarcos, playing drug traffickerPablo Escobar, a role for which he was nominated for several awards, including theGolden Globe. Later, Moura returned as director for two episodes ofNarcos: Mexico.
Besides being a well-established and acclaimed actor in Brazil, Moura has achieved international success as a part of the movement that seeks positive representation forSouth Americansin Hollywood.[3]In 2021, he made his debut as a movie director and screenwriter withMarighella, a biopic aboutCarlos Marighella, which hit cinemas after a well-received debut at theBerlin Film Festivalin 2019. The movie won several awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay for Moura in different ceremonies.
Moura was born inSalvadorand raised inRodelas, 540 kilometres (340 mi) from the capital. José Moura, his father, was in the military, so the family, still consisting of his mother, Alderiva, and his younger sister Lediane — who works as a pediatrician — became used to moving around. His relationship with acting started thanks to a schoolmate who had a passion for the arts. His colleague did theater, and Moura wanted to follow the same steps to try to find a class where he would fit in.[4]
He became best friends with Emmy nominee actorLázaro Ramosduring their teenage years inBahia. Ramos reported that his friend was a great supporter of his career since youth.[5]
Moura took acting classes in his teens, and started working in professional theater in 1996. Later, he graduated in journalism at theFederal University of Bahia. He had a small PR company that worked for other local actors and theater companies but the business soon went bankrupt. In the early 2000s, he was a reporter for an interview program onTV Bahia– an affiliate ofRede Globo– and covered high society parties talking to businessmen and celebrities.[6]
During this time Moura continued going to auditions because he aspired to become an actor. He found some success with the playA Máquina. Receiving critical and public acclaim, the show left Bahia and went on the road to Pernambuco, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro where it continued to succeed. The hit boosted the careers of Moura and his colleagues, now-successful Brazilian actorsLázaro RamosandVladimir Brichta.
In cinema, he started with the shortsPop Killer, by Victor Mascarenhas, andRádio Gogó, by José Araripe Jr. His first feature wasWoman on Top, by the Venezuelan directorFina Torres, in which he had a small participation with Ramos, whom he helped with the tests in English, since Ramos did not speak the language.
With the resumption of Brazilian cinema opening up to new faces, he got roles in several productions with important names, such asBehind the Sun, byWalter Salles;The Three Marias, byAluizio Abranches;God Is Brazilian, byCacá Diegues;Nina, byHeitor Dhalia;The Man of the Year, by José Henrique Fonseca;The Middle of the World, by Vicente Amorim. In Recife, during the filming ofGod Is Brazilian, Moura was reading the bookCarandiru StationbyDrauzio Varellawhen he found out about the auditions for the filmCarandiru. Because he was busy with the recordings and unable to appear in the face-to-face auditions in another state, he asked the person in charge of the making of to help him record a tape that would be sent to the production. The material was very dark, and it was only possible to hear the actor reading excerpts from the book. Some time laterHéctor Babencowould call him for a meeting in São Paulo, curious to meet the owner of the voice. The actor ended up joining the cast as the prisoner, dealer and drug addict Zico.[7][8]
He debuted on television after famous Brazilian actor and Mouras's costar inGod Is Brazilian,Antônio Fagundesinvited him for a small role in the popular seriesCarga PesadaonRede Globo. Then came the seriesSexo Frágil, which entered the network's Friday night schedule after its success as a sketch on the TV showFantástico.
The playDilúvio em Tempos de Secawas shown in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and ended its season at the Curitiba Theater Festival atTeatro Guaírafor an audience of more than four thousand people in the two days it was presented. With the end of the work, the actor would turn to television and cinema.
He debuted in telenovelas atA Lua Me DissebyMiguel Falabella, starring heartthrob Gustavo, a contrast to the other characters he had played before.[9]He then amended the telenovela with the limited seriesJK, the biography of the Brazil's former presidentJuscelino Kubitschek, playing the title character in his youth.[10]
In 2007, he was scheduled to play businessman Olavo Novaes, villain of the telenovelaParaíso Tropical, wrote by prestigious Brazilian screenwritersGilberto Bragaand Ricardo Linhares.[11]Braga initially thought about havingSelton Melloon the role, who turned it down due to scheduling conflicts, and director Dennis Carvalho, who had worked with Moura onJK, nominated him for the role. Olavo and his lover, prostitute Bebel, played byCamila Pitanga, became the biggest highlights of the show.[12]It was the duo of actors' idea to intensify the affection relationship between two characters, as it seemed interesting for the plot.[13]The result was a popular appeal for the villains to become officially a couple and have more screen time together, which happened. Both Moura and Pitanga were acclaimed and highly awarded for their roles.
At the same time, the filmElite Squad, in which he played the role of police officer Captain Nascimento, began to have wide repercussions. The film initially would have the aspiring Mathias as the protagonist of the film, but during editing it was realized that showing Nascimento's point of view would set the tone and energy that the production was looking for. From there, the synopsis was changed, the production was reassembled and Moura had to hastily record the narration. The film broke all box office records, won awards in Brazil and Europe, including theBerlin'sGolden Bear, and generated controversy and debates about piracy, police harassment and urban violence.[14]

In a 2004 interview withThe Independent, Thornton explained,
It's just that I won't use real silver. You know, like the big, old, heavy-ass forks and knives, I can't do that. It's the same thing as the antique furniture. I just don't like old stuff. I'm creeped out by it, and I have no explanation why ... I don't have a phobia about American antiques, it's mostly French—you know, like the big, old, gold-carved chairs with the velvet cushions. TheLouis XIV type. That's what creeps me out. I can spot the imitation antiques a mile off. They have a different vibe. Not as much dust.[81]
Thornton is a baseball fan, particularly theSt. Louis Cardinals. In his movie contracts, one of his conditions is a television in his trailer with a satellite dish so he can watch the Cardinals play.[82]He narratedThe 2006 World Series Film, the year-end retrospective DVD chronicling the Cardinals' championship season.

Asked about faith, Thornton said "I’m not what you’d call a traditional religious person. We went to the Methodist church—every Sunday you put on your little creepy suit with your clip-on tie and went to church. But it wasn’t like I paid any attention. Hardcore Christians and atheists—they both say they know exactly what the deal is. Anybody who says, 'I know what happens,' I don't believe them. That's kind of my religion."[77]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
