Hotel heiress Sierra Belmont has been newly appointed as "vice president of atmosphere" at the luxury ski resort inAspenowned by her father Beauregard, despite having no interest in the business. While her father is away on business, Sierra goes up a mountain top with her influencer boyfriend Tad for a photo shoot where he proposes to her.
However, the harsh wind causes Sierra, who was wearing skis, to lose balance. She falls from the top of the mountain, is separated from Tad and hits her head on a tree. Unconscious, Sierra is found by Jake Russell, who she bumped into earlier just after his failed business pitch to her father, and is taken to a hospital. She loses her memory due to the accident and the hospital staff is unable to verify her identify.
Jake offers the amnesiac Sierra a place at his bed and breakfast hotel, the Northstar Lodge, until she can remember who she is or someone comes to claim her. After taking the name Sarah from a stuffed toy that belongs to Jake's daughter Avy, Sierra decides to help him and his family at the lodge in hopes of getting her memory back, but struggles.
However, Sierra bonds with Jake and his family, especially Avy, as she finds out that she lost her mother a couple years ago and feels empathy for her. She also lost her own when she was young and this starts to trigger memories. After improving in helping the lodge, Sierra adjusts to a normal life. As the hotel is struggling, Sierra comes up with a fund raising party for the hotel.
Meanwhile, Tad is lost in the woods and finds shelter with recluse Ralph, who takes him to town on foot. At the Belmont, the hotel staff has not thought to look for Sierra and Tad as they believe that they are away on a trip.
After four days, Beauregard returns from his trip where he finds out that Sierra is missing and informs the Sheriff, who has just retrieved Tad and Ralph. At the party, the town comes together to support the Northstar Lodge, which is declared a historic site.
Before Jake can thank Sierra, Tad and her father rush in to take her home, restoring her memory. On Christmas Day, Sierra does her own chores, much to the staff and Tad's surprise. Sierra decides she will do things for herself going forward and resigns from the position her father created for her realizing she wants to find herself.
Meanwhile, Avy reveals to Jake that her wish was for him to find love and convinces him to seek out Sierra. Realizing that she fell in love with Jake, Sierra breaks off her engagement with Tad.  He is not upset, since he has realized that he is interested in Guest Service Manager Terry (Chase Ramsey), and asks him out on a date.
Later, Jake declares his love for Sierra.  She decides to go back and help Jake run the Northstar Lodge, especially when she finds out that it is sold out for the season after she publicly thanked them at a press conference. Beauregard believes he owes Jake a debt of gratitude for finding Sierra and so decides to invest in the lodge.

It was scheduled to start production in November, so it would be released for the 2022 holiday season.[7][8]In October, Michael Damian confirmed in an interview that filming would begin the following month inUtah, elaborating on the project:[9]
It's a comedy, a lot of really funny moments. We're excited to be working with [Lindsay], she's an incredible talent [...] Netflix approached us, I think we kind of became the go-to Christmas team [... they] said 'we've got a project that we're excited about', that Lindsay was attached to star in it and [asked] 'would you guys be interested in making it?' and we were like, 'yes, we would be thrilled to make it!', and it sort of evolved that way.
In early November, it was announcedChord Overstreethad been cast as Lohan's love interest in the film.George Young,Jack Wagnerand Olivia Perez would also appear in undisclosed roles.[10]In the following week, Netflix released a first look of the film, apublicity stillfeaturing Lohan and Overstreet, which was still untitled.[11][12]A production listing then reportedprincipal photographyfor the film, under the working titleChristmas in Wonderland, would take place in Utah, from November 8 to December 15, 2021.[13][14]It was filmed inPark CityandSalt Lake City.[15]Overstreet was originally considered for the role of Tad Fairchild.[16][17]Lohan improvised some of the comedy scenes and did some of her ownstunts.[18][19][20]Lohan was involved in her character'scostuming.[15]After the production, Lohan spoke about the importance of receiving a credit as executive producer: "It's a really different role that I get to play aside from just starring in the movie. It's being involved in the projects at every step: the whole casting process, the editing and production process. And even parts of the script."[21]Writer Ron Oliver said:[22]
Lindsay knows her stuff cold and she brings ideas to the table. [...] It's really a movie about redemption, or finding your way back to the right path after you've been a spoiled kid. [...] When you write holiday scripts, you're conscious of the tropes of Christmas but also of the tropes of cinema. Lindsay's life has been examined and reported on so closely ever since she was a kid—I was aware of howFalling for Christmasmight reflect her story when I was writing it.
In February 2022, Netflix released its 2022 movie preview with avideo teaserfeaturing footage from its most anticipated releases that included a clip of Lohan in the film, officially titledFalling for Christmas.[23][24][25]That same month, Lohan talked toVogueabout her decision to join the film:[26]
I feel like what we don't have enough of right now is romantic comedies. And that's exactly what it is: It's a really fun, uplifting romantic comedy. And it's actually really funny. When I read the script and when we started to film it, I didn't realize how physically funny we were going to be. There's a lot ofphysical comedyin it, which I really liked doing—it's one of my favorite things to do, which I haven't got to in a while.

We will be very open to a sequel, that sounds like a lot of fun."[33][34]

Samantha Bergeson of theIndieWirestated the film features Lohan's "career-best work in years" and called it "theCitizen Kaneof Netflix Christmas Movies", continuining that "Lohan absolutely owns the film, with Overstreet a worthy counterpart and a generous scene partner."[59]Inthe Guardian, Benjamin Lee called the film "as bland and cloying as any other low-budget festive romance but serves as a strong reminder of [Lohan's] confident screen presence."[60]Writing forVanity Fair,Richard Lawsonsaid Lohan "is back in bright form in the better-than-average Christmas B-movie film" that "is as dumbly winning as it's trying to be. In a more profound sense, it is heartening to see Lohan looking and acting well."[61]David Roony ofTHRclaimed that "if you're going to do anOverboardknockoff that slides into the generic sludge of sentimental holiday-season rom-com, then at least find a couple of leads with the charisma and chemistry to pull it off."[62]Courtney Howard ofVarietyexpressed that the film's "subversive spirit, female-forward smarts and sweet sentimentality remix the formulaic and festive, making all things merry and bright" and it is Lohan's "new, snappy and vibrant work that excels," describing her as "hilarious [...] yet also delicately faceted when melancholic moments arise."[63]
The A.V. Club's Luke Thompson wrote that "it's silly, sitcom-y, and impossible to call "good," butFalling for Christmasis the kind of bad that feels almost appealing," calling Lohan the best part of the holiday rom-com that "occasionally charms" despite being predictable and formulaic.[64]Ed Potton ofthe Timesdescribed it as an "aggressively unambitious blend of pantomime acting, knackered plotting and will-this-do? dialogue," with Lohan being "the least worst thing in it, showing the odd flicker of her old charisma."[65]Writing forRogerEbert.com, Marya E. Gates called it a "tinsel-covered twist onOverboard", commenting "there is a warmth to this film that's hard to resist" and that "Lohan's irrepressible charm" holds it together.[66]InRolling Stone, K. Austin Collins also called it a formulaic film that "reminds audiences what made [Lohan] a movie star in the first place", writing, "This healthy dollop of Christmas camp [...] is eager to give Lohan something to do. That's the point, and that's what the movie pleasingly accomplishes."[67]Sandra Gonzalez ofCNNsaid: "Some actors shoot forOscars, and that's great. Lohan's magic power has always been bringing to life films that have the simple goal of being unchallenging delights. If for that and that alone,Falling for Christmasis a gift."[68]TheLos Angeles Times's Noel Murray praised Lohan's performance, stating that she brings "every bit of her earthy charisma to a rare leading role" and "a spontaneous sincerity to even the corniest scenes. The movie's wrapping is shiny and plastic, but its star quality is genuine."[69]
In December 2022, Rotten Tomatoes rankedFalling for Christmasas the 90th best Christmas movie of all time.[1]The Independent,[70]TheWrap,[71]Cosmopolitan,[72]TV Guide,[73]Seventeen,[74]Den of Geek,[75]Elle,[76]Women's Health,[77]CafeMom,[78]the A.V.

Best said, "I had the honor to have been directed by Norman in a Hitchcock episode called 'The Jar.' Having worked with hundreds of directors in my career, I found very few that had Norman's qualities. He was most kind, gracious and patient with his actors. He is in all respects a complete gentleman in his personal life and I found it a genuine pleasure just to be in the presence of such a talented man. I am also doubly honored to consider him my friend. We are so blessed to have such a man among us for so long."[9]

He also added that, when asked to cry for the camera, "(Best) would say, 'sure thing, which eye?' I'm forever thankful to have cut my teeth in the company of such a fine man."[13]Nearly one year after Best's death, Schneider said about his working relationship with Best:
He was amazing in everything he did; he was not just a funny guy. In fact, I think the comedic timing came to him later on in life because before that he was a very serious actor. I was very fortunate to have grown up working with people like Jimmie Best andDenver PyleandSorrell Booke. Incredibly talented men, incredibly talented actors.[14]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
