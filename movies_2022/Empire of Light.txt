New employee Stephen, who isBlack Britishand lives with his mother Delia, a nurse, starts his new job at the cinema. Hilary is taken with the handsome and charming Stephen, and the two bond when she shows him the cinema's beautiful but disused upper floor.
Hilary becomes jealous when Stephen begins hanging out with Janine, a younger employee. While watching New Year's Eve fireworks from the cinema roof, Hilary impulsively kisses Stephen. The two of them begin a sexual relationship. Hilary cuts off Donald and, happy about the new relationship, stops taking her medication.
Hilary sees Stephen being harassed by a group ofskinheadson the street and later deal with a racist customer and Stephen confides in her about the racism he faces. Hilary and Stephen go to the beach, where Stephen tells her about his first love, Ruby, who works at the same hospital as his mother. When Stephen asks about her past, she goes on an agitated rant about men and angrily destroys a sand castle they had been building.
Neil, a colleague, discovers their relationship and warns Stephen of Hilary's mental health. He tells Hilary it would be best if they end their sexual affair. Donald informs the workers that the cinema has been chosen for the regional premiere ofChariots of Fire. At the premiere, a manic Hilary gets on stage and delivers an agitated speech before informing Donald's wife about their affair. Hilary's mental health deteriorates. While Stephen is at her flat checking on her, mental-health authorities break down her door and take her to be re-institutionalised.
Weeks later, back at the theatre, Donald has been replaced and Stephen begins training with Norman, the cinema's projectionist. He runs into Ruby at the cinema, and they start dating again. Hilary is released from the hospital and returns to work. Stephen advises her to see a movie at the cinema, something she has never done. During her welcome-back party, a skinhead crowd marches past the theatre. When they see Stephen, they break in and assault him. Hilary accompanies him to the hospital, where she meets Stephen's mother.
As Stephen recuperates, Hilary initially stays away. Norman confides in her that he has a son he has not seen in many years because he abandoned his family and cautions her not to run away. She visits Stephen in the hospital. His mother tells Hilary that she makes Stephen happy. An overjoyed Hilary rushes back to the theatre and has requests Norman to play any movie for her; Norman picksBeing There.
Stephen returns to the cinema but informs Hilary that, following her advice, he has decided to return to college and will be leaving town. Stephen remembers his times with Hilary at a going-away dinner with Ruby and his mother. The two meet in a park, where Hilary gives him a book and finally bids him goodbye.
As Stephen leaves on the train, he reads from the bookHigh WindowsbyPhilip Larkin.

The site's critics consensus reads: "Empire of Lightcontains some fine performances and a few flashes of brilliance, but this tribute to the magic of cinema is disappointingly mundane."[20]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted average scoreof 54 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[21]A more favourable review inThe Guardiansaid the film was a "poignant, wonderfully acted drama".[13]
Matt Zoller SeitzofRogerEbert.com, rating the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, wrote that it "starts out a bit dim and unfocused and becomes sharper and more illuminating as it unreels." He also praisedRoger Deakins' cinematography andOlivia Colman's performance, but was more critical of the character of Stephen: "[H]e remains an abstraction for too long, to the point where it looks like the film is setting him up as more of a plot device (or sacrificial lamb) than a man. The movie trembles with intimations of impending doom for Stephen, and the dialogue mentions then-recent racial incidents. But [Sam] Mendes presents his anger, fear and distress with the same dissociated stare that freezes Hilary in her tracks when she sees skinheads tormenting Stephen on a sidewalk."[22]

In 2008, Mendes directedRevolutionary Road, starring his then-wife,Kate Winslet, along withLeonardo DiCaprioandKathy Bates. In a January 2009 interview, Mendes commented, about directing his wife for the first time, "I would open my eyes in the morning and there Kate would be, going, 'Great! You're awake! Now let's talk about the second scene.'"[36]Mendes's comedy-dramaAway We Goopened the 2009Edinburgh International Film Festival. The film follows a couple (John Krasinski,Maya Rudolph) searching North America for the perfect community in which to settle down and start a family. The film was well received by critics but performed poorly at the box office.
In 2010, Mendes co-produced a critically acclaimed documentary filmOut of the Ashesthat deals with cricket in Afghanistan.[37][38]On 5 January 2010, news broke that Mendes was employed to direct the 23rdEon Productionsinstalment of theJames Bondfranchise.[39]The film,Skyfall, was subsequently released on 26 October 2012, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Bond films. Mendes had been employed as a consultant on the film when it was in pre-production, and had remained attached to the project during the financial troubles of MGM. The film was a major critical and commercial success, becoming the 14th film to gross over $1Â billion worldwide.[40][41]
In 2012, Mendes's Neal Street Productions produced the first series of theBBC Onedrama series,Call the Midwife, following it with a second season which began transmission in early 2013.[42]
After the success ofSkyfall, Mendes was asked if he was returning to direct the next Bond film. He responded, "I felt I put everything I possibly could into this film and it was the Bond film I wanted to make. And if I felt I could do the same again, then absolutely I would consider doing another one. But it is a big task and I wouldn't do it unless I knew I could."[43]It was reported that one reason Mendes was reluctant to commit was that one proposal involved making two films back-to-back, based on an idea bySkyfallwriterJohn Logan, which would have resulted in Mendes and other creative personnel being tied up with filming for around four years. It was reported in February 2013 that this idea had since been shelved and that the next two films would be stand-alone. Mendes said in an interview with film magazineEmpirein March 2013 that "it has been a very difficult decision not to accept Michael and Barbara's very generous offer to direct the next Bond movie." He cited, amongst other reasons, his commitments to the stage version ofCharlie and the Chocolate FactoryandKing Lear.[44]
However, on 29 May 2013, it was reported that Mendes was back in negotiations with producersMichael G. WilsonandBarbara Broccolito direct the next Bond film,[45]going back on his previous comments.[34][46]Wilson and Broccoli were willing to postpone production of the film to ensure Mendes's participation. On 11 July 2013, it was announced that Mendes would direct the 24th James Bond film,Spectre; it was released in October 2015.[47]This made him the first filmmaker sinceJohn Glento direct two Bond films consecutively. In April 2016, Mendes was named as the president of the jury for the73rd Venice International Film Festival.[48]
Mendes's next film, war epic1917, was released byUniversal Pictureson 25 December 2019 in the US and on 10 January 2020 in the UK.[49]Based in part on an account told to Mendes by his paternal grandfather,Alfred Mendes, it chronicles the story of two young British soldiers in the spring of 1917 at acritical pointduringWorld War I. Mendes went on to win theGolden Globe Award for Best Directorfor his achievement in directing; in his acceptance speech, he saluted his grandfather, as well as acknowledging the contribution to cinema of fellow nomineeMartin Scorsese, who was nominated forThe Irishman.[50]On 25 January 2020, he won theDirectors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing â€“ Feature Film, following which he was installed by the press as the favourite to win theAcademy Award for Best Directorat the then approaching92nd Academy Awards.[51]However that plaudit went instead toBong Joon-hofor the South Korean filmParasite.[52]The two directors had shared the honours for directing at the25th Critics' Choice Awardsseveral weeks prior.[53]
In 2022, his next feature was the romantic dramaEmpire of Light, starringOlivia ColmanandMicheal Ward.[54]
In February 2024, it was reported that Mendes would produce and direct four separate feature films about each of the members ofthe Beatles, to be released in 2027. The films will be the first Beatles biopics to have full cooperation fromPaul McCartney,Ringo Starr, and the families ofJohn LennonandGeorge Harrison.[55]The films will starPaul Mescal(McCartney),[56]Barry Keoghan(Starr),[57]Joseph Quinn(Harrison),[58]and an actor to be named as Lennon.
Mendes has listedStanley Kubrick,the Coen brothers,Alfred Hitchcock,Martin Scorsese,Wim Wenders,Howard Davies,David Lynch,Peter Brook,Ingmar Bergman,Orson Welles, andFrancis Ford Coppolaas amongst his cinematic and theatrical influences. He citedParis, Texas,Repo ManandTrue Storiesas three "seminal film moments" that influenced his stage and film career, and is also heavily influenced by British comedy acts such asMonty Python,The Goons,Tommy Cooper, andMorecambe and Wise.[18]
Much of his film directing techniques were informed by his background in theatre, which consisted of meticulous attention to detail, slow pacing,pictorialistcomposition, close collaborations with actors, use of tranquil atmosphere, periods of wordlessvisual storytelling, and long takes. Even though he was widely known for his use of long takes inSpectreand1917, he has used them sinceAmerican Beauty.[59]His first two films established a reputation for him of utilising a visual style that was considered formalist and classical, preferring to shoot and stage scenes with theatrical-stylemise-en-sceneand use ofchiaroscuro. His third film,Jarhead, which would mark the first of a long-time collaboration between him and cinematographer Roger Deakins, served as a stylistic departure from the former two films as it relied heavily on a gritter feel with improvised dialogue and looser handheld close-ups. Despite this, it shared a similar attention to detail and flawed characters.[60]
Although he has tackled a variety of genres over the course of his career, Mendes has frequently explored themes of family and isolation in his work. The protagonists in his films are realistically flawed and struggle to fit in a world that is hostile towards them, a theme that was initially established inAmerican Beautyand would be further explored in his subsequent films, includingSkyfallandSpectre, and1917. The exploration of such themes are owed to his early childhood experiences, particularly with his parents, with the most direct being his grandfather and his mother serving as inspirations for the characters of Schofield and Hilary Small in1917andEmpire of Light, respectively.[61][62][63]
In an interview in 2014, Mendes explained his reasoning for exploring such themes: "If you are doing a play or a film, you have to have a secret way in if you are directing it. Sometimes itâ€™s big things.American Beauty, for me, was about my adolescence.Road to Perditionwas about my childhood.Skyfallwas about middle-age and mortality."[64]
Mendes has been married to British Classical musicianAlison Balsomsince 5 January 2017. Their daughter was born in September 2017. Mendes has a son born on 22 December 2003 from his first marriage to actressKate Winsletand a stepson, born March 2010 from Balsom's previous relationship with conductorEdward Gardner. Mendes had a stepdaughter from Winslet's first marriage to filmmakerJim Threapleton.[65]
Mendes was appointed aKnight Bachelorin the2020 New Years Honours Listfor services to drama.[66]
In 2009, Mendes signed a petition in support of film directorRoman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his1977 chargefor drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.[67]
Mendes is an opponent ofBrexit. In 2017, he stated: "I'm afraid that the winds that were blowing before theFirst World Warare blowing again. There was this generation of men fighting then for a free andunified Europe, which we would do well to remember."[68]
In 2012, Mendes participated in theSight & Soundfilm polls of that year. Held every ten years to select thegreatest films of all time, contemporary directors were asked to select ten films of their choice.[69]

He always wants to know a character's needs, and what's beneath those needs. Then he takes all that material and somehow embeds it into the character and physically inhabits the character, so that you never think he's playing the character. It's fascinating to watch him close up. He carries the emotional complexities in every tiny gesture that his character makes so that you immediately can see what his character is like. A character like Roger is full of contradictions, a city banker with an air of entitlement but also a little insecurity picking away at him. Toby can portray that in his walk alone. That's what's great about him, he can portray cold he can portray warm and he can portray both of those things at once."[14]

Firth was born in the village ofGrayshott, Hampshire,[8]to parents who were academics and teachers. His mother, Shirley Jean (nÃ©eRolles), was acomparative religionlecturer at King Alfred's College (now theUniversity of Winchester); and his father, David Norman Lewis Firth, was a history lecturer at King Alfred's and education officer for theNigerian government.[9][10][11]Firth is the eldest of three children; his sisterKateis an actress and voice coach, and his brotherJonathanis also an actor.[12]His maternal grandparents wereCongregationalistministers and his paternal grandfather was anAnglicanpriest. They did overseasmissionarywork, and both of his parents were born and spent part of their childhoods inIndia.[13][14][15]
As a child, Firth frequently travelled due to his parents' work, spending some years inNigeria.[16]He also lived inSt. Louis,Missouri, when he was 11, which he has described as "a difficult time".[17]On returning to England, he attended the Montgomery of Alamein Secondary School (nowKings' School, Winchester), which at the time was a statecomprehensive schoolinWinchester, Hampshire. He was still an outsider and the target ofbullying. To counter this, he adopted the local working-class Hampshire accent and copied his schoolmates' lack of interest in schoolwork.[18]
Firth began attending drama workshops at age 10, and by 14 had decided to be a professional actor. Untilfurther education, he was not academically inclined, later saying in an interview, "I didn't like school. I just thought it was boring and mediocre and nothing they taught me seemed to be of any interest at all."[17]However, atBarton Peveril Sixth Form CollegeinEastleigh, he was imbued with a love ofEnglish literatureby an enthusiastic teacher, Penny Edwards, and has said that his two years there were among the happiest of his life.[19]
After hissixth formyears, Firth moved to London and joined theNational Youth Theatre, where he made many contacts and got a job in thewardrobe departmentat theNational Theatre.[18]He subsequently studied atDrama Centre London.[20]
Firth playedHamletin the Drama Centre end-of-year production, and in 1984, Firth made his film debut as Tommy Judd, Guy Bennett'sstraight,Marxistschool friend in thescreen adaptation of the play Another Country(withRupert Everettas Guy Bennett).[21][22]It was the start of a longstanding public feud between Firth and Everett, which was eventually resolved.[23]He starred with SirLaurence OlivierinLost Empires(1986), a TV adaptation ofJ. B. Priestley's novel.[24]
In 1987, Firth and other up-and-coming British actors such asTim Roth,Bruce PayneandPaul McGannwere dubbed the 'Brit Pack'.[25]That year, he appeared withKenneth Branaghin the film version ofJ. L. Carr'sA Month in the Country.[26]Sheila Johnston observed a theme in his early work of playing those traumatised by war.[27]He portrayed real-life British soldierRobert LawrenceMCin the 1988 BBC dramatisationTumbledown. Lawrence was severely injured at theBattle of Mount Tumbledownduring theFalklands War, and the film details his struggles to adjust to his disability whilst confronted with indifference from the government and public. It attracted controversy at the time, with criticism coming from left and right sides of the political spectrum.[27]Despite this, the performance brought Firth a Royal TV Society Best Actor Award, and a nomination for the 1989BAFTATelevision Award.[28]In 1989, he played the title role inMiloÅ¡ Forman'sValmont, based onLes Liaisons dangereuses.[29]Released just a year afterDangerous Liaisons, it did not make a big impact in comparison.

Firth finally became a British household name through his role as the aloof, haughty aristocratMr. Darcyin the 1995BBCtelevision adaptation ofJane Austen'sPride and Prejudice. Producer Sue Birtwistle's first choice for the part, he was eventually persuaded to take it despite his unfamiliarity with Austen's writing.[31]He and co-starJennifer Ehlebegan a romantic relationship during the filming, which received media attention only after their separation.[32]Sheila Johnston wrote that Firth's approach to the part "lent Darcy complex shades of coldness, even caddishness, in the early episodes".[27]The series was an international success and unexpectedly elevated Firth to stardom[32]â€”in some part due to a scene not from the novel, where he emerges from a lake swim in a wet shirt.[33]Although he did not mind being recognised as "a romantic idol as a Darcy with smouldering sex appeal"[34]in a role that "officially turned him into a heart-throb",[35]he expressed the wish not to be associated withPride and Prejudiceforever.[36]He was, therefore, reluctant to accept similar roles and risk becomingtypecast.[18]
For a time, it did seem as if Mr. Darcy would overshadow the rest of Firth's career, and there were humorous allusions to the role in his next five movies.[37]The most notable was his casting as the love interestMark Darcyin thefilm adaptationofBridget Jones's Diary, itself a modern-day retelling ofPride and Prejudice. Firth accepted the part as he saw it as an opportunity to lampoon his Mr. Darcy character.[38]The film was very successful[39]and critically well-liked.[40]A2004 sequelwas mostly panned by critics[41]but still financially successful.
Prior to this, Firth had a significant supporting role inThe English Patient(1996) as the husband ofKristin Scott Thomas's character, whose jealousy of her adultery leads to tragedy. That year he also played the husband of the character of Kristin's sister,Serena Scott Thomas, in the television miniseriesNostromo. Of the two he said "Serena was a much more faithful wife."
He next played the lead role as a school teacher and obsessedArsenal F.C.footballfan in the romantic fictional adaptationFever Pitch(1997) ofNick Hornbyâ€™s million-selling autobiographical essayFever Pitch: A Fan's Life.
He had parts in lightromanticperiod piecessuch asShakespeare in Love(1998),Relative Values(2000) andThe Importance of Being Earnest(2002).

Firth featured in the ensemble all-star cast ofRichard Curtis'sLove Actually(2003), another financial success[44]which divided critics.[45][46]He was also given solo billing as the romantic lead inHope Springs, but it received very poor reviews[47][48]and made little box-office impact.[49]He starred asAmanda Bynes' character's father in the 2003 teen comedyWhat A Girl Wants, which was based on the playThe Reluctant Debutante.[50]He played painterJohannes VermeeroppositeScarlett Johanssonin the 2003 releaseGirl with a Pearl Earring; some critics praised the film's subtlety[51]and sumptuous visuals,[52]whilst others found it almost restrained, tedious and bereft of emotion.[53]Nevertheless, it received mostly favourable reviews, was moderately successful[54]and earned several awards and nominations.
In 2005 Firth appeared inNanny McPheewithEmma Thompson, in which he plays a struggling widowed father, it was a rare venture for him into thefantasygenre.[55]He also appeared inWhere the Truth Lies, a return to some of his darker, more intense early roles, that included a notorious scene featuring abisexualorgy.[56]Sheila Johnston wrote that it "confounded his fans", but nonetheless that his character "draws knowingly on that suave, cultivated persona",[57]which could be traced from Mr. Darcy. Other films from this time includedThen She Found Me(2007) withHelen HuntandThe Last Legion(2007) withAishwarya Rai.
In 2008, he played the adultBlake Morrisonreminiscing on his difficult relationship with his ailing father in the film adaptation of Morrison's memoir,And When Did You Last See Your Father?It received generally favorable reviews.[58][59]Peter BradshawofThe Guardiangave it four out of five stars.[60]Manohla DargisinThe New York Timessaid: "It's a pleasure to watch Mr. Firthâ€“a supremely controlled actor who makes each developing fissure visibleâ€“show the adult Blake coming to terms with his contradictory feelings, letting the love and the hurt pour out of him."[61]Philip FrenchofThe Observerwrote that Firth "[does] quiet agonising to perfection."[62]However, Derek Elley ofVarietycalled the film "an unashamed tearjerker that's all wrapping and no center."  While he conceded that it was "undeniably effective at a gut level despite its dramatic shortcomings", he added, "Things aren't helped any by Firth's dour perf, as his Blake comes across as a self-centered whiner, a latter-day Me Generation figure who's obsessed with finding problems when there really aren't any."[63]
The film adaptation ofMamma Mia!(2008) was Firth's first foray intomusicals. He described the experience as "a bit nerve-wracking"[64]but believed he got off lightly by being tasked with one of the less demanding songs,Our Last Summer.[65]Mamma Miabecame the highest grossing British-made film of all time,[66]taking in over $600 million worldwide.[67]LikeLove Actually, it polarised critics, with supporters such asEmpirecalling it "cute, clean, camp fun, full of sunshine, and toe tappers",[68]whereas Peter Bradshaw inThe Guardiansaid the film gave him a "need to vomit".[69]Carrie Rickey inThe Philadelphia Inquirerdescribed Firth's performance as "the embodiment of forced mirth."[70]That year, Firth also starred inEasy Virtue, which screened at the Rome Film Festival to excellent reviews.[71]He starred inGenova, which premiered at the2008 Toronto International Film Festival.[72]In 2009 he appeared inA Christmas Carol, an adaptation ofCharles Dickens' novel, using theperformance captureprocedure, playing Scrooge's optimistic nephew Fred.[73]

In May 2011, Firth began filmingGambitâ€”a remake ofa 1960s crime caper, in the part originally played byMichael Caine. It was released in the UK in November 2012 and was a financial and critical failure.[85][86]Empire'sKim Newmanwrote, "Firth starts out homaging Caine with hishorn-rimmedcool but soon defaults to his usual repressed British cold mode",[87]whilstTime Out Londoncalled his a "likeable performance", although criticised the film overall.[88]Stephen Dalton inThe Hollywood Reportersaid, "To his credit, Firth keeps his performance grounded in downbeat realism while all around are wildly mugging in desperate pursuit of thin, forced laughs.[89][90]In 2012, Firth co-founded Raindog Films with British music industry executive and entrepreneurGed Doherty.[91]Its first feature,Eye in the Sky, for which Firth was co-producer, was released in April 2016.[92]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (FullÂ list...)
AmÃ©lie of Leuchtenberg(1812â€“1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor PedroÂ I. She was the fourth child ofEugÃ¨ne de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with AmÃ©lie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria AmÃ©liawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and AmÃ©lie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of AmÃ©lie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich DÃ¼rck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
