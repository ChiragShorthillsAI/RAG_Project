Duvall was born January 5, 1931, inSan Diego, California,[6][7][8]to Mildred Virginia Duvall (néeHart), an amateur actress, andVirginia-born Rear Admiral William Howard Duvall,[9]United States Navy.[10][11]The second of three sons, he has an elder brother, William Jr. and a younger brother, John (1934–2000), who was an entertainment lawyer.[12]His mother was a relative ofAmerican Civil WarGeneralRobert E. Lee, and a member of theLee Family of Virginia, while his father was a descendant of settlerMareen Duvall.[13]
Duvall was raised in theChristian Sciencereligion and has stated that, while it is his belief, he does not attend church.[14]He grew up primarily inAnnapolis, Maryland,[6]site of theUnited States Naval Academy. He recalled: "I was aNavy brat. My father started at the Academy when he was 16, madecaptainat 39 and retired as arear admiral." He attendedSevern SchoolinSeverna Park, Maryland, andThe PrincipiainSt. Louis, Missouri. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama fromPrincipia CollegeinElsah, Illinois, in 1953.[6][15]
His father had expected him to attend the Naval Academy, but Duvall said "I was terrible at everything but acting—I could barely get through school". He again defied his father by serving in theUnited States Army[16]after theKorean War, from August 19, 1953, to August 20, 1954, leaving the Army asprivate first class.[17]"That's led to some confusion in the press," he explained in 1984, "Some stories have me shooting it out with theCommiesfrom afoxholeover in Frozen Chosin.Pork Chop Hillstuff. Hell, I barely qualified with theM-1 rifleinbasic training".[6]While stationed at Camp Gordon, nowFort Eisenhower, inGeorgia, Duvall acted in an amateur production of the comedyRoom Servicein nearbyAugusta, Georgia.[15]
In the winter of 1955, Duvall attended theNeighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatrein New York City,[6]underSanford Meisner, on theG.I. Bill. During his two years there,Dustin Hoffman,Gene HackmanandJames Caanwere among his classmates.[6][18][19][20]While studying acting, he worked as a Manhattan post office clerk. Duvall remains friends today with fellow California-born actors Hoffman and Hackman, whom he knew during their years as struggling actors.[21]In 1955, Duvall roomed with Hoffman in a New York City apartment while they were studying together at the Playhouse.[22][23]Around this time, he also roomed with Hackman, while working odd jobs such as clerking atMacy's, sorting mail at the post office, and driving a truck.[15]
Duvall began his professional acting career with theGateway Playhouse, anEquitysummer theater based inBellport,Long Island, New York.

The playbill ofDark of the Moonindicated that he had portrayed the Witchboy before and that he would "repeat his famous portrayal" of this character for the 1955 season's revival of this play.

While appearing at the Gateway Theatre in the second half of the 1950s, Duvall was also appearing at the Augusta Civic Theatre, the McLean Theatre inVirginiaand theArena StageinWashington, D.C.. The 1957 playbills also described him as "a graduate of the Neighborhood Playhouse" (indicating that he had completed his studies there by the summer of 1957), "a member of Sanford Meisner's professional workshop" and as having worked with Alvin Epstein, amimeand a member ofMarcel Marceau's company. By this time, also July 1957, his theatrical credits included performances as Jimmy inThe Rainmakerand as Harvey Weems inHorton Foote'sThe Midnight Caller.[26][27]

AfterTo Kill a Mockingbird, Duvall appeared in a number of films during the 1960s, mostly in midsized parts, but also in a few larger supporting roles. Some of his more notable appearances include the role of Capt. Paul Cabot Winston inCaptain Newman, M.D.(1963), Chiz inCountdown(1968), and Gordon inThe Rain People.

Colonel Kilgore inApocalypse Now(1979). His line "I love the smell of napalm in the morning" fromApocalypse Nowis regarded as iconic in cinema history. The full text is:
You smell that? Do you smell that?Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for twelve hours. When it was all over I walked up. We didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' dink body. But the smell! You know – that gasoline smell... the whole hill! Smelled like... victory. (Pause) Some day this war is going to end...
Duvall received a BAFTA Award nomination for his portrayal of detestable television executive Frank Hackett in the critically acclaimed filmNetwork(1976) and garnered an Oscar nomination forBest Actor in a Leading RoleinThe Great Santini(1979) as the hard-boiledMarineLt.

"You can't concoct or push ahead something other than what you have at that moment as yourself, as that character. It's you at that moment in time. ... Between action and cut, it's a nice world, but you can't force that any more than you can force it in life."
Duvall continued appearing in films during the 1980s, including the roles of a detective inTrue Confessions(1981), a disillusioned sportswriter Max Mercy inThe Natural(1984) and Los Angeles police officer Bob Hodges inColors(1988).

ActressTess Harper, who co-starred, said Duvall inhabited the character so fully that she only got to know Mac Sledge and not Duvall himself. DirectorBruce Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable to him that he could feel his skin crawling up the back of his neck the first day of filming with Duvall. Beresford said of the actor, "Duvall has the ability to completely inhabit the person he's acting. He totally and utterly becomes that person to a degree which is uncanny."[37]Duvall and Beresford did not get along well during the production and often clashed during filming, including one day in which Beresford walked off the set in frustration.[37]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
