After spending three years without human contact in a remote trailer, former Detective Charlie Waldo returns toLos Angelesto investigate the murder of actor Alistair Pinch‘s wife. Initially unwilling to take the case, he agrees to stay for one day after his ex-girlfriend Lorena went missing.
After Alistair is arrested as the prime suspect, Charlie is lured back to his trailer by gangster Don Q, who claims that Lorena secretly stashed a “mem“ in the trailer. He gives Charlie an ultimatum: to retrieve the mem within 24 hours. Charlie deduces that Alistair‘s wife was killed with one of his missing acting awards and that furniture at the crime scene was moved, casting doubts on the theory believed by the police. The police reveal to him that Lorena was seemingly killed over the mem and fixer Warren Gomes attempts to pressure him off the case.
Charlie storms a party hosted by billionaire Darius Jamshidi, Gomes‘s employer. The next day, Charlie confronts Don Q over Lorena‘s murder, but is knocked out by his henchman. He receives a message from Lorena, who faked her death and hid the “mem”, a memory stick, on his property. Charlie learns that both men ordering attacks him, Jamshidi and gangsta rapper Swag Doggg, have kids in the same class as Alistair. He finds out that all three men had affairs with nymphomaniac school teacher Jayne White and attack him to keep it secret, while Alistair even got her pregnant.
Charlie has now deduced the real killer: Wilson Sikorsky, Alistair‘s boss and his employer. He had an affair with Alistair‘s wife and killed her after she threatened to tell Alistair about the affair and force him to move back to England with her. He hired Charlie because he thought the disgraced detective wouldn’t uncover the mystery and make Alistair take the Fall. After Gomes blackmailed him, he killed him, too. Sikorsky flees but is killed by Q, who reveals that on the memory stick is an epic poem he wrote. Charlie and Lorena reunite.

In August 1994, Image entered theCD-ROMmarket, releasing movies on the CD-ROM format.[5]
As the 1990s came to a close and Laserdiscs gave way to DVDs, Image re-focused on the fledgling format that quickly came to dominate the home video marketplace.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
