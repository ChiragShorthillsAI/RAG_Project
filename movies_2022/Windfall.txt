Windfallwas released on March 18, 2022, byNetflix.[1][2]
A wealthy CEO and his wife come to their vacation home only to discover a burglar. The CEO agrees to give him money and forget about the ordeal without calling the police, but the burglar locks them in a sauna.
Returning to his car, the burglar spots a camera which he suspects is recording him. He returns to the house and confronts them. He now asks for $500,000 in cash. The CEO calls his assistant, who tells him that the money will arrive the following afternoon.
Several conversations between the trio make it clear that the CEO and his wife are in a strained relationship, although the CEO looks forward to having children. At night, the wife tells the burglar that she is not happy with her life; the burglar tells her to stop calling herself a victim for marrying a man for his wealth.
The next day, the CEO guesses the burglar was an employee made redundant by the algorithm he has invented, which aids companies undergoing downsizing. A gardener arrives to work on the house. He takes them outside and talks to the CEO about planting an oak tree. The CEO writes 'Call 911' on the gardener's sketch. The burglar takes notice and orders the gardener to enter the house. His wife and the burglar criticize the CEO for jeopardizing another person's life.
After a few hours, the CEO finally breaks. He belittles the burglar and claims he will not do anything to them because his life is meaningless. After the burglar shoots a warning shot, the gardener tries to escape. He trips and falls through a glass door, and a shard of glass pierces his neck, killing him.
The money is left in front of the house, so the wife retrieves it. She sees a passing car but does not signal it before returning inside. The burglar ties up the CEO and his wife in different rooms. The burglar admits to the CEO that he wanted to know what it was like to live like a rich person. He reveals to him that his wife is taking birth control pills. Cutting herself free, she kills the burglar with a small statue. She then shoots her husband dead, plants the gun in the burglar's hand, and leaves the property.

Andrew Kevin Walker(born August 14, 1964) is an American screenwriter. He is known for having writtenSeven(1995), for which he earned a nomination for theBAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, as well as several other films, including8mm(1999),Sleepy Hollow(1999) and many uncreditedscript rewrites.
Walker was born inAltoona, Pennsylvania, though some time during his childhood, he moved toMechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, where he was raised. He attended theMechanicsburg Area Senior High Schooluntil his graduation in 1982. Walker soon enrolled inPenn State Universityto pursue a career infilm production. He graduated from Penn State in 1986, with aBachelor of Artsin film and video.[1]
Shortly after completing his education, he moved to New York City and took a job atTower Records. During that time, he worked on several projects, but Walker was unable to find much success until 1991, when he completed the script forSeven. Walker decided to move to Los Angeles to sell his screenplay. There, he personally contacted screenwriterDavid Koepp, who showed the script to executives atNew Line Cinema, who ended up purchasing the rights to it. The film, however, took nearly three years to begin production.Christmas VacationdirectorJeremiah S. Chechikwas originally chosen to direct the optioned film but he asked for a number of modifications, including the changes to the ending, particularly the removal of the head in a box scene.[2]Walker continued reworking the script but the film got passed around in Hollywood. The project finally went ahead whenDavid Fincheragreed to direct the film after he read the original draft, which was accidentally sent with the ending intact.[2]
While the project was ongoing, Walker found other work as a screenwriter, including a short stint withHBO'stelevision seriesTales From the Crypt, as well as writing two other films,Brainscan(1994) and the novel adaptationHideaway(1995).[1]
Sevenbegan production between his two other films, headed by Fincher as thedirectorand starringMorgan Freeman,Brad PittandKevin Spacey. At one point during production, the studio proposed several changes — which would later become a recurring theme throughout Walker's career — deeming it too dark for its target audience. Both Fincher and Freeman backed Walker's original script, and it eventually went unchanged.[1]The film was met with critical acclaim and enormous box office success, earning$327,311,859 worldwide.[3][4]It would allow Walker to make a name for himself in the movie industry.
However, Walker would not earn another film credit to his name for another four years, though he penned several uncredited rewrites during this period, includingThe Game(on which he again worked with David Fincher) andPaul W. S. Anderson'sEvent Horizon.[5]In1999, Walker's8MMfinally saw the light of day, having been sold by him for a reported $1.25 million. Once again, the film's production encountered concerns regarding the dark subject matter, and the studio asked Walker to lighten the film's tone. WithJoel Schumacheras director, Walker felt a rewrite would no longer be needed. But as it turned out, Schumacher supported the studio and made changes of his own, leading to a much-publicized fallout between the two, with Walker virtually disowning the film and walking away from the set. He refused to even watch the film, which became a critical failure.[6]In an interview withThe Guardian, he said that "it was such an inherently depressing experience that the very least I can do is protect myself from the miserable experience of actually watching it."[7]In 2015, he expressed his openness to a redo8MMinstead of remakingSeven.[7]The latter had left the studios and producers unhappy with Somerset merely standing there helpless as Mills shot John Doe.[8]
Walker found other success in 1999, as he penned uncredited rewrites to the critical hitsStir of EchoesandFight Club, now considered acult classic. Walker's adaptation ofWashington Irving'sshort story"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" also wrapped up production asSleepy Hollow, directed byTim Burton. While Burton admired Walker's original script, he hired the playwright and Academy Award-winning screenwriterTom Stoppardto tone down the violence.[6]The film, starringJohnny Depp, was still a box office and critical success.[9]
Since the mid-1990s, Walker wrote several screenplays that were nevergreenlitor have yet to go into production, such as a script for a movie starring the superheroSilver Surfer, a version ofX-Men(2000; his script was written in 1994),[10]and a film tentatively titledBatman vs. Superman. The latter film was set to go into production, butWarner Bros.opted to revive their franchises separately, and so the script was shelved.[11]After the announcement and subsequent successes ofBatman BeginsandSuperman Returns, the film seemed to be shelved permanently, thoughWolfgang Petersen, who was due to direct the feature, had continued to express his interest in the project.[12]That script and version of the project was permanently shelved in favor of theZack SnyderhelmedBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.
Walker wrote the 2016 animated dark comedyNerdland, starringPaul RuddandPatton Oswalt.
Walker also wrote as-yet unproduced screenplays for the American version ofThe Girl Who Played with Fireand a remake ofThe Reincarnation of Peter Proud, both forSevendirector David Fincher, as well as the adaption of the graphic novel "The Killer" by Alexis Nolent, which has been filmed by Fincher and stars Michael Fassbender.[13]
Walker also wrote twoshortsfor theBMWFilms seriesThe Hire, starringClive Owen:Ambush, directed byJohn Frankenheimer, andThe Follow, byWong Kar-wai.
Walker also co-wrote (withDavid SelfandPaul Attanasio) the screenplay forThe Wolfman, a remake of theUniversal Studiosclassic. The remake, directed byJoe Johnstonand starringBenicio del Toroin the title role, received a2010release.
Amazon named Walker's 2015 Kindle Single,Old Man Johnson(his first novel), among its "Best of the Year."
Walker is known for making shortcameosin films for which he served as a writer. InPanic Room, he appears as a sleepy neighbor; inFight Club, three detectives are named, respectively, Andrew, Kevin and Walker; and inSeven, he is the corpse near the very beginning of the movie.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
