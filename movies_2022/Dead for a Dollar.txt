The film premieredout of competition at the 79th Venice International Film Festivalon September 6, 2022. It was released in the United States on September 30, 2022, byQuiver Distribution.
In 1897, inNew Mexico Territory, veteranbounty hunterMax Borlund learns that Joe Cribbens, acard sharpand armed robber who served five years in prison after being brought to justice by Borlund, will soon be released. Borlund visits Cribbens to warn him against following through with his vow to "buy a gun and look him up".
A friend of Borlund's introduces him to a businessman, Martin Kidd, who hires Borlund to retrieve his wife, Rachel. He tells Borlund that Rachel was abducted and is being held for ransom inChihuahua, Mexico by Elijah Jones, an African Americanarmy deserter. The officer assigns one of his men, Sergeant Alonzo Poe, to assist Borlund as he was a close friend of Jones and has a map to his hideout, after agreeing to deliver the ransom money. En route, the two men run afoul of Tiberio Vargas, a rich landowner who moonlights as a vicious bandit. Borlund refuses to accede to Vargas's extortion and forces him to leave.
Cribbens also heads south to Chihuahua, where he tries to support himself by winningpokergames. One night, he wins a large sum of money from William "English Bill" Palmer; when Palmer threatens Cribbens at gunpoint for his money back, the latter shoots Palmer dead in self-defense. Vargas goes to see Cribbens and reveals that he and Palmer were working together on a lucrative mining scheme. Since Cribbens killed him, Vargas insists that he now owes him a "favor". Borlund and Poe find the two runaways hiding with Jack Hannon, an American fugitive who mistakenly assumes that Borlund is after him and threatens Rachel's head. Borlund shoots him and saves her.
Jones explains that he had made an arrangement with Vargas to obtain passage toCubafor $5,000, which he planned to pay for out of the ransom. Borlund and his party reach a small border town, where the local police captain agrees to incarcerate Jones and send atelegramto Martin informing him that Rachel has been found. Told to keep an eye on Jones, Poe secretly explains that he intends to set him free, feeling that Jones deserves a chance to live his life how he chooses. Borlund realises this and devises a plan to help Poe engineer Jones's escape once they cross over into the United States.
Borlund learns from Rachel what he had already begun to suspect: Rachel was not abducted; she chose to leave with Jones because Martin married her only for her money and routinely cheats on her with other women. She believes that her husband, humiliated by a black man running off with his wife, has no intention of taking her back home alive. Vargas sends Cribbens to kill Borlund; Poe and Rachel aim their guns at him and Cribbens leaves empty-handed. Vargas then intercepts the stagecoach transporting Martin into Mexico and the two men cut a deal. When Martin arrives, he bribes the captain's corrupt deputy to cover for him while he shoots Jones dead in his cell.
Rachel and her husband reunite and Martin admits that he paid Vargas off torapeand kill her, hoping to sell her death as a story to the newspapers to boost his political ambitions. Rachel takes out herderringerand shoots Martin dead. Vargas and his men arrive and murder both the captain and his deputy. Borlund kills several bandits, while Poe and Rachel kill the rest in a close-quarters shoot-out with the help of a friendly female innkeeper. Vargas manages to shoot Poe in the shoulder, while Cribbens sneaks up from behind and shoots him. Borlund offers his old enemy the chance to leave with his life but Cribbens refuses and subsequently dies when Borlund outdraws him.
Poe is patched up and the movie ends as the three go their separate ways after returning to America. Poe serves in the army for nearly thirty years, retires and dies an old man in a veterans' home in 1937, Rachel never remarries and spends the rest of her life fighting for politically progressive causes after moving toPhiladelphiaand Borlund works as a bounty hunter for the rest of his days.
Hill later recalled he had worked on the script "for about a year and a half, not constantly." The Christopher Waltz character was based on a real character,Chris Madsen, a US Marshal from Denmark. "I thought the idea of a European immigrant as protagonist was a nice, off-center way of getting into a story," said Hill. "We’re so used to the Joel McCrea, Randolph Scott, John Wayne Anglo kind of guy." However he stressed the role was fictionalised.[9]
The film was announced at theMarché du Filmin June 2021. It marks Waltz's return to the genre afterDjango Unchained(2012) and Hill's return to directing afterThe Assignment(2016).[3]Principal photographytook place inSanta Fe, New Mexico, from August 24 to September 21, 2021.[10][7]Approximately 80 crew members, 20 principal cast members, and 40 background and extras from New Mexico were employed for the shoot.[11]
On October 26, 2021, actor Shawn-Caulin Young filed agrievanceagainst stunt coordinator and second unit directorAllan Graf. In his complaint, Young said Graf did not properly supervise the stunts in the film and that he was "hostile on set". He also said the production did not give him suitable protective gear for his eyes and ears when using pyrotechnics and explosives. During the shooting of a scene, Young was asked to serve as a "target" and was hit in the face withshrapneland gunpowder debris. As a result of the scene, he and a camera operator became upset and were later "publicly shamed". At one point, Young said he overheard Graf calling him a "pussy". ProducerCarolyn McMasterand first assistant director Scott Corban Sikman have both disputed the allegations.[12]
Sikman said every member of the cast and crew was offered safety glasses and ear protection. When asked about the scene, Sikman said that Young and the camera operator were moved after the pair were hit with debris. Armorer John Farner only recalled the camera operator complaining about the incident but not Young. Furthermore, two anonymous crew members described the set as "unnerving" after blanks were fired at the floorboards of the set to create smoke; Farner said he was told by Graf that it was common practice to do so. In a statement, the production said Young had worked on the set for only one day—August 2, 2021—and that they "strongly deny any allegation that safety requirements were not fully met and adhered to at all times." According to Young, he was supposed to work for two days but was not brought back on set after asking for a pay raise; McMaster also disputed this claim.[12]

Walter Hill(born January 10, 1940)[1]is an American film director, screenwriter and producer known for his action films and revival of theWestern genre. He has directed such films asThe Driver,The Warriors,Southern Comfort,48 Hrs.and its sequelAnother 48 Hrs.,Streets of FireandRed Heat, and wrote the screenplay for the crime dramaThe Getaway. He has also directed several episodes of television series such asTales from the CryptandDeadwoodand produced films in theAlienfranchise. He foundedBrandywine ProductionswithDavid GilerandGordon Carroll.
Hill said in an interview that "every film I've done has been a Western", and elaborated in another that "the Western is ultimately a stripped down moral universe that is, whatever the dramatic problems are, beyond the normal avenues of social control and social alleviation of the problem, and I like to do that even within contemporary stories".[2]
Hill was born inLong Beach, California, the younger of two sons. His paternal grandfather was awildcat oil driller; his father worked atDouglas Aircraftas asupervisoron the assembly line.[1]Hill has said that his father and grandfather were "smart, physical men who worked with their heads and their hands" and had "great mechanical ability".[3]Hill's family had originally come fromTennesseeandMississippi, "one of those fallen Southern families, shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations".[4]"I got along with both my parents very well," Hill said. "I admired them enormously."[5]
Growing up inSouthern California, Hill wasasthmaticas a child and, as a result, missed several years of school.[3]
Despite the discomfort, it made you comfortable being alone with yourself. You weren't as surrounded by your peers as everybody else your age was... In my case it meant tremendous amount of reading at an early age... I read, listened to radio... I became utterly besotted with daytime serials... it enabled me to live in an imaginary world where one is comfortable with abstract ideas, dominated by stories, narrative, and characters.[1]
Hill became a film fan at an early age, and the first film he remembers seeing wasSong of the South(1946). He later described his taste as "juvenile", stating: "I liked adventure, westerns, but I liked everything. Musicals. But the general, I remember not liking kid movies... still don't, I think that's hung on."[1]His asthma receded when he was 15 and he began to think about becoming a writer.[1]He worked in the oil fields as aroustaboutonSignal Hill, California, during high school and several more years while in college. During one summer, he ran anasbestospipe-cutting machine and worked as a spray painter.
As a teenager, Hill contemplated being acomic bookillustrator and studied art at theUniversidad de las Américas, Mexico City.[4]"Mexico was as far away as I could get without any money," he says.[6]
He then transferred and majored in history atMichigan State University.[1][3]He said that, during this period, he was a particular fan ofErnest Hemingway's writing and came to believe that "the hardest thing to do is write clearly and simply, and make your point in an elegant way".[7]Upon graduation, Hill was called up for theUnited States Armyin 1964, but childhood asthma saw him ruled ineligible. This forced him to think about what he wanted to do for a career. "When you are that age, you think you are going to be in the army two years, it's a huge amount of time. You don't bother worrying about what you are doing. Suddenly, this whole thing was upon me."[7]
Through a friend Hill got a job in Los Angeles researching historical documentaries made by a company that was associated withEncyclopædia Britannica. He began seeing more and more scripts, writing scripts and developed the urge to direct.[4]Hill:
Seeing so many of the European films, Japanese films, I was part of this isolated community in east Hollywood. I remembered thinking just a little further west they are making the films I want to see. I'm going to do this. Sink or swim... I wanted to be a writer on my way to being a director. Directors were already my heroes.Kurosawa, number of Italian directors... Movies from England, France, Sweden, Italy. Poland... One wanted a chance to tell stories in an open, loose, not constricted Hollywood kind of way. At the same time you wanted to work in Hollywood... I was tremendously interested in genre films. Wanted to work within genre films.[7]
After this contract to make historical documentaries finished, Hill worked for a time in the mail room at Universal ("Somebody told me that was a good way to meet people"[7]). He then got into the training program of theDirectors Guild of America, which enabled him to work in television as an apprentice. He observed and worked for over a year on such shows asGunsmoke,The Wild Wild West,BonanzaandWarning Shot. "I did a lot of shows for a couple of weeks, they would rotate you through," he says.[7]
Hill wound up as second assistant director onThe Thomas Crown Affairin 1968.[2][8]He then went on to work as the uncredited secondassistant directoronBullitt—"It was my job to set background and also to set it up with the police. We had to organise every shot so people wouldn't wander out into the middle of the street and be hit... Every time we did a shot I was scared to death."[9]
In 1969, he was the second assistant director onWoody Allen's mockumentary film,Take the Money and Run, but said he remembers doing very little except passing out the call sheets and filling out time cards.[3]He also worked as a first assistant director on atelevision advertisement. "I didn't have a shred of desire in those areas," says Hill of assistant directing. "I wanted to work and be around films. I certainly took my duties fairly seriously and all that. I didn't see it as a long term kind of commitment."[7]
During this time Hill was writing screenplays on nights and on the weekends.
"I began to read screenplays that were being made, and I hesitate to say this, but I guess I read them and said: 'Christ, I could do that.'" It took him "four to five years to write my first screenplay writing at night, while I still had another day job."[10]
He says one of his earlier works "was intensely personal about a love affair I had. It was terrible, I knew it."[7]It was not until he started writing in a more "structured narrative environment" that he "began to find my voice... I had a hard time finishing scripts. My problem was finding certain character narrative concerns. Once I finished scripts, I almost instantly made a living. Not only made a living, but got them made. From the time I finished them to the time they were getting made, making progress on the trail, that all happened pretty quickly.[7]
Hill later said, "I was very sympathetic and identified with theNew Hollywood." But his films "are, or were, rather retro. That is to say, I didn't tackle subjects. I wanted to do genre films."[10]
Hill's first completed screenplay, a Western calledLloyd Williams and His Brother, was optioned byJoe Wizan.[11]It was never made but the script was admired atWarner Broswho asked Hill to pitch some projects. He came up with a detective story,Hickey & Boggsand the studio agreed to finance a draft. "Detective films were very old hat, not the kind of thing a young screenwriter was going to pitch," recalls Hill. "I think they were intrigued, maybe fresh air could be blown into a venerable genre."[12]
Warners liked theHickey & Boggsscript and hired Hill to rewrite the script forThe Thief Who Came to Dinner,for which he ended up getting sole credit.Hickey & Boggswas later sold toUnited Artistsand rewritten by directorRobert Culp.[13]Hill said he felt the film "had some nice moments, but it was cast much differently than it was written. I wasn't too excited about it."[14]
Meanwhile,Peter Bogdanovich's ex-wifePolly Platt, a film editor, had read Hill's script forHickey & Boggsand recommended him to co-writeThe Getaway, which Bogdanovich was going to make with Steve McQueen.[3][15]Bogdanovich and Hill worked on the script together in San Francisco while Bogdanovich was directingWhat's Up, Doc?Hill says that Bogdanovich was interested in making the film a moreHitchcock-type film. They had completed 25 pages when they went back to L.A., whereupon McQueen fired Bogdanovich without reading any of their work.Sam Peckinpahcame on to direct; Hill started from scratch and wrote his own script in six weeks.[3]The resulting film was a big hit which Hill later described "of the films I wrote, I thought it was far and away the best one, and most interesting."[12]He said the success of the film "was really how I got to be a director; the fact it had done so well put me in line to get a shot."[9]
Hill and Peckinpah got along well and for a time it seemed Peckinpah might directLloyd Williamsbut he decided to makePat Garrett and Billy the Kidinstead.The Thief Who Came to Dinnereventually came out. Walter Hill later said "Warren Oates was very good in the movie—better than the movie was. They cut a lot of things out of the movie they shouldn't have."[14]
Hill went on to write a pair ofPaul Newmanfilms,The Mackintosh ManandThe Drowning Pool. By Hill's own admission, his work onThe Mackintosh Man"wasn't much" and he did it to settle a lawsuit withWarner Bros, with whom he was angry for sellingHickey & Boggs—Warners offered to settle the suit if Hill wrote them a screenplay, giving him the chance to adapt his choice of several novels that the studio owned the film rights to. He pickedThe Freedom Trap, byDesmond Bagley.[3]
"I wrote a quick script which I was not particularly enamored with myself," Hill said. However it attracted the interest of Paul Newman and John Huston. "One would like to think you are mistaken about the wonders of your work, but I didn't believe it," he said. "That part turned out to be true. I went over to work on the script with Huston. He wasn't very well, I ended up with sole screen credit, but one of the problems is the screen credit is misleading very often. I wrote 90% of the first half, various people wrote the rest. I didn't think it was a very good film.[12]Hill says he never saw the final product, but was told it was "a real bomb".[14]
ProducersLarry Turmanand David Foster asked Hill to adaptRoss Macdonald's novelThe Drowning PoolforRobert Mulliganto direct as a sequel to a previous Newman film,Harper(1965). The producers did not like the direction Hill took with his script—he later estimated only two scenes in the final film were his[14]—so he left the project to writeHard TimesforLarry GordonatColumbia Pictures.[3]
In the early years of his career, Hill set up his own production company,Brandywine Productions, to develop and produce films. A script came to him,Alien, which he optioned and rewrote with his partner,David Giler. Hill and Giler were not credited for their writing work. Hill decided not to direct the film, which became a massive hit.[16]
John Hugheslater recalled, "I had been writing scripts for quite a while, but I never really knew what screenwriting was about until I read the script Walter wrote forAlien."[17]
By the early 1970s, Hill wanted to direct.
I think in casual conversation I would have told anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.[18]
Hill met producerLawrence Gordonin 1973. He agreed to let Hill direct a film if he wrote a screenplay for him. Hill made a deal to write and direct for scale and in turn got a shot at directing.[3]The result was Hill's 1975 breakthrough film,Hard Times, made on location inNew Orleansfor just $2.7 million in 38 days.[19]James Coburnplayed a fast-talking promoter of illegal street fights in 1930s New Orleans andCharles Bronsonplayed the boxer protagonist.
The film was also a turning point for Hill as a screenwriter. He readAlexander Jacobs' screenplay for theJohn BoormanfilmPoint Blankand considered it a "revelation" in terms of style and format.[3]He decided to tailor his own scripts in that manner, as he described it, "extremely spare, almostHaikustyle. Both stage directions and dialogue."[3]He was also influenced bySam Peckinpah.[20]Hill wroteHard Times,The Driver,The Warriors, and the uncredited rewrite ofAlienin this style.
Following the movie Hill was approached to directThe Shootistwith John Wayne but turned it down as he disliked the script.[21]
He created the TV seriesDog and Catwhich premiered in 1977 starring a youngKim Basingeras a police officer. It was not a ratings success and was soon cancelled. However Hill's pilot script later influencedShane Black's original script forLethal Weapon.[22]
Hill's second film as a director wasThe DriverstarringRyan O'Nealas a laconicgetaway driverfor hire andBruce Dernas a driven cop pursuing him. No character in the film has a name; they are merely The Driver, The Detective, and so forth. Hill originally had wanted to cast Steve McQueen, but he turned down the role because he did not want to do another car film.[19]"This Walter Hill is a force to be reckoned with," said O'Neal, "a first rate writer and an even better director. And he's fast. Most young directors today think they areDavid Lean."[23]
The Driverwas financed byEMI Filmswho announced they would make a second film with Hill, a Western he wrote withRoger Spottiswoode,The Last Gun.[24]HoweverThe Driverwas a commercial failure in the United States. "To say it did not do well would be kind," said Hill. "Had I not been shootingThe Warriorsat the time, I don't think my career would have survived. They loved it overseas, but in those days, that didn't matter that much. It made exactly zero dollars in the United States. I remember the studio had this huge sheaf of Xeroxed reviews they'd handed me — you could stop a fucking .45 slug with this stack, it was so thick. And of all the reviews in this six-inch thick pile, there was only one good one."[25](In 2016 Hill would say that "whenever they show retrospectives of my stuff, it's usually the first thing they show. Sometimes you just have to wait it out."[25])
Hill was going to makeThe Last Gunwith Larry Gordon[26]but when the financing on the project failed to materialize, Gordon showed Hill a copy of the novelThe WarriorsbySol Yurick. They took it toParamount Picturesbecause they were interested in youth films at the time and succeeded in getting the project financed. Hill remembers "it came together very quickly. Larry had a special relationship with Paramount and we promised to make the movie very cheaply, which we did. So it came together within a matter of weeks."[27]
WhenThe Warriorswas released there were a series of shootings and killings at screenings involving filmgoers on their way to or from showings.[28]This prompted Paramount to remove advertisements from radio and television completely and display ads in the press were reduced to the film's title. However the film was very popular and received excellent reviews.
"Hollywood forgives a lot when you have a hit," said Hill. "I don't know what to say about it, other than the fact that it was just a gift in terms of getting it. The studio hated it, and didn't even want to release it. There was a lot of friction with management at the time. Some of it might have been my fault."[25]
James Keach had developed a script about theJesse James Gang,The Long Riders, whichUnited Artistswere willing to finance if a suitable director were to be found. Hill was approached and eagerly agreed to film his first Western. The film is remembered for casting real-life acting brothers (the Keaches, Carradines, Quaids and Guests) as historical outlaw siblings (the James, Younger, Miller and Ford brothers).[29]Hill later said his "code" for the film was to keep "the jokes funny and the bullets real. It is about moral choices. I think people who object to violence shouldn't go to the movies.... The use of all the brothers can be perceived as a gimmick but I wanted a family feeling to the movie."[30]
Hill's next film was going to be adaptations ofThe Last Good Kiss(byJames Crumley) and thenRed Harvest(byDashiell Hammett).[31]However neither were made, though the story ofLast Man Standing(which he made in 1996) was very close toRed Harvest. Instead Hill didSouthern Comfort, originally written in 1976. It was an intenseDeliverance-style thriller about a group of U.S. Army National Guardsmen (includingKeith Carradine,Powers BootheandFred Ward) on weekend maneuvers in the Louisiana bayou who find themselves fighting for survival in the swamps after offending some localCajuns. The film was seen by many as an allegory for America's involvement in theVietnam War, although Hill denies this is the case.[10]
He and David Giler rewrote the script prepared by another writer. According to Hill, "No studio wanted to make it, but an independent guy showed up who had a relationship with Fox. Liked it, said he would finance it."[32]
The film was critically acclaimed but, in Hill's words, it "didn't make a... nickel anywhere. Foreign, domestic, anything... I was proud of the film... But I was disappointed in the lack of response. It was a universal audience failure... Usually you can say they loved it in Japan or something. I don't think anybody loved it anywhere."[32]
Hill tried to makeLone Star, from the play byJames McLureto starPowers BootheandSigourney Weaver(1981).[33][34]LikeRed HarvestandThe Last Good Kissit was not made.
Larry Grosslater recalled meeting Hill in the early 1980s:
He'd had some success, but then he had a series of setbacks. And there was also the scandal aroundThe Warriors; any success had been eclipsed by the killings in the theaters. So there was that, as well as the noncommercial success ofSouthern ComfortandLong Ridersand the fact that there was a writer's strike. All of that meant that Walter hadn't worked in a while. Meaning a year or so. And what happened was the strike ended and the studios didn't have a lot of ready scripts. So this clever colleague,Larry Gordon, dusted off a script that had been shuttling around development and got it greenlit at Paramount with his friendMichael Eisner. And that script was48 Hrs.[35]
48 Hrs.was originally meant to starClint EastwoodandRichard Pryorbut both dropped out.Nick Noltebecame attached as star and Hill's then-girlfriend, a talent agent at ICM, recommended the role of the convict be played by an exciting new comic onSaturday Night Live,Eddie Murphy. The resulting film was a problematic shoot, with many clashes between Paramount and Hill, but it resulted in a massive box office success.[3]
Hill's box office success with48 Hrs.enabled him to raise the money for a stylish "rock 'n' roll fable",Streets of Fire. He almost set this up at Paramount but they changed their mind; Universal decided to finance instead. Initially a box office failure, it gained a following in subsequent years (as have many of Hill's films).[citation needed]
Hill was meant to follow it up with a big screen adaptation ofDick Tracy, replacingJohn Landis.[36]Hill worked onDick Tracyfor several drafts of the script and screenwriterJack Epps Jr.says he "played a big role in reducing and focusing the screenplay".[37]Hill intended to make the film directly afterStreets of Firebut eventually left the project after a dispute over budget with Universal and with starWarren Beatty; the project would be madeseveral years later with Beatty directing.[38]
Hill's success directing Eddie Murphy in48 Hrs.saw him receive an offer to work with Richard Pryor in a new version ofBrewster's Millions(1985). This was Hill's first—and, as of 2016, only—full-fledged comedy. He says he purposefully made the film "to improve his bank account and success quotient",[39]and admitted it was "an aberration in the career line".[40]He added that "whatever [the film's] deficiencies, I think the wistful quality was there. I was happy about that. The picture did well and made money."[32]
After makingBrewster's MillionsHill said he had another comedy in development at Universal. He also wanted to do a new version ofThe Magnificent Seven(1960) which he had written withLukas Heller, "quite a bit different from the original—it's more Hawksian in flavour."[41]The plot had a female doctor hire seven mercenaries to defend an intellectually disabled boy from a lynching.[42]
Hill followedBrewster's MillionswithCrossroads(1986), a music-themed drama from an original script byJohn Fuscoinspired by the life and music ofRobert Johnson. The score was done byRy Cooder, who had been Hill's most regular composer sinceThe Long Riders. The film performed poorly at the box office, despite the presence ofRalph Macchioin the lead.[43]
He also co-wrote (withLukas Heller) and executive producedBlue City(1986) from a 1947 novel byRoss Macdonald. Hill developed this project intended to star a leading man in his mid-30s but by the mid-1980s a number of popular young male actors had emerged, so the script was rewritten to accommodate one of them (Judd Nelson). Hill handed over directing duties toMichelle Manning, who made her debut as director.[44]The film was a critical and commercial disaster.
However, that year also saw the release ofAliens(1986), a sequel toAlien. Hill says he and Giler decided "the next one should be a straight action thriller -the military takes over- a patrol movie."[3]They hiredJames Cameronto make the film and worked on his original treatment "a bit". Hill had a story and executive producer credit on the film which was a massive hit.[3]
In 1987, he returned to hard-edged action withExtreme Prejudice, a contemporary Western forCarolco Picturesabout theWar on Drugsbased on a story byJohn MiliusandFred Rexer, which had been originally written in the mid-1970s. It reunited Hill withNick Nolte. The film was a financial failure. Hill said he "tipped my hat to Sam [Peckinpah] a couple of times"[40]in the film and "I don't think it was understood how much genre parodying was involved in that picture. It rather mystified a lot of American critics but it has its defenders."[40]
Hill returned to the buddy-cop genre withRed Heat(1988), a sort ofGlasnost-era reworking of48 Hrs.withArnold Schwarzeneggeras a stoic Soviet cop who travels to Chicago to catch a Russian drug-dealer (Ed O'Ross). Schwarzenegger is partnered with a wisecracking American cop (Jim Belushi), who is as laid-back and mouthy as his Soviet counterpart is taciturn and humorless. Hill directed and rewroteTroy Kennedy Martin's script. The film, whilst profitable, was considered to be a box office disappointment compared to other Schwarzenegger films of the era.
Around this time, Hill was mentioned as wanting to make an adaptation ofJim Thompson'sPop. 1280but it was never made.[39]A project that was filmed was the horror anthology television seriesTales from the Crypt(1989–96), on which Hill worked as anexecutive producer, as well as directing a number of episodes.
Hill ended the 1980s withJohnny Handsome(1989) starringMickey Rourke. It was based on a 1972 novel byMorton Freedgood, about a criminal who has plastic surgery and seeks revenge on his colleagues who betrayed him. The project had been developed for a number of years—Hill says he turned down the job four times before deciding to do it whenHarold Beckerdropped out as director.[45]The film was a flop at the box office.
Hill had a number of projects in the late 1980s that were never made. These includedAmerican Iron(1989/1990), a film set in the world of bikers written by Hill, Mark Brunet,Daniel Pyne, andJohn Mankiewicz. He also did a draft (with David Giler) of an adaptation of theJim Harrisonnovella,Revenge—this was not used when turnedinto a film in 1990.[46]
Hill began the 1990s with the only sequel he has directed to date,Another 48 Hrs., with Murphy this time top-billed over Nolte. The sequel to his biggest commercial success was thought by many critics to be merely a retread of the original, but became the highest-grossing film that Hill has directed. The film grossed more at the US box office than its predecessor and made $72.7 million from foreign markets for a total of $153.5 million.[47][48]
In 1991 he came close to directing a big screen version of the television seriesThe Fugitive(1963-1967) withAlec Baldwin, but Baldwin was not considered a big enough star. The filmThe Fugitive(1993) was released two years later, starringHarrison Fordand without Hill's involvement, as the film was instead directed byAndrew Davis. Hill was also considered to replaceJohn McTiernanas the director ofPatriot Games(1992), another film in which Baldwin was recast with Ford.[49]
In 1992, Hill directed a film originally calledLootersabout two firemen who cross paths with criminals while searching for stolen loot in an abandonedEast St. Louis, Illinois, tenement building. However, the1992 Los Angeles riotsbroke out shortly before the film's release and the studio delayed its opening, eventually changing the title toTrespass.[50]
Trespasswas based out of an old script, co-written byBob GaleandRobert Zemeckis, years before they would writeBack to the Future.
Following this, he and David Giler wrote a remake ofThe Killerand plans were announced to make it withRichard GereandDenzel Washington.[51]However the film did not proceed. He and Giler also wrote the final script forAlien 3, as well as co-producing it.
Hill planned to direct Alec Baldwin in a new version ofThe Getawaybased on Hill's original script. Then there was a dispute over the budget and Hill left the project in order to makeGeronimo: An American Legend. The film received mixed reviews from critics and fared poorly at the box office. This also happened toThe Getaway(1994), which ended up being directed byRoger Donaldsonfrom Hill's script.
In 1994, Hill and his wife, agent Hildy Gottlieb, signed a two-year non-exclusive deal with Paramount. They developed a film,Sudden Country, an action adventure in the vein ofTreasure Islandset in late-19th century Texas to starElijah Wood, based on a novel byLoren Estleman.[52][53][54][55]The film was not made. Instead Hill wrote and directed a second biopic,Wild Bill(1995). This too had little critical or commercial success. Hill reflected on his career in 1995:
I think every director thinks that he hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't been able to make as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.[54]
Hill admitted his style of films were becoming less fashionable:
I admire a lot of what's going on out there, but the oversize kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films are perceived to be vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I think one of the things about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.[54]
Hill continued as one of the three original producers onAlien Resurrection, although he has stated in several interviews since, that he has had nothing to do with the franchise sinceAlien 3.
His 1996 effortLast Man StandingwithBruce Willis, aProhibition-era Western update ofYojimbo(and thus reminiscent of that film's inspiration,Dashiell Hammett'sRed Harvest, and its western incarnation,A Fistful of Dollars) saw him return to his earlier style to some extent: a gruffantiheroand a heavy focus on stylized action.
Hill and the team who madeTales from the Crypt—Joel Silver,Richard Donner,Robert Zemeckis, andDavid Giler—tried to repeat their success with another anthology,Perversions of Science(1997). Hill worked as producer and directed an episode. However it was not as popular.
Afterwards he was planning on directing a 1970s-set cop drama the following year titledRed White Black and Blue, from a script byAndrew Kevin Walker.[56]Woody HarrelsonandVince Vaughnwere eyed to play the leads, but it never went beyond pre-production.
At the end of the decade, in 1999 Hill was additionally in development onPersona Non GrataforSeven Arts Pictures, "the story of a big-game hunter tracking down an assassin on a transatlantic freighter."[57]
Hill then directed the 2000 filmSupernovaforMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer. When the studio did not agree with his vision, they brought inFrancis Ford Coppolato re-cut the film. This caused Hill to withdraw from the project and credit himself with the pseudonym "Thomas Lee" (a variation ofAlan Smithee), and chose not to be associated with the finished product. Hill called his original version a much darker take than the final product.
"One, it was embarrassing and, two, it made me think about quitting," said Hill. "While Coppola's intentions were honorable, I think he made a bad situation worse. I didn't do anything for a year. I was fortunate enough that I could buy my children a hot lunch. Then, I decided I wanted to work again."[58]
In 2002, Hill directed the prison boxing filmUndisputedstarringWesley Snipes,Ving RhamesandPeter Falk.[59]
In 2002 he said he wanted to makeVengeance is Mine, an original contemporary thriller set inLas Vegas, which he had written with Giler.[60]It was not made. "We almost had it together a couple of times and financing always slipped away at the last second," said Hill.[61]
In 2003,Quentin Tarantinosaid Hill was still worthy of admiration. "I think in the last 10 years he's had a big resurgence in creativity. I think he lost his way for a while in the '80s.Johnny HandsomeI thought was a return to form . . . But I thought withGeronimohe went to a really fantastic place. Everybody talked about how boring it was. But I didn't. I thought he made a really great classic Western and America just wasn't worthy of the privilege."[62]
Hill served as a director and consulting producer for the pilot episode of theHBOWestern drama television seriesDeadwoodin 2004.[63]The series was created byDavid Milchand focused on a growing town in theWestern United States. Hill's work onDeadwoodhas seen him return to favor in critical circles to some extent, earning him aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Seriesin 2004 and aDirectors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Drama Seriesin 2004. However, Hill had a falling out with Milch during the editing ofthe pilotand did not work on any other episodes of the show.[64]
Hill continued his work with westerns by directing the miniseriesBroken Trail, which became the highest-rated film made by a cable network when it premiered onAMC.[19]It also earned him thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series. Hill also won theDirectors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Miniseries or TV Filmfor his efforts onBroken Trail.
In 2006 he reflected on his career saying "Those who have been doing for this for 40 years would like to think that it's a kind of Darwinian survival of the talented. But I think that's half the picture. It has as much as to do with the survival of temperament. There are few people still working now that started when I did. Not many people have the temperament to deal with that."[65]
In 2009 Hill intended to start production on theindiecrime dramaSt. Vincentwritten by Cameron Young and set to starMickey Rourkein the lead role[66]withForest Whitaker,Gong LiandRay Winstonealso cast.[67]That year, Hill also finished the script for a low budgetscience fictionproject calledUnknown, which he intended to make withSigourney Weaver.[68]St. Vincentwould be postponed to 2010, withPierce Brosnan,Billy Bob Thornton,Maria BelloandGiovanni Ribisireplacing them, but was cancelled before the start date.[69]
In the 2010s Hill described his status as "semi-retired" and said he had a number of projects fall through.
"The desirability of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had a good-sized hit in quite a while. And, frankly, I went through a couple of experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I was just sitting at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had sent me a script."[70]
It wasSylvester Stallonewho offered Hill the job of directingBullet to the Head(2012). The film was not a success at the box office.
Hill was going to write and direct a proposed remake ofWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?[71]but it fell through.
He wrote the original story for agraphic novel,Bailes Perdues, which was adapted byMatzwith art by Jef, which was published in France, and later translated asTriggermanby Edward Gauvin and published by theTitan ComicsimprintHard Case Crime.[72]
In 2016 Hill's movieThe Assignment,based on a script Hill had written with Denis Hamill, premiered at theToronto International Film Festivalbefore a limited release and streaming video release in 2017.
In 2016 he said in an interview "You are very privileged to be a director. There is a great quote I'll get wrong ofSamuel Johnson, the English poet and essayist, that: 'We come to the arena uncalled, to seek our fortune and hazard disgrace. That's the game, those are the rules.' So I say to you as an audience, if you wanna feel sorry, feel sorry for the people in Syria, but don't feel sorry for film directors."[10]
In 2017Amazon Studiosrecruited Hill to direct two episodes of the upcoming second season ofGoliath,[73]but he was replaced for an unknown reason.
In 2019 Hill made his recording debut at age 77 withThe Cowboy Iliad: A Legend Told In The Spoken Word. Written and performed by Hill, the spoken word record tells the story of a deadly shootout that occurred in Newton, Kansas in 1871 and its legendary aftermath of violence and controversy. The record was produced by Bobby Woods and featured music by Les Deux Love Orchestra.[21]
"The Cowboy Iliadreaches back to the spoken tradition of storytelling — designed to have no simple resolution, but a mix of history, nostalgia and speculation. And, of course, we wanted to honor the tradition of the Western... In other words, Bobby Woods and I had a couple of shooters and made a record." —Walter Hill
In August 2021 Hill began shooting the upcoming westernDead for a Dollarstarring Christoph Waltz, Willem Dafoe, andRachel Brosnahan. The film premiered at2022 Venice Film Festivalwhere Hill received the Glory to the Filmmaker award.[74]It was released in the United States in September 2022.
For his next project Hill said he would be "going back tofilm noir", and that he had plans to direct several other undisclosed films in addition.[75]
Hill married Hildy Gottlieb, a talent agent atInternational Creative Management, in New York City atTavern on the Greenon September 7, 1986. They have two daughters, Joanna and Miranda.[76]

After a substantial career in German television and theatre, Waltz's Americanbreakthrough rolecame inQuentin Tarantino's 2009 filmInglourious Basterds, in which he playedHans Landa, for which he received theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actorand theCannes Film Festival Best Actor Award.

Waltz was born on 4 October 1956 inVienna,[4]the son of Johannes Waltz, a German set designer, and Elisabeth Urbancic, an Austrian costume designer of Austrian and Slovenian descent.[5][6][7]Waltz comes from a family of theatrical heritage: his maternal grandmother wasBurgtheaterand silent film actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather, Emmerich Reimers, and his great-grandfather, Georg Reimers, were both stage actors who also appeared in silent films.[6][8]Waltz's maternal grandfather,Rudolf von Urban, was a psychiatrist ofSlovenedescent[5][a]and a student ofSigmund Freud.[11]Waltz's father died when he was seven years old[6]and his mother later married composer and conductor Alexander Steinbrecher.[12][13]Steinbrecher was previously married to the mother of directorMichael Haneke; as a result, Waltz and Haneke shared the same stepfather.[14]
Waltz had a passion for opera as a youth, having seen his first opera (TurandotwithBirgit Nilssonin the title role) at around the age of ten. As a teenager, Waltz would visit the opera twice a week.[13]He was uninterested in theatre[6]and wished to become an opera singer.[11]After graduating from Vienna'sTheresianum,[6]Waltz went to study acting at the renownedMax Reinhardt Seminar.[15]At the same time, he also studied singing and opera at theUniversity of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, but eventually decided that his voice was not good enough for an opera career.[8][16]In the late 1970s, Waltz spent some time in New York City where he trained withLee StrasbergandStella Adler. He studied script interpretation under Adler and credits his analytical approach to her teaching.[8]
On his return to Europe, Waltz found work as a stage actor, making his debut at theSchauspielhaus Zürich.[17]He also performed in Vienna,Salzburg,CologneandHamburg.[8][11]He became a prolific television actor in the years 1980 to 2000.

InQuentin Tarantino's 2009 filmInglourious Basterds, Waltz portrayedSS-StandartenführerHans Landa, also known as "The Jew Hunter". Clever, courteous, multilingual—but also self-serving, implacable and murderous—the character of Landa was such that Tarantino feared he "might have written a part that was un-playable".[21]Waltz received theBest Actor Awardfor the performance at the2009 Cannes Film Festivaland received acclaim from critics and the public. In 2009, he began sweeping critics' awards circuits, receiving awards for Best Supporting Actor from theNew York Film Critics Circle, theBoston Society of Film Critics,[22]Los Angeles Film Critics Association,[22]as well as Best Supporting Actor awards at theGolden Globesand theScreen Actors Guild Awards.
The following month, he won theBAFTA for Best Supporting Actor,[23]and won theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[24][25]Tarantino acknowledged the importance of Waltz to his film by stating: "I think that Landa is one of the best characters I've ever written and ever will write, and Christoph played it to a tee. It's true that if I couldn't have found someone as good as Christoph I might not have madeInglourious Basterds".[26]
Waltz played gangster Benjamin Chudnofsky inThe Green Hornet(2011); that same year, he starred inWater for ElephantsandRoman Polanski'sCarnage. He played German bounty hunter King Schultz in Quentin Tarantino'sDjango Unchained(2012), a role Tarantino wrote specifically for Waltz.[27]During a training accident prior to filming, Waltz injured his pelvis, though it did not impact his role in the film.[28]His role garnered him acclaim once again, with Waltz winning the Golden Globe, the BAFTA, and ultimately the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Waltz was born in Vienna to an Austrian mother and German father. Upon his birth his German father only requested a citizenship certificate of Germany. Being born to an Austrian mother, Waltz was Austrian by birthright, and formally requested his Austrian citizenship certificate in 2010, thus holding citizenships of both Austria and Germany, but considers the fact that he also has a German passport a "legal, citizenship law banality".[3]Asked whether he felt Viennese, he responded: "I was born in Vienna, grew up in Vienna, went to school in Vienna, graduated in Vienna, studied in Vienna, started acting in Vienna — and there would be a few further Viennese links. How much more Austrian do you want it?"[42]He received American citizenship by naturalization in 2020 noting that he strongly believed "in this old dictum of no taxation without representation" as he was living in Los Angeles since 2010.[43]
Waltz has three children with his former wife, Jacqueline (néeRauch), a dance therapist originally from New York.[44]The two lived in London and their marriage lasted 17 years.[7][8]Waltz married his second wife, German costume designer Judith Holste, with whom he has a daughter.

Half of his family pronouncedDafoeas/ˈdeɪfoʊ/DAY-foh, while half pronounced it/dəˈfoʊ/də-FOH; he did go with the former as a young actor, but ultimately settled with the latter.[10]In high school, he acquired the nickname Willem,[11]the Dutch version of the name William.[12]He later grew more accustomed to it than his birth name.[10]
After attendingAppleton East High School, Dafoe studied drama at theUniversity of Wisconsin–Milwaukee,[13]and left after 18 months to join the experimental theater companyTheatre XinMilwaukee, before moving to New York City in 1976.[12]He apprenticed underRichard Schechner, the director of the avant-garde theater troupeThe Performance Group, where he met and became romantically involved with directorElizabeth LeCompte. Following tensions between Schechner and other members after they started staging their own productions outside of the group, Schechner left and the remaining members (including LeCompte and her ex-boyfriendSpalding Gray) renamed themselvesThe Wooster Group.[12]Dafoe joined the new company and is credited as one of its co-founders.[14]He continued his work with the group into the 2000s, well after establishing himself as a mainstream film star.[15]

Following a briefbit partinThe Hunger(1983), Dafoe again played the leader of a biker gang inWalter Hill's 1984 action filmStreets of Fire. His character in the film served as the mainantagonist, who captures the ex-girlfriend of a mercenary, played byDiane LaneandMichael Paré, respectively.Janet MaslinofThe New York Timesfelt there were no great performances in the film, but praised Dafoe's "perfectly villainous" face.[20]Dafoe starred alongsideJudge ReinholdinRoadhouse 66(1985) as a pair of yuppies who become stranded in a town onU.S. Route 66.[21]Later in 1985, Dafoe starred withWilliam PetersenandJohn PankowinWilliam Friedkin's thrillerTo Live and Die in L.A., in which Dafoe portrays acounterfeiternamed Rick Masters who is being tracked by two Secret Service agents.[22]Film criticRoger Ebertcommended his "strong" performance in the film.[22]
Dafoe's sole film release of 1986 wasOliver Stone'sVietnam WarfilmPlatoon, gaining him his widest exposure up to that point for playing the compassionate Sergeant Elias Grodin.[23]He enjoyed the opportunity to play a heroic role and said the film gave him a chance to display his versatility, saying "I think all characters live in you. You just frame them, give them circumstances, and that character will happen."[24]Principal photography for the film took place in thePhilippinesand required Dafoe to undergoboot camp training.[25]Los Angeles TimeswriterSheila Bensonpraised his performance and found it to be "particularly fine" to see Dafoe play "something other than a psychopath".[26]At the59th Academy Awards, Dafoe was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[27]Dafoe provided his voice to the documentaryDear America: Letters Home from Vietnam(1987) and, in 1988, Dafoe starred in another film set during the Vietnam War, this time as Buck McGriff in the action thrillerOff Limits.[28][29]His second release of 1988 wasMartin Scorsese's epic dramaThe Last Temptation of Christ, in which Dafoe portrayed Jesus.

"I really made a conscious effort to mix it up, not because in itself it's not the job of an actor to do all different things, but for me that's what I'm interested in. You've got to be careful because you've got to work with what you have, not just for vanity's sake, but I think the best part of being an actor sometimes is the opportunity to transform yourself superficially, and deeply."

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
