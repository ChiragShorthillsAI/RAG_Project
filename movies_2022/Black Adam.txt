Johnson was attached toShazam!early in development and confirmed to portray the villain Black Adam in September 2014, but the producers, at Johnson's urging, later decided to give the character his own film. Sztykiel was hired in October 2017. Collet-Serra joined in June 2019 with a planned release date of December 2021, but this timeline was delayed by theCOVID-19 pandemic. Additional casting took place over the next year, including four members of theJustice Society of America, along with the script being rewritten by Haines and Noshirvani.Principal photographytook place from April to August 2021 atTrilith StudiosinAtlanta, Georgia, and also inLos Angeles.
Black Adampremiered inMexico Cityon October 3, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 21. It was not well-received by critics andfailed to break-evenat the box office, grossing $393 million worldwide gross against a budget of $190–$260 million.
In 2600 BC, the tyrannical king Ahk-Ton ofKahndaqenslaves his people to mine the mythical metal Eternium, using it to forge the Crown ofSabbacto attain power and invincibility. After attempting to stage an uprising against Ahk-Ton, a young slave boy is chosen as champion by the Council of Wizards, transforming him into an adult superhero. He kills Ahk-Ton, ending his reign.
In the present day, Kahndaq is oppressed by the criminal organizationIntergang, asAdrianna Tomaz, an archaeologist, tries to locate the Crown of Sabbac with her brother Karim and colleagues Samir and Ishmael. Inside the tomb, Adrianna obtains the crown, but the Intergang troops kill Samir. As a last resort, she reads an incantation that awakens the superhuman warriorTeth-Adamfrom slumber. US government officialAmanda Wallerdeems Adam a threat; after he slaughters the Intergang troops, she contacts theJustice Societyto apprehend him. Justice Society membersHawkman,Doctor Fate,CycloneandAtom Smasherstop Adam's killing spree and explain to Adrianna that Adam was not a savior but an imprisoned killer.
Ishmael reveals himself as the leader of Intergang's Kahndaq division as well as the last descendant of Ahk-Ton and kidnaps Adrianna's sonAmon, who has hidden the crown. The group finds the crown and gives it back to save Amon. Ishmael attempts to shoot Amon, causing Adam to lose control of his powers, killing Ishmael and wounding Amon. Guilt-ridden, Adam flees and reveals to Hawkman that Kahndaq's champion was actually his late son Hurut, who was killed by Ahk-Ton's assassins after they killed his mother. Having been given Hurut's powers to save his life, Adam, blinded by grief and rage, murdered Ahk-Ton and destroyed his palace. Deemed unworthy by the Council of Wizards, Adam killed them all in retaliation except forShazam, who imprisoned him along with the crown.
Feeling unfit of becoming a true hero, Adam surrenders and the Justice Society takes him to a secret underwaterTask Force Xblack siteinAntarctica, where Emilia Harcourt places him in stasis. Fate again has a premonition of Hawkman's impending death. The Justice Society realizes Ishmael tricked Adam into killing him to be reborn as Sabbac, the champion of the six eponymousdemons. When Sabbac summons the Legions of Hell to terrorize Kahndaq, the Justice Society unsuccessfully attempts to stop Sabbac. Fate believes that Hawkman's death can be avoided with his sacrifice and fights Sabbac alone. Fate uses astral projection to release Adam before he is killed by Sabbac.
Meanwhile, Amon, Adrianna, and Karim rally the people to fight the Legions of Hell. Sabbac overpowers Hawkman, but Adam arrives in time to kill Sabbac, causing the Legions of Hell to disappear. The Justice Society departs on good terms with Adam, who destroys the old throne in the belief that Kahndaq needs a protector, not a ruler. He adopts a new name: Black Adam.
In amid-credits scene, Waller warns Adam against leaving Kahndaq and sendsSuperman, who offers to negotiate with him.

The demons Satan, Aym, Belial, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, and Crateis also appear in this film and are voiced by uncredited actors.[17][18]
New Line Cinemabegan the development of aShazam!feature film in the early 2000s, based on theDC ComicscharacterCaptain Marvel. The title came from the wizardShazamwho gives the hero his powers, with DC unable to use the titleCaptain Marveldue to legal issues.[37]Peter Segalsigned on to direct the film in April 2006,[38]andDwayne Johnsonwas approached about portraying Captain Marvel later that year. By November 2007, Johnson was also interested in the film's antagonist,Black Adam, and had received positive responses from fans about him possibly playing that character.[39]Development on the film was placed on hold by January 2009,[40]but had begun again by April 2014 whenWarner Bros.(the parent company of New Line) and DC began planning a slate of superhero films for itsshared universe, theDC Extended Universe(DCEU).[41]That August, Johnson said he was still attached to the film but had not yet decided if he would play Captain Marvel or Black Adam.[42]A month later, Johnson announced that he would portray Black Adam.[43]Johnson was paid $22.5 million for his involvement.[44]
In January 2017, Johnson met with DC'sGeoff Johnsto discuss the project after studio executives grew concerned that an actor of Johnson's profile was being used as a villain and supporting character in the film instead of starring in it. Following that meeting, they decided to split the project into two films:Shazam!(2019), starring the hero Captain Marvel, whom DC had since rebranded as Shazam; andBlack Adam, with Johnson starring as the titleantihero.[8]Johnson said the two characters would meet onscreen in the future.[45]Johns confirmed in July that Johnson would not appear inShazam!,[46]though his likeness is used in that film for a magicalhologramof Black Adam conjured by the wizard Shazam.[47]
Adam Sztykielwas hired to write the screenplay forBlack Adamin October 2017, with Johnson set to produce the film withDanyand Hiram Garcia of Seven Bucks Productions along withBeau FlynnofFlynnPictureCo.[48][49]At that time, there were plans for Johnson to first appear as Black Adam inthe sequeltoSuicide Squad(2016), which hadGavin O'Connorattached as writer and possible director. The intention was for the members of theSuicide Squadto be tracking a weapon of mass destruction which would be revealed as Black Adam in a small role for Johnson,[50]but these plans were abandoned when O'Connor left that film in 2018.[51]Sztykiel completed a draft of the script by April 2018, when Johnson said there was potential for filming to begin in 2019.[52]At the end of August, Sztykiel handed in another draft and further revisions were underway. Hiram Garcia said then that giving Shazam and Black Adam their own films was allowing the best movie for each character to be developed, and he added that their depiction of Black Adam was not going to be "softened up for audiences", explaining that he is "not the boy scout superhero, he's the guy that's like, okay, you cross him? Well, I rip your head off".[53]In December, Johnson said filming would not begin until the end of 2019 at the earliest due to his commitments toJumanji: The Next Level(2019) andRed Notice(2021).[54]
After the successful release ofShazam!,Black Adambecame a priority for New Line. By June 2019,Jaume Collet-Serrawas in talks to direct the film after impressing Johnson as the director ofJungle Cruise(2021).[49]Collet-Serra described Black Adam as theDirty Harryof superheroes, and said the film would show a darker version of Johnson compared to the adventure comedyJungle Cruise.[55]Johnson revealed in October that filming would begin in July 2020,[56]and announced the following month thatBlack Adamwas scheduled to be released on December 22, 2021.[57]He also said Shazam would not appear in the film, but members of theJustice Society of America(JSA) would be introduced.[58]
Johnson stated in mid-April 2020 that filming had been delayed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, and they were now planning to begin production in August or September of that year.[59]By July, filming was expected to begin in early 2021 inAtlanta, Georgia,[60][16]andNoah Centineowas cast asAtom Smasher.[13]During the virtualDC FanDomeevent in August, Johnson revealed that the film's version of the JSA would includeHawkman,Doctor Fate, andCyclone, in addition to Atom Smasher.[9]He explained thatHawkgirlwas originally included in the team, but for a complicated reason she ultimately could not be used in the film and was replaced with Cyclone.[61]
Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvanihad written a new draft of the script by September,[10]whenAldis Hodgewas cast as Hawkman.[10][11]Collet-Serra discussed his comparisons of the character of Dirty Harry with Johnson, saying "The systems were corrupt, so you had criminals taking advantage. You needed a cop that would cut through the bullshit and basically do what needed to be done. That's very much in line with Black Adam and his way of thinking. I think that's appealing to pretty much everybody. Everybody knows how the world sometimes is not fair, and you need people that break the rules to even out the playing field." Johnson remarked that "the Black in Black Adam refers to his soul", and described his worldview as "myopic", adding that for Adam, "There's no room or space for him being wrong. There's no room or space for anyone else's opinion. There's only room and space for him to justify anything that he does because of his pain. And he pushes and pushes and pushes and does not see any other way. It's very black and white."[62]
The next month, Warner Bros. adjusted their upcoming release schedule due to the pandemic, leavingBlack Adamwithout a release date.[63]Later in October,Sarah Shahijoined the cast asAdrianna Tomaz.[15]Quintessa Swindellwas cast as Cyclone in December,[19]withMarwan Kenzarijoining the cast in February 2021.[16]Filming was expected to begin that April,[16]with the construction of the sets beginning by mid-March.[64]Pierce Brosnanwas cast as Kent Nelson / Doctor Fate at the end of March,[23]and the film was given a new release date of July 29, 2022.[65]In April, James Cusati-Moyer, Bodhi Sabongui,Mo Amer, andUli Latukefujoined the cast in undisclosed roles.[27][22][25][28]Latukefu previously worked with Johnson on the seriesYoung Rock,[28]while Sabongui's character was described as a key role from the Black Adam comics.[22]
Henry Cavillreprises his role asSupermanfrom other DCEU films during the film's mid-credits scene; this marks his first time shooting material as the character sinceJustice League(2017). Johnson stated thatSeven Bucks Productions, including himself, Dany Garcia, and Hiram Garcia, played an integral role in the re-negotiations between Warner Bros. and Cavill. Johnson originally pitched the idea for Cavill to reprise his role toDC FilmspresidentWalter Hamada, who rejected the idea due to his plans for different Superman projects.[66][67]
Principal photographybegan on April 10, 2021, atTrilith Studiosin Atlanta, Georgia,[68][69]withLawrence Sherserving as cinematographer after previously shooting DC'sJoker(2019).[70]Filming was delayed from an initial July 2020 start due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[56][59]Johnson said on June 20, 2021, that there were three weeks left of filming,[71]and on July 15 he announced that he had completed his scenes.[72]Filming then continued without Johnson for several weeks, with the production moving to Los Angeles,[73]and hadwrappedby August 15.[74]
The mid-credits scene was filmed in parts, with Johnson filming it at the end of a day of reshoots and additional photography. The next part was filmed using a body double, without showing the actor's face. Sher said this version of the scene was included in test screening, to positive reactions, prompting a renewed push to include Cavill.[75]Johnson approached Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group co-chairmenMichael De LucaandPamela Abdy, who approved the idea. The final version of the scene was shot remotely in London in September 2022, a month before the film's premiere.[75]
Bill Westenhoferserves as the visual effects supervisor for the film, after doing so for the DCEU filmWonder Woman(2017),[76][77]while John Lee and Michael L. Sale are the editors.[78][79][80]Visual effects vendors includedWētā FX, UPP,Scanline VFX,Digital Domain,DNEG,Rodeo VFX,Lola VFX, Cantina Creative,Tippett Studio, and EDI Effetti Digitali Italiani.[81]Wētā worked on the final battle sequence, which contains many shots that were entirely digital.[82]
In March 2022, Warner Bros. adjusted its release schedule due to the impacts of COVID-19 on the workload of visual effects vendors.Black Adamwas pushed back to October 21, 2022, withThe FlashandAquaman and the Lost Kingdommoved from late 2022 into 2023 to allow time for their visual effects work to be completed.[83]The delay forBlack Adamwas also reportedly due to reshoots that were scheduled for February 2022 having to be postponed because most of the studio space at Trilith was being taken up by production onGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3(2023). Once shooting for that film ended,[84]reshoots forBlack Adambegan in early May,[85]and had concluded early the next month.[86]Initially greenlit on a $190 million budget, the final cost of the film ballooned to as much as $260 million due to the reshoots.[5]Collet-Serra confirmed that work on the film had been completed with apicture lockbeing achieved by July 2022.[87]
Final writing credits were given to Sztykiel, Haines, and Noshirvani, while an additional literary material credit was attributed toDavid Leslie Johnson-McGoldrickwho scribed DC'sAquaman(2018).[88]In October 2022,Djimon HounsouandJennifer Hollandwere revealed to be reprising their respective DCEU roles asShazamandEmilia Harcourt, the former fromShazam!(2019), and the latter fromThe Suicide Squad(2021) and the first season ofPeacemaker.[89][32]The film initially received anR ratingdue to several gruesome death scenes and many cuts had to be made to the film to receive the lower PG-13 rating.[90]
Lorne Balfe, who previously wrote additional music for DC'sThe Dark Knight Trilogyand composed the music forThe Lego Batman Movie(2017), composed the score for the film.[91]Black Adam and the Justice Society's themes were released byWaterTower Musicassingleson September 30 and October 5, 2022, respectively,[92][93]and the full soundtrack was released on October 21.[94]A rendition ofJohn Williams'Superman(1978) theme is played during the mid-credits scene, which Cavill said was selected overHans Zimmer'sMan of Steel(2013) theme because it was more recognizable to audiences.[95]
Johnson promoted the film at the virtualDC FanDomeevent in August 2020, revealing concept art and narrating an animated teaser for the film as well as announcing which members of the JSA would be appearing.[9]The film's new July 2022 release date was announced on March 28, 2021, with another teaser narrated by Johnson that was aired ahead of anNCAABasketball Regional semi-final game and also announced during a "takeover" of New York'sTimes Square. Carly Lane atColliderdescribed the Times Square event as thrilling,[96]whileCNET'sMark Serrels said "booming it over a giant speaker in Times Square" was a "very cool way to announce a movie's release date".[97]The film was promoted at the 2021 DC FanDome in October, with Johnson revealing an opening scene for the film introducing himself as Black Adam. Tom Reimann ofColliderwas excited to finally see footage from the film after its long development history, and said "looks like Dwayne Johnson in a superhero movie, which is to say it looks awesome".[98]BothTheWrap'sRoss A. Lincoln andThe A.V. Club'sWilliam Hughes highlighted the short scene's violence,[99][100]while Matt Patches atPolygoncompared the footage's tone to theMummyfranchise.[101]
In February 2022, more footage from the film was released as part of ashowreelfor Warner Bros.' 2022 slate of DC films, which also includedThe Batman,The Flash, andAquaman and the Lost Kingdom(before the last two were delayed to 2023 in March).[102][83]Johnson, Centineo, and Swindell promoted the film at Warner Bros.'CinemaConpanel in April 2022, where a teaser trailer was launched.[103]The first official trailer was released on June 8, featuring an orchestral remix ofKanye WestandJay-Z's song "Murder to Excellence" (2011).[104]Jennifer Bisset atCNETwrote that the trailer posed Black Adam as a character who "must choose between being a hero or villain – and it looks like he takes the darker path, judging by his take on the question of whether heroes kill people".[105]Both Maggie Lovvit fromColliderand Charles Pulliam-Moore fromThe Vergealso noted Adam's brutality in the trailer. Pulliam-Moore felt that the death of Adam's son "radicalizes him and emboldens him to use his newfound powers to seek a kind of justice so brutal that those around him are forced to lock him away". Lovvit opined that Adam's morality exists "within the grey area between black and white" and was excited at seeing the character's future in the DCEU.[106][107]Writing forIGN, Rosie Knight also felt that it showed Adam's "tragic" backstory, speculating that it could take inspiration from theNew 52iteration of the character, and that it would determine his future actions.[108]
Collet-Serra and the cast promoted the film in the 2022San Diego Comic-Conand revealed exclusive footage for the film.[33]Scottie Andrew ofCNNcompared the footage to that ofShazam! Fury of the Gods(2023), calling it "somehow even moodier".[109]Charles Pulliam-More fromThe Vergefelt the footage depicted Adam as a villain rather than an antihero, noting how theJustice Society of America(JSA) "seem much more keen on stopping him than trying to recruit him to their ranks."[110]Similarly, Pete Volk ofPolygonalso highlighted Adam's confrontation with the JSA.[111]Germain Lussier ofGizmodopraised the action sequences in the trailer, calling it an "action-packed little sizzle".[112]DC Comicspublished a series ofone-shotsfocusing on each member of the JSA, titledBlack Adam – The Justice Society Files, beginning on July 5 and concluding on October 4. Each issue also features a variant cover of the JSA members as they are depicted in the film.[113]The film partnered with ZOA Energy Drinks for an exclusive edition at the 2022San Diego Comic-Con.[114]

TheDVD,Blu-ray, and4Kversions were later released on January 3, 2023. The premium version of the VOD release, along with the 4K and the Blu-ray combo packs, includes ten special features.[117]It was the highest-selling title on physical media in the U.S. for the month according toThe NPD Group.[124]
Black Adamgrossed $168.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $225.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $393.3 million.[6]
In the U.S. and Canada,Black Adamwas released alongsideTicket to ParadiseandThe Banshees of Inisherin, and was projected to earn $58–68 million from 4,402 theaters in its opening weekend.[125]The film made $26.7 million on its first day, including $7.6 million from Thursday night previews, besting the opening day ofShazam!($20.4 million). It went on to gross $67 million during the opening weekend, the highest of Johnson's leading career, while also ranking first at the box office.[126][127]This was also the fifth-highest October opening weekend ever for a film.[128]In its sophomore weekend, the film dropped 59% to $27.5 million, remaining in the first position.[129]During the third weekend, the film grossed $18.3 million for a drop of 33%.[130]In the fourth weekend, it earned $8.1 million for a drop of 56%, while being displaced from the first position byBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever.[131]
Outside the U.S. and Canada,Black Adamearned $75.9 million from 76 countries over its first five days of release. It had the third-highest opening for a Warner Bros. title inLatin Americaduring thepandemic era. InMalaysia($2.2 million),Indonesia($2.9 million), and thePhilippines($1 million), it had the highest opening for a Warner Bros. title during the pandemic.Taiwan($2 million) had the biggest opening for a Warner Bros. film in 2022 and the second-biggest of Johnson's leading career.

Several publications described the film as abox office bomb, withThe Hollywood Reporterstating that the film "will be lucky tobreak even, even considering ancillary revenue."[4][137][138][139][140]Varietyestimated that it would lose $50–100 million against a break-even point of $600 million. Warner Bros. contradicted the claim, stating that the initial break even cost was $450 million, but that figure had come down due to the growth of ancillary revenue streams from home media and the marketing cost being low.[137]Deadline Hollywoodestimated that the film would ultimately turn a profit of $52–72 million due to a smaller estimated marketing budget of $80–100 million (thanks in part to Johnson's social media accounts handling large amounts of the marketing), increase in ancillary revenues from PVOD and streaming, and no one receiving any share from the box office gross.[117]A later report byPuckstated that several Warner executives suspected Johnson and his team of leaking a purported financial sheet toDeadline Hollywoodwhich contained inaccurate figures, including the marketing budget, exaggerated home entertainment revenue, and an inaccurate interest rate for the film.[141][142]
Black Adamwas not well received by critics,[a]with J. Kim Murphy ofVarietynoting that critics generally found the film to be "repetitive and anti-entertaining".[147]OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 39% based on 307 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's critics' consensus reads: "Black Adammay end up pointing the way to an exciting future for DC films, but as a standalone experience, it's a wildly uneven letdown."[151]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 41 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[152]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it 4 out of 5 stars.[126]
Katie Walsh of theLos Angeles Timeswrote: "The director does heroic work crafting a film around Johnson that is fast and entertaining."[153]Writing forConsequence, Liz Shannon Miller gave the film a B grade and said: "On its own merits,Black Adammight feel a little thin in terms of story, but it does deliver plenty of enjoyable moments and a solid ensemble to back up Johnson. But perhaps the most exciting aspect of it is how it might shake up the rest of the franchise going forward."[154]Helen O'Hara ofEmpirerated it 3 out of 5 and wrote that the film attempts "to offer a grand unified theory of DC, mixing family-film tropes with a protagonist who straight-up murders people. The result is sometimes a mess, but it's a generally entertaining one."[155]Todd McCarthy ofDeadline Hollywoodpraised Johnson's performance and the action scenes, writing: "The visual spectacle just keeps coming at you for two hours, and the effects are all so stupendous that you could begin to take it for granted. Practically every shot features something epic or at least unusual going on and director Jaume Collet-Serra, who guided Johnson's [2021] hitJungle Cruise, takes good care to present the star in the most favorable dramatic light."[156]
Maya Phillips ofThe New York Timeswas more critical in her review, calling the film "a dull, listless superhero movie that hits all the expected touchstones of the genre under the guise of a transgressive new antihero story."[157]Rachel LaBonte ofScreen Rantgave the film a 2.5 out of 5 and wrote, "Though suffering from repetitive plot beats and thin characters,Black Adamis powered by Johnson's performance and its promise of an exciting future."[158]TheWrap'sAlonso Duraldecalled the film a "muddled, overstuffed origin story" and wrote: "Most disappointing of all,Black Adamis one of the most visually confounding of the major-studio superhero sagas, between CG that's assaultively unappealing and rapid-fire editing that sucks the exhilaration right out of every fight scene."[159]
In February 2015, Johnson toldTotal Filmthat Black Adam would fightSupermanorBatmanin the future.[167]In April 2017, he stated that DC Films planned to have Black Adam andShazamappearing in a future film together.[45]Henry Cavill, who portrayed Superman in the DCEU, said in April 2018 that there were plans for Johnson's Black Adam to face off against Superman in the future, though he believed that it will take place after Black Adam and Shazam collide.[168]
Dany Garcia stated in May 2021 that Johnson and the other producers planned to make multiple Black Adam films during their "long-term relationship with DC",[169]and Hiram Garcia reiterated in July that there was potential for Cavill and Johnson to appear in a future project together as Superman and Black Adam.[170]That November, Hiram elaborated that they had an outline for future films and spin-offs featuring Black Adam and the JSA, dependent on the first film being a success;[171]he later added that other characters beyond Shazam and Superman were being considered as potential future rivals for Black Adam such asWonder Woman.[172]
In October 2022, Johnson confirmed plans for Black Adam to fight Superman in the DCEU, and reaffirmed plans for the character to crossover with Shazam.[173][174]In a separate interview, Johnson stated that the character will interact with various characters within the DCEU continuity, while there were also options for iterations of characters that exist in their separate universes (namelyThe BatmanandJoker) to crossover through a multiversal scenario.[175]Furthermore, he said thatBlack Adamserves as the first film in Phase One of a new storytelling initiative in the DCEU.[176]Johnson also confirmed that despite the events of the film, Doctor Fate will return in the future of the franchise.[177]
Producers Hiram Garcia and Beau Flynn later confirmed toComicBook.comthat a sequel was planned and that it was intended to be fast-tracked into production, serving as a buildup to the duel between Superman and Black Adam.[178]Cavill himself confirmed his resumed involvement in the DCEU as a whole on October 24, stating that his mid-credits cameo appearance inBlack Adamwas "just a very small taste of things to come".[179]In December, producer and financier Joe Singer toldDeadline Hollywoodthat he believed the film would turn a profit through PVOD and home media sales, furthermore stating thatWarner Bros. Discoverywas still in talks for a sequel.[117]Later that month, Cavill announced that he would no longer play Superman, as DC Studios co-CEOJames Gunnintended to reboot the character in the future.[180]
Also that month, Johnson confirmed that aBlack Adamsequel was not in Gunn's immediate plans, though he added that he and Warner Bros. would "continue exploring the most valuable ways Black Adam can be utilized in future DC multiverse chapters".[5]Gunn reciprocated by saying that he looked forward to future collaborations with Johnson and Seven Bucks Productions.[181]In August 2023, Johnson stated that he believed the film did not get a sequel due to multiple changes of the leadership at Warner Bros. Discovery.[182]

Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]
Warner Bros. owns some shared universes. Some of them are based on books and comics, including some of the highest grossing IP's in the movie industry.

DC Studiosis an American film and television production company that is a division ofWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD). It is responsible for the production of live-action and animated films and television series, as well as video games, based on characters from theAmerican comic bookpublisherDC Comics, primarily as part of its flagshipmedia franchiseandshared universe, theDC Universe(DCU). The studio has been led by writer/directorJames Gunnand producerPeter Safranas its co-chairmen and co-CEOs since it was formed in November 2022.
The studio's predecessor,DC Films, was formed in May 2016 as a division ofWarner Bros. Picturesto oversee DC-based film productions, primarily those from its shared universe franchise theDC Extended Universe(DCEU). It was led by DC comic book and television writerGeoff Johnsand Warner Bros. producer Jon Berg as co-chairmen. After several DCEU films received poor reception and underperformed financially, the duo stepped down by the end of 2017, and the division was reorganized, withWalter Hamadahired as the studio's president. Following the merger of DC and Warner Bros. ownerWarnerMediawithDiscovery, Inc.in April 2022, WBD overhauled operations, resulting in Hamada stepping down in October 2022. DC Films was then dissolved in favor of DC Studios, a new division with greater oversight of DC media. Gunn and Safran, who had worked on some DCEU projects, were hired to lead the studio, and the duo began work on the DCU as a new franchise to serve as asoft rebootof the DCEU.
From 2016 to 2023, DC Films produced 13 films within the DCEU, fromSuicide Squad(2016) toAquaman and the Lost Kingdom(2023), alongside two standalone films,Joker(2019) andThe Batman(2022).Jokerand the studio's filmAquaman(2018) are among the50 highest-grossing filmsof all time, withJokerbecoming the firstR-rated filmto gross over $1 billion. The first DC Studios production is the television seriesThe Penguin(2024), a spin-off fromThe Batman. DC Studios plans to release films and television series within the DCU, starting with the animated seriesCreature Commandosin 2024, and the filmSupermanin 2025. Productions that are not part of the DCU are set to be part of the "DC Elseworlds" label. The studio's first animated film will beDynamic Duo(2028).
After the divisive reception toBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016),Warner Bros. Picturessought to stabilize the direction of its media franchise andshared universe, theDC Extended Universe(DCEU). In May 2016, the studio reorganized to have genre-responsible film executives, thusDC Entertainmentfilms under Warner Bros. Pictures were placed under a new division, DC Films, to be led by Warner Bros.executive vice president, Jon Berg, and thechief creative officerofDC Comics,Geoff Johns. This was done in hopes of competing more directly withMarvel Studios' franchise, theMarvel Cinematic Universe. Johns kept his role at DC Comics, and reported to DC Entertainment's president,Diane Nelson, while Berg reported to Warner Bros. Pictures' president, Greg Silverman.[3]The division's formation was not designed to override the "director-driven" mandate.[8]
Justice League(2017) had one of the biggest film budgets (nearly $300 million) but grossed about $96 million in its opening weekend. An analysis inThe Washington Postexpected that there would be a course correction again, with a possible change in leadership.[9]Forbescontributors felt that the course correction would be for DC Films to give up on the shared universe, while continuing with theWonder Womanfilms and occasionally other films, as Warner Bros. had other franchises they could work with.[10]Despite this, in December, the studio reiterated their planned film slate for the DCEU.[11]That same month, Warner Bros. announced that a new strategy and organization of DC Films would occur, with Berg leaving his position as the studio's co-president of production to form a Warner Bros.–based production company withRoy Lee.[12][13]Johns was expected to remain involved in future DC films moving forward in an advisory role while continuing as the president and chief creative officer of DC Entertainment, with Warner Bros. expected to hire a new studio head.[12]In January 2018, Warner Bros. executiveWalter Hamadawas appointed as the new president of DC Films, to oversee the films in the DCEU. Hamada was closely associated withNew Line Cinema, and helped develop horror films, such asIt(2017) andThe Conjuringfilm franchise.[14]Johns subsequently left his role at DC Entertainment that June and he was no longer involved with the DCEU.[7]
In April 2022, after the merger between Warner Bros.' parent companyWarnerMediaandDiscovery, Inc.to formWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the new CEODavid Zaslavwas exploring a restructuring of DC Entertainment, including having a creative leader akin to Marvel Studios presidentKevin Feigeto lead its film and television projects.[15]Later in July,Toby Emmerichstepped down as the head of the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group. The group was restructured to give DC Films, Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, andWarner Animation Grouprespective leadership. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De LucaandPamela Abdybecame the co-executives of Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. They were also temporarily signed to oversee the remaining units of the group until the new positions were filled.[16][17]
When the release of the filmBatgirlwas canceled by WBD in August, Hamada was not consulted regarding the decision and only learned about it when De Luca and Abdy informed him at a test screening forBlack Adam(2022). Hamada was upset and considered resigning, but agreed to stay untilBlack Adam'srelease.[18]Later that month,Dan Linentered talks to oversee DC's film and television divisions. From this position, Lin was expected to report directly to Zaslav, while Hamada would depart the studio.[19][20]In September, Lin and WBD ended negotiations and agreed to part ways.[21]DuringBlack Adam'sTimes Square premiere in October, star and producerDwayne Johnsonsaid he could be a consultant at DC Films, helping the studio find its next creative leader.[22]Later that month, it was reported that De Luca had been effectively running DC Films in place of Hamada.[23]On October 19, Hamada departed the company, two days before the release ofBlack Adam.[24]
Less than a week after Hamada's departure, writer/directorJames Gunnand producerPeter Safran, who had previously worked together on the DCEU projectsThe Suicide Squad(2021) and its spin-off seriesPeacemaker(2022), were announced as the co-CEOs and co-chairmen of DC Studios, a newly-created production entity under WBD. DC Films was dissolved, and DC Studios helped oversee the remaining films from the studio that were pending release in 2023. The duo was tasked with leading the production of films, television, animation, and video games under the DC label, reporting directly to Zaslav, while also working alongside but independently of the heads of WBD's other divisions. Gunn oversees the creative development of DC projects, while Safran supervises the production side. Their roles officially began on November 1, 2022.[1][25][2][26]
In November, Gunn said that the studio would focus on multiple DCU live-action and animated projects, but also stated that they would acknowledge fan responses and complaints,[27]and confirmed all subsequent DC projects would be released under the DC Studios banner, including those that were filmed before the formation of the studio.[28]In December, Gunn announced that he was writing a new Superman film that would feature a younger actor in the role.Henry Cavillwas not set to return asSuperman, whileBen Affleck, who portrayedBruce Wayne / Batmanin the DCEU, was reported to be in talks to direct a new DC Studios project, before Affleck stated that he was not interested in directing a DC film.[29][30]Gunn later revealed that new DC films would have an equal focus on popular and obscure characters, drawing inspiration from the DC animated seriesJustice League Unlimited(2004–2006) andYoung Justice(2010–2022).[31][32]
On January 31, 2023, Gunn and Safran announced the first slate of DCU content, titled "Chapter One: Gods and Monsters". They also assembled awriters' roomthat includedDrew Goddard,Jeremy Slater,Christina Hodson, Christal Henry, andTom King.[31]Projects that are not a part of the shared universe will be branded as "DC Elseworlds".[33]The following month, Gunn confirmed development for animated films within both the DCU and DC Elseworlds.[34]Gunn said in March that they were working on potentially incorporating characters from DC'sVertigo Comicsimprint beyond theSwamp Thingfilm,[35]and said the following month that there were plans to incorporate characters from the DC-ownedMilestone Media, such asStatic.[36]In September, WBD announced that it would expand its production facility atWarner Bros. Studios Leavesden, England, which would serve as the primary production hub for DC Studios. Gunn and Safran were consulting on the expansion, with work starting in the second quarter of 2024 and was expected to be finished in 2027.[37]
In February 2024, Gunn and Safran worked with WBD corporate siblings to acquire theChristopher ReevedocumentarySuper/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story(2024).[38][39]This is the first film to be released under the DC Studios banner,[40]whileThe Penguin(2024) is the first DC Studios production and the first series to be released under that banner.[41]AtSan Diego Comic-Conin July 2024, Gunn unveiled the official logo for DC Studios as an updated version of the 1977 "DC Bullet" logo designed byMilton Glaser, alongside an animated introduction sequence featuring Superman,[42][43][44]in a recreation of the back cover ofSuperman#1(1939) designed byWarner Bros. Animation.[45]The updated logo was also being used for DC Comics and its affiliated units,[42][43][44]but was not used for some earlier projects that DC Studios had inherited, namelyThe Penguinand the animated seriesHarley Quinn(2019–present), because they were not as involved in those. A slightly different DC Studios logo animation is used for the end credits onThe Penguin, while a separate logo and opening animation are set to be used for future projects released under the "DC Elseworlds" banner.[45]
That October, DC Studios andWarner Bros. Pictures Animationgreenlit the theatrical animated filmDynamic Duo(2028), which is DC Studios's first animated film and the first new project to move forward at the studio following its DCU announcements.[46][47][48]The filmJoker: Folie à Deux(2024) is part of the "DC Elseworlds" label and was overseen by Warner Bros. Pictures co-chiefs De Luca and Abdy, without the involvement of Gunn, Safran, or DC Studios, although the DC logo used before that studio's formation is included in the credits. At the time of the film's release later that month, Gunn said that "[a]ll future films with DC characters [would] be DC Studios" productions moving forward,[49]and he later clarified that the studio would release every subsequent film and television adaptation from DC.[45][50]Ahead of the premiere of the DCU seriesCreature Commandosin December 2024, DC Studios announced the unscripted biweekly video podcast seriesDC Studios Showcase: The Official Podcast, produced byOBB Soundfor the streaming serviceMax.[51]Later that month, they also announced the launch of its DC Studios Fan First newsletter via DC's website, to provide updates on the company's projects, with an introduction message written by Gunn.[52]In February 2025, DC Studios announced that it had greenlit three "younger-skewed" animated series—Starfire!,My Adventures with Green Lantern, andDC Super Powers—which were being co-produced with Warner Bros. Animation.[53]
All of the live-action and animated films by DC Films and DC Studios are distributed byWarner Bros. Pictures.
In addition to the following films, DC Studios has also reserved release dates for unspecified films on May 29, 2026, and March 5, 2027.[60]
All of the live-action television series by DC Studios are co-produced in association withWarner Bros. Television.

Already, we are being bombarded, and we feel directors will find Ombra a fantastic platform. Jaume loves mentoring new talent."

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
