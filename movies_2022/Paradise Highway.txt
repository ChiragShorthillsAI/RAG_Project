Anna Gutto, orAnna Guttormsgaard, is a Norwegian-born American film director, writer, and actor.[1][2][3]She wrote and directed her debut feature-length filmParadise Highway(2022), featuringJuliette BinocheandMorgan Freeman.[4]Prior to that, she had directed episodes of the Norwegian Netflix seriesHome for Christmas(Hjem til jul), as well as five short films.[5][6]Described as a "multi-hyphenate creative",[7]her career has included playwriting, as well as translation and adaptation of Norwegian texts into English.[8][7]
Guttormsgaard attended secondary school inOslo, Norway,[5]and had experience as an exchange student inIndiana.[9]She later moved to New York and completed a master of fine arts degree in film directing atColumbia University, with honors, in 2016.[10]She refined the script forParadise Highwaywhile attending graduate school at Columbia.[5]
In 2004, Guttormsgaard andSarah Cameron Sundeco-founded Oslo Elsewhere, a theatre company known for translating and producing Norwegian playwrightJon Fosse's works in the United States.[11][12][13]Guttormsgaard also performed in several plays by Fosse, including the U.S. premiere ofSA KA LA(2008) andNight Sings Its Songs(2004), both at45 Bleecker Street Theaterin New York City.[12][14]A review inThe New York Timessaid the cast inNight Sings Its Songswas "uniformly excellent", noting that "Guttormsgaard's [character] smiles when she says awful things" to her husband, played byLouis Cancelmi.[15]
Guttormsgaard translated and adaptedRosmersholmbyHenrik Ibsenwith Bridgette Wimberly and Oda Radoor, transposing the setting from Norway to America.[16]In 2006, she played the main character Rebecca West, the live-in girlfriend of minister John Rosmer (Charles Parnell), for a double-bill staging together with Fosse'sdeathvariationsat the59E59 Theaters.[8][16]The New York TimessaidRosmersholmwas the less successful of the two plays, with Guttormsgaard giving a "quietly realistic performance" but one which failed to convey the "passion and beauty" of the main character.[8]The Chronicle of Higher Educationcalled out Guttormsgaard's portrayal of West as "excellent".[16]Another review bynytheatre.comsaid Guttormsgaard and her co-writers had done a "masterful job of translating the play and adapting it to a more modern setting and sensibility", while acknowledging the challenges inherent in the original work by Ibsen.[17]Meanwhile,Ibsen News and Commentsaid, "By far the best of the lot was Anna Guttormsgaard as Rebecca, who overacted a bit but managed her second-act confrontations with Kroll and Rosmer with such power and conviction that one almost forgave her for her work as the translator and adaptor."[18]
In addition to her work with Oslo Elsewhere, Guttormsgaard was co-artistic director of The Unbound Collective.[19]Previously known as The Unbound Theater, the company presented works includingUnder Milk WoodbyDylan Thomasin 2003,[20]andThe Workroomby Jean-Paul Grumberg.[21]InThe Workroom, Guttormsgaard played Simone, a Jewish seamstress in post-war Paris whose husband has been deported.[21]
By 2009, she was known as Anna Gutto, and wrote and starred inIn Security, the company's fifth production.[22]Playing Lona Waverton, a doctor struggling with the demands of work, family and friends, she was the only live character on stage, while other characters appeared as projections on her office wall during phone conversations and while playing voicemail messages.[23]
Gutto appeared in the independent filmThe Contenders(2010), playing the "obnoxious hostess" of a weekend gathering of five friends, one of whom dies off-screen.[24]She appeared in the filmGone with the Woman(Tatt av kvinnen) (2007), directed byPetter Næss.[25]
Prior to her feature-length film debut, Gutto directed five short films.[5][6][7]Her short filmThe Light Aboveis about a young sex-trafficking victim who manages to escape.[26]She received a grant from theAlfred P. Sloan Foundationto work onA Lucky Man, which tells the story of a college football player who is raped.[27]Her other short films includedMommy Heist, which was broadcast on France Television'sFR3.[26]
Gutto co-directed the Norwegian Netflix seriesHome for Christmas(Hjem til jul) during its first season with creator Per-Olav Sørensen.[28][3][6][7]The miniseries, which first aired in 2019, is often compared to the Christmas romantic comedy filmLove Actually.[28]
Gutto first got the idea forParadise Highwayaround 2011.[5]The film is about an American truck driver who is forced into human trafficking.[5]While developing the script, she met with and researched the lives of female truckers in the United States.[5][26]
One of Gutto's early supporters was Norwegian cinematographerJohn Christian Rosenlund, who sent actressJuliette Binochethe script when she happened to be traveling on a road trip in the U.S.[5]Lionsgateagreed to worldwide distribution after the team landed Binoche in the starring role.[5]Producer Claudia Bluemenhuber secured actorMorgan Freemanto play theFBI agentwho is in pursuit, intent on ending the human-trafficking operation.[5][29]The film shoot took place in Mississippi in the summer of 2021.[5][6]
Paradise Highwayreceived mixed reviews. In a review forVariety, criticJoe Leydonpraised the film as a "solid and satisfying thriller" and "a singularly promising debut for a first-time feature filmmaker", writing, "Gutto demonstrates welcome restraint and a meticulous avoidance of anything that resembles exploitation, relying on indirect yet impactful allusions to keep us constantly aware of the mortal stakes involved."[4]Meanwhile,The New York Timesdescribed it as a film that "does not quite hit its stride".[30]In a review for RogerEbert.com, critic Robert Daniels argued that Gutto clearly wanted "the movie to serve as an indictment of a system" but that it "falters" despite the writer/director's best intentions.[31]
Gutto won the Zaki Gordon Memorial Award for Excellence in Screenwriting for her feature screenplayParadise Highway(aka Leila M.).[32]
She received the two-year Artist Working Grant from the Norwegian state (Arbeidsstipend for yngre kunstnere fra Statens kunstnerstipend).[33]She received the 2007 Cultural Award from American Scandinavian Society.[34]

Binoche first gained recognition for working with suchauteurdirectors asJean-Luc Godard(Hail Mary, 1985),Jacques Doillon(Family Life, 1985), andAndré Téchiné; the latter made her a star in France with a leading role in his dramaRendez-vous(1985). She won theVolpi CupandCésar Award for Best Actressfor her performance as a grieving music composer inKrzysztof Kieślowski'sThree Colours: Blue(1993) and theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actressfor playing a nurse inThe English Patient(1996). For starring in the romantic filmChocolat(2000), Binoche received a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Actress. In 2010, she won theCannes Film Festival Award for Best Actressfor her role as an antiques dealer inAbbas Kiarostami'sCertified Copy. Binoche has since starred in such films asClouds of Sils Maria(2014),High Life(2018) andThe Taste of Things(2023).
Binoche has appeared on stage intermittently, most notably in a 1998 London production ofLuigi Pirandello'sNakedand in a 2000 production ofHarold Pinter'sBetrayalon Broadway for which she was nominated for aTony Award. In 2008, she began a world tour with a modern dance productionin-idevised in collaboration withAkram Khan.
Binoche was born in Paris, the daughter of Jean-Marie Binoche, a director, actor, and sculptor, and Monique Yvette Stalens (born 1939), a teacher, director, and actress.[2]Her father, who is French, also has one eighth Portuguese-Brazilian ancestry; he was raised partly inMoroccoby his French-born parents.[3][4][5]Her mother was born inCzęstochowa, Poland.[6]Binoche's maternal grandfather, Andre Stalens, was born in Poland, of Belgian (Walloon) and French descent, and Binoche's maternal grandmother, Julia Helena Młynarczyk, was ofPolishorigin.[7]Both of them were actors who were born inCzęstochowa; theGermanNazi occupiers imprisoned them atAuschwitzas intellectuals.[6][8][9]
Her great-uncle wasLéon Binoche, who won a gold medal in rugby at the 1900 Paris Olympics.[10]
When Binoche's parents divorced in 1968, four-year-old Juliette and her sister Marion were sent to a provincial boarding school.[11]During their teens, the Binoche sisters spent their school holidays with their maternal grandmother, not seeing their parents for months at a time. Binoche has stated that this perceived parental abandonment had a profound effect on her.[12]
She was not particularly academic[13]and in her teenage years began acting at school in amateur stage productions. At seventeen, she directed and starred in a student production of theEugène Ionescoplay,Exit the King. She studied acting at theConservatoire National Supérieur d'Art Dramatique(CNSAD), but quit after a short time as she disliked the curriculum.[13]In the early 1980s, she found an agent through a friend and joined a theater troupe, touring France, Belgium and Switzerland under the pseudonym "Juliette Adrienne".[14]Around this time, she began lessons with acting coach Vera Gregh.[15]
Her first professional screen experience came as an extra in the three-partTF1television seriesDorothée, danseuse de corde(1983) directed byJacques Fansten, followed by a similarly small role in the provincial television filmFort bloquedirected by Pierrick Guinnard. After this, Binoche secured her first feature-film appearance with a minor role inPascal Kané'sLiberty Belle(1983). Her role required just two days on-set, but was enough to inspire Binoche to pursue a career in film.[13]
Binoche's early films established her as a French star of some renown.[11]In 1983, she auditioned for the female lead inJean-Luc Godard's controversialHail Mary, a modern retelling of the Virgin birth.[16]Godard requested a meeting with Binoche having seen a photo of her taken by her boyfriend at the time.[17]Although she said she spent six months on the film's set in Geneva, her presence in the final cut is confined to just a few scenes.[17][18]Further supporting roles followed in a variety of French films.Annick Lanoë'sLes Nanasgave Binoche her most noteworthy role to date, playing opposite established starsMarie-France PisierandMacha Mérilin a mainstream comedy,[19]though she has stated the experience was not particularly memorable or influential.[20]She gained more significant exposure inJacques Doillon's critically acclaimedFamily Lifecast as the volatile teenage step-daughter ofSami Frey's central character. This film was to set the tone of her early career.[21]Doillon has commented that in the original screenplay her character was written to be 14 years old, but he was so impressed with Binoche's audition he changed the character's age to 17 to allow her take the role.[22]In April 1985, Binoche followed this with another supporting role in Bob Decout'sAdieu Blaireau, apolicierthriller starringPhilippe LéotardandAnnie Girardot.Adieu Blaireaufailed to have much impact with critics or audiences.[23]
It was to be later in 1985 that Binoche would fully emerge as a leading actress with her role inAndré Téchiné'sRendez-vous. She was cast at short notice whenSandrine Bonnairehad to abandon the film due to a scheduling conflict.[24]Rendez-vouspremiered at the1985 Cannes Film Festival, winning Best Director. The film was a sensation and Binoche became the darling of the festival.[25]Rendez-Vousis the story of a provincial actress, Nina (Binoche), who arrives in Paris and embarks on a series of dysfunctional liaisons with several men, including the moody, suicidal Quentin (Lambert Wilson). However it is her collaboration with theater director Scrutzler, played byJean-Louis Trintignant, which comes to define Nina.[26]In a review ofRendez-VousinFilm Comment,Armond Whitedescribed it as "Juliette Binoche's career-defining performance".[27]
In 1986, Binoche was nominated for her firstCésarfor Best Actress in a Leading Role for her performance in the film.[28]FollowingRendez-Vous, she was unsure of what role to take next. She auditioned unsuccessfully forYves Boisset'sBleu comme l'enferandRobin Davis'sHors la loi,[26]but was eventually cast inMy Brother-in-Law Killed My Sister(1986) byJacques Rouffioopposite the popular French starsMichel SerraultandMichel Piccoli. This film was a critical and commercial failure.[29]Binoche has commented that Rouffio's film is very significant to her career as it taught her to judge roles based on the quality of the screenplay and her connection with a director, not on the reputation of other cast members.[30]Later in 1986, she again starred opposite Michel Piccoli inLeos Carax'sMauvais Sang. This film was a critical and commercial success, leading to Binoche's second César nomination.Mauvais Sangis an avant-garde thriller in which she plays Anna the vastly younger lover of Marc (Piccoli) who falls in love with Alex (Denis Lavant), a young thief.[31]Binoche has stated that she, "discovered the camera", while shooting this film.[32]
In August 1986, Binoche began filmingPhilip Kaufman's adaptation ofMilan Kundera's novelThe Unbearable Lightness of Being, portraying the young and innocent Tereza.[33]Released in 1988, this was Binoche's first English language role and was a worldwide success with critics and audiences alike.[34]Set against theUSSR's invasion ofPraguein 1968, the film tells the story of the relationships a Czech surgeon, Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis), has with his wife Tereza and his lover Sabina (Lena Olin). Binoche has stated that at the time her English was very limited and that she relied on a French translation to fully grasp her role.[35]After this success, Binoche decided to return to France rather than pursue an international career.[36]In 1988, she filmed the lead in Pierre Pradinas'sUn tour de manège, a little-seen French film oppositeFrançois Cluzet.[37]She has stated that her attraction to this film was that it gave her the opportunity to work with close friends and family.[13]Pradinas is the husband of her sister Marion Stalens who was set photographer on the film and appeared in acameo role.[13]In the summer of 1988, Binoche returned to the stage in an acclaimed production ofAnton Chekhov'sThe Seagulldirected by Russian directorAndrei KonchalovskyatThéâtre de l'Odéonin Paris.[38]
Later that year, she began work onLeos Carax'sLes Amants du Pont-Neuf.[39]The film was beset by problems and took three years to complete, requiring investment from three producers and funds from the French government.[22]When finally released in 1991,Les Amants du Pont-Neufwas a critical success. Binoche won aEuropean Film Award[40]as well as securing her third César nomination for her performance. In the film Binoche portrays an artist who lives rough on the famous Parisian bridge where she meets another young vagrant (Denis Lavant). This iconic part of the city becomes the backdrop for a wildly passionate love story and some of the most visually arresting images of the city ever created.[41]The paintings featured in the film were Binoche's own work.[22]She also designed the French poster for the film which features an ink drawing of the eponymous lovers locked in embrace.[22]During a break in filming in 1990, Binoche spent five days shootingMaraforMike Figgis, based onHenry Miller'sQuiet Days in Clichy. This 30-minute film was part ofHBO's anthology seriesWomen & Men 2.[42]The film became somewhat contentious when, according to Mike Figgis, HBO altered it once he had completed it.[43]The film premiered on HBO in the U.S. on 18 August 1991.[44]
At this point, Binoche seemed to be at a crossroads in her career. She was recognized as one of the most significant French actresses of her generation.[45]However, the long production ofLes Amants du Pont-Neufhad forced her to turn down several significant roles in international productions includingThe Double Life of VéroniquebyKrzysztof Kieślowski,Cyrano de BergeracbyJean-Paul Rappeneau,Night and DaybyChantal Akerman, andBeyond the Aegean, an aborted project withElia Kazan.[46]Binoche then chose to pursue an international career outside France.[22]
In the 1990s, Binoche was cast in a series of critically and commercially successful international films, winning her praise and awards.[47]In this period, her persona developed from that of a young gamine to a more melancholic, tragic presence.[48]Critics suggested that many of her roles were notable for her almost passive intensity in the face of tragedy and despair.[37]In fact, Binoche has nicknamed her characters from this period as her "sorrowful sisters".[49]Following the long shoot ofLes Amants du Pont-Neuf, Binoche relocated to London for the 1992 productions ofEmily Brontë's Wuthering HeightsandDamage, both of which considerably enhanced her international reputation.[50]Yet, from a professional and personal point of view, both films were significant challenges for Binoche; her casting oppositeRalph Fiennes's Heathcliff inWuthering Heights, instead of English actressesHelena Bonham Carter[51]andKate Beckinsale,[52]was immediately contentious and drew derision from the British press, unimpressed that a uniquely English role had gone to a French actress.[53]The film had its world premiere at the1992 Edinburgh International Film Festival. Reviews were poor, with Binoche being cynically dubbed "Cathy Clouseau" and derided for her"franglais"accent.[54]Both Binoche and directorPeter Kosminskydistanced themselves from the film, with Binoche refusing to do any promotion for the film or to redub it into French.[55]
Damage, a UK and French co-production, is the story of a British Conservative minister played byJeremy Ironswho embarks on a torrid affair with his son's fiancée (Binoche). Based on the novel byJosephine Hartand directed by veteran French directorLouis Malle,Damageseemed to be the ideal international vehicle for Binoche; however the production was fraught with difficulties and dogged by rumours of serious conflict. In an on-set interview, Malle stated that it was the "most difficult" film he had ever made, while Binoche commented that "the first day was one big argument".[56]Damageopened in the UK late in 1992 and debuted early in 1993 on US screens. Reviews were somewhat mixed.[57]For her performance, Binoche received her fourth César nomination.
In 1993, she appeared inKrzysztof Kieślowski'sThree Colours: Blueto much critical acclaim.[58]The first film in a trilogy inspired by the ideals of the French republic and the colors of its flag,Three Colors: Blueis the story of a young woman who loses her composer husband and daughter in a car accident. Though devastated she learns to cope by rejecting her previous life in favor of conscious "nothing"; rejecting all people, belongings and emotions.[59]Three Colours: Bluepremiered at the 1993Venice Film Festival, landing Binoche the Best Actress Prize. She also won aCésar, and a nomination for theGolden Globe. Binoche has said her inspirations for the role were her friend and coach Vernice Klier who suffered a similar tragedy, and the bookThe Black VeilbyAnny Dupereywhich deals with the author's grief at losing her parents at a young age.[60]Binoche made cameo appearances in the other two films in Kieślowski's trilogy,Three Colours: WhiteandThree Colours: Red. Around this time, Steven Spielberg offered her roles inJurassic ParkandSchindler's List. She turned down both parts.[61]After the success ofThree Colors: Blue, Binoche took a shortsabbaticalduring which she gave birth to her son Raphaël in September 1993.[62]
In 1995, Binoche returned to the screen in a big-budget adaptation ofJean Giono'sThe Horseman on the Roofdirected byJean-Paul Rappeneau. The film was particularly significant in France as it was at the time the most expensive film in the history of French cinema.[63]The film was a box office success around the world and Binoche was again nominated for a César for Best Actress. This role, as a romantic heroine, was to influence the direction of many of her subsequent roles in the late 1990s.[64]In 1996, Binoche appeared in her first comedic role sinceMy Brother-in-Law Killed My Sistera decade before;A Couch in New Yorkwas directed byChantal Akermanand co-starredWilliam Hurt. This screw-ball comedy tells the story of a New York psychiatrist who swaps homes with a Parisian dancer.[65]The film was a critical and commercial failure.[66]Three Colors: Blue,The Horseman on the RoofandA Couch in New Yorkall gave Binoche the opportunity to work with prestigious directors she had turned down during the prolonged shoot ofLes Amants du Pont-Neuf.[22]
Her next role inThe English Patientreinforced her position as an international movie star. The film, based on the novel byMichael Ondaatjeand directed byAnthony Minghella, was a worldwide hit.[67]Produced bySaul Zaentz, producer ofThe Unbearable Lightness of Being, the film reunited Juliette Binoche with Ralph Fiennes, Heathcliff to her Cathy four years previously. Binoche has said that the shoot on location in Tuscany and at the famedCinecittàin Rome was among the happiest professional experiences of her career.[11]The film, which tells the story of a badly burned, mysterious man found in the wreckage of a plane during World War II, won nineAcademy Awards, including Best Supporting Actress for Juliette Binoche.[68]With this film, she became the second French actress to win an Oscar, followingSimone Signoret's win forRoom at the Topin 1960. After this international hit, Binoche returned to France and began work oppositeDaniel AuteuilonClaude Berri'sLucie Aubrac, the true story of a French Resistance heroine. Binoche was released from the film six weeks into the shoot due to differences with Berri regarding the authenticity of his script.[69]Binoche has described this event as being like "an earthquake" to her.[11]
Next, Binoche was reunited with director André Téchiné forAlice et Martin(1998), the story of a relationship between an emotionally damaged Parisian musician and her younger lover who hides a dark family secret. The film failed to find an audience in France, although it was critically acclaimed in the UK.[70]In February 1998, Binoche made her London stage debut in a new version ofLuigi Pirandello'sClothe the Nakedre-titledNakedand adapted byNicolas Wright. The production, directed byJonathan Kent, was very favorably received.[71]Following this acclaimed performance, she returned to French screens withChildren of the Century(1999), a big budget romantic epic, in which she played 19th-century French proto-feminist authorGeorge Sand. The film depicted Sand's affair with the poet and dandyAlfred de Mussetplayed byBenoît Magimel. The following year saw Binoche in four contrasting roles, each of which enhanced her reputation.La Veuve de Saint-Pierre(2000) byPatrice Leconte, for which she was nominated for a César for Best Actress, was a period drama which saw Binoche appear oppositeDaniel Auteuilin the role of a woman who attempts to save a condemned man from the guillotine.[72]The film won favorable reviews, particularly in the U.S.[73]where it was nominated for aGolden Globefor Best Foreign Language Film.[74]
Next, she appeared inMichael Haneke'sCode Unknown, a film which was made following Binoche's approach to the Austrian director.[75]The film premiered in competition at the2000 Cannes Film Festival.[76]This critically acclaimed role was a welcome change from playing the romantic heroine in a series of costume dramas.[77]Later that year, Binoche made her Broadway debut in an adaptation ofHarold Pinter'sBetrayalfor which she was nominated for aTony Award. Staged by theRoundabout Theatre Companyand directed byDavid Leveaux, the production also featuredLiev SchreiberandJohn Slattery.[78]Back on screen, Binoche was the heroine of theLasse HallströmfilmChocolatfrom the best selling novel byJoanne Harris. For her role Binoche won aEuropean Film Audience Awardfor Best Actress and was nominated for an Academy Award and aBAFTA.[79]Chocolatis the story of a mysterious stranger who opens achocolateriein a conservative French village in 1959. The film was a worldwide hit.[80]
Between 1995 and 2000, Binoche was the advertising face of theLancômeperfumePoème, her image adorning print campaigns photographed byRichard Avedon[81]and a television advertising campaign,[82]including an advert directed byAnthony Minghellaand scored byGabriel Yared.[83]By the end of this period and following roles in a number of prestige productions, critics were wondering if Binoche wastypecastas the tragic, despairing muse. In a feature article entitled "The Erotic Face" in the June 2000 edition of British film criticism magazineSight and Sound, Ginette Vincendeau pondered Binoche's persona; Vincendeau suggested that the fixation of numerous directors upon her face had led to an erasure of her body, and to her being perceived only as a romantic icon rather than a versatile actress.[37]
After the success ofChocolat, Binoche was internationally recognized as an A-list movie star in the early 2000s, but as an actor her persona became somewhat fixed following a series ofperiod rolesportraying a stoic heroine facing tragedy and desolation.[37]Keen to try something new, Binoche returned to French cinema in 2002 in an unlikely role: she played a ditsy beautician inJet LagoppositeJean Reno.[84]The film, directed byDaniele Thompson, was a box office hit in France and Binoche was once again nominated for a César for Best Actress.[85]The film tells the story of a couple who meet at an airport during a strike. Initially the pair despises each other, but, over the course of one night, they find common ground and maybe even love. This playful spirit continued when Binoche featured in a 2003 Italian television commercial for the chocolatesFerrero Rocher. The advertisement played upon herChocolatpersona featuring Binoche handing out the chocolates to people on the streets of Paris.[86]
In a more serious vein, Binoche traveled to South Africa to makeJohn Boorman'sIn My Country(2004) oppositeSamuel L. Jackson. Based on the bookCountry of My SkullbyAntjie Krog, the film examinesThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) hearingsfollowing the abolition of Apartheid in the mid-1990s.[87]Although the film premiered at the2004 Berlin International Film Festival, it received much criticism for the inclusion of a fictional romantic liaison and for its depiction of black South Africans.[88]Despite the negative reception, Binoche was extremely enthusiastic about the film and her connection with Boorman.[89][90]Her sister, Marion Stalens, also traveled to South Africa to shoot a documentary,La réconciliation?, which explores the TRC process and follows Binoche's progress as she acts in Boorman's film.[23]Next, Binoche re-teamed with Michael Haneke forCaché. The film was an immediate success, winning best director for Haneke at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival,[91]while Binoche was nominated for a European Film Award for Best Actress for her role.[92]The film tells the story of a bourgeois Parisian couple, played by Binoche andDaniel Auteuil, who begin to receive anonymous videotapes containing footage shot over long periods, surveying the outside of their home.Cachéwent on to feature in the number one position on the "Top 10 of the 2000s" list published by The Times at the end of the decade.[93]
Binoche's next film,Bee Season, based on the celebrated novel byMyla Goldberg, cast her oppositeRichard Gere. The film was not a success at the box office taking less than $5 million worldwide.[94]For many critics the film, although intelligent, was "distant and diffuse".[95]Bee Seasondepicts the emotional disintegration of a family just as their daughter begins to win national spelling bees.Mary(2005) featured Binoche in a somewhat unlikely collaboration with the controversial American directorAbel Ferrarafor an investigation of modern faith andMary Magdalene's position within the Catholic Church.[96]FeaturingForest Whitaker,Matthew ModineandMarion Cotillard,Marywas a success, winning the Grand Prix at the 2005 Venice Film Festival. Despite these accolades and favorable reviews, particularly from the cultural magazineLes Inrockuptibles,[97]Maryfailed to secure a distributor in key markets such as the US and the UK.[98]
The Cannes Film Festival in 2006 saw Binoche feature in theanthology filmParis, je t'aimeappearing in a section directed by the Japanese directorNobuhiro Suwa.

The segment also featuresWillem DafoeandHippolyte Girardot.Paris, je t'aimewas a popular success, taking over $17 million, at the world box-office.[99]In September 2006, Binoche appeared at theVenice Film Festivalto launchA Few Days in September, written and directed bySantiago Amigorena. Despite an impressive cast includingJohn Turturro,Nick Nolteand up-and-coming French starSara Forestier, the film was a failure.A Few Days in Septemberis a thriller set between 5 and 11 September 2001, in which Binoche plays a French secret service agent, who may, or may not, have information relating to impending attacks on the U.S.[100]The film was the recipient of harsh criticism from the press for its perceived trivialisation of the events of 11 September 2001.[101]While promoting the film in the UK, Binoche told an interviewer she believed the CIA and other government agencies must have had foreknowledge of the11 September attacks, as depicted in the film.[102]
Next, Binoche traveled to the2006 Toronto International Film Festivalfor the premiere ofBreaking and Entering, her second film with Anthony Minghella in the director's chair, based on his first original screenplay since his breakthrough filmTruly, Madly, Deeply(1991).

Although Binoche began the decade on a professional high with an Academy Award nomination forChocolat, she struggled at the beginning of the 2000s to secure roles that did not confine her to the tragic, melancholic persona developed in the 1990s.[107]Despite the huge success ofCaché, other high-profile films such asIn My Country,Bee SeasonandBreaking and Enteringfailed critically[108]and commercially.[109]Binoche again seemed to be at a crossroads in her career.[107]
2007 was the start of a particularly busy period for Binoche, one that would see her take on diverse roles in a series of critically acclaimed international movies giving her film career a new impetus, as she shed the restrictions that seemed to have stifled her career in the early part of the decade.[107]The Cannes Film Festival saw the premiere ofFlight of the Red Balloon(2007) by the Taiwanese directorHou Hsiao-hsien. It was originally conceived as a short film to form part of a 20th anniversary tribute to theMusée d'Orsay, to be produced bySerge Lemoine, president of the museum. When that idea failed to find sufficient funding, Hou developed it into a feature-length film and secured the necessary financing.[110]The film was well received by international critics and went on to debut around the world early in 2008. Paying homage toAlbert Lamorisse's 1957 shortThe Red Balloon, Hou's film tells the story of a woman's efforts to juggle her responsibilities as a single mother with her commitment to her career as a voice artist. Shot on location in Paris, the film was entirely improvised by the cast.[111]The film was number one on the influential critic J. Hoberman's "Top 10 List" for 2008 published inThe Village Voice.[112]

"I would really like to know why she has been so esteemed for so many years. She has nothing – absolutely nothing".[131]In response, while promotingCertified Copy, Binoche spoke to movie magazineEmpiresaying, "I don't know him. I understand you don't have to like everyone and you can dislike someone's work. But I don't understand the violence [of his statements]... I do not understand why he is behaving like this. It is his problem."[132]Certified Copyproved to be controversial in Kiarostami's homeland when Iranian authorities announced on 27 May 2010 that the film was to be banned in Iran, apparently due to Binoche's attire; Deputy Culture Minister Javad Shamaqdari is quoted as saying, "If Juliette Binoche were better clad it could have been screened but due to her attire there will not be a general screening."[133]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
