A sequel is in development.
For centuries,sea beastshave surfaced to wreak havoc against humankind. In response, crews of "hunters" venture outward on their ships to hunt the beasts. The most famous and successful being the crew of theInevitable, led by the legendary Captain Crow, his first mate Sarah Sharpe, and his adopted son andboatswainJacob Holland. The hunters are supported by the King and Queen of the Crown by means of the Three Bridges Society as a result of the hunters' success over the centuries. After nearly being killed during a hunt, Crow tells Jacob he will make him captain once they kill the "Red Bluster", who took his right eye years earlier.
The crew returns to Three Bridges to collect payment for their latest catch, but the King and Queen inform them that they will soon be replaced by the modernnaval vesselImperator, headed by Admiral Eric Hornagold, due to the Crown considering the hunters obsolete and not agreeing with the hunters' code of conduct, especially when Crow's crew was forced to abandon their hunt of the Red Bluster in order to save another hunter ship. This angers Crow and Sarah and nearly results in their arrest before Jacob placates them with a proposal that his crew be given one more chance to kill the Red Bluster as a test of worth. Admiral Hornagold accepts, and the Crown declares a contest between the crews of theImperatorandInevitablewith the winner being allowed to hunt the sea beasts in their name.
After they depart, the crew discovers an orphan girl named Maisie Brumble hasstowed awayon the ship to join them, having been inspired to do so by her late parents, who were themselves hunters. TheInevitablerelocates and attacks the Red Bluster, however, the ship is in danger of being pulled under, and, against Crow's orders, Jacob hesitantly allows Maisie to cut the Bluster free, which saves the crew, but lets the monster escape and throws Jacob and Maisie into the sea. Angered, Crow holds both of them at gunpoint and demands Jacob bring Maisie to him before the Bluster emerges from the depths and swallows Maisie and Jacob whole.
Jacob and Maisie are taken to an isolated island populated by several other sea beasts. Maisie discovers that the Bluster is not malicious and befriends the beast, renaming her Red, while also befriending a smaller beast named Blue. Maisie begins to believe the monsters are really just misunderstood creatures, which Jacob initially denies. Jacob and Maisie convince Red to take them to Rum Pepper Island, so they can secure a ship to return to Three Bridges.
Believing Jacob to be dead, a grieving Crow seeks out the renowned hunter and merchant Gwen Batterbie who gives Crow a poison-tipped harpoon powerful enough to kill Red. While travelling on Red's back, Jacob and Maisie bond with the creature and each other, with Jacob growing to support Maisie's belief that the beasts are innocent. They reach Rum Pepper Island, but discover theImperatorand Hornagold are stationed there. Red attacks the vessel after being shot at and inadvertently wounds Maisie in the scuffle.
After she destroys theImperator, Jacob stops Red's rampage and prevents her from killing Hornagold. Red re-engages after she spots theInevitableand nearly dies after being struck with the poison-tipped harpoon, with Crow keeping her alive long enough to bring her to the Crown as a trophy. Maisie is nursed back to health, but then imprisoned aboard theInevitableas it arrives at Three Bridges with Red in tow. After Blue frees Maisie, she discovers the dangers of the sea beasts to be propaganda created by the Crown to extend their corrupt rule.
Crow prepares topublicly executeRed before being stopped by Jacob. Crow and Jacob fight, while Maisie and Sarah, who begins to believe Maisie's worldview of the beasts, free Red from her binds. Maisie and Jacob convince Red to spare Crow, subsequently exposing the Crown for their deceptions. After witnessing the passive nature of the beasts, Crow and the people of the kingdom renounce their beliefs. With Red and the other sea beasts left alone, Maisie, Jacob, and Blue begin their new lives together as a family.
On November 5, 2018,Netflixannounced thatChris Williamswould write and direct a brand new animated filmJacob and the Sea Beast,[1]based on his own original story. On November 7, 2020, the film was retitled toThe Sea Beast.[4]
Animation services were provided bySony Pictures ImageworksinVancouverwho have provided new technology build upon the film.[5]For the look and feel of the film, they were drawn close to the artwork ofN. C. Wyethfor the wide open oceans andCaspar David Friedrichfor low contrast on the cinematic looks of the film. To match the wrinkles around Captain Crow, the inkline tool used forSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Versewas reworked into crease-lines to give custom wrinkles to curve depth in a more sculptural way around Crow's face. For the camera shots on the ship, a new camera tool was developed to counterbalance the camera to scenes set on the ship or the boat for a more live-action approach from the classic sea-monster films along with a new pivoting tool called Sea Legs, which was engineered for characters balancing on moving surfaces. Another new tool that was used for the webs inSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Versewas a new animation rig used on the ropes from the ship with more flexibility and control over how much rope was used in the film.[6]
Mark Mancinacomposed the film's score, having previously worked with Williams onMoana(2016).[7][8]Mancina also produced an original song called "Captain Crow" a sea shanty depicting the character written by Nell Benjamin and Laurence O'Keefe.
In March 2022, Netflix announced its premiere date for July 8, 2022.[9]The film was released in select theaters on June 24, 2022, before its Netflix debut.[10][11]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
