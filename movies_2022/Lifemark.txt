It tells the story of how a young man's mother considered aborting him, but instead made an adoption plan for him, and later reconnected with him as a young adult.
Kirk Cameron,Alex Kendrick, and Raphael Ruggero star, while theKendrick Brothersco-wrote the script with Peeples and act as executive producers. It is the Kendrick brothers' eighth film, the fifth through their subsidiary, Kendrick Brothers Productions, their first adaptation of a true story and their first film sinceFlywheelnot to be distributed bySony Pictures Releasing. Their initial five films were created underSherwood Pictures. The film was released on September 9, 2022, viaFathom Eventsafter traditional distributors declined to release it. It received generally positive reviews, and its initial one-week theatrical run was extended an extra week due to its box-office success.
As a pregnant teenager, Melissa is preparing for an abortion to end her unwanted pregnancy, when at the very last minute she told the doctor, "I can't do this."[2]Instead, she chooses to deliver her son and place him foradoption, where he is adopted by the Colton family of Louisiana. Eighteen years later, Melissa reaches out to David through the adoption agency, leading to their connection on social media and ultimately meeting face-to-face.
Lifemarkis the culmination of David Scotton's story, which he began telling in a 2011 "Louisiana Pro-Life Oratory Contest atJesuit High Schoolin New Orleans."[5]The story was picked up by Louisiana Right to Life, who funded the documentary filmI Lived on Parker Avenue[6]for $67,000.[5]After the film's release, Scotton spent his time "visiting Catholic high schools across the country, appearing on national television, showing the film to members of Congress and telling just about all who would listen about the adoption alternative."[5]While the Kendrick Brothers intended to tell a pro-life story, they started adapting the story in 2019; executive producer Stephen Kendrick attributed the post-Dobbsrelease of the project to providential timing.[7]Both Stephen Kendrick[8]and Cameron have adopted children, and Cameron's wife was herself adopted,[9]which both cite as a motivation for their involvement with this film. Cameron publicly promoted the film and explained his motivation in a speech at the 2022March for Life.[10]Bloomberg noted that Cameron "acknowledged adoption doesn’t always work as well as portrayed" in the film.[11]
Kirk Cameron approached the Kendricks, with whom he had previously worked onFireproof, to produce the movie after seeing David's story depicted inI Lived on Parker Avenue.[9]For the time jump, the filmmakers chose to use two sets of actors to play David's birth parents, while de-aging techniques to depict David's adoptive parents.[12]"Kirk Cameron looks like a 50-year-old and a (roughly) 30-year-old – all in the same film,"Crosswalk.comobserved.[13]Coles was involved in the creative process, being invited by the producers to help evaluate actresses who would play her,[14]and Long subsequently spent time with Coles preparing for the role.[4]A novelization by Chris Fabry (ISBN978-1496461278) was released byTyndale Houseapproximately one month before the film's release.[15]
Alex Kendrick said that they could not secure distribution because the film concerned abortion,[11]which Cameron attributed to studios' cowardice.[16]In an interview withBaptist Press, executive producer Stephen Kendrick noted that "Lifemark doesn’t focus in on the dark side of abortion, it focuses in on the positive beautiful side of adoption."[8]Anti-abortion organizations such asLive Actionhave used the film as a jumping off point to criticize abortion.[17]

Movie critic Phil Boatwright, aBaptist Presscolumnist, said of the Kendricks: "One gets the impression this is their ministry, while at the same time understanding the No. 1 rule of cinematic storytelling -- story must come first."[25]Movie reviewer Michael Foust said in aBaptist Pressfeature on the Kendricks: "They've been the Lewis and Clark of the genre. No, they weren't the first to make faith movies, but they did it better than anyone who came before -- and Hollywood noticed. They were trailblazers who made first-class movies on shoestring budgets." Foust added, "Even more impressive, the Kendricks have continued to improve on their craft.War Roomwas better thanCourageous, which was better thanFireproof,which was better thanFacing the Giants, which was better thanFlywheel. Remember:War Roomwas the No. 1 movie at the box office in its second weekend in 2015. That's an accomplishment that many well-known Hollywood directors haven't achieved. The Kendricks also have been models of humility, giving all credit to God while working to help raise up the next generation of filmmakers."[25]
