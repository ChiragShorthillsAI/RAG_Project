McIntyre. It starsPierce BrosnanasKing Louis XIV,Kaya Scodelarioas Marie-Josèphe, andBenjamin Walkeras Yves De La Croix. It wasWilliam Hurt's final screen performance to be released before his death in March 2022, though it had been filmed eight years prior.
Principal photographybegan in early April 2014 inVersailles, France. After the two-week shoot in France, production then began on April 23 inMelbourne, Australia. Shooting wrapped up at the end of May.
Originally intended to be released in April 2015, the film was delayed just three weeks prior  in order to complete post-production effects. It then sat indevelopment hellfor over five years, until the distribution rights were acquired byGravitas Ventures, which released it theatrically on January 21, 2022, to negative reviews.
Marie-Josèphe, born and raised in a convent in France, is a rebellious free spirit who often causes trouble for the Abbess. Marie-Josèphe's father, King Louis XIV, fears for his own mortality after being wounded by an assassin's bullet, but is told by Dr. Labarthe about a magical underwater creature that can grant him immortality; the procedure involves cutting out the creature's heart during an eclipse. Louis sends a group of fishermen, led by Captain Yves De La Croix, to capture the creature, a mermaid. Her mate is also caught, but Yves releases him before heading back to France.
Per the king's request, father La Chaise travels to the convent to bring Marie-Josèphe back, giving her the impression that she is traveling to play music in Versailles. Upon arriving in Versailles, Marie-Josèphe befriends a servant named Magali, but no one else knows she is the king's daughter. The following morning, Louis meets with Jean-Michel Lintillac, son of a wealthy baron who is gravely ill and ready to pass on, making Lintillac inherit a fortune and prestige. While out for a stroll with Magali, Marie-Josèphe meets Yves, and the two fall in love. She also encounters Lintillac and her father for the first time, though he still doesn't tell her about his relation to her.
The mermaid is brought into a chamber beneath the castle. Later, as Marie-Josèphe tries to practice in her room, she follows a strange noise to the mermaid's prison, where she encounters both the creature and Yves. At a grand ball the next day, Marie-Josèphe shares a dance with Louis, and later finds him outside painting a picture of a woman called Louise, telling Marie-Josèphe that she reminds him of her.
Louis appoints Lintillac with the title of Duke, and later holds a dinner in his honor. Marie-Josèphe visits the mermaid again and joins her underwater. Yves later takes Marie-Josèphe for a horse ride, but she falls and severely breaks her arm; Labarthe states that the arm will need to be amputated. Yves brings Marie-Josèphe and Magali to the mermaid, who completely heals Marie-Josèphe's arm. Marie-Josèphe assumes that Louis has brought the mermaid to France to heal the citizens, but she is told that the mermaid is for the king's purpose only.
Louis arranges for Lintillac to marry Marie-Josèphe so that they can share in Lintillac's fortune. He comes clean to Marie-Josèphe about being her father and that he wants her to marry Lintillac. She refuses and runs away crying, leaving Louis feeling remorseful.
La Chaise visits the mermaid and, realizing she is a sentient being, he confronts Labarthe and Louis. He pleads with Louis not to kill the mermaid as doing so would condemn his soul as the mermaid is clearly one of God's creations due to being a sentient being. However, both refuse to change their minds. Marie-Josèphe visits the mermaid, who shows her a telepathic vision of her capture. Meanwhile, Yves slips a picture of the procedure under Marie-Josèphe's door, alerting her to the king's true plans. She confronts Louis, telling him that she will marry Lintillac if he lets the mermaid go, but he refuses. As everyone prepares for the wedding, La Chaise and Marie-Josèphe go to the chamber where Yves is trying to get the mermaid out. They are found by Labarthe, but they fight him off to give the mermaid time to escape. Labarthe shoots Yves, who falls into the water and is taken along by the fleeing mermaid. Marie-Josèphe gets Labarthe caught in a water wheel that pulls him underwater, drowning him.
Marie-Josèphe makes it to a cliff where she has promised to rendezvous with Yves and his crew, and finds Yves healed by the mermaid. Louis and his men arrive and prepare to kill the mermaid as the eclipse approaches, but giving him the choice to save either his own life or hers, Marie-Josèphe jumps off the cliff and hits the water hard. Louis has no choice but to tell his men to stand down so that the mermaid can revive Marie-Josèphe. Louis watches Marie-Josèphe and Yves leave, and the mermaid swims home. La Chaise tells Louis he is now a great king and a great man.
In the epilogue, Marie-Josèphe and Yves sail to find the city ofAtlantisso that Marie-Josèphe may reunite with the mermaid, and she takes her underwater to see the city up close.

In the seriesThe Empress of China, Fan portrays the titular characterWu Zetian, the only female emperor in Chinese history.[53]The 82-episode TV series was broadcast onHunan Televisionfrom 21 December 2014 to 5 February 2015, and recorded the highest ratings for the year.[56]The same year, she starred inwuxiafantasy filmThe White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom.[57]In 2015, Fan joined theChina Central Television(CCTV) variety show as a judge inAmazing Chineseand as a contestant in thereality televisionshowChallenger's Alliance.[58]Fan won the Best Actress award at the 1st Berlin Chinese Film Festival for her role in the film.[59]She was ranked fourth onForbesWorld's Highest-Paid Actresses list for 2015.[60]
In 2016, Fan, along with her then partnerLi Chen, was invited as the final guest on the popular Taiwanese talk showKangxi Comingbefore its closure. She was featured in the action comedySkiptracealongsideJackie ChanandJohnny Knoxville, which won her Best Supporting Actress at the 1st Golden Screen Awards.[61][62]Fan then starred inGuo Jingming'sL.O.R.D: Legend of Ravaging Dynasties. The all-star film, which was released on 30 September, is China's first computer-animated motion film, but performed poorly at the box office.[63]Fan won theSilver Shell for Best Actressat the 64thSan Sebastián International Film Festivaland theGolden Rooster Award for Best Actressfor her performance inI Am Not Madame Bovary, directed byFeng Xiaogang.[64]

Since 2018, Fan's career has been derailed by a tax evasion scandal. On May 10, 2018,Feng Xiaogangposted on Weibo a concept poster forCell Phone 2, a sequel to Fan's breakout filmCell Phone(2003). On May 27, former CCTV hostCui Yongyuan, who had a feud with the original film due to its alleged insinuations about his real life, posted on Weibo photos of a contract showing that Fan was paid CN¥10 million. On May 28, Cui further alleged that another actor had signed two contracts for a four-day film shoot—one for CN¥10 million and the other for CN¥50 million—pocketing a total of CN¥60 million. Due to the smaller contract's amount matching Fan's revealed contract from the previous day, many incorrectly believed Cui referred to the same person with two days' revelations and was thus accusing Fan of tax evading through the dual contracts. On May 29, Fan's studio denied the accusation of tax evasion.[70][71]On June 3, China's tax authorities announced that they would investigate Fan's suspected case of tax evasion in light of Cui's posts.[72][73]Cui offered his help to the investigation, but clarified that the CN¥60 million contract did not involve Fan. He also apologized to Fan for subjecting her to the investigation, stating that his targets were Feng Xiaogang andLiu Zhenyun, the director and the writer ofCell Phone.[74]
Questions, concerns, and rumors about Fan's whereabouts grew when she was not seen after a last public appearance on 1 July 2018, and a lack of activity on social media after 23 July.[5][75]According to a later deleted Weibo post by Qiu Ziming, a former journalist forThe Economic Observer, Fan was arrested while consulting a fortune-teller named Shen Aixu, who is known by the epithet “Little Immortal,” atDeji Plazain Nanjing. The session, reportedly arranged by Wu Tiejun, the plaza’s owner, with Fan paying Shen CN¥2 million, was raided by the police, who detained Fan, Shen, and Wu on the spot. To maintain secrecy, they covered Fan’s head, escorted her from the elevator to the parking garage, and transported her to Beijing by police car. When Fan requested to use the restroom during the transfer, officers cleared the area to prevent exposure.[76]In 2021, theWeChatofficial account “Defenders,” a society of defense lawyers, disclosed that Shen, the “Little Immortal” arrested alongside Fan, had been sentenced to 12 years in prison.[77]
In the first week of July 2018, Fan canceled a meeting with a production company, informing them that she had been placed under house arrest.[78]In August, Fan's manager Jersey Chong refuted that Fan had been arrested.[79]On October 3,Xinhua News Agencyannounced that Fan was ordered to pay about CN¥883 million in taxes and penalties for her tax evasion, while her long-time manager, Mu Xiaoguang (original name Mou Enguang), had been "subjected to compulsory measures by public security authorities" for destroying accounting records and obstructing the investigation. On the same day, Fan broke her months-long silence with an apology statement on social media.[80][75]Meanwhile, Taiwan’sMainland Affairs Councilprotested that the Chinese government had not informed the Taiwanese government of the arrest of Mu, a Taiwanese citizen, as required under the Cross-Strait Joint Crime-Fighting and Judicial Mutual Assistance Agreement.[81]Mu remained out of public view until March 2023, when he attended the funeral of his uncle, veteran actor Yun-Peng Shang, in Taipei.[82]Although rumors have suggested that Mu served four years in prison to protect Fan by taking the blame, Chinese authorities have never disclosed whether he was sentenced following his arrest.
Fan's case triggered a tax audit crackdown and reforms in China's entertainment industry. In December 2018, a group of cultural and film industry representatives anonymously issued an open letter to PremierLi Keqiang, questioning the retroactive and punitive taxation methods of theState Taxation Administration.[83]According to Xinhua News Agency, from October 2018 to the end of the year, taxpayers in the entertainment industry "conducted self-inspections," and CN¥11.747 billion in taxes were declared.[84]
Since the tax scandal, Fan has been effectively blacklisted in mainland China, where her films and television works are prohibited from being released, such as the crime filmThe Perfect Blue,directed byCao Baoping, and the historical dramaThe Legend of Ba Qing(akaWin the World).[85]Fan made attempts at a comeback in China with varying degrees of success, with her publicity usually censored orshadowbannedon the Chinese internet. On April 22, 2019, she attended theiQIYINinth Anniversary Gala in Beijing,[86]with photos posted on herInstagramthe next day. This was her first public event after the tax scandal; however, by the time she arrived, the media session had already ended. Her closed-door session included only industry VIPs, with no journalists present. Fan was in attendance at the Shanghai Beauty Summit on 12 July[87]and the 12th China Cosmetic Summit on 22 July.[88]On 27 September, Fan posted on Weibo photos of her attending a promotional event forHongqi E-HS9. However, she was conspicuously missing from the list of celebrity guests in the car company's publicity. She later deleted the post about Hongqi. On November 17, Fan presented an award at the "2020EllemenFilm Hero Awards Ceremony" for the animated filmLegend of Deification.
In the two years following her tax scandal until the end of 2020, Fan filed over 200 infringement lawsuits in China, the majority of which she won. Some defendants, after losing their cases, appealed for a second trial, claiming that as a scandal-hit public figure, her image no longer held commercial value. However, these appeals were also unsuccessful.[89]
In April 2021, following Chinese actressZheng Shuang’s tax scandal, a Weibo user posted in defense of Fan: “I hope the authorities will release the full list of those who contributed to the 11.7 billion yuan in back taxes after Fan Bingbing’s case. Don’t single someone out and crush them completely—publish the entire list and rectify the issue systemically. Stop using the salary cap policy as a smokescreen to fool the audience. I believe exorbitant pay is a systemic issue, and solving it would be truly commendable.” Fan liked the post in Weibo but later unliked it and posted: “This world has never been fair. When you feel something is unfair, you need to accept it as normal. When you feel something is fair, you should consider yourself lucky.”[90]
Unlike many other convicted celebrities in China, after the tax scandal, Fan was allowed to maintain a social media presence, which she parlayed into a successful career running her personal brand, Fan Beauty. Founded not long before her tax scandal, Fan Beauty'sGMVsurpassed 300 million RMB in 2021, 850 million RMB in 2022, and 1.1 billion RMB in 2023.[91][92]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
