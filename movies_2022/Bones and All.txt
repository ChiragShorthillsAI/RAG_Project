In 1988, teenager Maren Yearly partially eats her friend's ring finger at a sleepover. Her beleaguered single father Frank, used to hercannibalisticnature since she murdered her babysitter at three years old, promptly relocates them and abandons her shortly after her 18th birthday, leaving behind a message where he hopes for her to overcome her hunger. Deciding she wants to find her long-absent mother Janelle, Maren sets out forMinnesota.
She runs into the eccentric Sully, who explains he is a fellow "eater", their people can identify each other by scent, and that it is part of their code to never eat each other. He leads her to the house of a dying, elderly woman and begins to feed, though a horrified Maren refuses to eat. The woman dies the next day and Maren reluctantly joins him in eating the corpse, after which he shows her a rope made from the hair of his victims. Unsettled by his growing obsession with her, she flees and continues her travels.
While shoplifting inIndiana, both she and a young man named Lee try to stop a drunk customer from harassing a woman. She later finds Lee having eaten the man, and they steal the man's truck. Lee joins her on her trip and they begin a relationship. They stop in his hometown inKentucky, where he refuses to discuss his past and they meet his sister Kayla. They meet a pair of eaters, where one discusses how he ate a victim "bones and all" by eating them in their entirety, and the other admits he is an eater by choice rather than out of necessity, disgusting Lee and Maren. Lee seduces and kills an amusement park employee because he believes he has no family, but Maren is horrified to discover that he does.
Maren tracks down Janelle's mother as they arrive in Minnesota, who informs her that Janelle was adopted after being found abandoned and had willingly committed herself to a psychiatric hospital. Maren visits her to find that she has eaten her own hands. A nurse gives Maren a letter from Janelle, who proclaims they are better off dead than living as monsters. Janelle tries to eat Maren before being restrained. A traumatized Maren abandons Lee and is found by Sully, who she again rejects, causing him to grow violent.
Lee returns home and Maren eventually follows him there, where Kayla explains to her that Lee killed their abusive father. She and Lee rekindle their relationship, and he admits that he ate his father after he tried to eat him first, disgusted by the fact that he enjoyed doing so. They agree to live normal lives and move toMichigan. After some time, Maren comes home to find Sully in their apartment, who holds her at knifepoint. Lee returns and they kill Sully, but Lee is mortally stabbed in the process as Maren finds Kayla's hair in the hair rope. Lee pleads for Maren to eat him "bones and all", which she reluctantly does.
One of the film's producers,Theresa Park, was on a trip to theLondon Book Fairin 2015, when she discoveredCamille DeAngelis'sBones & All, and described it as one of the "most heartbreaking" novels she had read.[5]She "optioned" the screen rights in 2016.[6]Park only sent the book to onescreenwriter,David Kajganich, as she thought he would like it based on his work onAMC'sThe Terror.[7][5][8]The screenwriter found the story to be a "surprising blend of genres" and described it as "exciting".[7]He and Park met with DeAngelis to know if she approved of him adapting it, as the story centered on a young woman, which she did.[7]
Kajganich's first choice for director wasLuca Guadagnino, as he trusted him due to their previous collaborations.[9][10]Guadagnino was busy with other projects at the time, and declined.[9]Kajganich decided to contact directorAntonio Campos, with whom he had also worked in the past, and he boarded the project in 2019.[11][12]The script was developed by Park and Kajganich over a period of five years.[5]Neither of them was fond of the idea of having a film studio meddling with the project, so they started it indepndently.[9][7]The first draft took around two and a half years, due to Kajganich's other commitments, nevertherless he appreciated the long process, as it allowed him to make decisions, that would have not been possible if the film had studio backing.[9]The screenplay was finished over theCOVID-19 lockdownbut Campos had to drop out to work on another project, at that point Kajganich reached to Guadagnino again, who only read the script as a favor due to their friendship.[9]Guadagnino joined the project a couple of weeks later, with the condition that actorTimothée Chalamet, with whom he had worked onCall Me by Your Name(2017), got on board as well.[9][13]
After meeting with the director in Rome, Chalamet accepted the offer and joined as producer as well.[14][15]Guadagnino and Chalamet wanted to keep the production independent so they sought out Italian financiers at the end of 2020.[14][12]Guadagnino first contacted The Apartment'sLorenzo Mieli, with whom he had worked previously onHBO'sWe Are Who We Are, Mieli teamed with
Memo's Francesco Melzi d'Eril andMarco Morabito, both frequent Guadagnino collaborators, to front the $20 million needed for the film.[16][17]Guadagnino and Chalamet also contacted,Call Me by Your Nameproducer and personal friend,Peter Spearsto join them.[18][19]Spears remarked on the uniqueness of the story as one of the reasons, to not look for studio involvement.[18]Once they reached the budget, the North American distribution rights were bought byMGMin anegative pickup deal.[16][14][17]The team including the producers, Guadagnino, Chalamet, and the rest of the actors, deferred their salaries until after the distribution rights were bought, which "really helped with investors," said  Melzi d'Eril.[14][16][9]Both Guadagnino and Kajganich credited Chalamet's involvement as the main reason the film got financed in the first place.[14][9]The film was executive produced by Giovanni Corrado and Raffaella Viscardi; with investment coming from The Apartment, 3 Marys, Memo,Tenderstories, Adler, Elafood, Elafilm, Manila, Serfis and Wise.[20]
On January 28, 2021, it was announced thatTaylor Russelland Chalamet would star in the film,[21][13][22]Filming began in May, by which timeMark Rylance,Michael Stuhlbarg,André Holland,Jessica Harper,Chloë Sevigny,Francesca Scorsese, andDavid Gordon Greenhad joined the cast.[23][24][20]Shooting took place inChillicothe, OhioandCincinnati, Ohio, which makes it Guadagnino's first film set and made in the United States.[25]Production was affected by break-ins that occurred for some of the crew's cars, leading to a request being submitted toCincinnati City Councilin late June to provide $50,000 for increased security.[26]While there was some criticism over the proposed use of taxpayer funds for a private enterprise, City Council ultimately passed a measure to grant the funds.[27][28]Filming wrapped in July 2021.[29]
Guadagnino said thatBones and Allis "a very romantic story, about the impossibility of love and yet, the need for it. Even in extreme circumstances."[30]He also said that Chalamet and Russell have "a gleaming power" and are able to "portray universal feelings".[30]
The first teaser forBones and Allwas released on August 10, 2022.[31]American artistElizabeth Peytonwas commissioned by director Luca Guadagnino to create a painting based on the film. The resulting painting, which she titled "Kiss (Bones and All)", was turned into the film's first poster, which was on display during the Venice International Film Festival, hanging on the 13th-century palaceCa' da Mostoin Venice.[32]
The official poster for the film was released on September 29, 2022, accompanied by its first trailer, which featured a rendition ofLeonard Cohen's "You Want It Darker".[33][34]The song was chosen by lead actor Timothée Chalamet.[35]Safeeyah Kazi ofCollidercalled the trailer "chilling" and "intense".[36]Toussaint Egan ofPolygonnoted similarities to 1994's crime thrillerNatural Born Killers.[37]Allegra Frank ofThe Daily Beastcalled it "gorgeously bloody", and praised it for not sharing too much information.[38]Lauren Milici ofTotal Filmdescribed the trailer asLet The Right One InmeetsBonnie and Clyde."[39]An extended trailer was released on October 5, 2022.[40]
The film's score was composed byTrent ReznorandAtticus Rossand was released on November 18, 2022, on Reznor's labelThe Null Corporation.[41][42]In an interview withTheWrap, Reznor and Ross explained that they had extensive discussions with Guadagnino regarding the score, who stated that he wanted it to be "a melancholic elegy, an unending longing. It needs to be a character in the film, a part of the landscape" and requested the use of acoustic guitars to complement theAmericanavisuals. Reznor and Ross noted how the duo had to experiment with a lot of different sounds before figuring out how the score would sit in the film and explained the creation of the film's original song "(You Made It Feel) Like Home", which stemmed from their personal connections to Russell and Chalamet's characters.[43]
In early 2022,MGM's then-chairman Kevin Ulrich met with Guadagnino to discuss distributingBones and All. During the meeting, Guadagnino showed Ulrich a 10-minute reel of the finished film, and told him he was also in the midst of developing his next project,Challengers(2024).

It's so carefully made, and so lovely to look at, even at its grisliest", praising the direction and cast performances, particularly Russell's.[68]Taylor Russell,Timothée Chalamet, andMark Rylancehave received acclaim for their performances with critics praising Russell and Chalamet's chemistry together.Bloody Disgustingcalled the duo "profound" and "touching and genuine".[69]The Hollywood Reporter'sDavid Rooney also praised the duo, adding their performances are "unforced and underplayed to subtly stirring effect," while calling the film "strangely affecting, even poetic" and commending the direction and cinematography.[70]
Leila Latif in her review forIndieWirewrote, "Bones & Allis fundamentally a beautifully realized and devastating, tragic romance which at multiple moments would haveChekhovhimself weeping asthe triggeris pulled."[71]Richard LawsonofVanity Faircalled it an "alternately plodding and engrossing YA road movie" praising the cast performances, but ultimately found the film unsatisfactory, writing "Bones and Allhas its merits, but the film is only a decent side dish at the feast of Guadagnino."[72]Writing forSight & Sound, John Bleasdale described it as "wryly funny, gleefully entertaining and oddly touching" and praised the direction, cinematography, score, and cast performances.[73]Comparing it toCall Me by Your Name, Selina Sondermann wrote "like two sides of the same coin – both cunningly display the love we find for ourselves when we are allowed to truly love another person, bones and all."[74]
"There's real pleasure inBones and All, an insistent sweetness that somehow both nourishes and cleanses away the horror" wrote Justin Chang in his review for theLos Angeles Times.[75]Clint Worthington Flow ofConsequencedescribed the film as "an oddly sweet—presumably a little coppery, too, due to all the blood—alchemy of love and murder" and compared it toBadlands(1973) andBonnie and Clyde(1967), with their tales of "lovers skirting human morality and forging their own sense of paradise with each other".[76]In one unenthusiastic review,Slant's Keith Uhlich criticized the screenplay, direction, and cast performances, concluding: "Straining to be aYAspin onTrouble Every Day,Bones and Allbarely eclipsesTwilight."[77]Mick LaSalle, writing for theSan Francisco Chronicle, provided a firmly negative review, criticizing the use ofgoreby saying "the problem is [cannibalism] can’t stay a metaphor" and "Guadagnino has a choice, whether to be an artist or just the maker of artistically rendered, conscientiously realized garbage."[78]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
