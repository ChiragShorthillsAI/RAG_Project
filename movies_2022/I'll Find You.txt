David Schad Ward(born October 25, 1945) is an American screenwriter and film director.[1]He was nominated for twoAcademy Awardsfor his screenplays for the filmsThe Sting(1973) andSleepless in Seattle(1993), winning for the former. He was also nominated for aBritish Academy Film Award, aGolden Globe Award, and twoWriters Guild of America Awards.
Ward was born inProvidence, Rhode Island, the son of Miriam (née Schad) and Robert McCollum Ward.[1]Ward has degrees fromPomona College(BA),University of Southern California, and theUCLA Film School(MFA).
He was employed at an educational film production company when he sold his screenplay forThe Sting(1973), which led to anOscarwin forBest Original Screenplay. After this initial success, his follow-up projects were less critically and commercially well received, including Ward's first directorial effort,Cannery Row(1982), and a sequelThe Sting II(1983).[2]Ward's efforts to sell a script based on the frontier days of California were undone by an industry-wide "ban" on Westerns after the spectacular failure ofMichael Cimino'sHeaven's Gate(1980). He then wrote the comedySaving Grace(1986) under a pseudonym.
StingstarRobert Redfordhired Ward in 1986 to work on the Redford-directedThe Milagro Beanfield War.The response to this project enabled Ward to convinceMorgan Creek Productionsand Mirage Productions to bankrollMajor League(1989), a baseball comedy that he'd been pitching to producers since 1982.Major Leaguewas a labor of love for Ward, who had lived in theClevelandsuburb ofSouth Euclidas a child and who had rooted for theIndians'teams of the 1950s, including the 1954American LeagueChampions. "I figured the only way they were ever going to win anything in my lifetime was to do a movie and they'd win", says Ward.  Within 10 years of the film's release, the Indians would appear in the World Series twice, then again in 2016. In a lawsuit by a judgment creditor, Ward was forced to turn over his prized possession, a baseball bat signed by the cast ofMajor League. The Court refused to allow the judgment creditor to seize and sell his Oscar, because the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had a right of first refusal.[3][4]
Major Leagueand Ward's subsequent efforts as a writer and director,King Ralph(1991) andMajor League II(1994), were about underdogs who triumphed over the gadflies and nay-sayers of the world. He later scored a box-office coup with a screenplay co-written withNora Ephron: 1993'sSleepless in Seattle.He directed the sequelMajor League II, then the naval comedyDown Periscope(1996) starringKelsey Grammer. He also did uncredited rewrites onThe Mask of Zorro(1998)[5][6]andSahara(2005).[7]
In 2006, Ward was credited on another film,Flyboys, a World War I drama starringJames Francodirected byTony Bill(who was a producer onThe Sting). In 2010, it was announced that there would be aMajor League 4, starring many of the same cast as the previous films. The script for the film was reportedly finished, as of late 2012, and moving towards pre-production. No further news has surfaced, meaning the project is likely stuck indevelopment hell.
Ward has produced the Canadian-American thriller filmBloodwork, and co-wrote another period drama,I'll Find You(previously known asMusic, War and Love).
Ward is a professor atChapman University, in southern California, where he teaches screenwriting and directing, and acts as a Filmmaker in Residence for the campus.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
