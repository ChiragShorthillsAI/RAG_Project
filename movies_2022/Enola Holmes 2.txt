The film is directed byHarry Bradbeerfrom a screenplay byJack Thornethat adapts the book seriesThe Enola Holmes MysteriesbyNancy Springer.

Enola opens her own detective agency, but struggles to get clients unlike her famous detective brotherSherlock Holmes. A factory girl named Bessie asks Enola to help find her missing sisterSarah Chapman. Bessie takes Enola to thematch factory, which is experiencing a deadlytyphusepidemic, and encounters Mae, who worked alongside the sisters.
Enola follows Mae to the Paragon Theatre where Mae and Sarah work as dancers. She finds a letter written to Sarah by a secret lover. On her way home, Enola comes across a drunken Sherlock and brings him home to221B Baker Street. He is struggling to solve his latest case involving the blackmail of government officials, but he cannot trace the owner of the accounts where the money is sent.
Enola deduces that the poem is a code leading to a home inWhitechapel. There, she finds Mae dying of a stab wound. Enola discovers a piece ofsheet musicin Mae's dress but is interrupted by Superintendent Grail who accuses her of murder. Enola escapes to Sherlock's flat and deduces that Sarah's lover will be at a ball hosted by the Lyon family.
There, she meets Cicely, a friendly noblewoman, and Mira Troy, secretary to Treasury Minister Lord Charles McIntyre. Enola meets Tewkesbury, who teaches her how to dance so she can find an opportunity to get closer to William Lyon, the son of the match factory's owner and Sarah's lover. Meanwhile, Sherlock pieces together a message in the blackmail scheme from its mastermindMoriarty. Enola is arrested by Grail before she can speak with William, but Sherlock enlists their mother Eudoria and her fellow radical suffragette Edith to break Enola out of prison.
While visiting Tewkesbury, Enola realizes that Sarah is Cicely and that she, Mae, and William had discovered thatwhite phosphorus, not typhus, was killing the workers and were planning to expose it. Tewkesbury and Enola confess their love for each other. They head to the factory, where they meet Sherlock and find William dead with a corner of the sheet music. The three deduce Lord McIntyre had struck a deal with William's father to use cheap phosphorus to increase profit.
The group heads to the Paragon after realizing the full sheet music was a map of the theatre. There, Sarah confirms Enola's findings and admits she and William needed Tewkesbury's help to expose McIntyre. Grail and several policemen arrive holding Bessie hostage, but she breaks free and a fight ensues, resulting in Enola defeating Grail and causing him to fall to his death. Lord McIntyre arrives withLestrade. He burns the evidence of the dealings and attempts to have Sarah arrested, but Sherlock and Enola deduce that Mira Troy is Moriarty and is responsible for the blackmail and murder. Mira is taken into custody.
Sarah, Bessie, and Enola inform the factory's match girls of the events and convince them to strike, McIntyre is arrested with Tewkesbury's help, and Moriarty escapes police custody. Enola sets up a new office at Edith's shop. Tewkesbury has begun courting Enola in earnest and he invites Enola to a ball.[3]
In September 2020, co-producer and starMillie Bobby Brownand directorHarry Bradbeeracknowledged their intentions to develop a sequel toEnola Holmes.[4]The story is an original story based on the real1888 matchgirls' strikeand the life of labour activistSarah Chapman. Bradbeer thought it was an inspiring feminist tale, and it showed the theme of working together — "Enola, to advance, has to work with others and not just be reliant on herself. It's a story that goes from 'I' to 'we', and that is a story of sisterhood."[2]
In April 2021,Enola Holmes 2was reportedly in development, with Brown and Cavill reprising their roles as Enola Holmes and Sherlock Holmes.[5]Sam Claflinwas unable to return as Mycroft Holmes due to scheduling conflicts, much to the sadness of Bradbeer and the crew, though Mycroft's absence allowed them to concentrate more on Sherlock.[6]In May 2021, the project was officially confirmed by Netflix.[7][8]Brown was reportedly paid $10 million for her role,[9]making it the highest upfront salary for an actor under the age of 20 as of the release of the film.[10]
Production and filming began in Autumn 2021.[11]Scenes were filmed inHullin October 2021,[12][13]and Cavill wrapped filming that November.[14]Filming concluded on January 7, 2022.[15]
Enola Holmes 2debuted at number 1 on Netflix's global weekly viewership with 64.08 million hours streamed across 93 countries. The next week the film stayed at the number 1 spot with 62.860 million hours. Interest in the first filmEnola Holmesgenerated another 9.64 million hours viewed for the first week of the sequel release.[16]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 93% of 104 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7/10. The website's consensus reads: "Building on its predecessor with boisterously entertaining flair,Enola Holmes 2solves the mystery of how to make a satisfying sequel – and makes it look positively elementary."[17]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[18]
Beandrea July ofThe New York Timeswrote "One can't help but cheer on thisY.A.feminist tale as a welcome addition to the Sherlock Holmes universe."[19]Lovia Gyarkye ofThe Hollywood Reportercalled it "a serviceable sequel". Gyarkye praises the meticulous production and costume design but is critical of the narrative as "The 1888 match girl strike, which was a process of community building, a focused effort onwe, gets repackaged as a lesson in one voice leading the masses."[20]
Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiangave it 3 out of 5 and wrote: "An equally boisterous romp that's equally as hard to remember once it's over but one that should keep its many fans engaged enough to warrant further sequels."[21]Robbie Collin ofThe Telegraphgave it 2 out of 5. He found the film less charming than its predecessor and was critical of "the overall aura of cheapness", from the dreary looking scenes to the basic fight scenes.[22]
Millie Bobby Brown won the award for "Favorite Movie Actress" at the2023 Kids' Choice Awards.[23]Consolata Boylealso won "Best Costume Design" at the19th Irish Film & Television Awards.[24]
In November 2023, Netflix revealed that a screenplay for a thirdEnola Holmesfilm was in the works. Netflix Films chairmanScott Stubersaid the streamer is very proud of their "homegrown star" Millie Bobby Brown, and they are excited to continue telling Enola's story.[25]
The third film was officially announced in November 2024, withPhilip Barantinitaking over as director.[26]

Thorne has been a long-term advocate for the disabled community in the dramatic arts. After he developedcholinergic urticariawhen he was 20 years old, he became allergic to outdoor heat, artificial heat, and his own body heat. This gave him chronic pain that forced him to leave university and spend much of his early twenties in bed.[56]Despite this, he felt unsure whether he could identify as a disabled person; after attending aGraeae Theatre Companyopen day (which he described as the "National Theatre of disability") three years after his diagnosis, he was accepted with open arms. He described the incident as a "coming outmoment" and a "crucial part" of who he is. He has since written disabled dramasThe Hunchback of Notre Dame,The Spastic King,Cast Offs,The Solid Life of Sugar Water,Don't Take My Baby,CripTales, andThen Barbara Met Alan, and has become a patron of the Graeae Theatre Company.
In August 2021, Thorne delivered theEdinburgh TV Festival's prestigiousMacTaggart Lecture.[56]He used the speech to discuss television's power as an "empathy box" in the living room of millions and its failings for neglecting a large and vibrant part of the populace by poorly representing the disabled community. Thorne points to the great suffering of disabled people during theCOVID-19 pandemicin which the media rendered huge amounts of unnecessary deaths acceptable through usage of the term "underlying health condition".[56]The speech also outlined how television industry practice has been discriminatory towards disabled artists, and the dire need for the industry to commit to change, both off-screen and on; alongsideGenevieve Barrand Katie Player, Thorne announced a pressure group called Underlying Health Condition which aims to elevate disabled voices in the industry. Thorne argues that more disabled stories written by disabled people and performed by disabled people would make visible what's invisible in the "empathy box" in the homes of the public and cause change to happen.
On 3 December 2021,Underlying Health Conditionwas launched at an event at theTate Modern, collaborating with other disability organisations such as Disabled Artists Networking Community, the Creative Diversity Network and 1in4 Coalition, to propose a series of requirements and measures to accommodate and support disabled artists in television.[57][58]
This, in turn, lead to the launch of The TV Access Project,[59]or TAP, which has seen 10 of the UK’s biggest broadcasters commit to the full inclusion of Deaf Disabled and/or Neurodivergent Talent by 2030. TAP created best practise guidelines to ensure this inclusion, referred to as the 5As: Anticipate, Ask, Assess, Adjust, Advocate.[60]
Within its first year, TAP delivered 20 sustainable, tangible solutions towards its vision of full inclusion, including launching TAPStars, a programme funded by the broadcasters and streamers who are TAP members to support early-career disabled off-screen talent; introducing an Access To Work pilot scheme to fast-track applications and access provision for freelances, and oversee reimbursements from Access to Work; securing a commitment from all TAP members to fund necessary access costs not covered by Access to Work, over and above the production budget; giving 82 Commissioning Editors and senior leaders from TAP members fundamental 5As training, delivered by CDN; and writing an outline of key access-related roles & responsibilities across productions and commissioning, to be adopted alongside Access Coordinators.[61]
In August 2024, it was announced that all 10 TAP members - theBBC,Channel 4,ITV,Disney+,UKTV,BritBox,Sky UK,Paramount Pictures,STV (TV channel)andAmazon Prime Video- would boycott any studios and production spaces which had not completed the TV Access Project's accessibility audit by August 2025.[62]This audit requires studios to self-assess their own accessibility in 4 key areas: Production buildings, Locations - external, Locations - Internal, and Outside Broadcast.
Thorne is married to Rachel Mason. They have one son, Elliott, who was named after the human protagonist ofE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. He and Mason underwent multiple attempts at IVF to have their son, the experience later leading them to develop the filmJoy.[63]His wife's sister Cath is the long-term partner of the comedianFrank Skinner.[64]
In 2022, Thorne was diagnosed as beingautistic. He was inspired to seek diagnosis following a question onDesert Island Discs.[65]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
