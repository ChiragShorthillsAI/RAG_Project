Moonage Daydreamis a 2022documentary film[1]about English singer-songwriterDavid Bowie. Written, directed, produced and edited byBrett Morgen, the film uses previously unreleased footage from Bowie's personal archives,[4]including live concert footage.[5]It is the first film to be officially authorized by Bowie's estate,[6]and takes its title from the1972 Bowie song of the same name.[7]
Moonage Daydreamhad its world premiere at the2022 Cannes Film Festival,[4][7]where it received positive reviews. It was released theatrically and inIMAXin the United States on 16 September 2022.[6][7]It was shortlisted forBest Documentary Featureat the95th Academy Awards,[8]and wonBest Music Filmat the66th Annual Grammy Awards.[9]
The documentary uses a montage-style editing format to convey a biography of Bowie, utilizing film clips and interviews from throughout his career.[10]The film starts with a 2002 quote of Bowie stating:
The film is divided into nearly two dozen "chapters" in theDVDrelease with the first hour covering Bowie starting in London up to his departure toWest Berlin. The second part of the film discussed and presents Bowie's extensive interests in the arts while in West Berlin outside of themusic industry, such as his interest inoil paintingandacrylic painting, as well as his forays into the literary arts. Many examples of Bowie's portrait work in oils are presented showing the use of a modern representational style of portraiture combined with an experimental color palette for brightly lit representations in nearly kaleidoscopic color preferences for facial expressions. In his third phase covered in the last part of the film, Bowie emerges from a two year hiatus where he remakes himself in the image of a suave musical artist often dressed in tailoredSaville Rowdouble breasted men's business suits.
The first hour of the film begins with a long film clip of Bowie performing a live version of a largely narrated version of "All the Young Dudes" before singing the choruses later made famous byMott the Hoople's recording of the song. Bowie is pictured in many clips from hisglam rockyears wearing heavily costumed outfits often experimenting with the signature transgender dressing associated with his early years. Bowie emerges from these pre-Berlin years as a significant rock-and-roll star on the London scene making an impact throughout much of Britain and the United States.
After moving to West Berlin, Bowie speaks in clips and interviews about the extensive impact which the aesthetics ofGerman culturein West Berlin had upon his artistic sensibilities. Bowie is apparently deeply moved by the visual arts as he experiences them while in West Berlin, and this influences his own painting style in his own renderings of oil portraits and related efforts in his other oil paintings. The documentary's film style of montage also interlaces many film clips from over two dozen different films ranging from the silent era including the filmMetropolisup to and including clips from theStanley Kubrick-directed filmsClockwork Orangeand2001: A Space Odyssey.
Bowie's third phase is covered by showing him appearing in his tailored Savile Row double breasted business suits and appearing in duets with multiple established artists such asTina Turnerand others. He is depicted as having entered the height of his career and formed a new life style with his new wifeIman Abdulmajid. Bowie dies at the age of 69.
In 2021,Varietyreported that Brett Morgen had been developing a film based on David Bowie, "for which an official title has not been disclosed, for the last four years."[5]It is the first film to be officially authorized by Bowie's estate.[5][6]Working in cooperation with the estate, Morgen was granted access to an archive of five million different items, including paintings, drawings, recordings, photographs, films, and journals.[1][11]Tony Visconti, who spent years as Bowie's producer, serves as the film's music producer.[5][7]
An official teaser trailer for the film was uploaded toYouTubeon 23 May 2022.[4]A full trailer was released on 27 July.[12]
Moonage Daydreamhad its world premiere at the2022 Cannes Film Festivalon 23 May 2022.[4][7]It was released inIMAXand theatres in the United States on 16 September 2022.[7]It was also expected to be released forstreamingonHBO Maxin spring 2023.[4][7]The documentary was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 15 November 2022.[13]It also was released onUltra HD Blu-rayby theCriterion Collectionin September 2023.[14]
To accompany the film, a soundtrack album containing music of Bowie's used therein was announced on 25 August 2022. An initial digital release was set for 16 September 2022, with a two-disc CD version to follow on 18 November 2022 and a three-disc vinyl record release was released on 31 March 2023.[15]The music on the album consists of rare or previously unreleased live tracks, as well as newly created remixes, interspersed with monologues from Bowie himself.[16]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 156 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critics' consensus reads: "An audiovisual treat for Bowie fans,Moonage Daydreamtakes an appropriately distinctive approach to one of modern music's most mercurial artists."[17]OnMetacritic, which uses aweighted average, the film has a score of 83 out of 100 based on 34 critic reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".[18]
Owen GleibermanofVarietywrote that "We've seen trippy documentaries before, but Morgen seems to have created this movie toberock 'n' roll. [...] WatchingMoonage Daydream, there are essential facts you won't hear, and many touchstones that get skipped over (in the entire movie, you'll never even see an album cover). But you get closer than you expect to the chilly sexy enigma of who David Bowie really was."[1]Corey Seymour ofVoguecommended the film's editing and soundtrack, and called the film "astounding, bombastic, groundbreaking, electrifying, and among the best films about any artist or musician I've ever seen. [...] Morgen has [assembled] a mesmerizing collage of sound and vision that will entrance and enrich any Bowie fan and, presumably, make new fans of anyone lucky enough to have this be their first real encounter with his world."[11]
Peter Bradshaw, in his review of the film forThe Guardian, gave it a score of five out of five stars.[19]He called the film "a glorious celebratory montage", and wrote favourably of how the film "shows that his fans, especially the ecstatic young people at theHammersmith OdeonandEarl's Courtshows, were not different from Bowie: they became Bowie. Overwhelmed, transfigured, their faces looked like his face."[19]Robert Daniels, writing forRogerEbert.com, praised the film's editing, and called it "a bombastic, overstimulating, poignant, life-affirming, and risk-taking summation of the artist's ethos and maturation as a person. In short,Moonage Daydreamis the film Bowie would've proudly made."[20]Fionnuala Halligan ofScreen Dailycalled the film "a pristine sensory voyage, with astonishing sound", and lauded its presentation as "skilled and satisfyingly unconventional".[21]
Entertainment Weekly's Joshua Rothkopf gave the film a grade of "A−", complimenting the remixed music by Tony Visconti and noting that, "Occasionally, Morgen's flow can feel belabored and imprecise, [...] But pruning would hamper the unencumbered risk-taking on display," an approach which Rothkopft writes "instantly vaults the effort to the top of the Bowie docs."[22]Siddhant Adlakha ofIndieWiregave the film a "B+", characterizing it thus: "More sensory experience than straightforward recounting, [Moonage Daydream] is about feeling your way through a chaotic world with Ziggy Stardust as your anchor."[23]He concluded that, "As musical documentaries go, it's more ambitious than anything you're likely to witness for quite some time."[23]Paul Sinclair ofSuperDeluxeEditionwas more critical in his review, praising the film's integration of archival footage, animation, interview audio, and music while criticizing the pacing and length, describing the result as "oddly unmoving" and stating that "the film is at least half an hour too long, a feeling accentuated by the reuse of clips you've already seen on a number of occasions which gives a rather circular, haven't-we-been-here-before vibe to proceedings." Sinclair also criticized a perceived lack of sufficient coverage for certain periods of Bowie's career, singling out his tenure onEMI America Recordsand his membership inTin Machine.[24]

NEON Rated, LLC,doing business asNeon(stylized inall caps), is an Americanindependent filmproductionanddistributioncompany founded in 2017 by CEO Tom Quinn andTim League, who also was the co-founder of theAlamo Drafthouse Cinemachain.[1]As of 2019, League is no longer involved with daily operations for the company.[6]
Its first film,Colossal, was released in 2017.[7]The company became known for distributing such notable films asI, Tonya(2017),Parasite(2019),Portrait of a Lady on Fire(2019),Palm Springs(2020),Flee(2021),Spencer(2021),The Worst Person in the World(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023),Anora(2024),Longlegs(2024),The Seed of the Sacred Fig(2024), andThe Monkey(2025).[8][9]
Parasitewent on to become Neon's highest-grossing film at the worldwidebox officewith $262 million and the first non-English-language film to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture.[10]In 2024,Longlegshad a domestic box office gross of $58.6 million, becoming the distributor's highest-grossing film ever in North America.[11]Anorabecame the company's second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[12]Neon has also worked with several high-profile filmmakers, which includesSean Baker,[13]Bong Joon Ho,Julia Ducournau,Craig Gillespie,Pablo Larraín, andCéline Sciamma.[14]
During the 4th Annual Zurich Summit, Tom Quinn commented on Neon's intent to release titles that appeal to audiences who "skew under 45, that have no aversion to violence, no aversion to foreign language and to non-fiction".[15]Explaining the success of the company in 2024, Quinn stated: "We were very much a startup, with everyone functioning as this sophisticated amoeba. We very quickly found ourselves that year inTorontowith a great slate [...] That work enabled us to sit at the table in Toronto that year and buyI, Tonya. Before the ink was even dry on the deal, we were planning itsOscar campaign. It's a testament to how quickly we can make decisions because we're not this big studio. We've always used that to our advantage."[16]
In September 2017, the company partnered withBlumhouse Productionsto manage BH Tilt.[17]In 2018, a majority stake of Neon was sold to30West, the media venture arm of "The Friedkin Group".[4][18]In February 2021,Bleecker Streetpartnered with Neon to launch the joint home entertainment distribution companyDecal, which is a standalone full-service operation that handlesdistribution dealson the home entertainment rights to both Neon and Bleecker Street's features. The first film to be distributed through Decal was the Bleecker Street releaseSupernovain winter 2021.[5]Additionally, Decal acquired North American distribution rights to the South Africanhorror filmGaiafor a summertheatrical release, marking their first ever acquisition.[19]
Andrew Brown (Co-President of Decal) oversaw the launch of Neon's home entertainment division. In 2022, Brown was promoted to "President of Digital Distribution". The exec, who has served as "SVP of Digital Strategy, Marketing, and Distribution" for Neon since 2017, also manages Neon's library, and oversees the annualFYC DVD Box Setanddirect-to-consumerdigital portal "Neon Cinema".[20]Prior to the joint-venture,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, as well asThe Criterion CollectionandWell Go USA Entertainment(for the filmPossessorwhich Neon and Well Go co-distributed), distributed several Neon films onhome video.[21][22][23]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, Neon was approved to continue promotional activities for its films since the company does not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP) nor had encountered any issue in receivingSAG-AFTRAinterim agreements.[24][25][26]
In August 2023, Neon hired formerA24employees Alexandra Altschuler as "VP Media" and Don Wilcox as "VP Marketing".[27]That same month, Neon hired former Sierra/Affinity employee Kristen Figeroid as "President of International Sales and Distribution", Laurel Charnetsky as "VP International Acquisitions & Operations", and Dan Stadnicki as "Manager, International Sales & Distribution".[28]In May 2024, Neon hired Joey Monteiro as "EVP, International Marketing" and Ashley Hirsch as "Manager of International Sales and Marketing".[29]That same month, Neon promoted Elissa Federoff from "President of Distribution" to "Chief Distribution Officer" and Ryan Friscia from "EVP, Finance and Business Development" to "Chief Financial Officer".[30]Furthermore, Jeff Deutchman, who joined Neon when it was launched, serves as "President of Acquisitions and Production".[31]
Additionally, Neon has acquired the distribution rights to fivePalme d'Orwinners at theCannes Film Festival:Parasite(2019),Titane(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023), andAnora(2024); all five won consecutively.[31][32][33]The company's strategy to acquire such titles at Cannes is to eschew "the lazy approach", said Deutchman. "The only real way to do Cannes is to go see as many movies as you can, because you never know where the nextDogtoothorBorderorHungerorForce Majeureis going to come from", he added, citing several modern Cannes standouts championed by arthouse buyers.[31]After acquiringParasitein 2018, Neon financed and distributed the film the following year in U.S. territories.[34]"From the very beginning, Tom Quinn sawParasiteas a universal film and refused to put it in a box as a foreign-language or international film", saidParasitedirectorBong Joon Ho. "He saw the heart of the film and understood that it was about all of us living in our modern class-based society. I was always grateful for that."[16]Neon spent $20 million promoting, distributing, and campaigning for the film's awards.[3]The film subsequently became Neon's highest-grossing film with more than $200 million at the worldwidebox officeand won fourAcademy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Director. Similarly, Neon spent $18 million promotingAnora, three times the film's original budget.[3]Anoraultimately won the two aforementioned Academy Awards whileAnatomy of a FallandTriangle of Sadnesswere nominated for the same two categories, among others. As of March 2025, Neon has garnered 39 Academy Award nominations, winning 11 overall.[10][12][35]
In 2023, Quinn commented on the company's success at Cannes, saying: "We've seen over the years that each of these films, because of their credibility and success, the Palme d'Or has come to mean something quite impactful for a very young group ofcinephiles. And the reason why we know this is we've tested all these movies and dating back toParasite, probably I think, the fifth reason why people came to see the film, in itstest screeninginSherman Oaks, was the fact that it won the Palme d'Or, and each subsequent year that went up. And this year, the number one reason why people came to see the film [Anatomy of a Fall], at a test screening inBurbank, was the fact that it had won the Palme d'Or."[36]In 2024, Quinn stated: "The award means a lot. To audiences here who are looking for the absolute most adventurous, forward-looking cinema available, that award represents it because these films have delivered, and they've been major Oscar contenders."[16]
In July 2024, Neon received its biggest opening weekend at the box office with the horror thriller filmLonglegs, after scoring $22.6 million from 2,510 theaters (a figure that includes $2.5–3 million in Thursday previews) and only behindUniversal/Illumination's second weekend ofDespicable Me 4. Initially projected to gross $7–9 million, the opening marked the biggest total for an original horror film of 2024, one of the top 20 weekends for an independent film and the best opening ever for an independent horror film.[37][38][39]To promote the film, Neon utilizedguerrilla marketingtactics similar to those that led to the box office success ofThe Blair Witch Project(1999).[40]DirectorOz Perkinscredited Neon for the film's marketing, stating the studio "really responded strongly to the movie, the raw materials of the movie really excited them, the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it sounds. They asked me early on, 'Do we have your permission to kind of go nuts?' And I said, 'What else are we doing here? Go for it. Do your thing.'"[41]The film's total marketing budget was under $10 million, focusing ondigital contentand not havingtelevision ads.[37]During its third weekend,Longlegsbecame the company's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office, earning $58.6 million, surpassing whatParasiteearned with $53.3 million in 2020.[11]Furthermore, it became the top grossing R-rated horror film of 2024 and the highest-grossing indie horror film of the last decade, topping A24'sTalk to Me(2022),Insidious: Chapter 3(2015) fromFocus Features, and A24'sHereditary(2018).[11]Afterward, furthering their marketing campaign, from August 1 to 4, Neon (partnering withAtom Tickets) offered free tickets to anyone who has a birthday that falls on the 14th of any given month. To get the tickets, those who registered and purchased tickets through Atom Tickets received a special promo code after verifying their date of birth and were able to get one free ticket per customer, while supplies lasted.[42]

BMG Rights Management GmbH(also known simply asBMG) is an internationalmusic companybased inBerlin, Germany.[2]It combines the activities of amusic publisherand arecord label.[3][4]
BMG was founded in October 2008 afterBertelsmannsold its stake inSony BMGtoSony.[5]From 2009 to 2013, the investment firmKKRheld 51% of the company, which became one of the world's largest music publishers during that time.[6][7]BMG is 100% owned by Bertelsmann and one of the group's eight business divisions.[8]
In the 1950s, Bertelsmann entered the music business when it added music to its book club.[9]Ariola, a record label, was launched andSonopress, a pressing plant, was established.[10][11]In 1975, Ariola opened an office in the United States.[12]Bertelsmann acquiredArista Recordsin 1979 and RCA Records in 1985, thereby becoming one of the world's largest music companies.[13]Its various subsidiaries were brought together in 1987 to formBertelsmann Music Group(BMG), which did business in a number of genres, includingfolk,pop, and in particularclassical music.[14]
In response to declining sales in the overall music market, Bertelsmann agreed to merge its record label interests withSonyin 2003; the company was called Sony BMG.[15][16]Furthermore, in 2006, Bertelsmann sold its subsidiary BMG Music Publishing toUniversal Music Group.[17][18]Having reached the conclusion that established music publishing companies and record labels were not appropriate for an increasingly digital music business, Bertelsmann sold its stake in the Sony BMG joint venture in 2008.[19]The company was subsequently renamedSony Music Entertainment.[20]
In October 2008, Bertelsmann launched the new BMG with a small portfolio of recorded music rights of around 200 artists it retained from Sony BMG.[3][21]It declared it would pursue a business model focused on fairness, service and transparency.[4][22]
The launch of the new BMG came amidst the 2008 financial crisis, and within two weeks of the collapse ofLehman Brothers.[23][24]Since Bertelsmann could not supply the required funds on its own, a 51% stake was sold to financial investorKKRin 2009.[25][26][27]Bertelsmann retained 49% and the right to appoint the company's management.[28]The transaction allowed BMG to increase its equity ratio.[26]
Initially, Bertelsmann had announced that the new BMG would focus on the European broadcast market. After KKR became the majority shareholder, the company set its sights on expanding internationally.[29][30]A key step towards achieving this goal was acquiringCherry Lane Music Publishingin 2009, which provided BMG with its first foothold in the United States.[31][32][33][34]BMG made several other purchases in 2010, includingEvergreen Copyright Acquisitions.[35][36]
In 2011,Bug Musicwas bought by BMG,[37]followed by music publisher R2M Music in 2012.[38]Bertelsmann was also reported to be interested in buyingEMI,[39]but EMI was ultimately acquired byUniversal Music GroupandWarner Music Group(record labels) andSony/ATV Music Publishing(songwriters).[40][41]The regulatory authorities approved the deal subject to some conditions, including the sale of several labels.[42]BMG was thus able to acquireMute Records(2012) andSanctuary Records(2013),[43][44]as well as the publishing catalogues of EMI Virgin Music andFamous MusicUK from Sony/ATV.[45]
In 2013, KKR sold its stake in BMG to Bertelsmann,[46]making it the sole shareholder of the company.[47]Under the leadership of Chief Executive OfficerThomas Rabe,[48][49]who had been a key driver of BMG's expansion during his time as Chief Financial Officer,[31]Bertelsmann again cited music as one of its strategic growth areas.[50]
In 2013, the company began to represent rights to songs byRobbie Williamsand theRolling Stones.[51][52]Record labels were also added to the portfolio including Union Square Music (distributor ofUniversal Music'sZTT RecordsandStiff Records),[53]Vagrant Music and Infectious Music (2014),[54][55]as well asS-Curve Records[56]andRise Records(2015).[57]Other acquisitions followed in 2016, including the labelARC Musicand the catalog ofThe End Records.[58][59]By acquiring Basement, BMG entered the market in Brazil,[60]one of Bertelsmann's growth regions.[61][62]In 2016, the company also signed an agreement with Warner Music'sAlternative Distribution Alliancefor the physical and digital distribution of music,[63]allowing BMG to consolidate its longstanding sales structures.[64]BMG further expanded by entering the Chinese market in cooperation withAlibaba, allowing the online company to distribute the work of musicians and composers via its web channels while securing copyrights.[65]
In the 2015 financial year, BMG was part of the Corporate Investments division at Bertelsmann.[66]In 2016, the media group turned the subsidiary into a stand-alone division.[8]Today, BMG is considered a prime example of how growth platforms are created and leveraged at Bertelsmann.[67][68]
In 2017, BMG announced the purchase ofBBR Music Group,[69]including the labels Broken Bow Records, Red Bow Records, Stoney Creek Records, Wheelhouse Records and the music publisher Magic Mustang Music.[70]With a value of more than 100 milliondollars, the transaction was the largest recorded music acquisition in the company's history.[71]BMG thus improved its position in thecountry musicsegment and ensured its long-term presence in theNashvillemusic industry and its overall impact on the United States market.[70]
In 2022, BMG announced its first new British record label within the group since 2009, Tag8 Music.[72][73][74]This label was set up in association with ex-Bros memberCraig Loganand his management company Logan Media Entertainment, with Tag8 Music featuring established acts such as Pixie Lott, Roachford, and Louise Redknapp as part of its roster. On the Official Albums Chart Top 100 of 4 November 2022, the label charted its first hit album in the form of Blue'sHeart & Soul.[75][76][77]
In October 2023, BMG signed withUniversal Music Groupfor physical distribution, and started self-distributing its own catalog on digital platforms, thus ending their partnership with Warner Music.[78]The transition of physical distribution to Universal took place over the course of 2024 and is set to officially change over in October of 2024.
BMG's parent enterprise is BMG Rights Management GmbH, alimited liability companyaccording to German law. The company's objective is "the marketing of music, as well as its development and delivery" for use in media, at concerts and for other purposes.[79]BMG has numeroussubsidiariesandshareholdings, for example, BMG Rights Management (Europe) GmbH.[80]In addition to Germany, BMG is present in Australia, Brazil, China, France, Italy, Spain, the UK, the Benelux countries, the United States, Canada, and Scandinavia.[81]
BMG's senior management includes Thomas Coesfeld (Chief Executive Officer), Mathis Wolter (Chief Financial Officer), Ama Walton (General CounselandChief Human Resources Officer) and Ben Katovsky (Chief Operating Officer).[82]Masuch has been a member of Bertelsmann's Group Management Committee since 2013.[83]
In the 2018 financial year, BMG posted revenues of €545 million. Rights and licenses accounted for 91.1% and products and merchandise 8.9%. Almost half of its revenues (44.1%) were generated in the United States. Other important markets were the United Kingdom (24.7%), Germany (6.3%) and France (3.9%).[84]
BMG offers musicians the services generally provided by music publishers and record labels.[3]Unlike its major competitors, it runs them under the same roof and on the same technology platform.[85][86][87]More recently, it has added film, television, and books to its roster of services.[21][88]
BMG publishing represents the rights of songwriters.[89]
BMG has a significant library ofproduction music(library music), for use in films, television, advertising, and other media.

Home Box Office(HBO) is an Americanpay televisionnetwork, which is the flagship property of namesake parent-subsidiaryHome Box Office, Inc., itself a unit owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. The overall Home Box Office business unit is based at Warner Bros. Discovery's corporate headquarters inside30 Hudson Yardsin Manhattan. Programming featured on the network consists primarily of theatrically releasedmotion picturesandoriginaltelevision programs as well as made-for-cable movies, documentaries, occasional comedy, and concertspecials, and periodicinterstitial programs(consisting of short films andmaking-ofdocumentaries).
HBO is the oldest subscription television service in the United States still in operation, as well as the country's firstcable-originatedtelevision network (both as a regionalmicrowave- and nationalsatellite-transmitted service).[2]HBO pioneered modern pay television upon its launch on November 8, 1972: it was the first television service to be directly transmitted and distributed to individual cable television systems, and was the conceptual blueprint for the "premium channel", pay television services sold to subscribers for an extra monthly fee that do not accepttraditional advertisingand present their programming withoutediting for objectionable material. It eventually became the first television channel in the world to begin transmitting via satellite—expanding the growing regional pay service, originally available to cable andmultipoint distribution service(MDS) providers in the northernMid-Atlanticand southernNew England, into a national television network—in September 1975, and, alongside sister channelCinemax, was among the first two American pay television services to offer complimentarymultiplexed channelsin August 1991.
The network operates seven 24-hour, linear multiplex channels as well as a traditional subscriptionvideo on demandplatform (HBO On Demand) and its content is the centerpiece ofMax(previously HBO Max from 2020 to 2023), an expanded streaming platform operated separately from but sharing management with Home Box Office, Inc., which also includes original programming produced exclusively for the service and content from other Warner Bros. Discovery properties. Since December 4, 2024, livestreams of most of the network's linear feeds (except for multiplex channels HBO Family and HBO Latino) are accessible on the Max streaming app to U.S. subscribers of its Ad-Free and Ultimate Ad-Free tiers (exclusive to accounts with adult profiles).[3][4]LinearEastorWest CoastHBO channel feeds are also available via Max'sa la carteadd-ons sold throughPrime Video Channels,YouTube Primetime Channels,The Roku Channeland virtual pay television providersHuluandYouTube TV(both of which sell their HBO/Max add-ons independently of their respective live TV tiers).[5][6][7]
As of September 2018[update], HBO's programming was available to approximately 35.656 million U.S. households that had a subscription to amultichannel television provider(34.939 million of which receive HBO's primary channel at minimum),[8]giving it the largest subscriber total of any American premium channel.[a]In addition to its U.S. subscriber base, HBO distributes its programming content in at least 151 countries worldwide to, as of 2018[update], an estimated 140 million cumulative subscribers.[11][12]
Cable television executiveCharles Dolan—through his company, Sterling Information Services—founded Manhattan Cable TV Services (renamed Sterling Manhattan Cable Television in January 1971), a cable system franchise serving anUpper Manhattansection of New York City (covering an area extending southward from79th Streeton theUpper East Sideto86th Streeton the Upper West Side), which began limited service in September 1966. Manhattan Cable was notable for being the first urban underground cable television system to operate in the United States.[13][14][15]
With external expenses resulting in consistent financial losses, in the summer of 1971, while on a family vacation to France aboard theQueen Elizabeth 2, a desperate Dolan—wanting to help Sterling Manhattan turn profitable and to preventTime-Life, Inc.(then the book publishing unit ofTime Inc.) from pulling its investment in the system—developed a proposal for a cable-originated television channel.Codenamed"The Green Channel", the conceptual subscription service would offer unedited theatrical movies licensed from themajor Hollywood film studiosand live sporting events, all presented without interruptions byadvertisingand sold for a flat monthly fee to prospective subscribers. On November 2, 1971, Time Inc.'s board of directors approved the "Green Channel" proposal, agreeing to give Dolan a $150,000 development grant for the project.[16][17][18]
Time-Life and Sterling Communications soon proposed for the "Sterling Cable Network" to be the name of the new service. Discussions to change the service's name took place during a later meeting of Dolan and the executive staff he hired to assist in developing the project, who ultimately settled on calling it "HomeBoxOffice", which was meant to convey to potential customers that the service would be their "ticket" to movies and events that they could see in their own home.[19][16]
Home Box Office launched at 7:30 p.m.Eastern Timeon November 8, 1972, initially available to subscribers of Teleservice Cable (nowService Electric Cable TV and Communications) inWilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.[20][21][22]HBO's inaugural program and event telecast, aNational Hockey League(NHL) game between theNew York Rangersand theVancouver CanucksfromMadison Square Garden,[23]was transmitted that evening over channel 21—its original assigned channel on the Teleservice system—to its initial base of 365 subscribers in Wilkes-Barre.[24]The first movie presentation shown on the service aired immediately after the hockey game concluded: the 1971 filmSometimes a Great Notion, starringPaul NewmanandHenry Fonda.[21][25][17][26]
To reduce subscriberchurnby offering extra programming choices to subscribers, on May 8, 1991, Home Box Office Inc. announced plans to launch two additional channels of HBO and Cinemax, becoming the first subscription television services to launch "multiplexed" companion channels (a term coined by then-CEO Michael Fuchs to equate the programming choices that would be provided to subscribers of the channel tier to that offered bymulti-screen movie theaters), each available at no extra charge to subscribers of one or both networks. (The three prior premium services that HBO launched between 1979 and 1987, Cinemax and the now-defunct Take 2 and Festival, were developed as standalone services that could be purchased separately from and optionally packaged with HBO.) On August 1, 1991, through a test launch of the three channels over those systems, TeleCable customers inOverland Park, Kansas;Racine, Wisconsin; and suburbanDallas(RichardsonandPlano, Texas) that subscribed to either service began receiving two additional HBO channels or a secondary channel of Cinemax. HBO2 (later renamed HBO Plus, then reverted to its original name), HBO3 (now HBO Signature), and Cinemax 2 (now MoreMax) each offered distinct schedules of programs culled from HBO and Cinemax's movie and original programming libraries separate from offerings shown concurrently on their respective parent primary channels. (Cinemax was originally scheduled to launch a tertiary channel, Cinemax 3, on November 1, 1991, but these plans were shelved until 1996.)[27][28][29][30][31]While most cable providers collectively offered the HBO and Cinemax multiplex channels in individual tiers, some providers had sold their secondary or tertiary channels as optional add-ons to expanded basic subscribers; this practice was discontinued when HBO and Cinemax began migrating todigital cablein the early 2000s, as the respective multiplex channels were being packaged in each tier mandatorily.
In February 1996, in anticipation of the adoption ofMPEG-2digital compression codecs that would allow cable providers to offer digital cable service, Home Box Office, Inc. announced plans to expand its multiplex services across HBO and Cinemax to twelve channels (countingtime zone-based feeds), encompassing a fourth HBO channel and two additional Cinemax channels, originally projected for a Spring 1997 launch.[32]The HBO multiplex expanded to include a fourth channel on December 1, 1996, with the launch of HBO Family, focusing on family-oriented feature films and television series aimed at younger children. (HBO Family's launch coincided with the launch ofMountain Time Zonefeeds of HBO, HBO2, Cinemax, and Cinemax 2, which were the first sub-feeds ever offered by a subscription television service to specifically serve that time zone.)[33][34]
Home Box Office, Inc. began marketing the HBO channel suite and related coastal feeds under the umbrella brand "MultiChannel HBO" in September 1994; the package wasrebrandedas "HBO The Works", now exclusively classified to the four HBO multiplex channels (and later applied to the three thematic channels that were launched afterward), in April 1998. (The Cinemax tier was accordingly marketed as "MultiChannel Cinemax" and then "MultiMax" at the respective times.) Concurrent with the adoption of "The Works" package brand, two of the channels changed their names and formats: HBO2 was rebranded as HBO Plus, and HBO3 was relaunched as HBO Signature—incorporating content catering toward a female audience, alongside theatrical films aimed at broader audiences and content from HBO's original made-for-cable movie and documentary libraries. (HBO Plus would revert to the "HBO2" moniker in September 2002. The "HBO Plus" brand—modified in 2019 to "HBO+"—remains in use[update]on a multiplex channel ofHBO Latin Americafeaturing mainly theatrical movies previously carried on its parent feed; HBO Latin America also operates a separate channel sharing the "HBO2" name with the shared U.S. namesake of both services.)[35]
On May 6, 1999, the HBO multiplex expanded to include two new thematic channels: HBO Comedy—featuring comedic feature films, comedy series from HBO's original programming library, and recent and archived HBO comedy specials—and HBO Zone—aimed at young adults between the ages of 18 and 34, offering theatrical movies; comedy and alternative series, and documentaries from HBO's original programming library; and music videos.[36]Rounding out the HBO multiplex expansion was HBO Latino, a Spanish language network launched on November 1, 2000, featuring a mix of dubbed simulcasts of programming from the primary HBO channel as well as exclusive Spanish-originated programs.[37][38]
Depending on the service provider, HBO provides up to seven 24-hour multiplex channels—all of which are simulcast in bothstandard definitionandhigh definition, and available as time zone-based regional feeds—as well as asubscription video-on-demandservice (HBO On Demand). Off-the-air maintenance periods of anywhere from a half-hour up to two hours occur at varied overnight/early morning time slots (usually preceding the 6:00 a.m. ET/PT start of the defined broadcast day) once per month on each channel.
HBO transmits feeds of its primary and multiplex channels on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together, resulting in thedifference in local airtimesfor a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most; the opposite-region feed (i.e., the Pacific Time feeds in the Eastern and Central Time Zones, and the Eastern Time feeds in the Pacific, Mountain andAlaska Time Zones) serves as atimeshift channel, allowing viewers who may have missed a particular program at its original local airtime to watch it three hours after its initial airing or allowing them to watch a program up to four hours, depending on the applicable time zone, in advance of their local airtime on their corresponding primary coastal feed. (Most cable, satellite, and IPTV providers, as well as its Amazon Prime Video and Roku OTT channels, only offer the East and West Coast feeds of the main HBO channel; some conventional television providers may include coastal feeds of HBO2 in certain areas, while wider availability of coastal feeds for the other five multiplex channels is limited to subscribers ofDirecTV,YouTube TVand theHululive TV service.)
HBO maintains a separate feed for theHawaii–Aleutian Time Zone—the only American cable-originated television network to offer a timeshift feed for Hawaii viewers—operating a three-hour-delayed version of the primary channel's Pacific Time feed for subscribers ofOceanic Spectrum, which otherwise transmits Pacific Time feeds for the six other HBO multiplex channels. (The state's other major cable provider,Hawaiian Telcom, offers the Pacific Time Zone feed of all seven channels.)
It also airs premieres of recent theatrical or new HBO original movies, marketed as the "HBO Movie Premiere", on selected Saturday nights (usually at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time). The main HBO channel mainly airs R-rated films after 5:00 p.m. (or sometimes as early as 2:30 p.m.) Eastern and Pacific, and TV-MA-rated programs (usually edited for daytime airings to limit scenes of graphic violence, excluding sexual content and nudity included in original versions shown on the main channel only at night) after 1:00 p.m. ET/PT.
Launched on August 1, 1991, HBO2 originally used a channel-specific version of the main HBO channel's then-current on-air look; by 1993, this was replaced with a spartan "program grid" layout during promotional breaks, similar to the visual appearance then used by thePrevue Channel(and subsequently applied by HBO 3 [now HBO Signature], Cinemax 2 [now MoreMax] and Cinemax 3 [now ActionMax]). The channel was rebranded asHBO Pluson October 1, 1998, concurrently adopting a distinct on-air look from the primary channel.[39]Since reversing the "HBO2" brand in September 2002, the channel has used minor variations of the main HBO channel's on-air identity.
Cinemax is an American pay television network owned by the Home Box Office, Inc. subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery. Originally developed as a companion service to HBO, the channel's programming consists of recent and some older theatrically released feature films, originalaction dramaseries, documentaries, and specialbehind-the-scenesfeaturettes. While Cinemax and HBO operate as separate premium services, their respective channel tiers are very frequently sold as a combined package by many multichannel television providers; however, customers have the option of subscribing to HBO and Cinemax's corresponding channel packages individually.
On August 1, 1980, HBO launched Cinemax, a companion movie-based premium channel created as a direct competitor to two existing movie-focused premium channels:The Movie Channel, then a smaller, standalone pay movie service owned by Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment (then part-owned by Warner Bros. Discovery predecessor Warner Communications), andHome Theater Network(HTN), a now-defunct service owned byGroup W Satellite Communicationsthat focused on G- and PG-rated films.[45]Cinemax succeeded in its early years partly because it relied on classic movie releases from the 1950s to the 1970s—with some more recent films mixed into its schedule—that it presented uncut and without commercial interruption, at a time when limitedheadendchannel capacity resulted in cable subscribers only being able to receive as many as three dozen channels (up to half of which were reserved for local and out-of-market broadcast stations, and public access channels). In most cases, cable operators tended to sell Cinemax and HBO as a singular premium bundle, usually offered at a discount for customers that decided to subscribe to both channels. Cinemax, unlike HBO, also maintained a 24-hour schedule from its launch, one of the first pay cable services to transmit around the clock.
Even early in its existence, Cinemax tried to diversify its programming beyond movies. Beginning in 1984, it incorporated music specials and some limited original programming (among them,SCTV ChannelandMax Headroom) into the channel's schedule. Around this time, Cinemax also began airing adult-orientedsoftcore pornographic films and series—containingstrong sexual contentand nudity—in varying late-night timeslots (usually no earlier than 11:30 p.m. Eastern and Pacific); this programming block, originally airing under the "Friday After Dark" banner (renamed "Max After Dark" in 2008 to better reflect its prior expansion to a nightly block), would become strongly associated with the channel among its subscribers and inpop culture. The channel began gradually scaling back its adult programming offerings in 2011, in an effort to shift focus towards its mainstream films and original programs, culminating in the removal of "Max After Dark" content from its linear and on-demand platforms in 2018, as part of a broader exit from the genre across Home Box Office, Inc.'s platforms.[46][47][44]In terms of mainstream programming, Cinemax began premiering original action series in the early 2010s, beginning with the August 2011 debut ofStrike Back(which has since become the channel's longest-running original program). As a consequence of WarnerMedia reallocating its programming resources toward the HBO Max streaming service, Cinemax eliminated scripted programming after the last of its remaining slate of action series ended in early 2021, shifting the channel back to its original structure as a movie-exclusive premium service.[47]
The linear Cinemax multiplex service, as of 2021[update], consists of the primary feed and seven thematic channels: MoreMax (launched in April 1991 as Cinemax 2, in conjunction with HBO2's rollout); ActionMax (originally launched as Cinemax 3 in 1995); ThrillerMax (launched in 1998);[35]MovieMax (originally launched as the female-targeted WMax in May 2001); Cinemáx (a Spanish language simulcast feed, which originally launched as the young adult-focused @Max in 2001), 5StarMax (launched in May 2001) and OuterMax (launched in May 2001).[48][49][50]
Magnolia Network is an American multinationalbasic cablenetwork owned byWarner Bros. DiscoveryandChip and Joanna Gaines, formerly known as DIY Network.
In April 2019, Discovery officially announced its new venture, and that its linear television component would launch sometime in 2020, replacing DIY Network, though it was delayed until 2022 due to theCOVID-19 pandemicimpacting the ability to produce the network's launch programming and ending up launching several months before the closing of the Warner Bros. and Discovery Inc. merger.[51]Due to the delay in production, some Magnolia Network programming debuted as part of the January 4, 2021, launch of theDiscovery+streaming service. The transition of the linear DIY Network to the Magnolia Network occurred on January 5, 2022.[52][53]In April 2022, Discovery Inc. merged with WarnerMedia to formWarner Bros. Discovery. On April 7, 2022, it was reported that after the completion of the merger, Magnolia Network leadership would report to HBO andHBO Max's chief content officer Casey Bloys rather than directly to Zaslav, nor Kathleen Finch (who previously oversaw Discovery's lifestyle brands, and now oversees most of Warner Bros. Discovery's U.S. cable networks);Deadlinesuggested the possibility that Magnolia Network could contribute content (such as library programs or original series) to HBO Max—noting that some of the service's scripted series have appealed to a similar adult female demographic to Magnolia Network, HBO Max's ownforays into unscripted content, and reports that the Gaines had shown interest in working on scripted projects.[54][55][56]
HBO HD (originally called HBO HDTV from March 1999 until April 2006) is ahigh definitionsimulcast feed of HBO that broadcasts in the1080iresolution format.[74]HBO maintains high definition simulcast feeds of its main channel and all six multiplex channels. HBO HD is available on all major cable television providers including, among others, Charter Communications (including systems once owned by former HBO sister company Time Warner Cable); Comcast Xfinity (which, in 2016, began downconverting HBO, Cinemax and other cable channels transmitting in 1080i to720p60);[75]Cox Communications andOptimum; as well asDirecTV;AT&T U-verse; andVerizon FiOS. From the 2008 rollout of HD simulcasts for the HBO multiplex feeds until the mid-2010s, the majority of pay television providers that carried HBO HD generally offered only the main channel in high definition, with HD carriage of the multiplex channels varying by market. As of 2020[update], most providers transmit all seven HBO multiplex channels in HD, either on a dedicated HD channel tier separate from their SD assignments or as hybrid SD/HD feeds.
Home Box Office, Inc. announced plans to launch a high-definition simulcast feed on June 12, 1997, with initial plans for a rollout to television providers as early as the Summer of 1998, when electronics manufacturers planned to begin retailing their initial line of HD-capable television sets.[76]HBO began transmitting a high definition simulcast feed on March 6, 1999, becoming the first American cable television network to begin simulcast their programming in the format. For the first 23 months of its existence, the HD feed only transmitted theatrical films from the network's programming suppliers (initially accounting for about 45% of its available feature film output, expanding to around 60% by early 2001) and HBO's in-house original movies in the format, as existing widescreen prints of those films were already scalable in the 16:9 widescreenaspect ratioand could readily be upconverted to HD resolution.[76][77]
Original programming began to be made available in HD on January 14, 2001, when the network commenced a 13-week Sunday "encore" presentation of the second season ofThe Sopranosin remastered 1080i HD. (HBO had been requiring the producers of its original series to film their episodes in widescreen—subsequently downconverted for the standard definition feed—to fit4:3television screens since 1996, to future-proof them for remastering in HD.) The third-season premiere of the mob drama, "Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood", on March 4 was the first first-run episode of an HBO series to be transmitted in high-definition from its initial telecast, with all subsequent episodes being delivered to HBO exclusively on HD videotape (and downconverted for the main standard-definition feed). Bob Zitter, then the network's Senior Vice President of Technology Operations, disclosed toMultichannel Newsin January 2001 that HBO elected to delay offering its original series in high definition until there was both sustainable consumer penetration of high-definition television sets and wide accessibility of HDTV equipment on the retail market.[78][79]Sports telecasts were upgraded to HD on September 25, 2004, with anHBO World Championship Boxingfight card headlined byRoy Jones Jr.andGlen Johnson.[80]HD programming can also be broadcast inDolby Digital 5.1. The network began transmitting its six multiplex channels in high definition on September 1, 2008, when DirecTV began offering HD simulcast feeds of HBO2, HBO Family, HBO Signature, and HBO Latino.[81]
HBO on Demand is HBO's companionsubscription video-on-demand(SVOD) service that is available at no additional cost to subscribers of the linear television service, who regularly pay a premium fee to pay television providers to receive access to the channel. VOD content from the network is also available on select virtual MVPD services (includingDirecTV Stream,YouTube TVandHulu), and through HBO's dedicatedRokuvideo channel. HBO on Demand offers theatrical feature films from HBO's distribution partners and original programming previously seen on the network (including weekly series, documentaries, sports magazine and documentary programs, and concert and stand-up comedy specials). The service's rotating program selection incorporates newer film titles and episodes that are added to the platform following their debut on the linear feed, as well as library content (including complete seasons of the network's past and present original programs).[82]
HBO on Demand, the first SVOD service to be offered by an American premium service, launched on July 1, 2001, over then sister company Time Warner Cable'sColumbia, South Carolina, system.[83]The service was developed to allow HBO subscribers access to the channel's programming at their choosing, thereby reducing the frequency in which viewers were unable to find a program they prefer to watch and limiting cancellations to the service because of that issue. On January 3, 2011, HBO became the first pay television network to offer VOD content in3D; initially available to linear HBO subscribers signed with Time Warner Cable, Comcast, and Verizon FiOS, 3D content consisted of theatrical feature films available in the format.[84]
In the United Kingdom, a domestic version of HBO on Demand was launched in 2015 to subscribers ofIPTVproviderTalkTalk TV, which provides HBO's program offerings through the provider'sYouViewset-top boxes via a standalone VOD subscription.[citation needed]
HBO Go is an internationalTV Everywherestreaming service for broadband subscribers of the linear HBO television service.
Content available on HBO Go, available on most operating systems, included theatrically released films (sourced from the network's pay television contractual windows for recent studio releases and from library content agreements with film distributors) and HBO original programming (including scripted series, made-for-cable movies, comedy specials, documentaries, and sports documentary and magazine programs).[85]HBO Go, along with companion service HBO Now and HBO Max, did not provide live simulcasts of the seven linear HBO channels. (HBO and Cinemax are the only American premium television services not to include live network feeds in their proprietary streaming VOD platforms.)
Based on the prototype HBO on Broadband service that was originally launched in January 2008 to linear HBO subscribers of Time Warner Cable'sGreen BayandMilwaukee, Wisconsin, systems, HBO Go launched nationwide on February 18, 2010, initially available to existing HBO subscribers signed withVerizon FiOS.[86]Initially carrying 1,000 hours of program content available for streaming in standard or high definition, the on-demand streaming service was conceived as a TV Everywhere platform marketed exclusively to existing subscribers of the linear HBO television service. (The HBO Go website and mobile apps, including its apps for streaming devices such as Roku and Apple TV, and somevideo game consoles, required a password accompanying a linear HBO subscription by a participating television provider to access content on the service.)
On June 12, 2020, WarnerMedia announced that HBO Go's mobile anddigital media playerapps would be discontinued in the U.S. on July 31, as most traditional and virtual MVPDs have secured distribution deals for HBO Max. Those providers that have not yet made an HBO Max deal continue to allow customer access to HBO Go (mainlyAltice USA's brands,Mediacom, smaller cable providers, and closed-circuit university television systems which had not had personnel available during theCOVID-19 pandemicto contractually transfer their credentials to HBO Max), though only through the HBO Go desktop website. The "HBO Go" moniker remains in use as the brand for HBO's streaming platforms in select Asian markets until it was also rebranded directly intoMaxon November 19, 2024.[87][88][89]
HBO Now (formally named HBO from August to December 2020) was anOver-the-top media servicethat provided on-demand access to HBO's library of original programming and theatrical films, and was marketed independent of a pay television subscription to the linear HBO service as a standalone platform targetingcord cutters, available on most operating systems.[90]
On October 15, 2014, HBO announced plans to launch an OTT subscription streaming service in 2015, which would be distributed as a standalone offering that does not require an existing television subscription to access the content.[91][92][93]
HBO Now was unveiled on March 9, 2015, and launched on April 7, 2015.[90][94][95]The service was initially available via Apple Inc. to Apple TV and iOS devices for a three-month exclusivity period following its formal launch, before becoming available for subscription through other participatingInternet service providers.[90]Available for $15 per month, HBO Now was identical to the former HBO Go in terms of content and features. New episodes of the HBO series were made available for streaming on the initial airdate and usually uploaded at the normal airtime, of their original broadcast on the main linear HBO channel.[96]By February 2019, subscribership of HBO Now subscribers had reached over 8  million customers.[97]On June 12, 2020, WarnerMedia announced that HBO Now would be rebranded solely as HBO on August 1. Following HBO Max's launch, the HBO streaming service had served as the network's default OTT platform for Roku customers, as WarnerMedia has not yet signed deals to distribute HBO Max on that platform; until its replacement by HBO Max on those platforms in November 2020, it also served as a default HBO OTT service for Amazon Fire and Fire TV customers.[87]As a consequence of an agreement with WarnerMedia announced the day before offering HBO Max on Roku devices starting the following day, the HBO streaming service was discontinued on December 17, 2020.[98]
Max (formerly known as HBO Max) is an over-the-top subscription streaming service operated by Warner Bros. Discovery Global Streaming and Interactive Entertainment built mainly around HBO's programming and other Warner Bros. Discovery assets.
HBO's programming schedule currently consists largely of theatrically released feature films and adult-oriented original series (including, as of November 2023[update], dramas such asEuphoria,Industry,The Gilded Age,House of the Dragon,The Last of Us, andTrue Detective; comedies such asCurb Your EnthusiasmandThe Righteous Gemstones; and topical satiresLast Week Tonight with John OliverandReal Time with Bill Maher). In addition, HBO also carries documentary films (mainly produced through its in-house production unit HBO Documentary Films), sports-focused documentary and magazine series (produced through its HBO Sports production unit), occasional original made-for-TV movies, occasional original concert and stand-up comedy specials, and short-form behind-the-scenes specials centered mainly on theatrical films (either running in their initial theatrical or HBO/Cinemax broadcast window). Newer episodes of most HBO original programs usually air over its main channel after 9:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time; depending partly on the day's programming schedule, repeats of original series, made-for-cable movies, and documentaries (typically excluding programs with graphic violent or sexual content) are shown during the daytime hours on the main channel, and at various times on HBO's themed channels. Four of the themed multiplex channels—HBO Signature, HBO Family, HBO Comedy, and HBO Zone—also each carry archived HBO original series and specials dating to the 1990s. (Outside of HBO Family, which regularly airs archived family-oriented series and specials, airings of older original programs may vary based on the channel's daily schedule.)[99]
Beginning with its programming expansion to afternoons in 1974, the primary HBO channel had imposed a longstandingwatershed policyprohibiting films assigned an"R" ratingfrom being broadcast before 8:00 p.m. ET/PT. (At various points, HBO also prohibited showings of X-/NC-17-rated and foreignart films.)[100][101][102]The policy—which extended to films shown between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. ET/PT, when HBO began offering 24-hour programming on weekends in September 1981—may have once stemmed from HBO's pre-mid-2000s availability on analog cable tiers (whereas its multiplex channels generally require adigital cablesubscription or at least scrambling), and, because of controversy surrounding daytime showings of R-rated films that began being scheduled on competing premium services as early as 1980, remained in place well after theV-chipbecame standard in newer television sets.[103]From April 1979 to March 1987, rating bumpers preceding HBO telecasts of R-rated films included a special disclaimer indicating to viewers that the movie would air exclusively during the designated watershed period ("Home Box Office/HBO will show this feature only at night"). The watershed policy was extended to cover TV-MA-rated programs when theTV Parental Guidelineswere implemented industry-wide on January 1, 1997, although HBO had already been withholding airing original programs incorporating mature content that would now qualify for a TV-MA rating outside the watershed period.[104]
As of 2025[update], HBO no longer employs the watershed policy, allowing R-rated movies to air in selected morning and afternoon timeslots on its main channel. The policy began to be weakened in January 2010, when the main HBO channel started allowing original series, movies, and documentaries given a TV-MA rating for strong profanity or non-graphic violence to air during the daytime on Saturdays and Sundays; in January 2012, HBO began offering occasional Sunday daytime airings of R-rated films within its weekly encore showing of the Saturday movie premiere (airing as early as 4:00 p.m. ET/PT, depending on the previous night's scheduled premiere film, that film's length, and the Sunday night block of HBO original series that usually follows the rebroadcast); by 2017, afternoon R-rated movie airings (which occasionally have been shown as early as 2:00 p.m. ET/PT since then) were permitted in random afternoon timeslots any day of the week on the main channel at the network's discretion. Most of the six HBO thematic multiplex channels—except for HBO Family, which prohibits programming containing either equivalent rating by the effect of the channel's target audience and format[105]—air TV-MA and R-rated programming during morning and afternoon periods. HBO also does not typically allow most NC-17-rated films to be aired on the primary channel or its multiplex channels.[citation needed]
HBO pioneered thefree previewconcept—now a standard promotional tool in the pay television industry—in 1973, as a marketing strategy allowing participating television providers to offer a sampling of HBO's programming for potential subscribers of the service.[106]Cable providers were permitted to offer the unscrambled HBO content—aired for a single evening or, beginning in 1981 at the network level (as early as 1978 on some providers), over a two-day weekend (later extended to three days in 1997, then to a Friday-to-Monday "four-day weekend" format by 2008)—over a local origination channel, though satellite and digital cable providers elected instead to unencrypt the channels corresponding to each HBO feed for the preview period.[107]
Until 2002, interstitials hosted by on-air presenters (notably including, among others,Norm Crosby,Greg Kinnear,SinbadandEllen DeGeneres) promoting the service and its upcoming programs to prospective subscribers aired alongside on-air promotions between programs during the preview weekend, although interstitials produced in-house or by third-party producers were inserted by some providers over the HBO feed during promo breaks for their local or regional audience; from September 1988 to September 1994, the network also aired a 15-minute-long promotional "free preview show" each night of the preview event—usually following the headlining prime time film—that previewed upcoming HBO programming for prospective and existing subscribers. HBO offers between three and five preview events each year—normally scheduled to coincide with the premiere of a new or returning original series, and in the past, a high-profile special or feature film—to pay television providers for distribution on a voluntary participation basis.[108](The total of participating providers that elected to offer a free preview event varies depending on the given preview period, and participating multiple-system cable operators may elect to carry the event only in certain regions where they provide service.)
HBO also produces short segments promoting newer movies with the cooperation of the film studios that hold distribution rights to the projects (almost universally by studios maintaining exclusive pay television contracts with HBO and Cinemax, and which have been rebroadcast on the former during a film's pay-cable distribution window), and have usually consisted of either interstitial "behind-the-scenes" and interview segments on an upcoming/recent theatrical release orred carpetcoverage. Currently, these segments air under theHBO First Lookseries of 15-to-20-minute-long documentary-style interstitial specials, which debuted in 1992 and has no set airing schedule. (Since 2010, the "making of" specials, for which HBO officially no longer uses theFirst Lookname, are only identified under the banner forprogram listingidentification.) The network previously produced three-to-five-minute-long feature segments that aired during longer-duration between-program promotional breaks,HBO News(1988–2011; formerly titledHBO Entertainment Newsfrom 1988 to 2007) andHBO Behind the Scenes(1982–1992). The interstitials—particularly those aired as episodes ofFirst Look—have also frequently been included as bonus features on DVD andBlu-rayreleases of the profiled films. Since 2011, HBO no longer airs "behind-the-scenes" interstitials during promotional breaks, and has reduced airings ofFirst Lookto a few episodes per year as the network has honed its focus on higher-profile original programs and studios have increasingly limited their self-produced "making of" featurettes for exclusive physical and digital media release.[citation needed]
During the network's early years, HBO aired other interstitials in-between programs. Originally billed asSomething Short and Special, around 1980,InterMissions(as the interstitials were begun to be called in September 1978) was bannered into two groupings:Video Jukebox, a showcase of music videos from various artists (eventually separated from the other intermission shorts and given various long-form spinoffs, also titled asVideo Jukeboxor variants thereof), andSpecial, showcasing short films. By 1984, the short segments had mainly been limited to comedic film shorts (originally branded asHBO Comedy Shortsand then asHBO Short Takes, which used a set of differing animated intros) and youth-targeted live action and animated short films seen largely before and during family-oriented programming (branded asHBO Shorts for Kids). Intermission shorts had largely vanished from the channel by 1988. Since 2014, HBO has occasionally aired short films ranging between 15 and 25 minutes in length at varying times each week during the overnight/early morning hours on its primary and select multiplex channels, in addition to being available on demand via HBO's various streaming and television VOD platforms (including its dedicated portal on HBO Max).
HBO innovatedoriginal entertainment programmingfor cable television networks, in which a television series (both dramatic and comedic), made-for-television movie, or entertainment special is developed for and production is primarily, if not exclusively, handled by the channel of its originating broadcast. Since 1973, the network has produced a variety of original programs alongside its slate of theatrical motion pictures. Most of these programs cater to adult viewers (and, with limited exceptions, are typically assignedTV-MA ratings), often featuring—with such content varying by program—high amounts of profanity, violence, sexual themes or nudity thatbasic cableor over-the-air broadcast channels would be reticent to air because of objections from sponsors and the risk of them pulling or refusing to sell their advertising depending on the objectionable material that a sponsor is comfortable placing their advertising. (Incidentally, since the early 2000s, some ad-supported basic cable channels—likeFXandComedy Central—have incorporated stronger profanity, somewhat more pervasive violence and sexual themes, and occasional nudity in their original programs, similar to the content featured in original programs shown on HBO and other premium services, with relatively limited advertiser issues.)
Mainly because it is not beholden to the preferences of advertisers, HBO has long been regarded in the entertainment industry for letting program creators maintain fullcreative autonomyover their projects, allowing them to depict gritty subject matter that—before basic cable channels and streaming services deciding to follow the model set by HBO and other pay cable services—had not usually been shown on other television platforms. During the "Executive Actions" symposium held byThe Washington PostandGeorge Washington Universityin April 2015 (shortly after the launch of the HBO Now streaming service), then-HBO CEO Richard Plepler said that he does not want the network to be akin toNetflixin which users "binge watch" its television shows and film content, saying "I don't think it would have been a great thing for HBO or our brand if that had been gobbled up in the first week[..] I think it was very exciting for the viewer to have that mystery held out for an extended period." Pleper cited that he felt that binge-watching does not correlate with the culture of HBO and HBO watchers.[109]
Some of its original programs, however, have been aimed at families or children, primarily those produced before 2001 (through its original programming division and third-party producers both American and foreign) and from 2016 to 2020 (under its agreement with Sesame Workshop); children's programs that have aired on HBO have includedSesame Street,Fraggle Rock,Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child,A Little Curious,Crashbox,Babar,HBO Storybook Musicals,Lifestories: Families in Crisis,Dear AmericaandThe Little Lulu Showas well as acquisitions includingThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz,The Legend of White Fang,Shakespeare: The Animated Tales,Animated Hero ClassicsandThe Country Mouse and the City Mouse Adventures. Beginning in 2001, most of the family- or kid-oriented programs had migrated to HBO Family, with only a limited amount of newer family-oriented series being produced for either the primary channel or HBO Family since. (HBO Family continued to maintain a limited slate of original children's programming until 2003.)
HBO ventured back into children's programming with its acquisition of first-run broadcast and streaming rights toSesame Street, a long-running children's television series that had previously aired on the program's longtime broadcaster,PBS(and itsmorning block), for the vast majority of its run, in a five-year programming and development deal withSesame Workshopthat was announced in August 2015. Although struck with the intent to have the show remain on PBS in some fashion, the nonprofitproduction companyreached the deal due to cutbacks resulting from declines in public and private donations, distribution fees paid by PBS member stations, and licensing for merchandise sales. Through the agreement, HBO obtained first-run television rights toSesame Street, beginning with the January 2016 debut of its 46th season (with episodes being distributed to PBS, following a nine-month exclusivity window at no charge to its member stations); Sesame Workshop also produced original children's programming content for the channel, which also gained exclusive streaming rights to the company's programming library for HBO Go and HBO Now (assuming those rights fromAmazon Video,Netflixand Sesame Workshop's in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, the latter of which will cease to operate as a standalone offering).[110][111][112][113][114]With the debut of HBO Max in May 2020, under contract renewal terms agreed upon between the studio and WarnerMedia in October 2019,Sesame Streetand other Sesame Workshop content will shift from the linear television service to the streaming-based HBO Max later in the year.[111]
On average, movies occupy between 14 and 18 hours of the daily schedule on HBO and HBO2 (or as little as 12 hours on the latter, depending upon if HBO2 is scheduled to carry an extended "catch-up" marathon of an HBO original series), and up to 20 hours per day—depending on channel format—on its five thematic multiplex channels.
Since June 6, 1992, HBO has offered weekly pay television premieres of recent theatrical and original made-for-cable movies on Saturdays at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT. (Event presentations that have followed the movie—such as boxing coverage or concerts—have caused rare variances in the preceding film's start time; if a live event was scheduled, before the December 2018 discontinuation of HBO's boxing telecasts, the premiered film would air after the event—in reverse order from the Eastern feed scheduling—on the Pacific Time Zone feed.) From June 1996 until September 2006, the presentations were marketed as the "Saturday Night Guarantee" to denote a promise of "a new movie [premiering] every Saturday night" all 52 weeks of the year. (HBO had highlighted said "guarantee" in promotions for the Saturday premiere night dating to January 1994.) Before settling on having Saturday serve as its anchor premiere night, the scheduling of HBO's prime-time film premieres varied between Saturday, Sunday, and Wednesday, depending on competition from broadcast fare during the traditional network television season. First-run theatrical films debut on average from ten months to one year after a film's initial theatrical run has concluded, and no more than six months after their DVD or digital VOD download release.[115][116][117]COVID-19-relatedpostponements of newer theatrical releasesby its distribution partners caused HBO to reduce the frequency of scheduled theatrical premieres in September 2020; since then, the Saturday 8:00 slot has been occupied by premieres of original specials and documentaries (scheduled at least once per month) and, since late December 2020, airings of older hit movies (mainly films released between 1979 and 2015) distributed under library content deals during gap weeks in the monthly premiere schedule.
As of 2024, HBO and sister channel Cinemax (as well as their associated streaming platforms) maintain exclusive licensing agreements to first-run and library film content from the following studios and their related subsidiaries:
HBO also maintains sub-run agreements—covering television and streaming licensing of films that have previously received broadcast or syndicated television airings—for theatrical films distributed byParamount Pictures(including content from subsidiaries or acquired library partnersMiramax,Carolco Pictures,MTV Films,Nickelodeon MoviesandRepublic Pictures, all for films released prior to 2013),Universal Pictures(including content from subsidiariesUniversal Animation Studios,DreamWorks Animation,Working Title Films,Illumination, andFocus Features, all for films released prior to 2022),Summit Entertainment(for films released prior to 2023),Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures(including content fromWalt Disney Pictures,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures(except films co-produced byPixar), and former subsidiariesTouchstone Pictures, andHollywood Pictures, all for films released prior to 2023),Sony Pictures Entertainment(including content from subsidiaries/library partnersColumbia Pictures,Sony Pictures Classics,ELP Communications,Morgan Creek Entertainment,Screen Gems,Revolution Studios, and former HBO sister companyTriStar Pictures), andAmazon MGM Studios(including content from subsidiariesMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer,Orion Pictures,United Artists, and former subsidiariesThe Cannon Group, andThe Samuel Goldwyn Company).
HBO also produces made-for-cable television movies through a sister production unitHBO Films, which traces its origins to the 1983 founding of HBO Premiere Films. Originally developed to produce original television movies and miniseries with higher budgets and production values than other telefilms, the film unit's first original movie project was the 1983 biopicThe Terry Fox Story. Differing from other direct-to-cable television films, most of HBO's original movies have been helmed by major film actors (such asJames Stewart,Michael Douglas,Drew Barrymore,Stanley Tucci,Halle BerryandElizabeth Taylor). The unit—which would be rechristened HBO Pictures in 1985—expanded beyond its telefilm slate, which was scaled back to focus on independent film production in 1984.[122][123]The current HBO Films unit was formed in October 1999 through the consolidation of HBO Pictures andHBO NYC Productions(created as HBO Showcase in 1986, and following its June 1996 restructuring, had also occasionally produced drama series for the network).[124][125][126][127]Since 1984, HBO Films has also maintained an exclusive licensing agreement with HBO (later expanded to include Cinemax) for theatrical productions produced by the unit and, since HBO became co-owned with the film division through the 1989 Time-Warner merger, distributed through Warner Bros. Entertainment.
Films to which HBO maintains traditional telecast and streaming rights will usually also be shown on the Cinemax television and streaming platforms during their licensing agreement period (either after a film title completes its HBO window or transfers between services over certain months during the contractual period). Feature films from the aforementioned studios that maintain joint licensing contracts encompassing both services will typically make their premium television debut on HBO approximately two to three months before their premiere on Cinemax and vice versa.
HBO's relationship with Warner Bros. began with a five-year distribution agreement signed in June 1986, encompassing films released between January 1987 and December 1992; the estimated cost of the initial pay-cable rights was between $300 million and $600 million, depending on the overall performance of Warner's films and HBO/Cinemax's respective subscriber counts. Although the Warner deal was initially non-exclusive, a preemptive strategy if its co-owned rivalsShowtimeand The Movie Channel (which elected not to pick up any spare Warner titles) sought full exclusivity over movie rights, the terms gave Warner an option to require HBO to acquire exclusive rights to titles covered under the remainder of the deal for $60 million per year (in addition to a guaranteed $65 million fee for each year of the contract).[118][128]As a result of the 1989 Time-Warner merger, HBO and Cinemax hold pay-cable exclusivity over all newer Warner Bros. films for the duration of their joint ownership.
HBO and HBO Max initially reached a pay television and streaming rights deal with A24 (which had partnered with HBO to produce selected original series and specials since 2017, beginning with the comedy specialJerrod Carmichael: 8) on July 18, 2022, which gave them library rights to the independent studio's 2013–2021 releases.[121]On December 6, 2023, as part of a broader agreement that extended the studio's library content deal with both Warner Bros. Discovery-owned platforms, A24 announced it had entered into a multi-year output deal to distribute its films on HBO and Max following their theatrical release; the deal succeeded a pay-one exclusivity agreement that A24 had maintained with Showtime since 2019, which concluded at the end of 2023.[120][129]
Being the first pay-cable service to go national, for many years, HBO was advantageous in acquiring film licensing rights from major and independent studios; until Showtime, The Movie Channel, and other premium channels started beefing up their movie product to compete with HBO in the early 1980s, HBO's dominance in the pay-cable led to complaints from many motion picture companies of the network holding monopoly power in the pay cable industry and a disproportionate advantage in film acquisition negotiations.[130]During the early years of premium cable, the major American movie studios often sold the pay television rights to an individual theatrical film title to multiple "maxi-pay" and "mini-pay" services—often including HBO and later, Cinemax—resulting in frequent same-month scheduling duplication amongst the competing services. From its launch as a regional service, HBO purchased broadcast rights to theatrical movies on a per-title basis. The network pioneered the pay television industry practice, known as a "pre-buy", of buying the pay-cable rights to a movie from its releasing studio before it started filming, in exchange for agreeing to pay a specified share of a film's production costs; this allowed HBO to maintain exclusivity over film output arrangements and to save money allocated for film acquisitions.[131]In June 1976, it signed a four-year exclusive deal withColumbia Picturesfor a package of 20 films released between January 1977 and January 1981, in exchange for then-parent company Time, Inc. committing a $5-million production financing investment with Columbia over between 12 and 18 months.[132][58]
Although HBO executives were reluctant at first to strike such arrangements, by the mid-1980s, the channel had transitioned to exclusive film output deals (now the standard among North American premium channels), in which a film studio licenses all or a proportion of their upcoming productions to a partner service over a multi-year contract. In 1983, HBO entered into three exclusive licensing agreements tied to production financing arrangements involving Tri-Star Pictures (formed as a co-production venture between Time, Inc./HBO, Columbia, and CBS Inc.), Columbia Pictures (an exclusivity-based contract extension initially covering 50% of the studio's pre-June 1986 releases with a non-compete option to purchase additional Columbia titles) andOrion Pictures(encompassing a package of 30 films, in return for financial participation and a $10-million securities investment; the deal was indirectly associated with Orion's buyout ofFilmwaysthe year prior, in which HBO bought pay television rights to the studio's films). All three deals were approved under aU.S. Department of Justicereview greenlighting the Tri-Star venture in June of that year. (The Tri-Star deal became non-exclusive in January 1988, although Showtime elected not to acquire titles from HBO's film rights lessees.)[133][134][135]After the exclusive contract transferred to Showtime in January 1994, in July 1995, HBO preemptively signed a five-year deal with the studio that took effect in January 2000, in conjunction with a five-year extension of its existing deal with Columbia Pictures. (Columbia and TriStar's respective output deals with HBO ended on December 31, 2004, whenSony Picturestransferred exclusive pay-cable rights for their films to Starz—which as of May 2020[update], holds rights to televise all recent releases from either studio through December 2021, after which in January 2022, under a five-year agreement signed in April 2021, Netflix will assume pay television rights to its newer Sony films—after HBO declined a request by Columbia during contract negotiations to allow the studio to experimentally distribute its theatrical films via streaming video during its contract window.)[136][137][138][139][140][141]
In February 1983, HBO signed an agreement withSilver Screen Partners(a now-defunct joint venture between HBO, Silver Screen Management,Thorn EMIandThe Cannon Group), in which HBO had right of first refusal in the film selection and received 5% of all profits derived from non-pay-cable distribution of the studio's films; the Silver Screen agreement concluded upon the studio's cessation in 1998.[142]In early 1984, HBO abandoned the exclusivity practice, citing internal research that concluded that subscribers showed indifference to efforts by premium channels to secure rights to studios' full slate of recently released films from to distinguish their programming due toVHSavailability preceding pay-cable distribution in the release window. This change came after the firing of then-HBO chairmanFrank Biondi, reportedly for having "overextended the network in pre-buy and exclusive movie deals" as subscribership of pay-cable services declined. Biondi's replacement, Michael J. Fuchs, structured some of the subsequent deals as non-exclusive to allow HBO to divert more funding toward co-producing made-for-cable movies, other original programming, and theatrical joint ventures (via Tri-Star and Silver Screen Partners).[143][144][59]In July 1986, the network had signed a three-year output deal withNew World Pictures, whereas HBO would receive up to 75 New World films Showtime won't, which cost $50 million to sign a deal.[145]On August 8, 1986, HBO had inked a non-exclusive agreement withLorimar-Telepicturesto enable a package of various Lorimar-Telepictures theatrical films up to 1989, and Lorimar-Telepictures would be involved as a production partner on several made-for-HBO television movies, in exchange for worldwide distribution rights, excluding pay television, and the current plans for the agreement enables five to six films per year from Lorimar-Telepictures.[146]
In September 1986, the network signed a five-year agreement with MGM/UA Communications Co. for a package of up to 72 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer andUnited Artistsfilms.[147]Also that month, HBO signed a pay cable and home video agreement with film producerKings Road Entertainment, which will serve eight films, with the home video rights being assigned to subsidiaryHBO/Cannon Video, and the first film under the eight-picture agreement between HBO and Kings Road would beTouch & Go, and will cost $65-$70 million.[148]In November 1986, HBO signed an agreement withDe Laurentiis Entertainment Groupfor films that ran between 1987 and 1990, along with a three-year home video rights contract for sister label HBO/Cannon Video.[149]In December 1986, HBO signed a pact with Soviet Union producer Poseidon Films, to cover Soviet-based films that covered a non-specific timespan, with the network controlling US and Canada rights.[150]In July 1987, HBO signed a five-year, $500-million deal for exclusive rights to 85 Paramount Pictures films to have been tentatively released between May 1988 and May 1993. (This solidified an existing alliance with Paramount dating to 1979, for the non-exclusive rights to the studio's films.) Though this contract would herald the end of its embargo on new film exclusivity deals, HBO's then-CEO Michael Fuchs cited Showtime–The Movie Channel parentViacom(which, at the time, had debt in excess of $2.4 billion) for it having to obtain exclusivity for the Paramount package, which the studio approached HBO directly to bid.[151][152][153][154]The Paramount package remained with HBO/Cinemax until December 1997; Showtime assumed the pay-cable rights to the studio's films in January 1998, under a seven-year deal reached as a byproduct of Viacom's 1994 purchase of Paramount from Paramount Communications, and held them until December 2008. (Shared rivalEpix—created as a consortium between Paramount/Viacom, Lionsgate, and now-sole owner MGM—took over pay television rights upon that network's October 2009 launch.)[155][156]
In March 1995, HBO signed a ten-year deal with the then-upstartDreamWorks SKGvalued at between $600 million and $1 billion, depending on the total output of films and generated revenue during the contract, covering the studio's tentative releases between January 1996 and December 2006.[157][158][159]By result of the 2004 spin-off of its animation armDreamWorks Animationinto a standalone company, DreamWorks' pay-cable distribution rights were split up into separate contracts: in March 2010, Showtime acquired the rights to live-action films from the original DreamWorks studio (coinciding with the transfer of co-production agreement from Paramount Pictures toTouchstone Pictures, then a Showtime distribution partner) for five years, effective January 2011.[160]Then in September 2011, after HBO agreed to waive the last two years of its contract, Netflix acquired the DreamWorks Animation contract effective upon the December 2012 expiration of the HBO deal. (Before the 2015 launch of HBO Now, HBO required its studio output partners to suspend digital sales of their movies during their exclusive contractual window with the network; the Netflix deal was not subject to any distribution restrictions, allowing DreamWorks Animation to continue the re-sale of its films through digital download via third-party providers.)[161][162]
20th Century Fox first signed a non-exclusive deal with HBO in January 1986, covering Fox films released between 1985 and 1988, along with a production co-financing agreement involving HBO original programs; the pact transitioned to an exclusivity arrangement with the 1988 renewal.[163][164][165]The first-run film output agreement with Fox was renewed by HBO for ten years on August 15, 2012 (with a provision allowing the studio to release its films through digital platforms such asiTunesandAmazon Videoduring the channel's term of license of an acquired film for the first time).[166]WhileThe Walt Disney Companycompleted its acquisition of 20th Century Fox in March 2019, Disney maintains an output deal with its in-house streaming servicesDisney+andHulufor films produced or distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and its subsidiaries (which have not distributed their films over a traditional pay-cable service since the studio's agreement with HBO rivalStarzended in 2015). Disney continued to honor the output deal with HBO until November 2021, when WarnerMedia and Disney announced that the deal would be expanded to the end of 2022, with an amendment that would allow half of 20th Century Studios' 2022 slate to be shared between HBO or HBO Max and Disney+ or Hulu during the pay-one window beginning withRon's Gone Wrong.[167]
HBO's relationship with Universal first began in March 1984, when it signed a six-year non-exclusivity deal with the studio; in April 1990, Universal elected to sign a deal with CBS for the licensing rights to a package of the studio's ten 1989 releases, bypassing the traditional pay-cable window.[168][169][170]The current Universal output deal—which began as an eight-year agreement that originally lasted through December 2010, assuming the studio's pay-cable rights from Starz—was renewed for ten years on January 6, 2013; the current deal gives HBOright of first refusalover select Universal titles, allowing the studio to exercise an option to license co-distributed live-action films to Showtime and animated films to Netflix if HBO elects not to obtain pay television rights to a particular film. (Universal put a 50% cap on title acquisitions for the first year of the initial 2003–10 contract, intending to split the rights between HBO and Starz as consolation for the latter outbidding HBO for the Sony Pictures output deal.)[140][171]On July 6, 2021, Universal Filmed Entertainment Group announced it would begin releasing its theatrical films onPeacockafter its exclusivity agreement with HBO concludes at the end of 2021, under a fragmented window (starting within 120 days of a film's theatrical release) through which Peacock will hold exclusive rights to Universal titles in bookending four-month windows at the beginning and end of the 18-month pay-one distribution period.[172][173]Subsequently,Amazon(on July 8) and Starz (on July 16) signed separate multi-year sub-licensing agreements, in which Universal films would stream on Prime Video andIMDb TVin a 10-month non-exclusivity window during the middle of the period and air on Starz's linear and streaming platforms following the Peacock/Amazon windows; HBO will continue to release Universal's 2021 film slate under their existing contracts through 2022, while Netflix will continue to offer the studio's animated films thereafter.[174][175][176]
The first-run output deal with Summit Entertainment—which initially ran through December 2017, and replaced Showtime (which had exclusive rights to its films from January 2008 until December 2012) as the studio's pay-cable output partner when it initially went into effect in 2013—was renewed by HBO for an additional four years on March 1, 2016. (Summit is currently the only "mini-major" movie studio and the only studio not among the five core majors that maintains an exclusive output deal with HBO.)[177]On March 2, 2021, it was announced that the deal with HBO through to the end of 2022 expires.[178][179][180]
Other film studios which formerly maintained first-run pay-cable contracts with HBO have includedAmerican Film Theatre(non-exclusive, 1975–1977),[181]Walt Disney Productions(non-exclusive, 1978–1982),[182][183]The Samuel Goldwyn Company(non-exclusive, 1979–1986),[184]ITC Entertainment(non-exclusive, 1982–1990), New World Pictures (non-exclusive, 1982–1986),PolyGram Filmed Entertainment(non-exclusive, 1984–1989),Hemdale Film Corporation(non-exclusive, 1982–1986; exclusive, 1987–1991)[185]De Laurentiis Entertainment Group(non-exclusive, 1988–1991)[186]Lorimar Film Entertainment(non-exclusive, 1987–1990),[187]Hemdale Film Corporation(non-exclusive, 1982–1986) andSavoy Pictures(exclusive, 1992–1997).[188]
Alongside feature-length movies and other types of original programming, HBO has produced originalentertainment specialsthroughout its existence. Five months after its launch, on March 23, 1973, the service aired its first non-sports entertainment special, the Pennsylvania Polka Festival, a three-hour-long music event broadcast from theAllentown Fairgroundsin Allentown, Pennsylvania.[189][190][191]
The network has cultivated a reputation for itsstand-up comedyspecials, which have helped raise the profile of established comedians (includingGeorge Carlin,Alan King,Rodney Dangerfield,Billy CrystalandRobin Williams) and served as the launchpad for emerging comic stars (such asDennis Miller,Whoopi Goldberg,Chris Rock,Roseanne Barr,Patton Oswalt,Margaret ChoandDave Chappelle), many of whom have gone on to television and film careers. HBO premieres between five and seven comedy specials per year on average, usually making their initial broadcast in late Saturday prime time, following its weekly movie premiere presentation.[citation needed]Regular comedy specials on HBO began on December 31, 1975, with the premiere ofAn Evening withRobert Klein, the first of nine HBO stand-up specials that the comic headlined over 35 years. Positive viewer response to the special led to the creation ofOn Location, a monthly anthology series that presented a stand-up comedian's nightclub performance in its entirety and uncut; it premiered on March 20, 1976, with a performance byDavid Steinberg.[132][192]HBO's stand-up comedy offerings would eventually expand with theHBO Comedy Hour, which debuted on August 15, 1987, withMartin Mull: Live fromNorth Ridgeville, a variety-comedy special headlined by Mull that featured a mix of on-stage and pre-filmed sketches.[193]TheComedy Hourtypically maintained a virtually identical concept asOn Location, taking that program's place as HBO's flagship stand-up series and ultimately resulting inOn Location's phase-out after a 13-year run, ending with the premiere ofBilly Crystal: Midnight Train to Moscowon October 21, 1989. A spin-off, theHBO Comedy Half-Hour, airing from June 16, 1994 (with the inaugural specialChris Rock: Big Ass Jokes) until January 23, 1998, maintained a short-form format in which the special's featured comedian presented their routine—usually recorded live atThe Fillmorein San Francisco—only for 30 minutes.
George Carlin headlined the most comedy specials for the network, making 12 appearances between 1977 and 2008; his first,On Location: George Carlin at USC(aired on September 1, 1977), featured Carlin's first televised performance of his classic routine, "The Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television".[191]As other cable channels incorporated comedy specials due to their inexpensive format, HBO began to model its strategy with its comedy specials after its music programming, focusing on a few specials each year featuring popular comedians. (HBO stopped billing its comedy specials under theComedy Hourbanner after the February 6, 1999, premiere of the Carlin-headlinedYou Are All Diseased.)[191]The network's library of comedy specials would become part of the initial programming inventories of two comedy-focused basic cable networks started by HBO through Time Inc./Time Warner,The Comedy Channel(launched on November 15, 1989) and its successor,Comedy Central(launched on April 1, 1991, as a consolidation of The Comedy Channel and Viacom-ownedHa!).
At irregular intervals between 1986 and 2010, HBO served as the primary broadcaster ofComic Relief USA'sfundraising specials to help health and welfare assistance programs focused onAmerica's homeless population. Developed by Comic Relief founderBob Zmudain conjunction with former HBO executiveChris Albrecht, all eleven HBO editions of the fundraisers aired between the aforementioned years (out of the 15 produced by the charity over its 24-year existence) was hosted by Williams, Crystal, and Goldberg, featuring performances by stand-up comedians,improvisational comicsandimpressionists, and appearances by celebrities and politicians as well as documentary segments showing issues affecting the homeless. HBO and other sponsors handled all or most of the incurred costs of the Comic Relief events to ensure that money raised or contributed is distributed to the charity.[194]
Concert-based music specials are occasionally produced for the channel, featuring major recording artists performing in front of a live audience. One of HBO's first successful specials wasThe Fabulous Bette Midler Show,[note 3]a stage special featuringMidlerperforming music and comedy routines, which debuted on June 19, 1976. It served as the linchpin for the creation ofStanding Room Only, a monthly series featuring concerts and various stage "spectaculars" (including among others,burlesqueshows,Vaudevilleroutines,ventriloquismand magic performances) taped live in front of an audience;SROpremiered on April 17, 1977 (withAnn Corio's 'This Was Burlesque'as inaugural broadcast).[195]For a time in the early 1980s, HBO produced a concert special almost every other month, featuring major music stars such asBoy Georgeandthe Who. AfterMTV's successful rollout in 1981, theStanding Room Onlyseries began to produce fewer concerts, eventually ending on May 24, 1987 (with the premiere of theLiza Minnelliconcert specialLiza in London); HBO's concert telecasts also began to focus more on "world class" music events featuring artists such asElton John,Whitney Houston,Tina TurnerandBarbra Streisand, as well as fundraisers such asFarm Aid.[191]Michael Jackson: Live inBucharest, recorded on the first leg of his 1992–93Dangerous World Tour, holds the record as HBO's highest-rated special with 3.7  million viewers (21.4 rating/34 share) watching the October 10, 1992, premiere telecast. The special is also believed to be the largest financial deal for a televised concert performance on television, with estimates from music industry executives indicating that HBO paid around $20  million for the rights.[196][197]In recent years, concert specials have had an increasingly marginal role among HBO's television specials, limited to an occasional marquee event or the annual induction ceremony of theRock and Roll Hall of Fame.
HBO broadcasts sports-related magazine and documentary series produced by HBO Sports, an in-house production division managed by Warner Bros. Discovery Sports (previously through Time Warner Sports from 1990 to 2018) that also produced selected sports event telecasts for the channel from its November 1972 launch until December 2018. HBO Sports has been headed by several well-known television executives over the years, including its founder Steve Powell (later head of programming atESPN), Dave Meister (later head of theTennis Channel), Seth Abraham (later head ofMSG Network),[191]andRoss Greenburg.
As HBO was being developed, the Time Inc./Sterling Communications partnership elected a local origination channel operated by Sterling Manhattan Cable Television (which served as the progenitor of the MSG Network) to handle production responsibilities for home game broadcasts involving theNew York KnicksandNew York Rangers—both based atMadison Square Garden—that would be televised on HBO throughout its initial Mid-Atlantic U.S. service area. (HBO founder Charles Dolan, through Cablevision, would purchase the arena and its headlining sports teams in a $1.075-billion joint bid with theITT Corporationin August 1994; his son,James L. Dolan, has owned the Knicks and Rangers throughThe Madison Square Garden Companysince 2015, and Madison Square Garden throughMadison Square Garden Entertainmentby way of the former company's 2020 spin-off of its non-sports entertainment assets.) The contracts related to this arrangement dated to May 1969, when Manhattan Cable Television first signed a one-year, $300,000 contract with Madison Square Garden to broadcast 125 sports events held at the arena, and was extended for five additional years in November 1970.[198][199][200]On November 1, 1972, one week before HBO formally launched, Madison Square Garden granted Sterling the rights to televise its sporting events to cable television systems outside New York City.[201][23]
The first game under this arrangement was the New York Rangers-Vancouver Canucks NHL game that launched Home Box Office on November 8, 1972, and served as its inaugural sports broadcast. For the 1974–75 Rangers and Islanders seasons, HBO contracted MSG announcers for play-by-play and color commentating duties; this created a burden on announcers to fill what otherwise would bedead airover the HBO feed of the games, since the service does not accept advertising, during the MSG Network's commercial airtime.National Basketball Association(NBA) andNational Hockey League(NHL) coverage expanded with HBO's transition into a national satellite service, covering non-New York-based teams in both leagues (including the NBA'sMilwaukee Bucks,Boston Celtics,Portland Trail Blazers,Golden State WarriorsandLos Angeles Lakers; and the NHL'sLos Angeles Kings) under individual agreements as well as select playoff games.[202][203](The NBA and NHL discontinued their HBO telecasts after their respective 1976–77 seasons. In May 1978, theNew York Supreme Courtruled then-Islanders and Nets presidentRoy Boehadbreached an exclusive contractwith Dolan's successor firm Long Island Cable Communications Development Co. through the HBO agreement and concurring contracts with other New York-area cable systems.[204]) In 1974, the network acquired the rights to broadcastWorld Football League(WFL) games from theNew York Stars(later relocated toCharlotteas the Charlotte Hornets midway through the WFL'sinaugural season) and thePhiladelphia Bell; 18 WFL games aired on HBO throughout two seasons until the league abruptly folded midway through the1975 season.[205][206]In March 1973, HBO signed a $1.5-million contract to acquire the regional rights to a selection ofAmerican Basketball Association(ABA) games for five years; notably, it carried the1976 ABA Finals—the league's last tournament game before the completion of its merger with the NBA—a six-game tournament in which theNew York Netsbeat theDenver Nuggetsfour games to two. The merger of the two professional basketball leagues resulted in an early termination of HBO's ABA contract, which was originally set to expire on July 1, 1977, following the conclusion of the 1975–76 season.[207]
Through 1977, HBO carried other sporting events originating on the Sterling Manhattan/Manhattan Cable sports channel, includingWorld Hockey Associationregular season and playoff games;Eastern College Athletic Conference(ECAC) tournaments (including theMen's Ice Hockey Tournamentand the ECAC Holiday Festival basketball tournament);World TeamTennis; internationalhigh school basketballinvitationals; theNational Horse Show;harness racingevents fromYonkers Raceway; equestrian,roller derbyand ice skating events; theWorld Professional Karate Championships; theMillrose Gamestrack and field invitational; theWestchester Kennel Club Dog Show; andWorld Wide Wrestling Federationmatches. (The regionalized sports focus was soon copied by other local subscription television services launched during the 1970s and early 1980s, most notablyPRISM,ONTVandWometco Home Theater.)NCAA Division I college basketballgames held at Madison Square Garden and, after becoming a national service, other venues (including theNational Invitational Tournamentand the Holiday Basketball Festival) were also carried by the network until the 1978–79 season.[208]
HBO also provided regional coverage ofNew York Yankeesbaseball games for the 1974 season. New York independent stationWPIX(now aCWaffiliate) provided microwave signal pickup assistance to HBO for the telecasts; through its right of first refusal on game selection in its local television contract with the team, covering the team's away games, WPIX preempted planned coverage of four Yankees games that HBO was scheduled to carry that season. (ThePhiladelphia Philliesreportedly rejected an offer for HBO to televise regular season games not shown locally on independentWPHL-TV[now aMyNetworkTVaffiliate].[209]) HBO's Yankees telecast spurred a complaint filed in June 1974 byNational Association of BroadcastersSpecial Committee on Pay TV chairman Willard Walbridge, who alleged they violated anti-siphoning rules barring pay television services from carrying live sports televised regularly on broadcast stations within two years. HBO representatives contended that regulatory interference over the game broadcasts was prohibited under theFirst Amendmentand that it offered only weekday games as WPIX held rights to selected Yankees weekend games; it also contended the anti-siphoning rules did not apply as there was not a per-program charge for the broadcasts. In September 1974, citing the games were unavailable on broadcast television, the FCC gave temporary authorization for HBO to carry no more than three of the team's remaining regular season games.[205][210][211][212][213][214]HBO broadcast approximately 20 Yankees games in 1974 and 25 games in 1975. HBO attempted to negotiate the carriage of a weekly Thursday night MLB game package in 1976, but ultimately balked at the price being asked for by baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn.[215]From 1973 to 1976, HBO carriedProfessional Bowlers Association(PBA)tournament events; beginning with the Winston-Salem Open on June 10, 1973, the network aired around 25 PBA tournaments, including eight which HBO co-sponsored over those three years.Dick Stockton,Marty GlickmanandSpencer Rossserved asplay-by-playannouncers, and Skee Foremsky acted as thecolor commentatorfor the bowling telecasts.[216][217]
With the assistance of programming consultation and acquisition firmTrans World International,[218]the expansion into a national service resulted in HBO expanding its sports coverage to include a broader array of events from the United States and Canada, including theNorth American Soccer League(1976–1978), selectAmateur Athletic Uniontournaments (1976–1981), selectLPGAgolf tournaments (1976–1978), championship rodeo (1976–1978), theUSGF National Gymnastics Championships(1976–1981),Skate Canada International(1976–1978), theCanadian Football League(1976–1978), non-basketball NCAA tournaments including theMen's Gymnastics Championships(1976–1978) and theDivision I Baseball Championships(1977–1978). Most of the aforementioned events ceased to be part of HBO's sports offerings in 1978, citing much of its sporting events generally had regional appeal, "don't repeat" and were readily abundant on commercial television.[219]The NCAA regular season and tournament events remained on HBO until the 1978–79 athletic season, shifting over to upstart basic cable network ESPN beginning with the 1979–80 athletic season under an exclusive national cable deal with the organization; USGF, AAU and select non-NCAA invitational events remained on the network until early 1981, thereafter limiting HBO's sports rights to boxing and Wimbledon.[220]
InJuly 1975, HBO inaugurated regional coverage of theWimbledontennis tournament for its Mid-Atlantic U.S. subscribers. (That year sawArthur Ashedefeat defending championJimmy Connors, 6–1, 6–1, 5–7, 6–4, in theGentlemen's Singles final, becoming the first Black male to win a Wimbledon singles title.[221]) Initially, the HBO telecasts of the tournament mainly consisted of replays culled from other video sources (including theBBC); HBO Sports began to employ an in-house team of commentators starting with the1978 tournament.[222]Throughout its tenure on the channel, Wimbledon coverage on HBO, which was the first to offer weekday tennis coverage on network television, consisted of singles and doubles events from the early rounds of the tournament;NBC(which had the over-the-air broadcast rights to Wimbledon since1969) maintained rights to the quarterfinal, semi-final and final rounds as well as weekend early-round matches. (Before the arrival of Wimbledon, HBO also carried the men's and women's rounds of theU.S. National Indoor Championshipsfrom 1972 to 1976 and selectedWTA Tourevents from 1977 to 1979.[223])
On June 25, 1999, HBO Sports announced it would not renew its share of the Wimbledon television contract after the conclusion ofthat year's tournament, ending its 25-year broadcast relationship with theGrand Slamevent. Seth Abraham, then-president of HBO Sports parent unit Time Warner Sports, said at the time that the decision was guided by a need to "refresh" its programming slate rather than because of issues with financial terms or stagnant viewership. (At the time of the announcement, HBO paid $8  million annually—under a $40-million deal over five years—to air the tournament.)[224][225]Although ESPN,Fox Sports NetandUSA Networkeach expressed interest in obtaining the cable package relinquished by HBO, Time Warner kept that portion of the Wimbledon contract within its corporate umbrella: on January 23, 2000, a co-owned subsidiaryTurner Broadcasting Systemand NBC reached a joint three-year, $30  million contract with theAll England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Clubfor the tournament rights. TNT (which would be folded into WarnerMedia Entertainment, alongside HBO, as part of the realignment resulting from AT&T's 2018 acquisition of Time Warner) andCNN/SI(later moved to the now-defunctCNNfnin 2002, after CNN/SI's shutdown), which would have their broadcasts produced through theTNT Sportsunit, assumed cable rights to the event beginning with the2000 tournament.[226][227][228][229](Since 2003, the Wimbledon cable rights have been held by ESPN, which assumed full U.S. television exclusivity over the championship in2012.)[230][231]Professional tennis briefly returned to HBO on March 2, 2009, when it broadcast the inaugural edition of the now-defunctBNP Paribas Showdownas a one-off special presentation.[232]
HBO's sports coverage was long synonymous with its boxing telecasts, fronted by matches featured on HBO Sports' longtime flagship series,HBO World Championship Boxing. Its first boxing telecast, on January 22, 1973, was "The Sunshine Showdown", the worldheavyweightchampionship bout fromKingston, Jamaicain whichGeorge ForemandefeatedJoe Frazierin two rounds. Outside of high-profile matches held at exotic locales, most of the boxing events shown during HBO's early existence as a regional service were bouts held at Madison Square Garden; once HBO became a national service, boxing coverage began to regularly cover fights held atThe Forum(as part of its television contract with the Los Angeles Lakers and Kings[202]) and other arenas. On September 30, 1975, the "Thrilla in Manila" boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier aired on HBO (under a licensing agreement with television program distributor Video Techniques) and was the first program on the network to be broadcast via satellite.[233](HBO also provided the first interconnected satellite demonstration broadcast on June 18, 1973, in which a heavyweight championship match betweenJimmy EllisandEarnie Shaverswas relayed viaAnik Ato a closed-circuit system at theAnaheim Convention Centerin Anaheim, California, and to a Teleprompter Cable system inSan Bernardino.)[234]Boxing telecasts aired on various scheduled nights through 1979, and mainly aired thereafter on Fridays; boxing telecasts moved to Saturdays full-time in 1987. (All boxing events shown on HBO aired on average in two- to three-week intervals.) Through 1979, HBO also carried variousNational Golden Glovescompetitions, and from 1978 to 1979, carried theNational Collegiate Boxing Associationchampionships.
HBO expanded its boxing content topay-per-viewin December 1990, when it created a production arm to distribute and organize marquee boxing matches in conjunction with participating promoters, TVKO (rebranded HBO PPV in 2001 and HBO Boxing Pay-Per-View in 2013); the first TVKO-produced boxing event was the April 19, 1991,"Battle of the Ages" boutbetweenEvander HolyfieldandGeorge Foreman. (TVKO signed Holyfield away from Showtime, which had been carrying his matches since itsShowtime Championship Boxingtelecasts premiered in 1986, under an agreement with promoterDan Duvaduring Holyfield's reign as cruiserweight champion.)[235]
HBO expanded its boxing slate on February 3, 1996, whenHBO Boxing After Dark(titledHBO Late Night Fightsfor its inaugural edition) premiered with title fights involving contenders in thejunior featherweight(Marco Antonio Barreravs.Kennedy McKinney) andjunior bantamweight(Johnny Tapiavs. Giovanni Andrade) classes. The program typically featured fight cards involving well-known contenders (generally those not designated as "championship" or "title" bouts), and up-and-coming boxing talents that had previously been featured mainly on basic cable boxing showcases (such as ESPN'sFriday Night Fights). A second franchise extension,KO Nation(which ran from May 6, 2000, to August 11, 2001), attempted to incorporatehip-hopmusic performances between matches involving up-and-coming boxers to attract the show's target audience of males 18 to 24 (later broadened to ages 18 to 34) to the sport; formerYo! MTV RapsVJEd Loverwas the "face" of the show and acted as its ring announcer. (Internal research stated that males aged 18–34 accounted for 3% of boxing viewership, while men 50 and older made up 60% of the sport's audience.)[236][237][238]KO Nationdrew low ratings throughout its run, even after it was moved from Saturday afternoons to Saturday late nights in January 2001. HBO Sports then refocused its efforts at attracting younger viewers throughBoxing After Dark.[239][240]To court the sport's Hispanic and Latino fans, the network's boxing franchises expanded to HBO Latino with the January 2003 premiere ofOscar De La HoyaPresenta Boxeo De Oro, a showcase of up-and-coming boxers represented by the De La Hoya-foundedGolden Boy Promotions. A second boxing series for HBO Latino,Generación Boxeo, premiered on the multiplex channel in April 2006.[241][242]
On September 27, 2018, HBO announced it would discontinue its boxing telecasts after 45 years, following its last televised match on October 27, marking the end of live sports on the network. (Two additionalWorld Championship Boxing/Boxing After Darkcards would follow that originally scheduled final broadcast, airing respectively on November 24 and December 8, 2018.) HBO's decision to bow out of boxing telecasts was due to factors that included the influx of sports-based streaming services (such asDAZNandESPN+) and issues withpromotersthat hampered its ability to acquire high-profile fight cards, and resulting declining ratings and loss of interest in the sport among HBO's subscribers. Also factoring into the move was HBO parent WarnerMedia's then-recent ownership transfer to AT&T, and the network's efforts to focus on its scripted programming; network executives thought that "HBO [was] not a sports network."[243]Since then, although it no longer produces sporting event telecasts, HBO Sports has continued to exist as a production unit for the network's sports magazine shows and documentaries.
Since 1977, HBO has offered documentary- and interview-based weekly series focusing on athletes and the world of athletics. On September 22, 1977, HBO premiered the channel's first original weekly series, and its first sports-related documentary and analysis series,Inside the NFL, a program that featured post-game highlights and analysis of the previous week's marqueeNational Football Leaguegames (using footage provided byNFL Films) as well as interviews with players, coaches and team management. The program was one of the first studio shows on cable television to offer weekly NFL game reviews, predating the launches of similar football review shows on ESPN and other sports-centered cable networks.Inside the NFLwould go on to become the network's longest-running program, airing for 31 seasons until it ended its HBO run in February 2008. (After HBO canceled the program,Inside the NFLwas subsequently acquired by Showtime, under arrangement withCBS Sports, formally moving to the rival premium channel in September 2008.)[244][245][246]The network would build upon the concept behindInside the NFLthrough the debuts of additional sports talk and documentary programs: theMajor League Baseball-focusedRace for the Pennant(1978–1992),HBO Sports Magazine(1981–1982),On the Record with Bob Costas(2001–2005) and its revamped iterationCostas Now(2005–2009), andJoe Buck Live(2009).
Another program built on similar groundwork,Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel—which eventually became the network's flagship sportsnewsmagazine—premiered on April 2, 1995, and lasted for 29 seasons before ending on December 19, 2023. The hour-long monthly series (originally airing quarterly until 1999), hosted by veteran television journalist and sportscasterBryant Gumbel, regularly received positive reviews for its groundbreaking journalism and typically features four stories centering on societal and athletic issues associated with the sports world, investigative reports, and interviews with famous athletes and other sports figures. As of 2020[update],Real Sportshas received 33Sports Emmy Awards(including 19 for Outstanding Sports Journalism) throughout its run, as well as two Peabody Awards (in 2012 and 2016) and threeAlfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards.[247]Of note, the show's 2004 Sports Emmy win for "Outstanding Sports Journalism" and 2006 duPont–Columbia University Award win for "Outstanding Broadcast Journalism" was for a half-hour hidden camera investigative report—guided by human rights activistAnsar Burney—into slavery and torture in secret desert camps in theUnited Arab Emirates(UAE), where boys younger than age 5 were trained incamel racing. The segment uncovered a carefully hiddenchild slaveryring that bought orkidnappedhundreds of young boys inPakistanandBangladesh, who were then forced to become camel jockeys in the UAE and questioned the sincerity of U.S. diplomatic pressure on the UAE, an ally to the United States, to comply with the country's ban on children under age 15 from participating in camel racing. The documentary brought worldwide attention to the plight of child camel jockeys in the Middle East and helped the Ansar Burney Trust convince the governments ofQatarand the UAE to end the use of children in the sport.
In 2001, HBO andNFL Filmsbegan to jointly produce the documentary seriesHard Knocks, which follows an individualNFLteam each season duringtraining campand their preparations for the upcoming football season.[191][248]
The original HBO logo—used from the channel's November 8, 1972, launch until April 30, 1975—consisted of a minimalistmarqueelight array surrounding a left-adjusted "Home Box Office" nameplate, rendered inmixed-caps, accompanied by a ticket stub image (the former and latter signifying the channel's initial film and event programming focus).
The first iteration of the current HBOlettermark, designed by then Time-Lifeart directorBetty E. Brugger,[249]was introduced on March 1, 1975; it consisted of bold, uppercase "HBO" text incorporating abullseyemark—derived from thetuning knobsfound on then-current television set and cable converter box models—inside the cylindrical "O". Because of inadvertent consumer impressions of the name appearing as "HEO", as the 1975 design had the "O" obscure the "B"'s double-curve, marketing firm Bemis Balkind modified it into the current trimmer form; introduced in April 1980, it shifted the "O"—now attached to the “B”'s full double-curve—"an eighth of an inch" rightward, and slightly widened the spacing of the lettering and bullseye mark.[250](The 1975 and 1980 versions were used concurrently in on-air identifications and certain network promos until the former was fully discontinued in June 1981.) The simplicity of the logo makes it fairly easy to duplicate, of which HBO has taken advantage over the years within its imaging; a proprietary typeface adapted fromITC Avant Garde(which, like the similarKabel, had previously been used in some on-air and print marketing dating to 1978) that featured bullseye-like glyphs within the 'D' and 'O' capitals was developed internally in 2008 as a logotype for HBO Sports (including the unit's boxing productions and, by 2012,Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel), the linear HBO high-definition and VOD services, and was later used for the logotype for HBO Go.
[citation needed]
The logo would become widely recognized through a program opening sequence, often nicknamed "HBO in Space", produced in late 1981 by New York City-based production firmLiberty Studiosand used in some capacity from September 20, 1982, to October 31, 1997. (It replaced a series of six film-based animated "HBO Feature Movie" intros used since April 1979, which Canadian pay serviceFirst Choice Superchannellater reused for its 1984–87 movie intros.)[251]The original 70-second version begins inside an apartment, where a man tunes a television set's converter box and sits down with his wife to watch HBO. (A variant that begins with a dark cloudscape fading into the city sequence replaced the early version in November 1983.) As the camera pans out of the apartment window, a continuousstop motionflight (filmed on a computer-controlled camera) occurs over a custom-built model cityscape and countryside set against a painted twilightcyclorama. After the camera pans skyward at the flight's end, a bursting "stargate" effect (made using two die-cut film slides) occurs, unveiling achrome-plated,brassHBO logo that flies through astarfield. As the HBO "space station" rotates toward the "O",rainbow-huedlight rays (created using afiber opticlighting rig) encircle that letter's top side—sparkling to reveal its interior wall and a center axis in the bullseye mark area—and streak counter-clockwise inside the "O"'s inner wall, fading in a slide displaying the program presentation type in three-dimensional, partiallyunderlinedblock text—usually the "HBO Feature Presentation" card for theatrical movies, though varied title cards set mainly to custom end signatures of the accompanying theme music (including, among others,Standing Room Only, "HBO Premiere Presentation", "HBO Special",On Locationand "HBO Family Showcase") were used for original programs and weekend prime time films—before more light streaks sweep and shine across the text and create a sparkling fadeout. (An abbreviated version—shown during most non-prime-time programming until October 31, 1986, and thereafter for early-prime-time movie telecasts, aside from premieres and most weekend presentations—commenced from the starburst and the flight of the HBO "space station".)[252]
Most variants of this sequence—except for the feature presentation, "Saturday Night Movie" and "Sunday Night Movie" versions—were discontinued on November 1, 1986. (In September 1993, the latter two versions were discontinued and the "Feature Presentation" variant was extended to all films aired in early prime time, with the full-length version being reintroduced in 1993 for Saturday premieres and Tuesday re-broadcasts.). The regularity of the airings also decreased from 1996, as the later HBO Movie intro took prominence. Variants of the intro are available on YouTube, including one—a previously unaired version including two children sitting with the aforementioned couple—uploaded to HBO's official YouTube channel; the sequence is also used as a movie introduction at the annual HBOBryant ParkSummer Film Festival (held since 1992, near HBO's now-former New York City headquarters), and a seldom-used "World Premiere Presentation" variant was featured in the intro of the 2019 HBO stand-up comedy specialDan Soder: Son of a Gary.[252][253]The twelve-note musical signature of the sequence's orchestral fanfare—originally composed forScore Productionsby Ferdinand Jay Smith III of Jay Advertising, who adapted the theme from the Scherzo movement ofAntonín Dvořák'sNinth Symphony—eventually became the network'saudio logoin November 1997, being styled in various arrangements (includinghorns, guitar and piano, and sometimes arranged as an abridged nine-note variant) within HBO's programming bumpers and network IDs since then. (An extendedpop rockversion of the theme, alternately titled "Fantasy", was released as both instrumental and lyrical tracks on Smith's 1985 album "Music Made for Television".[254])
Another well-known HBO program opener, designed byPacific Data Imagesin conjunction with the network and commonly nicknamed "Neon Lights", began non-prime-time movie presentations[citation needed]from November 1, 1986, to October 31, 1997. The sequence, set to a synth and electric guitar theme, begins with a rotation shot of a heliotrope HBO logo on a film strip as blue, green, and pink light rays penetrate it and four radiating CGI slots; one ray then reaches a field of varied-color spheres that zoom outward to reveal a light purple HBO logo, which is overlaid by a cursive magenta "Movie" script against a black and purple sphere-dotted background.[255][256][257]
From 1997 to 1999, known as the "It's on Now" era, HBO went through a phase of trying to figure out their identity. During this era, there were several logos that formed their branding, such as an HBO logo chasing a guy, an HBO logo being crushed by a hand, a running man riding an HBO logo bridge over a lake, in escape, an HBO logo imposed onto the streets, an HBO logo as a celebrity in a taxi, and several others. These also formed the Feature Presentation intros, and from December 1997 to about September 1998, proceeded an intro prelude called "Now." These bumpers and the network's branding was designed by Telezign—also.[258][259]In September 1999, a new rebrand replaced everything except the various bumpers shown.
ACGIfeature presentation bumper (designed by Pittard Sullivan) harkening to the 1982 sequence was used from November 6, 1999, to April 1, 2011. (It commenced outside a movie theater facade (displaying the HBO logo and the words "Feature Presentation" on the marquee), leading into a trek across countryside road, snowy mountain cliffside, and desert settings—respectively passing under anelectrical transmission towerand an above-ground tunnel, and through atank trailer cylindershaped in each letter of the HBO lettermark; a metropolitan neighborhood follows, culminating in a flying leap above a bridge between two skyscrapers, and a slower-speed panning shot above an HBO-lettermark-shaped lake outlined by spotlights before a 3D animation of the "Feature Presentation" text forms. (An abbreviated variant that preceded movies aired outside of weekend prime time excerpts the footage following the skyscraper leap.).[260]The premieres of this debut coincided with the exclusive premiere ofSaving Private Ryan, and was a significant viewing event for fans of the movie. This intro came after an extensive broadcast squencing buildup leading to the broadcast, using the HBO Saturday Night Guarantee branding that was used in the time. It included a clip of the movie, "next" (programming), the HBO Saturday Night Guarantee logo, customized for that broadcast with different music, clips from HBO's upcoming movies, and then a brief auditory/visual intro, before the feature presentation. However, the previous bumpers did continue on non-premiere broadcasts, until the feature presentation (via a shorter version starting at the city) was standardized on the network by January 2000, thus replacing the 1997 bumpers for good.
Another sequence paying homage to the 1982 opening—designed by Imaginary Forces, and accompanied by a Smith-derived theme arranged by Man Made Music—debuted on March 4, 2017. (It replaced a shorter, minimalist intro based around cascading screenshots from theatrical films in HBO's program library that were introduced in April 2014—one of two brief sequences by Viewpoint Creative used between April 2, 2011, and March 3, 2017, that were modeled on the network's graphical imaging, preceded by a 2011–14 sequence designed by Viewpoint contractor Jesse Vartanian that centered on a 4:1auroralandscape.)[261][262]The live-action/CGI sequence, set inside ametropoliswithin the HBO letterforms, features groups of people (respectively a married couple, a pair of teenage siblings watching viatabletin their bedroom, a family with four children, and a group of adult friends) gathering in their homes to watch an HBO movie; the sequence's second and third living room segments include brief glimpses of the HBO "space station" segment from the 1982 intro. (The full 49-second version is used only for Saturday movie premieres; an eight-second variant—beginning at the reveal of the HBO metropolis letterform—has been used for most film presentations since September 2018. HBO Max has used a four-second variant to open films on its main HBO content portal since it launched in May 2020.)[263][264][253][265]
Unlike other pay television networks (including the multiplex channels of sister channel Cinemax), HBO does not feature in-programon-screen logo bugson its main feed and multiplex channels; however, until their respective "The Works"-era logos were discontinued in April 2014, channel-specific on-screen bugs were previously shown during promotional breaks between programs on the six thematic HBO multiplex channels.[266]

Since 1991, the Home Box Office, Inc. oversaw the expansion of HBO's service to international markets, establishing three major subsidiaries in Latin America, Europe, and Asia, as well as forming several distribution partnerships to syndicate HBO programs to other broadcast networks, cable channels, and video services on request outside the United States.
HBO Latin Americawas launched in 1991 as a partnership between Warner Bros. and Omnivisión (Ole), which was later joined by Sony and Disney. The Brazilian channel was launched in 1994. It is available inHispanic America, including theCaribbean. Disney and Sony left the shareholding in 2010 and Ole Communications in 2020.[277]HBO Max OTT service is available.
HBO Europewas launched in Budapest in 1991 in partnership withSony, which was joined byDisneyin 1996. After its launch in Hungary, it has expanded to severalCentral EuropeanandBalkancountries such as the Czech Republic in 1994, Poland in 1996, Slovakia in 1997, Romania in 1998, Moldova in 1999, Bulgaria in 2001, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2006, and Northern Macedonia in 2009. It was also available in the Netherlands from 2012 to 2016 through a partnership with the Dutch cable operatorZiggo. In 2010, HBO bought the shares ofSonyandDisney.[278]HBO programs are available as well through the HBO Max OTT service. Furthermore, the programs are available exclusively through HBO Max in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands.
HBO Asiawas launched in 1992 in Singapore as a partnership withSingteland was later joined by Sony and UIP (UniversalandParamount). This was followed by an enlargement of Thailand and the Philippines in 1993, Taiwan and Indonesia in 1994, Hong Kong and Malaysia in 1995, and Vietnam in 2005. It has also been available in otherSoutheast Asiancountries from 1997 to 2020 such as Brunei, Cambodia, South Korea, Macau, Myanmar, Mongolia, Nepal, Palau, Pope New Guinea, and Sri Lanka.[279]HBO South Asiahas been a subsidiary of HBO Asia since 2000 broadcasting in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and the Maldives, which closed in 2020.[280]Singtel left the joint venture, being followed in 2008 by Sony and Universal.[281]The on-demand video program in Southeast and South Asia is still on the old HBO Go platform as of April 2022, while Max being planned for launch in late 2024.
HBO programs are also distributed through agreements with third parties and are available on premium TV channels of local operators:Fox Showcasein Australia,Be 1in Belgium,HBO Canada(brand and programming licensed under agreement withBell Media),Amazon Prime Videoin France,[282]Sky Atlantic inthe United Kingdom and Ireland,Italy,Germany, Austria and Switzerland,[283]HBOin New Zealand,[284]M-Net Bingein Sub-Saharan Africa,OSN First Seriesin the Middle East and North Africa[285]andJioCinemain India. Apart from TV channels, the programs can also be watched on the OTT platforms of the operators. In Japan, it is exclusively available onU-Nextvideo-on-demand service.
Starting in 2004, the 2002 rebrand for the network simatanelously got standardized for all of the outer channels, except HBO Family. Some difference included, however: voiceovers were omitted from the outer channels. This meant that the MPAA bumpers, then voiced by Michael Carroll, a longtime veteran voiceover for TV, including CBS and commercial breaks on WPIX, had the voiceovers omitted, as well as the "next"/"tonight" bumpers.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
