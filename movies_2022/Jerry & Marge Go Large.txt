The film premiered at theTribeca Film Festivalon June 15, 2022, and was released onParamount+on June 17, 2022.
Jerry and Marge Selbee, a retired couple from the small town ofEvart, Michigan, discover a statistical loophole in the WinFall lottery that allows them to almost guarantee a win during rolldown weeks (when there was no grand prize winner for long enough that, instead of the jackpot growing further, it was distributed to the next tier of winners).
They start small but quickly go all-in, emptying their savings to invest in the lottery, which pays off handsomely. Excited by their success, the Selbees share their secret with friends and neighbors, creating GS Investment Strategies. This reinvigorates the town, as old businesses reopen and the local Jazz Fest venue is restored using the lottery winnings.
Their success attracts the attention of a group of Harvard students who also discover the loophole. The students, led by Tyler, confront the Selbees, arrogantly suggesting they combine forces, but the Selbees refuse, standing firm in their methods and morals.
Tensions rise, and Tyler threatens Jerry, demanding he stop playing WinFall. Jerry almost gives in, but the support of his son and the community strengthens his resolve.
In a final confrontation, Jerry exposes Tyler's selfish tactics. Ultimately, the Massachusetts Lottery, pressured by growing media attention, shuts down WinFall, ending the Selbees' lottery journey. Despite this, Jerry and Marge return to Evart as heroes, as their adventure not only brings wealth but also revives the spirit of their small town.

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
