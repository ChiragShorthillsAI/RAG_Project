Vendettais a 2022 American action-thriller revenge film written and directed byJared Cohnand starringClive Standen,Theo Rossi,Mike Tyson,Thomas Jane, andBruce Willis.[3]
The film was released in limited theaters andon-demandplatforms on May 17, 2022, byRedbox Entertainment.
In suburban Georgia, family man William Duncan (Clive Standen) picks up his daughter Kat (Maddie Nichols), a softball player with dreams of playing professionally. On their way to pick up dinner, Kat assures him that while she focuses on her sports, she will also study to become a lawyer. While William goes inside to order the food, Kat is left in the car. Brothers Rory (Theo Rossi) and Danny (Cabot Basden), working for their father, kingpin Donnie (Bruce Willis) turn up and drag her outside despite her pleas, with Rory informing her they only want her soul before Danny shoots and kills her. They are soon arrested by the authorities, but William intentionally doesn't identify Danny, allowing him to go free. The following night, William later stalks and hits Danny with his car, then proceeds to beat Danny to death with a softball bat. Returning home, he cleans his car and the bat and disposes of the bloody garments, later noticing and washing blood off his shirt, breaking down at the horror of what he's done.
Rory is informed of Danny's death and rushes to the scene but is told the investigation is ongoing. Detective Brody, the investigating detective finds out who Danny is and pays William a visit, informing him of Danny's murder and asking where he was that night, to which William states he was at home, and asks if he's a suspect. Brody says he's not but asks that he call if he thinks of anything. William's wife Jen confronts him and asks him where he was that night and begs him not to go back to his old ways, revealing that William was a former Marine. Rory questions a prostitute who tried to solicit William in the place where Danny was killed, and after confirming William's identity from a photo, Rory and his henchman ambush William the following day at a coffee shop. William manages to kill the henchman but loses his wallet which is picked up by Rory. Rushing home, William calls Brody and tells him the truth, and Brody leaves a squad car for his protection. William confesses to Jen what he has done, and she suggests they run away, but are ambushed by Rory and Donnie, who shoot him and Jen, killing her and leaving William to die.
William wakes up in the hospital, intent on revenge. Brody visits him and gives him a file on Donnie and Rory. After recuperating, William escapes from the hospital in a janitor outfit and gets a change of clothes and a motel to stay in as well as money from the bank. Upon returning to the motel, William is accosted by a man named Dante, who reveals his knowledge of William from the court case and offers him firearms, revealing himself to be an arms dealer who lost his cousin to Donnie. After telling Dante of his past, William buys firearms and moves to a secluded location where he trains himself. Once done William comes back into town and seeks out one of Rory's henchmen, forcing him to reveal Donnie's location before shooting him dead. Upon learning of his henchman's death, Donnie orders Rory to kill William once and for all. Rory and his gang set out to find William, but William having already been at the club, sneaks inside and confronts Donnie. He tells Donnie that he has become emotionless to all that he has experienced, and that killing is normal for him now before shooting Donnie dead. He uses Donnie's phone to call Rory and inform him about his father's death. Upon reaching the club and seeing his father's body, Rory doesn't react as he hates his father due to Donnie constantly mentioning that Danny was better than him but orders his gang to find and kill William. William ambushes the gang but escapes to the motel, where the prostitute that identified him earlier tips off Rory. Dante learns of the ambush and helps William remove a bullet lodged in him, but Rory shows up at the motel and calls out to William. William opens fire on the gang and he and Dante escape with Rory in pursuit. Dante calls his friend Roach, who sets up an ambush for Rory and drives them away. Knowing they will be back, Dante, Roach and his gang prepare for the ambush, during which all gang members from both sides are killed, and Rory kills Roach, leaving him and William. Rory shoots William in the stomach and gloats over him, allowing William to grab a screwdriver and stab Rory in the neck. As he watches Rory die, Rory sees the pain that he caused by destroying his family. But knowing that William finally got his revenge, knowing there is nothing he can do now that he slowly dies, as he's smiling with insult, showing the face he wants William to never forget as he finally dies. Dante, having survived the assault, escapes upon hearing police sirens. Brody meets William and has a chat with him before William succumbs to his injuries as he dies. William finally avenges his family by not only killing the notorious Fetter family and their gang, but destroying their community, putting an end to their crimes once and for all, but at the cost of his own life. After William's death Brody states that he hopes it was worth it. At the end, the message says, ("To exact revenge for yourself is not only right, it's an absolute duty") written 
by Stieg Larsson.

Redbox Automated Retail, LLCwas an Americanvideo rentalandstreaming mediacompany, based inOakbrook Terrace, Illinoiswest ofChicago. Redbox specialized inautomated DVD rental kiosks, and operatedtransactionaland ad-supportedstreaming videoandtelevisionservices. From 2022 until its liquidation, Redbox was a wholly owned subsidiary ofChicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment.[2]
Redbox kiosks, which rented and sold films onDVDandBlu-ray, were located at retail stores, includingconvenience stores,supermarkets, andpharmacies. At its peak in the early 2010s, the company operated kiosks at more than 34,000 locations,[a][3][4]and controlled more than half of the US DVD rental market.[5][6]
In June 2024, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment filed forChapter 11 bankruptcy; the following month, the company’s case was converted toChapter 7 liquidation. As part of ongoing liquidation proceedings, Redbox’s online streaming services and mobile app ceased functioning in July 2024.
Redbox Automated Retail LLC was initially developed in Chicago as a part of “Project 361”, aMcDonald'sbusiness expansion initiative. John Sexton Abrams, a strategy executive at McDonald's, designed the original concept as an immersive kiosk leveraging McDonald's product supply chain and geographic footprint to provide 24/7 access to fresh dairy and other products. Initially, the kiosks sold a range of goods under the name TikTok Easyshops.[7][8]In late 2003 McDonald's ended its use of the kiosks for the products. Instead, McDonald's executiveGregg Kaplandecided to use the kiosks for DVD rentals, which was tested in Denver in 2004.[9]
The company employed a "return anywhere" policy, different from competitors, which allowed consumers to return their rental to any Redbox kiosk, not just the one from which they originally rented it.[10]
In 2005,Coinstarbought 47% of the company for $32 million,[11]after unsuccessful attempts to sell half the company toBlockbusterandNetflix.[12]In early 2008, Coinstar exercised an option to increase its share to 51%,[11]before acquiring the remainder for $169–176 million in February 2009.[13]While traditional brick and mortar rental stores were closing at a high rate, Redbox moved into existing retail locations such as supermarkets, and placed kiosks within them or outside of them to gain access to that consumer base.[14]
Competitors included Netflix, Blockbuster,Movie Galleryand its subsidiaryHollywood Video,West Coast Video, andFamily Videoalong with otherDVD by mailrental services.Mitch Lowejoined Redbox in 2003 after spending five years as an executive at Netflix. At Redbox, he started first as a consultant and then as VP of Purchasing & Operations. In 2005, he became the Chief Operating Officer.[15]Lowe owned and operated a video rental company named Video Droid from 1982 through 1997. Video Droid attempted a VHS rental vending machine concept, though the idea was quickly deemed impractical.[16]Lowe was named President of Redbox in April 2009.
With growing concern in 2009 that DVD kiosks might jeopardize movie studio income from DVD sales and rentals, three major movie studios,20th Century Fox,Warner Bros., andUniversal Studios, each refused to sell DVDs to Redbox until at least 28 days after their arrival in stores.[16]Fox and Warner Bros. represented 62% of home video rental revenue in 2008–09.[17][18]Redbox responded byfiling lawsuits, first, against Universalin October 2008,[19]then against 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. in August 2009.[20][21]In August 2009, the federal judge hearing the Universal case allowed the antitrust claim to continue.[22]In October 2009, 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. filed motions to dismiss Redbox's lawsuits against them.[23][24]During that time, Redbox continued to rent films from the companies, purchasing them at retail from places likeWalmartinstead of receiving them from the movie studios, which in some cases saved Redbox money due to the discounted prices offered by retailers.[25]Other major studios—Sony Pictures,Paramount Pictures, andLionsgate—signed distribution deals with Redbox.[16]The Walt Disney Companypermits third-party distributors to sell to Redbox, but has not entered into a direct relationship with the company.[16]Both sides of the studio lawsuits pointed to these revenue-sharing deals to shore up their argument, with Redbox president Mitch Lowe saying, "our growth can lead to theirs [the studios' growth]. For example, Redbox currently estimates we will pay more than a combined $1 billion over the next five years to Sony, Lionsgate and Paramount to purchase and then rent new-release DVDs to consumers,"[26]while Warner Bros. says the deals are proof that far from being shut out byHollywood, "Redbox's business has thrived since its suit against Universal, underscored by lucrative distribution deals with Paramount Home Entertainment, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, and Lionsgate."[24]Redbox entered into an agreement with Warner Bros. on February 16, 2010,[27]followed by Universal[28]and Fox[29]on April 22, 2010.
In the agreements which settle the lawsuits, Redbox agreed to not make available for rental films from these studios until 28 days after their initial home-video releases. Redbox continued to sign additional and new distribution deals with these and other movie studios;[30]by 2017, titles from Fox and Warner became available on Redbox seven days after their initial home-video release.[31]
With over 6,000 kiosks, Redbox surpassedBlockbusteras the largest U.S. video rental chain in November 2007.[32]The company reached 100 million rentals in February 2008,[33]and passed 1 billion rentals in September 2010.[34]As of Q2 2011, 68% of the U.S. population lived within a five-minute drive of a Redbox kiosk.[35]In Q2 2011, kiosks accounted for 36% of the disc rental market, with 38% of that attributable to rent-by-mail services and 25% to traditional stores, according to theNPD Group.
Redbox announced in July 2010 that they would introduceBlu-raymovies at 13,000 kiosks; by that fall, Blu-ray discs were available across the Redbox network.[36]In October 2010, the company began offering video game rentals in select markets, includingReno, Nevada;Orlando, Florida;Stevens Point, Wisconsin;Austin, Texas;Wilmington, North Carolina; andCorvallis, Oregon.[citation needed]Video games were available at all Redbox locations by June 2011.[37]In February 2012, Redbox announced the acquisition of Blockbuster Express, a competing kiosk-based rental service operated byNCRin partnership with Blockbuster. The $100 million purchase, completed on June 27, 2012, included over 10,000 kiosks, inventory, and certain retailer contracts.[38][39]As part of the agreement, Redbox entered a supplier arrangement of purchasing product and services from NCR.[40]The company sold some Blockbuster Express kiosks in less competitive markets to third party providers in June 2013.[41]Also in 2012, Redbox partnered withNew Era Ticketsand Sparkart to test sales of live event tickets at Redbox kiosks. Redbox Tickets launched in October 2012 inGreater Philadelphia,[42][43]and later expanded to theLos Angelesarea in early 2013.[44]
Redbox announced its 3 billionth disc rental, including both movies and games, in July 2013.[45]The number of items rented from kiosks annually peaked in 2013, with 772.87 million rentals creating $1.97 billion in revenue; that year, Redbox rentals comprised more than 50% of DVD rentals in the United States[6][46]with 717.13 million units rented in 2014, and 587.55 million in 2015.[47]This decline was widely attributed to consumers' preferences shifting from physical media to online streaming; although as of 2014, Redbox still represented half of the physical media rental market.[48]
Redbox began offering rentals inCanadain mid-2012.[49]1,400 kiosks were installed in Canada before Redbox ended operations in the country in March 2015, citing low demand. These kiosks were subsequently relocated to retail stores in the United States.[50][51]
In August 2012, Redbox's founder, Gregg Kaplan, exited as president and COO of Redbox, and was succeeded as president by Anne Saunders.[52]Throughout most of 2016, parent company Outerwall was seeking a buyer based on shareholder input. In early September, Outerwall was sold toApollo Global Managementand its three units (Coinstar,ecoATMand Redbox) were split into separate operating companies. In late September 2016, Outerwall CFO Galen Smith was announced as the new CEO of Redbox.[53]
In January 2017, Redbox began moving some of its then-40,000 kiosks, with the intention of analyzing consumer trends and reacting to under-performing neighborhoods.[54][55]On December 13, 2017, Redbox offered a newvideo streamingservice called Redbox On Demand.[56]The percentage of consumers renting or purchasing movies from Redbox rose in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the third quarter, according to a TiVo survey.[57]That month, Disney sued Redbox, accusing them of violating copyrights by selling codes to download Disney movies such asStar Wars: The Force AwakensandBeauty and the Beast.[58]
In April 2018, Redbox acquired the independent filmBenjaminfor a 90-day release period via its kiosks and on demand service, as the first Redbox Original.[59]In October 2019 Redbox formed a film and TV series production division, Redbox Entertainment, with Marc Danon as senior advisor of content acquisition.[60]Redbox announced on December 9, 2019, that it would no longer be renting video games but will continue selling used video game copies through the end of the year.[61]
Redbox Free Live TV, afree ad-supported streaming televisionservice, was soft launched in early February 2020 with a nationwide launch on February 18.[62]The company's revenue fell 20% in 2019, 36% in 2020 and over 50% in 2021.[63]On May 17, 2021, Redbox announced that it reached a definitive agreement to merge with Seaport Global Acquisition, aspecial-purpose acquisition companywhich would result in Redbox being publicly listed on theNasdaqunder the ticker RDBX.[64]The company officially went public on October 25, 2021.[65]
On May 11, 2022,Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainmentannounced its intention to acquire Redbox for $375 million.[66]The acquisition was completed on August 11, 2022, less than a year after Redbox went public.[67]At the end of 2022, the company operated about 34,000 kiosks nationwide, with plans to increase that number with 1,000 more kiosks in 2023.[68]In July 2023, CSSE announced a partnership with the video sharing platformTikTok, under which screens showcasing top content from the service will be installed on at least 3,000 Redbox kiosks. These ads will also display advertising sold by Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment's sales platform Crackle Connex.[69]
In August 2023, convenience store chain7-Eleventerminated its contract with Redbox due to its failure to pay commissions and demanded the kiosks be removed; Redbox failed to do so. Franchisees began to unplug machines and tape credit card readers shut. 7-Eleven eventually filed a lawsuit in June 2024.[70]In February 2024, drug store chainCVSfiled a lawsuit against Redbox for failure to pay commissions during the third quarter of 2022. Convenience store chainSheetzfollowed suit the same month for not receiving payments since the end of 2022.[70]
On April 23, 2024, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment announced a $636.6 million loss in 2023, and warned that without any options to generate additional financing, the company could be forced to liquidate or pause operations, and seek a potentialChapter 11 bankruptcyprotection filing. However, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment did also report that Redbox's sales increased last year, seeing a 66% increase in annual revenue to $112.7 million.[71]
By June 15, all Redbox kiosks inHannafordgrocery stores had been shut down.[72]On June 29, 2024, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after missing a week of paying its employees and failing to secure financing.[73]On July 10, 2024, a bankruptcy judge ordered to convert Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment's Chapter 11 bankruptcy into aChapter 7 bankruptcyliquidation after accusing the company's previous CEO of misusing the business and failing to pay employees or support healthcare. With the Chapter 7 conversion, the company's assets will be liquidated, resulting in the shut down of its subsidiaries, including Redbox. In addition, over 1,000 employees will be laid off. The company's website and apps were taken down shortly after.[74][75][76]
Although many of Redbox’s kiosks have been removed, many remaining kiosks are still functional and dispense discs. Some kiosks have been taken by hobbyists and tinkerers who aim toreverse engineerthe software used by them.[77][78]A major company involved in the removal and disposal of Redbox kiosks is The Junkluggers, although most kiosks are removed by independent contractors.[79]The Junkluggers aim to recycle the metal used by the kiosks and donate the DVDs inside to community organizations.[79]
Redbox's vending kiosks rent and sell movies onDVDandBlu-Raydiscs. Each stocked a selection of roughly 200 titles, with multiple copies of popular titles.[80]
Many Redbox kiosks were installed indoors, while others are located outdoors. They were usually attached to a large sign advertising a selection of featured films, and some locations feature two attached kiosks, allowing for additional selection and stock. Each kiosk was operated by customers via atouchscreen, and contained a robotic disc retrieval system with a stacked carousel capable of holding more than 600 discs.[80][81]Discs within are marked withbarcodes, allowing identification by the kiosk's machinery, and stored on the carousel in thin plastic cases, which are dispensed to customers via a small slot next to the control panel.
Rented discs could be returned to any of the company's kiosks. Charges accrued up to 25 days, after which the customer then owned the DVD (without the original case) and rental charges ceased. Customers could reserve DVDs online, made possible by real-time inventory updates on the company's website.[82]While customers could buy used DVDs from the kiosks (with unsold used DVDs returned to suppliers), Redbox estimated only 3% of the company's revenue came from used-disc sales.[83]
At its peak, a Redbox kiosk rented its average DVD 15 times at an average of $2 per transaction plus any applicable taxes.[16]
From 2010 to 2019, Redbox kiosks rentedvideo games. Initially games for thePlayStation 3,Wii, andXbox 360were offered;[37]titles for theWii U,PlayStation 4, andXbox Onewere added in 2014,[84]followed byNintendo Switchgames upon that console's launch in 2017.[85]
Redbox began in 2004, using re-branded kiosks manufactured and operated bySilicon Valley–based DVDPlay, at 140 McDonald's restaurants inDenverand other test markets.[86]In April 2005, Redbox phased out the DVDPlay-manufactured machines and contracted theSolectronfacility inCreedmoor, North Carolina—later purchased byFlextronics International, in October 2007 (Flextronics has been the manufacturer of theZune,Xboxand Xbox 360)—to create and manufacture a custom kiosk design.[87]The new kiosk was designed by Flextronics' Creedmoor design team including engineers Steven Hancock and John Rupert as key contributors under the direction of Franz Kuehnrich at GetAMovie Inc.[88](which was bought by RedBox). Other key contributors from Flextronics were Flextronics Global account manager Dave Stadelmaier and Global Supply Chain manager Ben Wheeler (The KioskGuy). Redbox was innovative[89]in that its carousel design not only decreased the number of robotic movements necessary to dispense and restock inventory, it also dramatically increased the number of discs (from 100 to 700+)[90]which could be stored within a kiosk. In addition, the software, designed and developed by Enterprise Logic Systems,[91][92]was also innovative in that it allowed RedBox to remotely monitor and manage inventory at all kiosks throughout the country.
In late December 2020, Redbox began offering a yearly subscription service allowing a subscriber to rent 12 or 24 discs in total, depending on their plan of choice. Only eligible movies could be rented on the plans. It extended the user return window until midnight, giving customers an additional 3 hours to return a movie to a kiosk.[93]
Retail chains hosting Redbox kiosks have included McDonald's,CVS,[70]Walgreens,Dollar General,[94]Family Dollar,Walmart,Market BasketinNew England,Krogerin addition to  subsidiaries inAlbertsons,Safeway,Meijer,[95]Winn-Dixie,Publix,HannafordinNew Yorkand New England,[72]Wegmans,[96]7-Eleven,[70]Cumberland Farms,Circle K, andSheetz.
Redbox began internally testing a video streaming service, dubbed Redbox Instant, in July 2012. The service was a joint effort between Redbox andVerizon.[97]On March 14, 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon officially went public, offering customers a free 1-month trial of an $8/month unlimited streaming service that includes 4 disc rentals from kiosks ($1 more for Blu-ray).[98]The service launched with 4,600 titles from movie companies includingEpix, Lionsgate,NBCUniversal, Paramount Pictures,Relativity, andSony Pictures. According to early reports, Redbox Instant planned to allow users to download content to mobile devices for offline viewing; titles could be either rented or purchased, in SD or HD quality, with rental customers having 30 days to begin viewing their title and 48 hours of unlimited views thereafter.[99]
In June 2013, Sony made the official announcement atE3(Electronic Entertainment Expo) that Redbox Instant would be available on thePlayStation 4console, and it was released in late 2013.AndroidandiOSapps also enabled streaming content on mobile devices.[100]
Redbox Instant disabled sign-ups for new users in mid 2014 owing to a growing number of people using the website to verify stolen credit cards.[101]In Q2 2014 earning call, Outerwall, Redbox's parent company, stated that they were "not pleased" with Redbox Instant subscription numbers.[101]Finally on October 4, 2014, it was announced that Redbox Instant would shut down on October 7, only 19 months after its initial launch.[102]
On December 13, 2017, Redbox offered a new service called Redbox On Demand. Like Redbox Instant, it is a streaming service, but based on a different model. It does not require any membership, and the list will contain new releases as well as several titles that it is claimed will never be available on services like Netflix.[56]The service launched with 6,000 titles for on demand rental or electronic sell-through in line with its kiosk operations. The titles come from themajor film studios' libraries except for Disney and Lionsgate.[103]
Redbox Free Live TV was an ad supported channel based video on demand service. The service was soft launched in early February 2020 with a nationwide launch on February 18. Nearly 30 channels were offered—three self-branded channels: Redbox Rush (action and adventure), Redbox Comedy and Redbox Spotlight, featured and recommended titles. The service's launch content partner was Lionsgate. Other content suppliers includeAmerica's Funniest Home Videos,Cinedigm,Comedy Dynamics,Fremantle,FilmRise,Gravitas,Jukin Media,Kabillion, Maverick Movies, People Are Awesome,TMZ, andUSA Today.[62]
Redbox Entertainmentwas Redbox’s content acquisition and production division.
On April 23, 2019, Redbox acquired the indie filmBenjaminfor an exclusive 90-day release period via its kiosks and on demand service as a Redbox Original.[59]In October 2019, Redbox formed its film and TV series acquisition division, Redbox Entertainment, with Marc Danon as senior advisor of content acquisition.[60]Then Redbox Entertainment exclusively picked up the distribution rights toAssailant,[104]which was released in March 2022, andVendetta,[105]which was released in May 2022.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
