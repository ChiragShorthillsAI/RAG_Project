Tillis a 2022biographicaldrama filmdirected byChinonye Chukwuand written by Michael Reilly,Keith Beauchamp, and Chukwu, and produced by Beauchamp, Reilly, andWhoopi Goldberg. It is based on the true story ofMamie Till, an educator and activist who pursued justice after the murder of her 14-year-old sonEmmettin August 1955. The film starsDanielle Deadwyleras Mamie andJalyn Hallas Emmett.Kevin Carroll,Frankie Faison,Haley Bennett,Jayme Lawson,Tosin Cole,Sean Patrick Thomas,John Douglas Thompson,Roger Guenveur Smith, and Goldberg also appear in supporting roles.
The film was officially announced in August 2020, though a project about Emmett Till's murder had been in the works forseveral years prior. Much of the main cast joined the following summer, and filming took place inBartow County, Georgia, that fall. It is the second major media property based on Mamie Till to be released in 2022, following the television seriesWomen of the Movement. The film is dedicated in memory of Mamie Till's life and legacy and its release coincided with the October 2022 unveiling of astatue in Emmett Till's memoryinGreenwood, Mississippi.[5]
Tillhad its world premiere at theNew York Film Festivalon October 1, 2022, was theatrically released in the United States on October 14, 2022, byUnited Artists Releasing, and was released in the United Kingdom on January 6, 2023, byUniversal Pictures. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for Deadwyler's performance, and was named one of the best films of 2022 by theNational Board of Review. For her performance,Deadwyler received several awards, including nominations for theBAFTA,Critics' ChoiceandSAG Award for Best Actress.[6]It grossed $11 million against a production budget of $20 million.[2]
In August 1955, 14-year-oldEmmett Tilllived with his mother,Mamie, at 6427 South Saint Lawrence Avenue inChicago, Illinois. Before Emmett leaves to visit relatives inMoney,Mississippi, Mamie warns him to be extra careful around white people. At a train station, the Tills meet with Mamie's uncle, Moses "Preacher" Wright, and Emmett's cousin, Wheeler Parker. After picking cotton on a sharecropper plantation, Emmett and his cousins purchase candy at the Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market. At the cash register, Emmett tells Carolyn Bryant that she looks like a movie star before showing her a photograph of a white girl in his wallet. Carolyn follows Emmett outside of the store, where hewhistlesat her. Disgusted, Carolyn retrieves a shotgun from her vehicle as Till and his relatives flee from the store.
In the early hours of August 28, Carolyn's husband, Roy, and his half-brother, John William "J. W." Milam, arrive at the Wrights' house and force themselves inside. They locate Emmett inside one of the bedrooms and force him to put on his clothes before kidnapping him. Emmett’s great-aunt Elizabeth offers the men money, but Milam refuses. Before leaving, Milam holds Wright hostage with a gun. Inside one of the other vehicles, Carolyn identifies Till and the Bryants drive off into the night. Emmett is then badly beaten, fatally shot, and his body is dumped into theTallahatchie River.
Back in Chicago, Mamie is informed of Emmett's kidnapping. Her cousin, Rayfield Mooty, arranges her to meet with William Huff, the counsel for the NAACP chapter in Chicago. At his office, Huff inquires about Mamie's past marriages as her personal history will be questioned. Meanwhile, the police locate Till's corpse along the river. Upon hearing the news, Mamie collapses in shock. Despite Mooty's reservations, Mamie asks for Emmett's body to be transferred back to Chicago. Shortly after, his coffin arrives on train, and Mamie cries in anguish upon seeing it. After seeing Emmett's mutilated corpse on an autopsy table, Mamie has anopen casket funeralfor Emmett to reveal what had been done to him. Emmett's killing and funeral garner national headlines across America.
Milam and Bryant are charged for their actions in relation to Till's killing. Accompanied by her father, Mamie travels toMound Bayouto help represent Emmett for the trial. At theRegional Council, headed byT. R. M. Howard, Howard asks Mamie to consider her future after the trial as her activism can help galvanize federal support for voting rights toward Black Americans. On the first day of the trial, the defense team requests a recess after learning of another witness, to which the judge agrees and adjourns.
During the recess, the prosecution locatesWillie Reed, who was an eyewitness to Till's killing. The next day, Wright and Reed give their testimonies, and the former identifies Milam as the culprit who held his family at gunpoint. Next, Mamie goes before the trial, testifying she could identify the corpse as her son. The defense then cross-examines Mamie, as she had told the "colored press" she warned Emmett on how to conduct himself in Mississippi. Later, on the witness stand, Carolyn Bryant testifies that Emmett grabbed her by the waist[7]and told her that he had previousinterracial romance. Angered, Mamie leaves the courtroom sure that she already knows the verdict.
After an hour, theall-white and all-male Mississippi jury[8]acquits Milam and Bryant of Till's killing. Later, at an NAACP rally inHarlem, Mamie criticizes the Mississippi criminal justice system for victim blaming and the United States for failing in its promise for equal justice. She returns home and fondly remembers Emmett as she imagines him in his room.
The post-credits state that Mamie's actions galvanized theCivil Rights Act of 1957. She dedicated her life to teaching children while continuing to fight for civil rights in America.
On August 27, 2020, it was announced thatChinonye Chukwuwould write and direct a feature film based on the life ofMamie Till-Mobleyand her fight for justice after the lynching of her 14-year-son,Emmett Till. Produced byOrion Pictures, the film uses 27 years' worth of research byKeith Beauchamp, whose efforts led to the reopening of Till's case by theUnited States Department of Justicein 2004. Simeon Wright, Till's cousin and an eyewitness of the event, served as a consultant to the project until his death in 2017. Chukwu's screenplay is based on a draft she previously co-wrote with Beauchamp and producer Michael Reilly.[13]In July 2021,Danielle DeadwylerandWhoopi Goldbergjoined the cast.[9]Jalyn Hall was cast as Emmett Till that August.[10]Filming began inBartow County, Georgia, in September 2021.[14]By the end of the year,Frankie Faison,Jayme Lawson,Tosin Cole,Kevin Carroll,Sean Patrick Thomas,John Douglas Thompson,Roger Guenveur Smith, andHaley Bennettwere confirmed to star.[11][12]
During post-production, the musical score was composed byAbel Korzeniowski.[15]
The film received alimited releasein the United States on October 14, 2022, and Canada on October 21, 2022, before awide releaseon October 28, 2022, byUnited Artists Releasingunder theOrion Pictureslabel.[16]Outside of the US, it was distributed byUniversal Pictures,[17]including its release in the United Kingdom on January 6, 2023. The film premiered at theNew York Film Festivalon October 1, 2022, and was screened at the66th BFI London Film Festivalon October 15, 2022, and at the 31stPhiladelphia Film Festivalthat same month.[18][19][20]The distributor also invited high school students to special screenings of the film in New York'sAlice Tully Hall; showings of the film and questionnaires with the filmmakers were simultaneously shared online.[21]The film was also screened forUS PresidentandFirst LadyJoeandJill Bidenat theWhite HouseinWashington, D.C., on February 16, 2023.
Tillis the second last film by United Artists Releasing under the banner of Orion Pictures, following the shutdown of the predecessor company byAmazon Studiosdue to the lack of box office likeBones and AllandWomen Talking(also being the last film) as a result of general public no longer supportingprestige filmsreleased during the late-2022 awards season period, and the decision of the Amazon Studios'Airin theatres in 2023 following the 96th Academy Awards buzz.Women Talkingis also a last film following the Amazon's acquisition of Orion Pictures.[22]
The film was released forVODplatforms on November 22, 2022, followed by aBlu-rayandDVDrelease on January 17, 2023.[23]
In the United States and Canada, the film made $242,269 from 16 theaters in its opening weekend.[24][25]It held this record as the highest platform release opening of the year untilThe Whaletwo months later.[26]In its second weekend the film made $363,541 from 104 theaters.[27]Expanding to 2,058 theaters in its third weekend, the film made $1.03 million on its first day[28]and would go on to gross $2.7 million over the weekend, finishing sixth.[29]In its second weekend of wide release the film made $1.88 million (marking a drop of 32%).[30]Varietyattributed these results to the general public showing the early stages of refusal to see and supportprestige filmsin theaters in a moviegoing environment altered by theCOVID-19 pandemic, along with the possibility that the film's subject matter may have been seen as uncomfortable for audiences to handle.[31]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 96% of 195 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Tillreframes an historically horrific murder within a mother's grief, brought heartwrenchingly to life by Danielle Deadwyler's tremendous performance."[32]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 77 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[33]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film a rare average grade of "A+", and those atPostTrakgave the film a 91% overall positive score, with 87% saying they definitely would recommend it.[28]
Michael O'Sullivan ofThe Washington Postgave the film four complete stars, writing: "It's Deadwyler who holds our attention—our gaze and our hearts—and who does so with a masterful control. Even at Mamie's most shattered, an inextinguishable ember of courage and purpose seems to smolder at the core of the character."[34]Peter TraversofABC NewsfeltTill"is more than a movie—it's essential viewing." He further praised Deadwyler's performance, writing she "is too good to let a movie turn Black trauma into cheesy Oscar bait. Even when the film lets conventional biopic tropes mess with momentum, Deadwyler never loses her uncanny connection to the female warrior she's playing."[35]Manohla DargisofThe New York Timeshighlighted Chukwa's fixed focus on Mamie Till, to which she also praised Deadwyler for "delivering a quiet, centralizing performance that works contrapuntally with the story's heaviness, its profundity and violence."[36]
Michael Phillipsof theChicago Tribunealso noted Chukwa's direction and Deadwyler's performance, but felt more screen time was needed to justify "Mamie's transformation from relatively apolitical Chicagoan to an urgently engaged citizen of a wider world."[37]Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkerstated the film "is a work of mighty cinematic portraiture, with a range of closeups of Mamie that infuse the film with an overwhelming combination of subjective depth and an outward sense of purpose. These images depend for that vast spectrum of feeling upon Deadwyler's performance, one of the most radiantly, resonantly expressive to grace the screen this year."[38]Brian Lowry ofCNNfelt there's "a difficult-to-avoid aspect to the production that can't entirely escape a movie-of-the-week feel," but nevertheless wrote: "Anchored by Danielle Deadwyler's towering performance, it's a wrenching portrayal of reluctant heroism under the most horrific of parental circumstances."[39]
Peter Debruge ofVarietywrote: "It would take a tough constitution not to be moved byTill, although that doesn't necessarily make it great drama ... Chukwu's first wish is clearly not to re-victimize Emmett Till, but in eliding such details and avoiding the torture, Chukwu relies perhaps too much on our imagination."[40]Kate Erbland, reviewing on the websiteIndiewire, gave the film a mixed response: "While Deadwyler turns in a remarkable performance as Mamie, beautifully calibrating her love and anger in one riveting package, the rest ofTillis prone to trope-ridden, predictable sequences that do little to advance her story or Emmett's legacy."[41]
Despite receiving nominations in several other ceremonies, Deadwyler was controversially not nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Actressat the95th Academy Awards, prompting Chukwu to criticise the film industry for "upholding whiteness and perpetuating an unabashed misogyny towards Black women".[42][43]In the wake of this decision, widely considered a snub,[44]film critic Robert Daniels of theLos Angeles Timeslamented on how the film industry at large fails Black women, with the lack of a nomination for Deadwyler orViola DavisinThe Woman Kingserving to exemplify this.[45]

Orion Releasing, LLC(doing business asOrion Pictures) is an Americanfilm productionanddistributioncompany owned by theAmazon MGM Studiossubsidiary ofAmazon.
It was founded in 1978 asOrion Pictures Corporation, ajoint venturebetweenWarner Bros.and three former senior executives atUnited Artists(UA). The company produced and released films from 1978 through 1999 and was also involved in television production and syndication in the 1980s and early 1990s. It was one of the largest mini-major studios during its early years, when it worked with prominent directors such asWoody Allen,James Cameron,Jonathan Demme, andOliver Stone.[3]Four films distributed by Orion wonAcademy AwardsforBest Picture:Amadeus(1984),Platoon(1986),Dances with Wolves(1990), andThe Silence of the Lambs(1991).[4]
In 1997, Orion was acquired byMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM), which revived the Orion name for television in 2013 and relaunched Orion Pictures a year later. In 2022, Amazon acquired Orion when it acquired MGM.
On February 6, 1978, three executives ofTransamerica(TA)-owned studioUnited Artists(UA)—Arthur B. Krim(chairman),Eric Pleskow(president and chief executive officer), andRobert Benjamin(chairman of the finance committee)—quit their jobs. Krim and Benjamin had headed UA since 1951 and subsequently turned around the then-flailing studio with a number of critical and commercial successes. Change had begun once Transamerica purchased UA in 1967 and, within a decade, a rift formed between Krim and Transamerica chairmanJohn R. Beckettconcerning the studio's operations. Krim suggested spinning off UA into a separate company which was rejected by Beckett.[5]
The last straw came for Pleskow when he refused to collect and deliver the medical records of UA department heads to Transamerica's offices in San Francisco for the sake of confidentiality. The tensions only worsened whenFortunemagazine reported an article on the clash between UA and TA in which Beckett had stated that, if the executives disliked the parent company's treatment of them, they should resign.[5]Krim, Benjamin and Pleskow quit UA on January 13, 1978, followed by the exits of senior vice presidents William Bernstein andMike Medavoythree days later. The week following the resignations, according to the websiteReference for Business, 63 important Hollywood figures took out an advertisement in a trade paper warning Transamerica that it had made a fatal mistake in letting the five men leave. The 'fatal mistake' came true following the box-office disaster ofHeaven's Gate[6]in 1980 which led to Transamerica selling UA toMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM).[7]
That same year, the five men forged a deal withWarner Bros.[8]The executives formed Orion Pictures Company, named afterthe constellationwhich they claimed had five main stars (it actually has seven or eight). The new company intended only to finance projects, giving the filmmakers complete creative autonomy; this ideal had been successfully implemented at United Artists. Orion held a $100 million line of credit and its films would be distributed by theWarner Bros.studio. Orion, however, was contractually given free rein over distribution and advertising as well as the number and type of films the executives chose to invest in.[9]
In late March 1978, Orion signed its first contract, a two-picture deal withJohn Travolta's production company. Contracts with actress and directorBarbra Streisand; actorsJames Caan,Jane Fonda,Peter Sellers,Jon Voight, andBurt Reynolds; directorsFrancis Ford CoppolaandBlake Edwards; writer/directorJohn Milius; singerPeter Frampton; and producerRay Starksoon materialized.[6][10]Orion also developed a co-financing and distribution deal withEMI Films.[6]In its first year, Orion had fifteen films in production and had a dozen more actors, directors and producers lining up to sign with them.[6]
In October 1979, Benjamin died.[11]Orion's first film,A Little Romance,[12]was released in April that year. Later that year, Orion releasedBlake Edwards'10which became a commercial success, the first for Edwards in over a decade (aside from installments ofThe Pink Pantherfranchise). Other films released by Orion over the next two years included a few successes such asCaddyshack(1980) andArthur(1981); critically praised but underperforming films such asThe Great Santini(1979), an adaptation of aPat Conroynovel, andSidney Lumet'sPrince of the City(1981); and pictures by young writer-directors such asPhilip Kaufman'sThe Wanderers(1979) andNicholas Meyer's debutTime After Time(1979); plusMonty Python's Life of Brian(1979) which Orion only distributed in the United States. Out of the 23 films Orion released between April 1979 and December 1981, only a third of them made a profit.[13]Orion executives were conflicted over financing big-budgeted films and passed onRaiders of the Lost Ark(1981) for that reason.[14]
By early 1982, Orion had severed its distribution ties with Warner Bros. As part of the deal, the rights to Orion's films made up to that point were sold to Warner Bros. Orion was now looking to have its own distribution network by acquiring another company with such capabilities. The four partners looked intoAllied ArtistsandEmbassy Pictures[15]before settling onFilmways.[16]Orion subsequently purchased Filmways and reorganized the flailing company. New employees were hired and all of Filmways' non-entertainment assets (Grosset & DunlapandBroadcast Electronics) were sold off.[6][16]
Another result of the merger was that Orion entered television production. Orion's biggest TV hit wasCagney & Lacey, which lasted seven seasons onCBS. In 1983, Orion Pictures introduced art-house divisionOrion Classicswith executives who had previously runUnited Artists Classics.[16][17]
Out of the initial 18 films released by the firm under the name of Orion Pictures Corporation, ten made profits, five just managed to cover their costs, and three suffered losses under $2 million.[6]One such film,Francis Ford Coppola'sThe Cotton Club, was mired in legal troubles and Orion lost $3 million of its investment.[6]"We've had some singles and doubles [but haven't] had any home runs," lamented Krim.[6]In September 1984, Orion distributedAmadeus, which garnered many accolades, winning eightAcademy Awards, includingBest Picture.[6]That year, on April 3, 1984, Orion Pictures launched Orion Entertainment Group, that would consist of four groups, Orion Television, Orion Home Video, Orion Pay Television and Orion Television Syndication, and the new organization would produce and distribute product for television, home video, pay and syndicated markets, withJamie Kellnerserving as president.[18]On October 26, 1984, the company released theJames Cameron-directedscience fiction filmThe Terminatorwhich was well received by critics and audience and led to a franchise involving five further films. However, Orion distributed none of the follow-ups.
For Orion, 1985 was a dismal year. All but two films,Desperately Seeking SusanandCode of Silence, made less than $10 million at the United States box office, including an unsuccessful attempt at aJames Bond-type franchise,Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins.[6]Orion's haphazard distribution channels and unsuccessful advertising campaigns made it impossible to achieve a hit. Another factor was that Orion was about to venture into the video business and stopped selling home-use rights to its films. Furthermore, the production of theRodney DangerfieldcomedyBack to Schoolwas put on hold when a co-producer died, taking the film off of its Christmas 1985 release slate.[19]
In January 1986,Mario KassarandAndrew Vajna, producers of theRambofilms (the first film,First Blood, was distributed by Orion) attempted to buy $55 million worth of the studio's stock through the duo's company,Anabasis. Had they succeeded, Kassar and Vajna would have controlled the board and laid off every executive save for Krim.[19]Warburg Pincus subsequently limited its 20% stake in Orion to 5%; the remaining stock was acquired byViacom International.[6]Viacom hoped to use Orion's product for its pay-TV channelShowtime.[20]Orion expanded into home video distribution with the formation of Orion Home Entertainment Corporation in 1985,[21]which began distributing videos under theOrion Home Videolabel in 1987 (before OHV's formation,HBO Videoand their predecessors, as well as former Orion's partnerWarner Home Video,Vestron VideoandEmbassy Home Entertainment, had been responsible for home media releases of Orion product).[6]
On May 22, 1986, a 6.5% stake in Orion was purchased byMetromedia, a television and communications company controlled by billionaire (and a friend of Krim's)John Kluge. Metromedia had just divested its television station group toRupert Murdoch'sNews Corporation(which would form what is now theFox network). Kluge's investment in Orion came at the right time;Back to Schoolwas a success that earned $90 million at the box office.[6]By March 1987, the studio's fortunes had increased dramatically with a succession of critical and commercial hits, includingPlatoon(which ultimately won a Best Picture Oscar), Woody Allen'sHannah and Her Sisters, and the sports filmHoosiers. Orion's 1986 offerings drew 18 Academy Award nominations, more than any other studio.[6]In 1987, Orion achieved further success withRoboCopandNo Way Out.[6]By this time, Orion's television division had expanded into the lucrative syndicated game show market under the name Century Towers Productions, a reference to Orion's street address. It produced revivals of format inherited fromHeatter-Quigley Productions, owned since the late 1960s by Filmways; this includedThe New Hollywood Squares, which ran from 1986 to 1989, and a revival ofHigh Rollersthat aired in the 1987–88 season. 1987 also saw the arrival of formerCBS/Fox Videoexecutive Len White, who became president and CEO of Orion Home Video, with plans to release its first home video titles in the third or fourth quarter of that year; he reported to Larry Hilford, who joined the home video division two years earlier.[22]
In January 1987, Kluge faced competition with the arrival ofSumner Redstone, whose theater chain,National Amusements, purchased 6.42 percent of Orion's stock. National Amusements later acquired Viacom, increasing their Orion stake to 21%, then 26%. Soon Kluge started buying more Orion stock, touching off a battle with Redstone over control of the company.[23][24]Kluge won on May 20, 1988, when Metromedia took over about 67% of Orion.[6]One analyst toldThe Wall Street Journal: "This amount is probably so small to Kluge it doesn't matter. He probably burns that up in a weekend."[6]
In 1989, Orion suffered from a disastrous slate of films, placing dead last among larger Hollywood studios by box office revenue. Among its biggest flops that year wereGreat Balls of Fire!, a biography ofJerry Lee LewisstarringDennis QuaidandWinona Ryder;She-Devil, a dark comedy starringMeryl StreepandRoseanne Barr;Speed Zone, an action-comedy vehicle forSCTValumniJohn Candy,Joe Flaherty, andEugene Levy; andMiloš Forman's adaptation ofLes Liaisons dangereuses,Valmont, which competed withDangerous Liaisons, also based on the same source material. Test screenings of the"Weird Al" YankoviccomedyUHFwere so strong that Orion had high expectations for it, but it flopped at the box office (though it later developed a cult following on video).[6][25]Also that year, it signed a deal withNelson Entertainmentto distribute titles on videocassette and theatrically.[26][27]
In February 1990, Orion signed a deal withColumbia Pictures Entertainmentin which the much larger studio would pay Orion $175 million to distribute Orion's movies and television programs overseas. Orion had previously licensed its films to individual distributors territory by territory.[6]That same month, Mike Medavoy left Orion and became head ofTri-Star Pictures.[28]
The box-office returns for Orion's 1990 releases were just as dismal, with failures inThe Hot SpotandState of Grace. The only bright spot wasKevin Costner's western epicDances with Wolves,which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture,[29]and grossed $400 million worldwide. A few months later, Orion garnered another winner withThe Silence of the Lambs, but these two films could not make up for years of losses. Only Kluge's continued infusions of cash were enough to keep the company afloat, but soon he had enough.
Kluge first attempted to sell Orion to businessman (and former20th Century Foxowner)Marvin Davis.Sony, which had recently purchasedColumbia Pictures, was also interested.[30]When those talks fell through, Kluge took drastic steps. First, Orion shut down production. Second, Kluge ordered the sale of several projects, such asThe Addams Family(which went toParamount, though the international rights to the film were retained by Orion), in order to accumulate much-needed cash. Finally, in the spring of 1991, Kluge's people took over the company, leading to the departure of Arthur Krim.[31]Orion's financial problems were so severe, that at the 63rd Annual Academy Awards in March 1991, hostBilly Crystalmade reference to Orion's debt in his opening monologue, joking that "Reversal of Fortune[is] about a woman in a coma,Awakenings[is] about a man in a coma; andDances with Wolves[was] released by Orion, a studio in a coma."[32]
It was during this time thatABCstepped in to co-finance and assume production over many of Orion TV's shows it had in production, such asAmerican DetectiveandEqual Justice. After Orion had to shut the television division down, this resulted in projects likeThe Chuck Woolery Show, which was planned to be produced by Orion, instead having to find new production companies (such asGroup W Productionsin the case of Woolery).[33]Gary Nardino, former employee of Orion Television Entertainment, moved on to producing forLorimar Television, taking some of Orion's projects with him, includingBill & Ted's Excellent AdventuresonFox, andHearts are Wild, a co-production withSpelling Television, forCBS; talent deals Orion Television had at the time (withThomas Carter,Robert Townsend, Paul Stajonovich, Clifton Campbell andDeborah Joy Levine) were also taken by Nardino to Lorimar.[34]On November 25, 1991, Orion sold itsHollywood Squaresformat rights toKing World Productionsafter Orion closed down its television division.[35]
On December 11, 1991, Orion filed forChapter 11 bankruptcyprotection.[6]That same month, Orion was in talks withNew Line Cinema, a successful independent film company, to acquire the bankrupt studio. By the following April, Orion and New Line Cinema cancelled their plans on the issue of price.Republic Picturesand the then-newSavoy Picturesalso attempted to buy Orion, but no deal materialized.[36][37]
In February 1992, Bernstein, who was president and chief executive of Orion at that point, resigned from the studio, Bernstein would go on to become executive vice president at Paramount Pictures.[38][39]
At the Academy Awards ceremony, broadcast on March 30, 1992, Crystal made another reference to Orion, this time about its demise:
Take a great studio like Orion: a few years ago Orion releasedPlatoon, it wins Best Picture.Amadeus, Best Picture. Last year, they releasedDances with Wolveswins Best Picture. This yearThe Silence of the Lambsis nominated for Best Picture. And they can't afford to have another hit! But there is good news and bad news. The good news is that Orion was just purchased, and the bad news is it was bought by the House of Representatives.[40]
The Silence of the Lambsswept all five major Academy Awards; however, a majority of key executives, as well as the talent they had deals with, had left the studio. Hollywood observers had doubts that Orion would be resurrected to its former glory.[41]
In May 1992, it was reported that Pleskow was resigning from Orion on July 1 of that year.[42]stating in the New York Times: "There is little for me to do at this point".[43]
On November 5, 1992, Orion reemerged from bankruptcy. Its reorganization plan would allow for Orion to continue producing and releasing films, but financing for the features would be provided by outside sources, with the studio purchasing the distribution rights to them after their completion.[44][45]
Orion's bankruptcy also delayed the release of many films the studio had produced or acquired, among them:Love Field(1992),RoboCop 3(1993),The Dark Half(1993),Blue Sky(1994),Car 54, Where Are You?(1994),Clifford(1994),The Favor(1994), andThere Goes My Baby(1994). Orion started releasing these films after their reorganization.Blue Skywon starJessica Langean Academy Award for Best Actress in 1995.
In August 1994, Orion Home Video partnered withStreamline Picturesin distributing the latter's licensedanimevideo titles to general retailers, which animation historianFred Pattenconsidered a major development in anime's growing popularity in Americanpop culture.[46]
In November 1995, Orion, two other companies controlled by Kluge, and film and TV houseMCEGSterling (producer of theLook Who's Talkingseries) were merged to form the Metromedia International Group.[47]Few of the films released during the four years afterbankruptcy protectionwere successful either critically or commercially.
In 1996, Metromedia acquired production companyMotion Picture Corporation of America, and installed its heads, Brad Krevoy and Steve Stabler, as co-presidents of Orion. Both received a six picture put picture distribution deal as a part of their contracts.[48]
In the years ahead, Orion produced very few films, and primarily released films from other producers, includingLIVE Entertainment.Orion Classics, minus its founders (who had moved toSony Pictures Entertainmentand foundedSony Pictures Classics), continued to acquire popularart-housefilms, such asBoxing Helena(1993), before Metromedia merged the subsidiary withSamuel Goldwyn Entertainmentin 1996.
In July 1997, Metromedia shareholders approved the sale of Orion Pictures (as well as Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment andMotion Picture Corporation of America) toMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM). This led to the withdrawal of 85 employees, including Krevoy and Stabler, while 111 other employees were to be laid off within nine months, leaving 25 of them to work at MGM. Orion Pictures also brought with it a two-thousand film library, ten completed movies and five direct-to-video features for future release[49]and the Krevoy and Stabler movie put picture distribution deal.[48]Krevoy and Stabler retained the right to the Motion Picture Corporation of America name and their three top movies. Metromedia retained Goldwyn Entertainment's Landmark Theatre Group.[49]One Man's Hero(1999) was the last film released by Orion Pictures for 15 years.
MGM kept Orion Pictures intact as a corporation, mostly to avoid its home video distribution agreement withWarner Home Videoand began distributing Orion Pictures films under the Orion Home Video label. MGM acquired the two thirds of the pre-1996PolyGram Filmed Entertainmentlibrary (which included theEpic film library) fromSeagramin 1999 for $250 million, increasing their library holdings to 4,000. The PolyGram libraries were purchased by its Orion Pictures subsidiary so as to avoid its 1990 home video distribution agreement with Warner Home Video.[50]In March 1999, MGM bought out its distribution contract with Warner Home Video for $225 million, effectively ending the distribution problem.[51]
In 2013, Orion returned to television production (after its original TV unit was shut down during its bankruptcy period) with a new syndicatedcourt show,Paternity Court.[52]

Worldwide Gross
Almost all of Orion's post-1982 releases, as well as most of the AIP and Filmways backlogs and all of the television output originally produced and distributed by Orion Television, now bear the MGM name. However, in most cases, the 1980s Orion logo has been retained or added, in the case of the Filmways and AIP libraries.
Most ancillary rights to Orion's back catalog from the 1978–1982 joint venture period remain with Warner Bros., including such films as10(1979),Caddyshack(1980),Arthur(1981),Excalibur(1981), andPrince of the City(1981). Some post-1982 films originally released by Orion—Lionheart(1987),The Unbearable Lightness of Being(1988), andAmadeus(1984) (the latter two beingSaul Zaentzproductions)—are currently distributed by Warner Bros. as well.HBOalso owns video distribution rights toThree Amigos(1986), as they co-produced the film and owns pay-TV rights. However, MGM owns all other rights and the film's copyright.[citation needed]The Wanderersis owned by the film's producers; however, the copyright is held by MGM/Orion. Orion also retains a controlling interest inThe Cotton Club, although major rights are now withLionsgate, which owns the library of presenting studioZoetrope Corporation.
Woody Allen's filmsA Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy(1982) andZelig(1983) are the only Orion films from the original joint venture period now owned by MGM, as the rights for them remained with Allen, who sold them to MGM in 2000.[79]Orion releases produced by theHemdale Film CorporationandNelson Entertainmentare included in MGM's library as well, and are incorporated into the Orion library. MGM did not acquire the Hemdale films (which includeThe Terminator,Hoosiers, andPlatoon) or the Nelson films (including theBill & Tedfilms) until MGM bought the pre-1996 library of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment (the "Epic library"), which included both companies' libraries, although the television and digital rights to certain Nelson films are now held byParamount Television(the result of a pre-existing deal Nelson had with Viacom), with television syndication handled on behalf of Paramount Television byTrifecta Entertainment & Media.
Many of the film and television holdings ofThe Samuel Goldwyn Companyhave now also been incorporated into the Orion library (with ownership currently held by MGM), and the copyright on some of this material is held by Orion, exceptThe New Adventures of Flippernow carries the MGM Television Entertainment copyright.[citation needed]
MGM still holds distribution rights to the 1980s revival ofHollywood SquaresandHigh Rollersthe company produced, as well as the remnants of the Heatter-Quigley library that was not erased, including all remaining episodes of the originalSquares; they do not own the rights to the format, which is currently owned byCBS Television Distribution, successor-in-interest to King World, who purchased the format rights in 1991 and produced another syndicated revival from 1998 to 2004.
Orion distributed the firstRambo film,First Blood(1982).[80]That film, like the rest of theRambofranchise, is now owned byStudioCanalas a result of purchasing the library of its co-distributor,Carolco Pictures.[81]

Linked page for 'Eon Productions' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eon_Productions):
Eon Productions Limitedis a Britishfilm productioncompany that primarily produces theJames Bondfilm series. The company is based in London'sPiccadillyand also operates fromPinewood Studiosin the UK.
Eon was started by film producersAlbert R. "Cubby" BroccoliandHarry Saltzmanin July 1961, at the same time they became partners and sought financing forDr. No. The year before they formedDanjaq, which for legal reasons became Eon's holding company, from which it licenses the rights to produce theBondfilms.
Broccoli had been interested in theBondnovel rights for several years but was dissuaded from pursuing the project by his former partner. When they dissolved their relationship he was free to pursue the property, for which Saltzman, a novice to film production, had taken a gamble to acquire. The two were introduced by aNew Yorkwriter who was acquainted with both, and formed a partnership within a week of meeting. The enterprise was and is still a family business, including both wives of the principal partners, as well as several of their progeny, the latter group now carrying on their parents' work. Albert almost immediately includedDana Broccoli's college-aged sonMichael G. Wilsonin the early films, doing various production jobs.
In 1975, after nine films, Harry Saltzman sold his shares of Danjaq toUnited Artists(UA). Although Albert R. Broccoli died in 1996, Eon Productions is still owned by the Broccoli family, specifically Albert R. Broccoli's daughter,Barbara Broccoli, and his stepson and her half-brother by actress Dana Wilson Broccoli, Michael G. Wilson, who are the current producers of the films.
In February 2025,Amazon MGM Studiosand Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced the formation of a joint venture that would manage the franchise rights to James Bond, giving Amazon MGM full creative control from the Broccoli family.[2]
Albert R. Broccoli's name has appeared in the opening "presents" credit of every Eon-producedJames Bondfilm, and as the first name in the credits fromThe Spy Who Loved Meonwards. FromDr. NothroughThe Man with the Golden Gun, the credit was "Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli present"; for some films Broccoli came first. After Saltzman left, the opening credit was "Albert R. Broccoli presents" through toGoldenEye, which was the last film produced before Broccoli's death, even after Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson replaced him as producers. On all films since Broccoli's death, the opening credit is "Albert R. Broccoli's Eon Productions presents", with "Ltd." usually added after "Productions" in the film proper.[3]
The 1965 filmThunderballdiffers from the others in how it credits Saltzman and Broccoli; due to a legal agreement withKevin McCloryrelated to the rights to Ian Fleming's original novel, McClory received producer credit on the film, with Saltzman and Broccoli credited as executive producers. This agreement also gave McClory the rights to remakeThunderballin the future, resulting in the 1983 non-Eon production,Never Say Never Again. McClory would attempt to remake the story a second time in the 1990s, but was prevented from doing so. In 1999, Eon picked up the rights to theCasino Royalenovel after a lawsuit betweenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) andSony Picturesended as part of a trade deal that saw Sony acquiring MGM's interest in theSpider-Manfilm rights.[4]
The copyrights and trademarks for the film properties which began withDr. No, are held by Danjaq and United Artists Corporation; United Artists was bought by MGM in 1981, but as an MGM subsidiary its name still appears in Bond copyright and trademark disclaimers.Casino Royale(2006),Quantum of Solace(2008),Skyfall(2012) andSpectre(2015) were co-distributed withSony Pictures Releasingthrough itsColumbia Pictureslabel.[5]With the revival of United Artists – formed as a joint venture between MGM andAnnapurna Picturesunder the labelUnited Artists Releasing– as well as the expiration of Columbia Pictures' deal with the Bond franchise, the distribution ofNo Time to Die(2021) is shared between United Artists Releasing (domestically) andUniversal Pictures(internationally), while Danjaq retains the essential rights to the film.
The distribution rights for all of Eon's films are owned byMGM Home Entertainment, and were controlled by MGM's distributorWarner Bros. Home Entertainment(previously20th Century Fox Home Entertainment).[3][6]Sony Pictures Home Entertainmentinitially assumed the home video rights toCasino Royale, but the 2012 home video editions of this film were issued by MGM and 20th Century Fox.[3]Since 2020, WBHE took over the home entertainment distribution rights to the Bond films after MGM ended their home media agreement with Fox in June 2020, excluding the home media release ofNo Time to Die(which is handled byUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment, although both companies own a joint venture called Studio Distribution Services).[7][8]
TheBondfilms produced by Eon Productions are:
Other production companies were responsible for theBondproductionsCasino Royale(1954),Casino Royale(1967) andNever Say Never Again(1983); the first is a one-hour TV film produced for an anthology series and the others are feature films produced for the cinema.Never Say Never Againis a remake ofThunderball.
Since its first film,Dr. Noin 1962, Eon has made eight non-Bondfilms. Saltzman and Broccoli produced other films separately: Broccoli produced the filmChitty Chitty Bang Bang, based on a book byIan Fleming; Saltzman produced several non-Bondfilms during this time includingThe Ipcress FileandBattle of Britain.
Other non-Bondprojects from either 1963 or 1964 –The Marriage Gamewritten byTerry Southernand to have been directed byPeter Yates[9][10]andThe Pass Beyond Kashmirbased on the novel byBerkely Mather– did not go into production.[11]
In 2008, Eon signed a deal with Columbia Pictures to develop fifteen thrillers and family films outside theBondfranchise, with budgets of up to $80 million (£40 million). The company hopes the move will allow more British writers to establish themselves in the United States.[12]
Eon Productions produced the adaptation of Mark Burnell's first book in theStephanie Patrickseries, titledThe Rhythm Section. StarringBlake Livelyand directed byReed Morano, and distributed byParamount Pictures.[13][14]The film was released on 31 January 2020.[15]

Eon has made several theatre productions,[17]includingChitty Chitty Bang Bang, based on a book byIan Fleming, andOthello, starringDaniel Craig.

Keith Beauchamp(born 1971) is an Americanfilmmakerbased inBrooklynand best known for his extensive investigation of and films about thelynchingofEmmett Till.
Beauchamp was born in 1971 and grew up inBaton Rouge, Louisiana. He attendedSouthern Universitywhere he studied criminal justice until 1997, when he left the school to pursue a film career inNew York City.
Beauchamp began researching and writing for a documentary about the Till case in the late 1990s. He identified and interviewed witnesses and accomplices who were not originally interviewed in the case, and has been credited with building trust and accessing information through these interviews that would not have been otherwise provided to law enforcement officials. Beauchamp worked closely with Till's mother,Mamie Till-Mobley, who became a friend and mentor of his until her death in 2003.The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Tillwas released in 2005.
Beauchamp's research and advocacy led to the reopening of the Till case in 2004 which was closed again after finding no new evidence.[1]He was approached by theFederal Bureau of Investigationto aid in investigations of othercold casecivil rights homicides and produced a series of documentaries about those cases. Most recently, Beauchamp produced and co-wroteTill, a feature film focused on Till-Mobley's story released in October 2022.
Beauchamp was born in 1971[2]and grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in aCatholicandBaptistfamily.[3][4][5]When he was ten years old, he was investigating an oldJetmagazine his educator parents[6]kept and came across a story about thelynchingofEmmett Till.[7][8]The piece included photographs of Till prior to his murder as well as a photo of Till's mutilated body. Beauchamp's parents talked with Beauchamp about the case, explained its context in theAmerican Civil Rights Movementand warned him about enduring attitudes that remained a threat to Beauchamp's safety as a young man. Beauchamp describes this conversation as the beginning of his lifelong devotion to investigating the Till case.[3][8]
In 1989, an undercover police officer dragged Beauchamp out of a nightclub, beat him, and arrested him, allegedly for dancing with a white classmate at the club. Beauchamp credits this experience with a deeper understanding of Till's story and further motivation to examine the case.[8][6]
Considering a career in civil rights law, Beauchamp attended atSouthern Universitywhere he studied criminal justice but left before graduation to pursue an entertainment career.[8]
In 1997, Beauchamp moved toNew York Citywhere he worked writing and producing music videos for Big Baby Films, a production company owned by friends. Beauchamp quickly began focusing on research and writing for a documentary film about the Till case, and in 1999, he founded Till Freedom Come Productions.[4][2][8]
Beauchamp began his research using public librarymicroformarchives, where he encountered several names of witnesses and alleged accomplices who had never been questioned by authorities regarding the Till case. He set out to find and interview them.[8]A 2003 article inThe Nationexplained that Beauchamp "located and earned the trust of traumatized [B]lack witnesses from Mississippi’s back country who haven’t spoken of the case in nearly fifty years."[9]During filming, he was warned in some communities that he was endangering residents and two witnesses in the film would only agree to be pictured in silhouette for their own safety.[10]
During the film's research and production, Beauchamp worked closely with Till's mother,Mamie Till-Mobley, who famously insisted that her son's body be returned to Chicago and that his casket would remain open during the funeral. Beauchamp and Till-Mobley became close, speaking several times a day for eight years until her death in 2003.[8][7]The film was released in 2005.[2][11]
Over the course of the nine years Beauchamp spent researching the documentary, he identified several individuals, including five Black men, who he suspected had been involved in Till's murder in addition to the two who were arrested and acquitted of the crime in 1955.[8][11][3]
Throughout the film's production, due to extensive research into witnesses and potential accomplices who had never been questioned, Beauchamp advocated for reopening of the Till case.[11]On May 10, 2004, theUnited States Department of Justiceannounced that it would turn its 8,000 pages of information to 4th District Court of Mississippi Attorney Joyce Chiles, effectively reopening the case, but in 2007 a grand jury inLeflore County, Mississippideclined to indict anyone further.[8][12]The U.S. Department of Justice has credited Beauchamp's efforts with the decision to re-open the case.[3][13][14]
The case was reopened again in 2017 with renewed interest in Carolyn Bryant's culpability in Till's lynching, but was closed in 2021 without any new arrests.[15][16]
As a result of his documentary work, Beauchamp was approached by theFederal Bureau of Investigation(FBI)'s civil rights division to collaborate on cold cases. In 2007, he began working to produce additional documentaries about unsolved civil rights murders.[4][2]Beauchamp was given access to agents who worked on the cases, and he was able to interview new individuals as someone outside of law enforcement.[2][6]
Released in October 2022,[17]Tillfocuses on Till-Mobley's perspective of the Emmett Till story.[18]The film had been in production for over a decade[18]and starsWhoopi Goldbergas Till's grandmother, Alma;Danielle Deadwyleras Till-Mobley; andJalyn Hallas Emmett Till.[17]Beauchamp has expressed his desire for this film to help viewers become familiar with Till-Mobley's story and how significantly the Emmett Till case contributed to the beginnings of thecivil rights movementin the United States. According to Beauchamp, who co-wrote and produced the film,[7][17]"There is no other story that speaks more to this generation and to this political climate and racial climate of this country than the story of Emmett Louis Till."[18]
Beauchamp credits directorsSpike LeeandSteven Spielbergfor inspiring his work as a filmmaker, and Beauchamp has explained that he hopes to educate viewers about Black history in the same manner that Spielberg has brought awareness and education to Jewish history.[8]Beauchamp has donated many of his research materials to the Strozier Library atFlorida State University, whose special collections department contain an extensive repository of materials related to the Till case.[7]

Haley Loraine Keeling(born January 7, 1988), known professionally asHaley Bennett, is an American actress. She made her film debut in the romantic comedyMusic and Lyrics(2007) and has since appeared in films such asThe Equalizer(2014),The Magnificent Seven(2016),Hillbilly Elegy(2020), andCyrano(2021).
Bennett was born Haley Loraine Keeling inFort Myers, Florida, on January 7, 1988.[1]Her parents, Leilani (néeDorsey Bennett) and Ronald Keeling,[2][3]met in church and hitchhiked to Florida while Leilani was pregnant with her.[4]Bennett has Lithuanian ancestry through a maternal great-grandmother.[5][6][7]She was raised inNaples, Florida.[2]Her parents divorced when she was six years old and she moved toOhiowith her father, who opened an automobile repair shop there.[4]They moved regularly around the state, with Bennett later saying, "There was no time when I lived anywhere longer than two years. I was always a social outcast. Maybe I didn't care what people thought because I [thought], 'Well, I probably won't stick around here for too long.'"[4]Bennett describes her childhood as "nomadic", as she moved between living with her father in Ohio and her mother in Florida:
I lived somewhat of a nomadic life even when I lived in Ohio. We spent time in rural areas, in suburban areas, never really city areas. We rode four-wheelers. We had pigs and ferrets. And creeks. We had a creek in my backyard. It was likeHuckleberry Finn... I was kind of a tomboy for awhile. It's tough to explain because I grew up with my mom and my dad simultaneously but separately because they weren't together. So I kind of get femininity from my mother and boyishness from my dad. He loved fishing, he loves hunting, he loves boating, and football, baseball, and basketball. So that really saturated my life. And then my mother was very soft and also strong, but more of an artist. So I kind of had the best of both worlds.[8]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
