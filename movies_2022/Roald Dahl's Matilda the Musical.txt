The secondfilm adaptationof the novel, followingMatilda(1996), it starsAlisha Weiras thetitle character, alongsideLashana Lynch,Stephen Graham,Andrea Riseborough,Sindhu Vee, andEmma Thompson. In the plot, Matilda Wormwood (Weir), neglected and mistreated by her parents (Graham and Riseborough), developspsychokinetic abilitiesto deal with the injustices of life, as well asMiss Trunchbull(Thompson), the ruthless and cruel headmistress of Crunchem Hall School.
An adaptation of the stage musical was first announced in November 2013, with Warchus and Kelly reportedly attached to return as director and writer, respectively. In January 2020, the project was officially announced, and Warchus and Kelly's returns were confirmed, as well as Minchin, who revealed he was returning to write new songs for the film. Christopher Nightingale, who had written background music for the stage production, was also hired to return as composer of the film's incidental score. The cast was filled out between January and April 2021, including Weir, Lynch, Thompson, Vee, Graham, and Riseborough. Filming took place beginning in May 2021.
Roald Dahl's Matilda the Musicalpremiered at the66th BFI London Film Festivalon 5 October 2022, and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 25 November, bySony Pictures Releasing, while in the United States it received alimited theatrical releaseon 9 December and was available onNetflixon 25 December. The film received largely positive reviews from critics, and was nominated forOutstanding British FilmandBest Makeup and Hairat the76th British Academy Film Awards.
In a hospital, Mrs Wormwood disbelieves she is pregnant and in labour. The baby she births is a girl much to Mr Wormwood's dismay, as he wants a boy ("Miracle").Matildagrows into a sweet child who loves reading, despite the neglect of her parents. She visits the mobile librarian Mrs Phelps and tells her a story - in instalments - about an acrobat and an escapologist who have a baby together but who have their lives destroyed by a wicked sister.
Later, the authorities discover that Matilda has not been properly schooled, and teacher Miss Jennifer Honey suggests Matilda be sent to Crunchem Hall. Angry about being fined for not sending his daughter to school, Mr Wormwood tells tyrannical headmistress,Miss Agatha Trunchbull, that Matilda is a horrible child. In retaliation, Matilda mixes green hair dye into his hair tonic ("Naughty").
Arriving at school, Matilda and fellow new student Lavender are warned about the terrible way the students are treated ("School Song"). In Miss Honey's classroom, Matilda solves a complex mathematical equation on the board left there from a class for adults. She also admits reading several books every week. An impressed Miss Honey asks Trunchbull to move Matilda to a class with older children, but Trunchbull refuses to let Matilda be an exception to the rules ("The Hammer"). At home, when Matilda criticises her father, he rips her library book apart and sends her to bed; the next day, she retaliates by putting glue in his hat so it sticks to his head ("Naughty (reprise)").
During lunch, Trunchbull accuses Matilda of stealing a slice of her private chocolate cake, but Bruce Bogtrotter accidentally reveals he is the culprit by belching. The children explain Trunchbull's preferred method of punishment to be the Chokey, a tight, spiked cupboard ("Chokey Chant"). Trunchbull forces Bruce to eat the entire cake, which is nearly as big as he is, saying he will be forgiven if he eats every last crumb ("Bruce"). Bruce's success thrills Matilda, Miss Honey, and the students, but Trunchbull still punishes him by taking him out to the Chokey anyway. Afterwards, Matilda's classmates sing about their hopes for the future ("When I Grow Up").
After school, Matilda returns to Mrs Phelps and continues her story: the now-pregnant acrobat is forced to perform a dangerous stunt by her stepsister; she is horribly injured anddies after giving birth to a daughter. The escapologist forgives the stepsister and asks her to help him raise his daughter, but she is secretly cruel to the girl. When the escapologist discovers his daughter locked in the cellar, he comforts her before leaving to confront the stepsister, but never returns ("I'm Here").
The next day, Trunchbull forces the children through challenging military-style exercises to crush their rebelliousness ("The Smell of Rebellion"). Lavender slips her pet newt into Trunchbull's drinking water, causing her distress. Then Matilda stands up to Trunchbull, and uses her newly-discoveredtelekinesisfuelled by rage to hurl a cup at Trunchbull's head, causing Trunchbull to yell at her ("Quiet").
Miss Honey invites Matilda to her cottage, where Matilda learns that the escapologist and the acrobat were Miss Honey's parents, and the evil stepsister is Trunchbull ("My House"). Miss Honey tries to warn Matilda that Trunchbull is more dangerous than she realises. Matilda goes to the Chokey and uses her telekinesis to destroy it. Returning home, Matilda learns that her father has cheated theMafiaand that her family will be fleeing toSpain.
When the children return to school, Trunchbull forces Miss Honey's class to spell words correctly or be locked in a new Chokey. She has Lavender spell a tricky, made-up word, prompting the other children to purposely misspell words in rebellion. Trunchbull then reveals that she made a multitude of new Chokeys for every single child to be put in. Matilda uses her telekinesis to write on the blackboard pretending to be the ghost of Miss Honey's father. She tells her to give Miss Honey back her house or else. When Trunchbull refuses, a vast number of chains attack her but she resists. Finally, Matilda ties Trunchbull's hair into pigtails (much to her horror), and uses them to throw her out of the school. Miss Honey tells Trunchbull never to return, and takes back the keys to her father's house. After Trunchbull runs away, the students sing and perform a dance routine about revolting (with its double meaning in play) while destroying Trunchbull's statue ("Revolting Children").
Mr and Mrs Wormwood come to take Matilda to Spain with them, but Miss Honey asks them if Matilda might stay with her - she also asks Matilda if she wants this (she does). They let Matilda stay, and in return she unsticks her father's hat.
With Miss Honey as the new headmistress, the students rename Crunchem Hall "The Big Friendly School". They renovate the school and add a new playground and a giraffe. Matilda finishes her story for Mrs Phelps, who is overjoyed that Matilda's now true story has a happy ending ("Still Holding My Hand").

TriStar Pictures, Inc.(spelled asTri-Staruntil 1991) is an Americanfilm studioandproduction companythat is a member of theSony Pictures Motion Picture Group,[1]part of the multinational conglomerateSony Group Corporation. It is a corporate sibling of fellow Sony studio,Columbia Pictures.
TriStar Pictures was established on March 2, 1982, founded by Victor Kaufman as Nova Pictures, changed a year later to Tri-Star to avoid confusion with thePBSseriesNova.[3]Its most notable releases includeTerminator 2: Judgment Day,Basic Instinct,Rambo: First Blood Part IIand Hollywood’s first everGodzilla.
Originally a joint venture between Columbia Pictures,CBS, andHBO, whose individual video units handled video, broadcast, and pay cable rights to its products,[4]the company scored a number of box-office hits with modestly budgeted fare in the 1980s, as well as fortuitous distribution deals with theProducers Sales Organization,[5]Carolco Pictures[6]and theTaft Entertainment Group.[7]It also expanded ambitiously throughout the decade with the acquisition ofLoews Theatresand the formation ofits own television arm. Among the various hits TriStar scored on its own during the decade wereAbout Last Night,The Muppets Take Manhattan,Real Genius,Nothing in Common,Peggy Sue Got Married,The Principal,Look Who's TalkingandSteel Magnolias.
On November 15, 1985, CBS dropped out of the joint venture, selling its stake to Columbia Pictures.[8]HBO sold its shares to the same studio in 1986 in order to formHBO Pictures.[9]On December 21, 1987, Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. followingThe Coca-Cola Company's merger of Tri-Star and Columbia to become "Columbia/Tri-Star", of which it owned 80% of its stock.[10]In January 1988, CPE's stocks somewhat fell, and Coca-Cola decreased its shares in CPE to 49%. On April 13, 1988, the name of the company reverted to Tri-Star Pictures, Inc.[11]On November 8, 1989, theSony Corporation of Japanacquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment for $3.4 billion. On August 7, 1991, under Sony Pictures Entertainment, the hyphen was officially removed from the name of the studio. TriStar became the first new Americanmajor film studiosinceRKO Pictures, which was founded in 1928.
During the 1990s, TriStar operated autonomously from Columbia. Although its products were mostly indistinguishable from that of its sister studio, it soon scored a string of hits at the box office with such films asSleepless in Seattle,Philadelphia,The Mirror Has Two Faces,Jerry Maguire,As Good as It Gets,BugsyandJumanji, and it also scored a major video hit withDanny DeVito'sMatilda.[12]However, in 1998, the company fell on hard times following the box-office disappointment of its remake of theJapanesemonster filmGodzilla, and Sony quickly responded by merging the studio with Columbia to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Pictures Group.[13]The TriStar name was subsequently used by Sony on a very limited basis until 2004, when the company decided to turn the studio into a genre label that specialized in acquisitions.[14]In 2015, Sony formedTriStar Productionsas a vehicle for film and television productions.[15]TriStar Pictures is currently being used as a vehicle for distribution of products from that new entity and other items from Sony Pictures, including titles fromSony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions.[16]
TriStar Pictures is a member of theMotion Picture Association(MPA).[17]
The concept for Tri-Star Pictures can be traced to Victor Kaufman, a senior executive ofColumbia Pictures(then a subsidiary ofthe Coca-Cola Company),[18]who convinced Columbia,HBO, andCBSto share resources and split the ever-growing costs of making movies, leading to the creation of a new joint venture on March 2, 1982. On May 16, 1983, it was given the name Tri-Star Pictures (when the new company was formed and did not have an official name, the press used the code-name "Nova", but the name could not be obtained as it was being used as the title for thePBSscience series).[3][19]Tri-Star embarked on a 12 to 18 feature film slate per year, with a combined budget of $70 to $80 million and signed producer Walter Colbenz as vice president of the Tri-Star feature film studio, and signed initial development deals with directorJohn Schlesingerand producers Jeffrey Walker and Michael Walker.[20]Tri-Star's first project to roll out wasThe Muppets Take Manhattan.[21]
On May 11, 1984, Tri-Star's first produced film was released,The NaturalstarringRobert Redford. Tri-Star's first release, however, was the film,Where the Boys Are '84; a 1984remakeof the 1960Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) picture,Where the Boys Arethat was co-distributed on behalf ofITC EntertainmentafterUniversalrejected it; the film was a commercial flop.[22]
Many of Tri-Star's productions were released on VHS byRCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video,HBO/Cannon Video, orCBS/Fox Video. In addition, HBO owned exclusive cable distribution rights to the films, with broadcast television licenses going to CBS.[4]
On May 8, 1984, Tri-Star Pictures secured North American distribution rights for the filmSupergirlfromWarner Bros., which enabled the film to be ready for distribution by Christmas 1984.[23]On May 15, 1984, the studio hit big through its association withCarolco Pictures, with the release ofRambo: First Blood Part II, which eventually became a smash hit for the studio the following year.[6][24]The company also partnered withProducers Sales Organizationto handle theatrical distribution of the PSO titles,[5]while both Tri-Star and Columbia struck a deal for film financing with Delphi Film Associates.[25]
CBS dropped out of the Tri-Star venture in November 1985.[8]HBO also dropped out of the venture and sold half of its shares to Columbia Pictures following a month.[9][26]Despite the changes in majority ownership, Tri-Star continued ambition-laden expansion plans. Chief among these plans was an expansion of their successful relationship with Carolco; a new extension of their pre-existing deal included Tri-Star gaining theatrical distribution rights to various Carolco projects, includingRambo IIIandAir America;Carolco retained all foreign, cable, television and videocassette rights.[27]Taft/Barish Productions, a joint venture ofTaft BroadcastingandKeith Barish Productions, signed a $200 million domestic distribution deal with Tri-Star (much like Carolco, Taft/Barish retained non-theatrical and ancillary distribution rights). Of the four films to emerge from this pact, onlyThe Running Manwould become a major success.[7]
Another avenue of expansion was acquiring the storiedLoews Theaterschain of cineplexes in October 1986 for $300 million, after a deal to purchaseUnited Artists TheatersfromTele-Communications, Inc.did not come to fruition. At the time, Loews had 260 theaters in six states.[28][29][30]
1987 was another ambitious year for Tri-Star; plans were in place to take Tri-Star from a relatively new, untested film company into a major film studio. Components of these plans included the formation ofTriStar Television, and joining forces withStephen J. CannellProductions andWitt/Thomas/HarrisProductions to create a television distribution company known as TeleVentures; they also proposed forming their own home video label, Tri-Star Video, taking over from the trio of distributors (RCA/Columbia, CBS/Fox and HBO/Cannon).[31][32]A full-on international distribution arm was also in the planning stages.[33]Another distribution deal was signed by Tri-Star andHemdale Film Corporationin September 1987, but only one film,High Tide, would result from that deal.[34]
However, Tri-Star's ambitions were curtailed by yet more change in ownership.The Coca-Cola Companyboosted its stake in Tri-Star to 29.3% that September.[35]That December, following several high-profile flops (includingIshtar), Coca-Cola began a plan to get out of the media industry; Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc., and Coca-Cola sold its entertainment business to Tri-Star for $3.1 billion. Coca-Cola would then gradually reduce their holdings in the new company to 49%. Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names; a new Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. entity was created in April 1988.[10][11]
As a result, Tri-Star's television division was consolidated into a single operating entity withColumbia/EmbassyTelevision and Coca-Cola Television to form a new incarnation ofColumbia Pictures Television.Merv Griffin Enterpriseswould continue to operate separately.[36][37]Similarly, Tri-Star's nascent video division was absorbed into RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video.[38]
In 1989, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. was acquired by Japanese conglomerateSony Corporation, which merged Columbia and Tri-Star, but continued to use the separate labels. On July 11, 1990, Tri-Star Pictures dissolved and sold its venture in TeleVentures to Stephen J. Cannell Productions and TeleVentures became Cannell Distribution Co. Most of the series and the Tri-Star film packages that were distributed by TeleVentures were transferred to Columbia Pictures Television Distribution.[39]Sony Pictures Entertainment later revived TriStar Television as a television production banner in 1991 (by way of acquiring rights to shows fromNew World Television) and merged with its sister television studioColumbia Pictures Television(CPT) to formColumbia TriStar Television(CTT) on February 21, 1994.[40][41]Both studios continued to operate separately under the CTT umbrella until TriStar Television folded in 1999 and CPT folded in 2001.
In addition to its own slate, TriStar Pictures was the theatrical distributor for many films produced byCarolco Pictures(the rights to only one of its films,Cliffhanger, has been retained by TriStar). TriStar Pictures also theatrically distributed someFilmDistrictfilms. In 1992, TriStar Pictures, along withJapan Satellite Broadcastingsigned an agreement withThe IndieProd Companyto distribute movies produced by IndieProd in order to fill the void left by Carolco, whose deal with TriStar Pictures was on the verge of expiring amid financial troubles.[42]
Around summer 1998, SPE merged Columbia and TriStar to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group, but just like Columbia Pictures Entertainment, both divisions continued producing and distributing films under their own names. Some of the movies slated to be released by TriStar Pictures, includingStepmomwould go to Sony's flagship labelColumbia Picturesfollowing the merger.[13]
TriStar was relaunched on May 13, 2004, as a marketing and acquisitions unit that had a "particular emphasis on genre films".[14]Screen Gems' executive vice president Valerie Van Galder was tapped to run the revived studio after being dormant.[43]However, the release of its 2013 filmElysiumrepresented the label's first big-budget release sinceThe Mask of Zorroin 1998.
The same year, former20th Century Foxco-chairmanTom Rothmanjoined Sony Pictures and createdTriStar Productionsas a joint venture with existing Sony Pictures executives. The new TriStar would develop, finance and produce up to four films per year, as well as television programming and acquisitions, starting on September 1.[15][44][45]Sony's TriStarPicturesunit is currently being retained for "other product, including titles fromSony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions", and is distributing product from TriStar Productions.[16]
TriStar's logo features the winged horsePegasus(either stationary or flying across the screen). The idea came from executive Victor Kaufman and his family's interest in riding horses. The original logo was created with the assistance ofSydney Pollack, who was an adviser at Tri-Star. The horse in the original filmed logo was the same one used in Pollack's filmThe Electric Horseman.[46]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
