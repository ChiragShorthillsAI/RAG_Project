Marisa Tomei was born on December 4, 1964, inBrooklyn, New York City, to Adelaide "Addie" (néeBianchi), an English teacher, and Gary A. Tomei, a trial lawyer.[7]She has a younger brother, actor Adam Tomei,[8]and was partly raised by her paternal grandparents.[9]Tomei's parents are both ofItaliandescent; her father's ancestors came fromTuscany,Calabria, andCampania, while her mother's ancestors are from Tuscany andSicily.[10][11]She graduated fromEdward R. Murrow High Schoolin 1982.[12][13]
Tomei grew up in theMidwoodneighborhood of Brooklyn.[14]While there, she became captivated by theBroadwayshows to which her theater-loving parents took her and was drawn to acting as a career. At Andries Hudde Junior High School, she played Hedy LaRue in a school production ofHow to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. She also attended Albee School of Dance. After graduating from high school, she attendedBoston Universityfor a year.[9]

In 1986 she had a small role in theBobandHarvey Weinsteindirected comedy filmPlaying for Keepswhich was a financial and critical failure.
During this phase, she made her stage debut in 1987 at the age of 22 in the off-Broadway playDaughters, playing Cetta. The role earned her rave reviews and theTheatre World Awardfor outstanding debut on stage. She continued to take roles off-Broadway in the playsBeirutin 1987,Sharon and Billyin 1988, andWhat the Butler Sawin 1989.

Following several small films, includingOscar,[15]Tomei came to international prominence with her comedic performance in the 1992 filmMy Cousin Vinnystarring oppositeJoe Pescifor which she received critical praise.[16]CriticVincent Canbywrote, "Ms. Tomei gives every indication of being a fine comedian, whether towering overMr. Pesciand trying to look small, or arguing about a leaky faucet in terms that demonstrate her knowledge of plumbing. Mona Lisa is also a first-rate auto mechanic, which comes in handy in the untying of the knotted story."[17]For her performance, Tomei was namedBest Supporting Actressat the1993 Academy Awards, prevailing overMiranda Richardson,Joan Plowright,Vanessa RedgraveandJudy Davis.
American film criticRex Reedcreated controversy (and a minor Hollywood myth)[18][19][20]when he suggested thatJack Palancehad announced the wrong name after opening the envelope.[21][22]While this allegation was repeatedly disproved[23][24]—even theAcademyofficially denied it[22]—Tomei called the story "extremely hurtful".

In 1998, she was nominated for theAmerican Comedy Awardfor Funniest Supporting Actress forTamara Jenkins'cult filmSlums of Beverly Hills. The independent feature was well received by critics and the public,[28]withJanet MaslinofThe New York Timeswriting, "Jenkins makes the most of an especially ingratiating cast, with Ms. Tomei very charming and funny as Rita,"[29]andEmanuel LevyofVarietydescribing Tomei as "spunky and sexy... more subdued than she usually is."[30]Tomei spent several years away from high-profile roles[why?]and major motion pictures in the late 1990s before rising again to prominence in the early 2000s.[31]

Simpson murder trial.[33]
In 1998 she made herBroadwaydebut playing Susy Hendrix	in the revival of theFrederick KnottplayWait Until Darkacting oppositeQuentin Tarantinoat theBrooks Atkinson Theatre.[34]Ben BrantleyofThe New York Timescompared her performance unfavorably toAudrey Hepburnwho played the role in the1967 film. Brantley wrote, "[Tomei]'s a fine, vibrant actress, and heaven knows she works hard here, but she isn't well cast. The appeal of [Hepburn] in the part was of seeing her fragile, ladylike persona turn tough and muscular, and Ms. Tomei's performance allows for no similar transition".[3]Matt Wolf ofVarietywrote "Tomei gives a likable, if not wildly interesting performance".[35]
Tomei appeared in theNancy Meyersdirected comedyWhat Women WantstarringMel GibsonandHelen Hunt. The film was a commercial success. She also had a supporting role in the romantic comedySomeone Like YoustarringAshley Judd,Hugh Jackman, andGreg Kinnear.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
