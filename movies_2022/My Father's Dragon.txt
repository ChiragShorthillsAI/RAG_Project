An unseen older woman tells the story of her father, Elmer Elevator, when he was a kid. He and his mother, Dela, owned a candy shop in a small town, but were forced to close down and move away after the people of the town moved away. They move to faraway Nevergreen City where they plan to open a new shop, but they eventually lose all the money they saved up while getting by, presumably by 3 naughty street kids named Callie, Gertie, and Eugene.
Elmer soon befriends acatand eventually gets the idea to panhandle the money needed for the store, only for his mother to tell him it is now a lost cause. Angered, Elmer runs to the docks to be alone. The Cat comes to him and speaks to him, much to his shock. She tells him that on an island, Wild Island, beyond the city lies a dragon that can probably help him. Elmer takes the task and is transported to the island on a bubblywhalenamed Soda. Once they make it to Wild Island, Soda explains that agorillanamed Saiwa is using the dragon to keep the island from sinking, but it remains ineffective.
Elmer frees the dragon, a goofball named Boris, who explains that his kind has been saving the island as long as anyone can remember, and after he succeeds, he will be an "After Dragon". However, they discover that Boris cannot fly due to breaking his wing when Elmer saved him, and he reveals that he is afraid of both water and fire. The two make an agreement that Boris will help Elmer raise enough cash to buy a new store and will let the dragon go free once finished, and they go on an adventure in search of a tortoise named Aratuah to find out how Boris can keep the island from sinking for the next century. Along the way, they encounter some of the island's inhabitants, like Cornelius thecrocodile, thetigersiblings Sasha and George, and a motherrhinonamed Iris all while trying to evade Saiwa and his monkey army.
They soon make it to Aratuah's shell, but Elmer finds out that he died, and leaves as the island continues to sink. While resting on a flower, they are found by Saiwa and his forces and Saiwa reveals he knew about Aratuah's death, which angers hismacaque2nd-in-command Kwan, who proceeds to use a giant mushroom as a raft to leave the island. While flying with Boris, Elmer has an epiphany; it is the roots below the island that pull it down. He convinces Boris to fly with all his might and break the roots. Boris breaks two of the roots, but has his own epiphany of how to save the island alone (without Elmer).
Elmer falls into the water but is saved by Saiwa, who is evacuating the island with the other animals. He confronts Elmer for wanting to use Boris, and not truly being a friend. He then reveals that once he found out about Aratuah's death and saw how foolish and frightened Boris was, he knew everyone would drown in fear before the ocean swallowed the island. So, he used Boris to carry out the only solution he knew: forcing the dragon to lift the island up, over and over.
Wanting to fix things, Elmer goes back to the island to Boris and helps him find the courage to jump into the summit's fire and inhale it. This restores the roots, which were actually holding the island up, but had weakened after a century. Boris finally becomes an "After Dragon", and tells the animals how to teach future dragons the right way to save the island. He takes Elmer home, passing by a surprised Kwan residing over on tangerine trees. Elmer reunites with his mother and the film ends with him embracing his new life in the city with his daughter narrating the end of the story.

She is best known as the co-founder ofCartoon Saloon, alongsideTomm MooreandPaul Young, ananimationstudio and production company, based inKilkennyCity,Ireland. She is best known for co-directingThe Secret of Kellsand directingThe Breadwinner. Her work on both films earnedAcademy Awardnominations forBest Animated Feature.
Twomey was educated at St. Mary's Secondary School inMidleton, County Cork but left before completing theLeaving Certificateat the age of 15. She did manual labor at a local factory but continued to draw and briefly studiedfine artbefore she was admitted toBallyfermot CollegeinDublinto their School of Animation program on the basis of her portfolio.[1][2]In the factory Twomey operated a conveyor belt for up to twelve hours on end during the night shift. Twomey credits this period of her life to much of her success, as she wore headphones to drown out the loud noise of machinery, the silence combined with the monotony of the task she performed allowed her to ponder concepts and generate ideas, many of which would be put to film later in her life.[3]She graduated from Ballyfermot College in 1995.[4]
After graduating from Ballyfermot College, Twomey began to work forBrown Bags Filmanimation studio in Dublin.[1]In 1999 she helped foundCartoon Saloon, along withTomm Moore, Paul Young and Ross Murray. In 2002 she directed the award-winning short animated filmFrom Darkness. The short film has no dialogue and is based on an Inuit folk tale where a man helps a woman with only a skeleton for a body to regenerate.[5]She also worked on the successful animated TV seriesSkunk Fu!.
Twomey went on to write and direct the animated shortCúilín Dualach(Backwards Boy), released in 2004. Based on a story by Jackie Mac Donacha, a boy with his head on backwards finds only love and acceptance in his mother and has to work to gain that from the rest of his community but most of all his father.[5]
She co-directed, with Tomm Moore,The Secret of Kells, ananimated feature filmas well as doing additional voice acting for the film. The film is set in 9th century Ireland, at the time when theBook of Kellswas written. In it, a 12 year old orphan boy living at a monastery has the task of finishing abook with the art of illumination.[5]The film premiered at theBerlin International Film Festivalin February 2009.The Secret of Kellshas been nominated in the category ofBest Animated Feature Filmat the82nd Academy Awards.[6]
Twomey continued to work on feature films with Cartoon Saloon with 2014'sSong of the Seadirected by Tomm Moore. She worked as the film's head of story and voice director.[7]
She next directed the animated filmThe Breadwinner, released in 2017. Based on thebest-selling young adult novelbyDeborah Ellis, an 11-year-old girl named Parvana must dress as a boy and become the titular breadwinner for her family when her father is wrongfully arrested by theTaliban. It premiered at theToronto International Film Festivalin September 2017 with a wide release in November 2017.[8]It is the first feature-length film she has sole director credit on.[1]She worked on the project with actressAngelina Jolie, who helped fund the project and worked as an executive producer[3]The project was a huge success for Twomey, as she was recognized as a solo female filmmaker, and given accolades as well as being lauded by many as a source of female empowerment, all while battling cancer during production.[3]During the development ofThe Breadwinner, Twomey was named inVariety's "2017 10 Animators to Watch".[9]
Twomey is a member of theMotion Picture Academy.[1]
Twomey's films are often coming-of-age films with pre-teen protagonists dealing with mythic worlds, the importance of stories and finishing them, acceptance, family, and communities.Twomey's work also takes aim at the fact that life is a cycle of impermanence, and that life is always ever changing. Her depictions of this cycle vary in size and scope, an example of this being her depiction of Afghanistan in the breadwinner, which she describes as a land that has gone from progressive to oppressive in a matter of years, such is the cycle.[10]Twomey follows a unique design perspective either using characters that are explained by their visual design, or characters whom character gives more to the overall design or her worlds. She tends to use simple yet effective character designs in order to be concise about delivery.[10]Her films combine traditional and digital art but are oftenhand-drawnand in a visual style inspired by the worlds of her stories.[11]
Twomey's work is tailored to be enjoyed by all audiences, even though her protagonist are typically children or young adults, the stories they star in are typically considered complex and multi-layered, lending them to potentially be enjoyable and meaningful for adults as well as young adults and children.she has stated that animation is an often overlooked medium particularly by adults, and something she believes to be pointless, as to her it is simply another way of telling stories that can be just as complex. Twomey particularly loves young adults as an audience, as she is able to provide them with vivid coming of age stories that attempt to depict and age where they are also coming to terms with reality, and she, unlike many filmmakers attempts to treat them with dignity by not softening the reality of her stories. Examples of this are seen in the Breadwinner which depicts the oppression, brutality, and hypocrisy of the Taliban in a post 9-11 world. Twomey does concede in an interview that she believes that her young adult and child portion of her audience may not have the same visceral reaction towards depictions of the Taliban as adults who have strong associations with them, however Twomey uses the " coming of age " trope with a child protagonist seeing many of these things for the first time, giving hem someone in the story that can cue how they should and would react to such situations.[12]She believes that a young protagonist gives children a stepping stone into more adult themes, allowing for multi layered filmmaking.
Twomey's stories often deal with juxtaposition, combining the fantastical and ethereal with the realities of life, such as sexism and oppression.[12]She attempts to make her real world depiction of Afghanistan dark, gritty and draped in realism, using brought on Afghan artist and witnesses in order to capture the culture and environment her film takes place in, conversely as half the film takes place in the titular characters mind, Twomey uses colorful geometric art based on Persian miniatures to contrast reality from imagination.[10]
Twomey also weaves in smaller slice of life themes such as a child's, love for their parents, complex sibling dynamics, and femininity that are included to give more humanity to her characters.[13]
In terms of style, Twomey is a huge proponent of thehero's journeyand believes one should have a sound understanding of this narrative structure so they can work both within and outside of it, allowing for subversions or new interesting takes on the formula.[14]
Twomey also makes the stylistic choice to stick to hand drawn 2D images despite the readily available, and cheaper 3D CGI available today, as she believes 2D can be more stylistic and withstands the test of time.[15]
Nora Twomey became the seventh graduate of Ballyfermot College to have been nominated for an Academy Award with her work onThe Breadwinnerwhen it was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the90th Academy Awards.[4]She was also nominated for an award at the Golden Globes.[16]
The Breadwinnerearned 10 nominations at the45th Annie Awards, includingOutstanding Achievement for Directing in an Animated Feature Productionfor Twomey. It won the award forbest animated feature for an independent film. This marked the first time a sole female director directed the film that won the award.[17]It also won theCinema for Peaceaward for Justice in 2018.[18]
Nora Twomey's work also had a heavy presence at the Emile Awards, an annual event held by the European Animation Assosciation that honors European creators of animation.[16]During the awards of 2018 which were hosted in Lile, France, Twomey's filmThe Breadwinnerwon awards in four categories: Best Direction, Best Storyboarding, Best Character Animation, Best Background, and Best Character Design.[19]

The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron.
