Simmons.Walt Disney Picturesco-produced the film in association withThe Lonely Island(Schaffer and Samberg are two of the members of the group) andDavid HobermanandTodd Lieberman'sMandeville Films. The film takes place in analternate worldwhere fictional and cartoon  characters live alongside humans. Set 30 years after their original show got cancelled due to a falling-out, Chip and Dale attempt to reconcile their differences while investigating the kidnapping of their friend and co-star Monterey Jack.
Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangerspremiered at theEl Capitan TheatreinHollywood, California on May 16, 2022, and was released in the United States on May 20, 2022, streaming onDisney+asan original film. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, with praise for its humor, voice acting, and meta-commentary.[9]At the74th Primetime Emmy Awards, the film won the award forOutstanding Television Movie.
In a world co-populated by humans and fictional characters, twochipmunksnamedChip and Dalemeet in elementary school and become best friends. They later relocated toHollywoodand, after casting as extras in commercials and shows, went on to star in the successful television seriesChip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangersin the early 1990s. However, when Dale gets his own show,Double-O-Dale, a heated argument breaks out, causing them to fall out, which leads to both shows' cancellation.
Thirty years later, Chip is a successful but disillusioned insurance salesman while Dale spends most of his time on the fan convention circuit, having been put through CGI surgery. One night, the two are contacted by their formerRescue Rangersco-star Monterey Jack, who owes money to the criminal Valley Gang due to hisstinky cheeseaddiction. Monty warns the pair of a trafficking operation where toons are kidnapped, have their appearances altered, and are shipped overseas to producebootlegsof their works for the rest of their lives. Later that night, the two are informed that Monty has been kidnapped. They meet Police Captain Putty and Officer Ellie Steckler; the latter reveals herself to be a bigRescue Rangersfan, and with the police's hands tied, she suggests Chip and Dale investigate on their own.
Chip and Dale visit Bjornson the Cheesemonger, Monty's cheese dealer, and ask about the Valley Gang. They are taken to theuncanny valleypart of town and meet the gang's leader—Sweet Pete, a toon actor who playedPeter Pan, now an adult—and his henchmen Bob and Jimmy. Thinking they are investigating his bootlegging business, Pete tries to capture the pair, but the chipmunks escape. The two later share their discoveries with Ellie, learning that she is shunned by Putty due to acting on a bad tip and raiding theNick Jr. Channelstudios with negative results.
With Ellie's help, the chipmunks sneak into abathhouseto steal Pete'sfitness tracker. They trace his movements to a dock warehouse, though it is already abandoned by the time the police arrive. Inside, they find a large operating machine designed to alter toons' bodies, along with several toon parts, including Monty's mustache.
At the police station, the pair argue over the loss of Monty and their past feud but smell the scent of Monty's cologne. Realizing either Putty or Ellie is working with Sweet Pete, the two flee the station. At the ongoing Fan Con, they try to convinceUgly Sonicto ask his FBI contacts for help, but Pete and his henchmen arrive, having tracked Dale using his social media posts. In the ongoing chase, Bob is restrained and arrested, but Chip is caught by Jimmy and taken to the warehouse. Ellie is also lured there by Putty, revealing he is part of the Valley Gang and has been covering for Pete, including giving Ellie the false Nick Jr. tip while Dale regrets gettingDouble-O-Dalein the first place.
Sweet Pete has Ellie call Dale to lure him to the warehouse, but Ellie sends a coded message using aRescue Rangersepisode. Dale realizes Ellie is in trouble and contacts formerRescue Rangersco-stars Gadget Hackwrench and Zipper, now married with children, for help. Dale enters the warehouse using a firework, which gets lodged into the machine and stops it before it can be used on Chip. The machine goes haywire, transforming Jimmy into a fairy and Pete into a giant amalgamation of various toons. While Ellie fights and defeats Putty, Pete chases Chip and Dale through the warehouse, revealing it to also be where the bootlegs are filmed. The chipmunks lure Pete to the docks and use a ploy from aRescue Rangersepisode to trap him.
The FBI, led by Ugly Sonic, arrives to arrest Sweet Pete and the Valley Gang. Sweet Pete fires a cannonball at Chip, but Dale takes the hit. Chip fears Dale is dead and apologizes for his behavior over the years, but Dale reveals he was protected by a goldenpogChip gave him. The chipmunks free all the bootlegged toons, including Monty, and Dale introduces the Rescue Rangers to Ellie, who decides to open her own detective agency, while Sweet Pete and the Valley Gang are arrested for their crimes. As the team departs, Dale convinces them to film aRescue Rangersreboot, which is released to great success.

Director Akiva Schaffer alluded Jimmy's appearance to theCoca-Cola polar bear.[16]Schaffer provides voices for numerous minor roles includingE.T.fromE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial(1982) andMr. Naturalwhile also appearing in live-action as the director of the original show.[14]Rachel BloomvoicesFlounderfrom the1989 version ofThe Little Mermaid,Cubby of the Lost BoysfromPeter Pan(1953), Chip's mom, and a bootlegBart Simpson, among other characters.[10]Liz CackowskivoicesTigra, who is modeled after her appearance inThe Avengers: United They Stand, Officer O'Hara, and a cartoon cow who strongly resemblesClarabelle Cow.[10]Despite not reprising Monterey Jack in the film,Jim Cummingsreprises his roles as Fat Cat from the original series, theShredder's "right arm" from the 1987Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtlesanimated series,Peg Leg Pete, andDarkwing Duck, in addition to voicing bootleg versions ofWinnie the PoohandTigger.[10]Chris Parnellappears as Dave Bollinari, Dale's agent.[17]Jeff BennettvoicesLumièrefrom the1991 version ofBeauty and the Beast.[10]Steven Curtis ChapmanvoicesBaloofrom the2016 version ofThe Jungle Book.[10]Jorma Tacconevoices theDC Extended Universeversion ofBruce Wayne / Batmanalong with other minor roles.[10]Jean Gilpinvoices Chip's neighborMrs. House.[10]Alan Oppenheimervoices bothHe-ManandSkeletor(reprising his role as the latter) from the originalHe-Man and the Masters of the Universe.[10]Charles Fleischerreprises his role asRoger RabbitfromWho Framed Roger Rabbit, as well as the character's first animated appearance since the 1993 shortTrail Mix-Up.[10]OriginalRescue Rangersco-creatorTad Stonescameos as the voice of a studio executive.[18]David Tennantreprises his role asScrooge McDuckfrom the2017 version ofDuckTales.[10]Paula Abdulappears as ade-agedversion of herself, alongsideMC Skat Katfrom her video for "Opposites Attract", and also voices the 3-D reporter modeled after her.[19]Paul Ruddappears in a live-action cameo as himself.[20]
In the spirit ofWho Framed Roger Rabbit, the film features numerous cameo appearances of other animated characters from within the Disney catalogue and other third party properties that appear without dialogue:
On January 31, 2014, it was announced thatThe Walt Disney Companywas developing a live-action movie based on theDisney Afternoonanimated seriesChip 'n Dale: Rescue RangerswithCGIspecial effects, similar to20th Century Fox'sAlvin & the Chipmunksfilm series. David Hoberman andTodd Liebermansigned on as its producers, while Robert Rugan was hired to write and direct the film. It would have followed an origin story for the Rescue Rangers.[22]Robert Rugan debunked these claims, claiming that the project was a combination of live-action and animation, and was a direct film adaptation of the series with a slightly darker tone reminiscent to a 1940s noir film.[23]
In May 2019, Akiva Schaffer, known for the 2007cult classicHot Rod, became the film's new director, replacing Rugan, while Dan Gregor and Doug Mand became its new writers and claimed that the film would follow a "meta, something self-referential and cool" take on the characters. David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman returned as its producers, and the project became a co-production betweenWalt Disney PicturesandMandeville Films.[24]Gregor and Mand had started the new script as aspiritual successortoWho Framed Roger Rabbit, taking into account the changes in animation techniques in the four decades sinceRoger Rabbithad been made. They wanted to keep what they felt madeRoger Rabbitsuccessful, being that the film "is not talking down to the animated characters [and] playing it real and to the top of your intelligence."[19]Schaffer said they were further influenced bybuddy copfilms of the 1990s such as theLethal Weaponseries, while including more comedic elements.[25]
Schaffer agreed to direct the film after he was sent Gregor and Mand's script; he agreed due to the film's self-referential humor, his love for both the original series andRoger Rabbit, and an interest in working on animated films.[14]The film features cameos from several non-Disney animated properties due to Schaffer wanting the film to be "a love letter celebration of animation", similar toRoger Rabbit, and felt including only Disney characters would instead make the film "just a celebration of Disney animation".[26]Schaffer did not want to go overboard on such cameos, going by the rule "Don’t put in a cameo unless it’s forwarding the story or putting a button on a really good laugh".[25]Schaffer used the example of the donut cops fromWreck-It Ralph, who not only served as recognizable characters for younger audiences, but also played on the popular concept of police officers loving to eat donuts as a joke for those that had not seen the film.[25]Non-Disney companies authorized through Disney's legal team for their characters to appear in the film after Schaffer assured them it was "not going to make fun of their characters".[14][19]
Schaffer said that for the film's villain, they wanted to play on the idea of child actors that were not able to continue acting as adults through cartoon characters. Early on, the team considered using an adult version ofCharlie BrownfromPeanutsfor the role, but eventually selectedPeter Panfor easier licensing.[16]This was compared toBobby Driscoll, the original voice actor for Peter Pan in the 1953 film. In the years following its release, Driscoll's acting career spiraled into decline after being terminated from Disney as he reached puberty. This affected his personal life, with Driscoll becoming addicted to drugs. In early 1968, Driscoll passed away as a result of heart failure from drug abuse. Several events from this point in Driscoll's life were applied similarly to Sweet Pete's backstory.[27]The film was heavily criticized for this, with both critics and audiences pointing out how the portrayal of Sweet Pete, with the context of Driscoll's later life in mind, came off as disrespectful and insensitive.[28]Despite this, Schaffer had stated there was no intention to mock any specific actor in the film, and the writers had not been aware of Driscoll's history.
According to storyboard artist Simeon Wilkins, they had planned forJar Jar Binksto feature in the convention hall scenes, but he was replaced withUgly Sonic.[29]Other discarded appearances included actorChris Evans, Elliot fromPete's Dragon, Sulley and Mike fromMonsters, Inc., Tick-Tock the Crocodile fromPeter Pan,SabretoothfromX-Men: The Animated Series, and Mushu fromMulan.[29]
Though initial reports said that Corey Burton would return as the voice of Dale, it was announced in December 2020 that Andy Samberg would provide the voice for the character. John Mulaney as Chip was revealed in the same announcement and Seth Rogen was announced to be making a cameo in the film.[6]Additional casting was announced with the release of the teaser trailer on February 15, 2022.[11]In April 2022, during the release of a new trailer, it was confirmed that Burton would reprise Dale along with Tress MacNeille reprising Chip for brief dialogue.[30]
Principal photographycommenced on March 16, 2021, in Los Angeles withLarry Fongas cinematographer.[31][32]Filming lasted 30–35 days.[4]
Both visual effects for the film and the Rescue Rangers' and Sweet Pete's animation were provided byMoving Picture Company(MPC).[33]While there are numerous hand-drawn animated characters shown as minor roles, the crew decided for MPC to provide computer-animation for the Rescue Rangers and Sweet Pete, while giving them a cel-shaded look to appear hand-drawn, for time and budget.[34]MPC had also done the animation work for theSonic the Hedgehogfilm, and were able to provide the model for Ugly Sonic once it was cleared for use.[15]ForRoger Rabbit's cameo at the start of the film, one of the animators fromWho Framed Roger Rabbitwas brought to animate the character.[14]Animation services were also provided byPassion Pictures. The ponies fromMy Little Pony: Friendship is Magicwere done by Top Draw Animation, who animated them for the series and2017 film. Schaffer said the animation budget was "an eighth of what like aPixarorDisney Animationmovie would be" and that it accounted for half the film's total cost.[4]
Brian Tyleris the film's composer and conductor and its theme song was written by pop songwriterMark Mueller, who composed it for the television series.[35][2]Post Malonerecorded a cover of the television show's theme song for the film.[36]The soundtrack album was released on May 20, 2022, alongside the film's release. The song used in the teaser trailer and the main trailer is "Best Friend" bySaweetiefeaturingDoja Cat. The songs "Friendship" byTenacious D, "Now That We Found Love" byHeavy D and the Boyz, and "Laid to Rest" byLamb of Godcan be heard in the movie, but are not included in the soundtrack.[37]
All tracks are written byBrian Tyler, except where indicated
Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangerspremiered at theEl Capitan TheatreinHollywood, California, on May 16, 2022, and was released as a Disney+ original film on May 20, 2022.[6][38][39][40]
According toWhip Media,Chip 'n' Dale: Rescue Rangerswas the most watched movie across all platforms in the United States during the week of May 20, 2022[41]and the most watched movie across all platforms in the United States during the week of May 27, 2022.[42]According toNielsen Holdings,Chip 'n' Dale: Rescue Rangerswas the 5th most watched program and the 2nd most watched movie across all platforms during the week of May 16, 2022, to May 22, 2022.[43][44]According to Reelgood,Chip 'n' Dale: Rescue Rangerswas the 10th most watched program across all platforms, during the week of May 26, 2022, to June 1, 2022.[45][46]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 81% of 139 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Sometimes some reboots fall through the cracks, butChip 'n' Dale: Rescue Rangerspicks up the slack with a fast, funny film that (almost) never fails."[47]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[48]
Frank Scheck ofThe Hollywood Reportergave it a positive review, saying it succeeded whereSpace Jam: A New Legacyfailed, and called it "the funniest movie of the year so far, either animated or live-action. Or in this case both, since it ingeniously melds the two forms in the cleverest manner sinceWho Framed Roger Rabbit."[49]Amy Nicholson ofVarietywrote: "This frenetic and funny crossbreeding of live action and cartoon is both a reboot and an anti-reboot, a corporate-funded raspberry at corporate IP, and a giddily dumb smart aleck committed to mocking its joke — and making it, too."[50]David Sims ofThe Atlanticreviewed the movie positively, describing it as a contemporary version ofWho Framed Roger Rabbit, and wrote: "The movie works mostly because, through its weird tricks of animation and self-referentiality, it somehow finds a fresh satirical angle. Other films have skewered an industry that’s intent on bludgeoning audiences with their own fading memories, but onlyChip ’n Daleactually gives those memories a new life."[51]Calum Marsh ofThe New York Timesreviewed the film positively, drawing some comparisons toWho Framed Roger Rabbit, writing, "A wry take on the material that combines animation and live-action comedy, the movie has some of the hip flair and anarchic meta-humor ofWho Framed Roger Rabbit, as well as an irreverent, self-referential attitude that’s rather appealing."[52]Matt Fowler ofIGNscored the movie a 7 out of 10, finding the story "a bit thin", but praising the humor and its handling of pop culture references, while calling Samberg and Mulaney "just the right voice duo to bring these chipmunks back to life."[53]
Nick Allen ofRogerEbert.comgave the film a more mixed review, rating it 2.5 out of 4 stars, praising the different styles of animation, complimenting the performances of the voice actors, and stated that the film manages to provide comical moments. He criticized the plot, writing, "At the least the premise is funny [...] but it’s still stuck in that usual animated movie spot of trying to make something "for kids," with some irreverent references and deep cuts for the adults. Take away the cameos—in the recording booth, and animated on-screen—and you get something that's a little too close to the same old junk."[54]Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardianrated the film 3 out of 5 stars, stating, "The script feels a few punch-ups away from being quite as funny as it could have been. But what Gregor and Mand do manage is a neat balance of tone, the knowing satire never falling into self-referential smugness thanks to a healthy dose of both earnestness and a genuine affection for the source material."[55]Jennifer Green ofCommon Sense Mediarated the movie 3 out of 5 stars, praised the depiction of positive messages, citing friendship and forgiveness, found agreeable the presence of role models across the different characters who fight for justice, while complimenting the diversity of the cast.[56]
Tad Stones, the co-creator ofRescue Rangers, has expressed his approval of the film,[57]calling it "fantastic".[58]
After the film's release, writers Dan Gregor and Doug Mand said they were interested in working on a sequel, but it would depend on the popularity of the first film.[62]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
