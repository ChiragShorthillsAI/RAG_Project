TheNational Board of ReviewnamedGlass Onionas one of thetop ten filmsof 2022. The film received a nomination forBest Adapted Screenplayat the95th Academy Awards, and receivednumerous other accolades.
A third film, titledWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, is set to be released in 2025.[3]
During theCOVID-19 pandemicin May 2020, Miles Bron, the co-founder of technology company Alpha, hosts amurder mystery gameat the Glass Onion, his mansion on aprivate islandinGreece. He invites his friend group, the "Disruptors": Alpha head scientist Lionel Toussaint,Connecticutgovernor Claire Debella, controversial model-turned-fashion designer Birdie Jay,men's rightsstreamerDuke Cody, and Alpha co-founder Cassandra "Andi" Brand, who is estranged from Miles. The five friends are each delivered a woodenpuzzle boxto decipher to find the invitation inside. Lionel, Claire, Birdie, and Duke all solve the box together, while Andi smashes the box open with a hammer.
The Disruptors travel to Miles' island, along with Birdie's assistant Peg and Duke's girlfriend Whiskey. Famous detective Benoit Blanc joins them, claiming Miles invited him. However, Miles privately tells Blanc that the Disruptors were the only guests invited. Nevertheless, Miles allows Blanc to stay, assuming another guest sent him their invitation. Before dinner, Miles shows off his glass sculpture collection and theMona Lisa, which he has on loan from theLouvre. Miles also reveals that the mansion is powered by "Klear", a hydrogen-basedalternative fuelthat Alpha will soon sell, despite Lionel and Claire's knowledge that it is dangerous.
Blanc solves Miles' murder mystery game immediately and privately warns Miles that the Disruptors all have motives to kill him. After an argument with the rest of the group, Andi storms off. Duke suddenly dies after drinking from Miles' glass and the panicked group suspects that Andi attempted to poison Miles. Lionel calls the police but discovers they are unable to arrive until morning. After the group discovers Duke's pistol is missing, apower outageoccurs. Blanc finds Andi, whom he refers to as Helen, but an unseen assailant shoots her. Blanc gathers the group and announces that he has solved Andi's murder.
An extended flashback shows that Andi actually died a week earlier, apparently by suicide. Her twin sister Helen hired Blanc to investigate. At Alpha, Andi had halted Klear's development because of its dangerous properties, so Miles fired her. Andi sued Miles to regain control of Alpha, but Miles won the lawsuit because the other Disruptorsperjuredthemselves by testifying that Miles had single-handedly sketched out the plan for Alpha on a napkin years before; the sketch was drawn by Andi. Shortly before her death, Andi had emailed the group a photo showing the original napkin still in her possession. Helen suspected that one of the Disruptors killed Andi and stole the napkin to protect Miles and themselves. With Andi's death not yet public knowledge, Blanc persuaded Helen to pose as Andi at Miles' party and help him investigate.
Helen helps Blanc discover the Disruptors' motives to protect Miles: Lionel and Claire have staked their reputations on Klear, Birdie needs Miles's financial assistance to handle the fallout of ignorantly employingsweatshops, and Duke is hoping for a show on Alpha News. Each of them visited Andi's home on the day she died. Helen searches the guests' rooms but does not find the napkin. When Helen is shot, Andi's journal in her jacket pocket stops the bullet. Blanc tells Helen to search Miles's office.
Blanc deduces that Miles committed both murders: he fatally poisoned Andi after learning she had the napkin, and Duke saw Miles leaving Andi's house afterward. During the party, Duke saw a news report of Andi's death and, realizing that Miles was responsible, attempted to blackmail him. Miles then poisoned Duke with pineapple juice, which Duke wasdeathly allergicto, and took Duke's pistol, with which heshotHelen.
Helen locates Andi's napkin in Miles' office and reveals her identity to the group. Miles burns the napkin, eliminating the evidence, and his friends refuse to testify against him. Blanc tells Helen that he has done all he can and goes outside. In a rage, Helen destroys Miles' glass sculptures, and the Disruptors eventually join her. Helen lights a bonfire and throws a piece of Klear that Blanc had given her into the fire, causing an explosion that destroys the mansion and theMona Lisa. With Klear now proven dangerous, the Disruptors have no choice but to testify against Miles. On the beach, Helen and Blanc watch as police boats arrive.

The 2019 filmKnives Outwas a commercially successful production fromMRCandLionsgate Films. It grossed over $311 million on a budget of $40 million, making it the second-highest-grossing original movie of the year that was not based on existing intellectual property.[29][30]Before its release, writer and directorRian Johnsonhad teased the possibility of a sequel revolving around the lead character, Detective Benoit Blanc.[31][32]Lionsgate officially greenlit the sequel in early 2020.[31][32]
In March 2021,NetflixoutbidAmazonandAppleat an auction to acquire the rights to the film and another sequel toKnives Outfor $469 million, with Johnson returning as director,Daniel Craigset to reprise his role as Blanc, and a budget of at least $40 million for each installment.[5][33]Johnson, Craig, and the producerRam Bergmanreportedly earned more than $100 million for both productions.[33][34]A losing bidder called it an inexplicable, "mind-boggling" deal.[35]
Craig worked with adialect coachto regain familiarity with Blanc'sSouthern accent.[36]Johnson previously considered having Blanc speak with an inexplicably different accent in each film.[37]
Johnson wroteGlass Onionin 2020 during theCOVID-19lockdown, with its setting of Greece coming from a desire to travel abroad when international travel had been shut down.[38][39]His writing began from the premise that he wanted to write a whodunnit "vacation mystery" in the style of stories Johnson loves such asEvil Under the Sun,Death on the NileandThe Last of Sheila.[38]Johnson made it clear thatGlass Onionwas not a continuation of its predecessor but a standalone film featuring a new story and cast, similar to theHercule Poirotnovel series byAgatha Christie.[40][41]
In addition to Christie novels, he took inspiration from "tropical getaway murder mysteries" like the film adaptation of Christie'sEvil Under the Sunand especiallyThe Last of Sheila,[20]saying: "It's structured around a group of friends, orfrenemies, who all have a power dynamic with one of their successful friends. It begins with him inviting them to come and play this murder mystery game at this exotic locale. InThe Last of Sheila, it's on his yacht, and everything ends up going horribly wrong. That is essentially howGlass Onionbegins."[8]Johnson wanted the film's title to refer to something hidden in plain sight. He chose "glass" because it is clear. He searched his phone for songs with the word, finally settling on "Glass Onion" bythe Beatles.[8]The song is featured in the end credits.[20]
The character of Benoit Blanc was revealed as gay in the film. Johnson said this "did not feel like a big decision" and "felt very natural" when depicting Blanc's home life.[42]
Johnson described casting the film as "throwing a dinner party".[8]Dave Bautistasaid Johnson encouraged him to audition during an unprompted call, andKathryn Hahnsecured her role over severalZoomcalls with Johnson.[43][44]
ReturningKnives Outcrew members included cinematographerSteve Yedlin, editorBob Ducsay, and composerNathan Johnson.[41][45]Filming began onSpetses, an island in Greece, on June 28, 2021.[46]Johnson discovered theAmanzoe's Villa 20 in Porto Heli and decided to use it as a major filming location. It also housed the cast and their families for the majority of the shoot, which Johnson described as "a summer vacation where we also made a movie".[8]The shoot moved out of Greece on July 30 to continue shooting interior and New York scenes inBelgrade,[47]and wrapped officially on September 13, 2021.[48][49]
In addition to the title, the film contains references to other songs by the Beatles: two of the glass sculptures include a walrus ("I Am the Walrus") and strawberries ("Strawberry Fields Forever"), and the switch that controls the safety enclosure around theMona Lisais modeled as "The Fool on the Hill".[50]
Rian's cousin and frequent collaborator,Nathan Johnson, returned to scoreGlass Onion; it marks their fifth collaboration afterBrick(2005),The Brothers Bloom(2009),Looper(2012), and the predecessor,Knives Out(2019). Netflix Music released the album on November 25, 2022.[51]
Other songs featured in the film include "To Love Somebody"by theBee Gees; "Star" and "Starman" byDavid Bowie; "Take Me Home, Country Roads" byToots and The Maytals; and "Mona Lisa" byNat King Cole.  Edward Norton plays "Blackbird" byThe Beatlesand "Under the Bridge" byRed Hot Chili Pepperson guitar. "Glass Onion" by The Beatles plays during the end credits.[52]
AGlass Onionteaser trailer was released on September 8, 2022,[53]followed by a full trailer on November 7.[54]
Johnson said he was "pissed" that "A Knives Out Mystery" was added as a subtitle to the film's marketing materials, and he originally intended the film's title to simply be "Glass Onion", as it is a standalone story.[38][55]While he said he understood the need for audiences to understand thatGlass Onionwas part of a series, he felt that "the whole appeal to me is it's a new novel off the shelf every time", and that there is an industry trend with "the gravity of a thousand suns toward serialized storytelling".[56]
Glass Onionpremiered at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 10, 2022.[1][20][57]It also screened at thePhiladelphia Film Festivalin October 2022, closed theBFI London Film Festivalon October 16 and Film Fest 919 on October 30,[58][59]and screened at theMiami International Film Festivalas its opening night film on November 3.[60]TheLos Angelespremiere took place at theAcademy Museum of Motion Pictureson November 14.[61]It was released on Netflix on December 23, 2022.[62][8]Over its first 10 days of digital release, the film logged over 209.5 million hours viewed worldwide.[63]Between January and June 2023, the film totaled 142.9 million hours watched (equal to 61.7 million views).[64]
Netflix was reportedly considering a new release model for films likeGlass Onion, which would give the film a 45-day window in theaters before being released on the streaming service.[65]On October 6, 2022, Netflix announced that, after signing deals with the three largest theater chains in the United States (AMC Theaters,Regal Cinemas, andCinemark, the latter with whom Netflix had a pre-existing deal), the film would see a limited, one-week theatrical release (billed as a "sneak preview" release) from November 23 to 29 in roughly 600 theaters in the largest markets across the United States, as well in other international markets, marking the first time a Netflix-distributed film would be shown in all three major theater chains in the United States. After the release was over, Netflix would then pull the film from distribution until the Netflix release on December 23. At that point, Netflix would allow theaters to show the film again.[66]Deadlinelater reported that Netflix agreed to take a lower amount of the rental revenue than usual from theaters (40% vs. 60–70%), as well as to kick in four times the average amount of money for exhibitor marketing.Deadlinealso reported that some smaller exhibitors that were interested in playing the film were shut out from the one-week limited release, as Netflix preferred more popular theaters forGlass Onion.[67]
On December 23, 2022, in an interview withTheWrap, Johnson and Bergman confirmed that discussions between Netflix and the creatives about a possibleBlu-rayrelease of the film had taken place, with Bergman saying: "There have been conversations but no results yet. I really hope we can do it. We've got plenty of good stuff to fill out a disc if anyone's interested." Johnson—a longtime advocate of physical media—also was hopeful, saying that, even if it does not come to fruition, he will strive to make an audio commentary available in some form.[68]
In the United States and Canada,Glass Onionwas released alongsideStrange World,Devotion,Bones and AllandThe Fabelmans, and was initially projected to gross around $6–8 million from 698 theaters over its five-day opening weekend.[69]As with their other theatrical releases, Netflix did not release any box office numbers for the film.Deadline Hollywoodreported that the film made an estimated $2–2.5 million on its first day, which led to estimates being raised to as much as $12.3 million.[70]The Hollywood Reporterlater reported that the film went on to debut with an estimated $13.1 million over the five-day weekend, which would be the best-performing theatrical release for Netflix, and third for the weekend had Netflix officially released box office numbers, behindBlack Panther: Wakanda ForeverandStrange World.[71]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 91% of 434 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Glass Onionbrings back Benoit Blanc for another wildly entertaining mystery rounded out by an outstanding ensemble cast."[72]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 81 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[73]
Variety'sOwen Gleibermanpraised the film as "a bigger, showier, even more elaborately multi-faceted shell-game mystery" than the first film.[20]Christy LemireofRogerEbert.comgave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing: "The clever details, amusing name-drops, and precisely pointed digs at vapid celebrity culture keep Johnson's movie zippy when it threatens to drag."[74]Writing forThe Guardian,Peter Bradshawgave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said: "Glass Onionis never anything less than entertaining, with its succession of A-lister and A-plus-lister cameos popping up all over the place. And Johnson uncorks an absolute showstopper of a flashback a half-hour or so into the action, which then unspools back up to the present day, giving us all manner of cheeky POV-shift reveals."[75]
The film's characters and plot have been likened to currentbusiness magnates. Calder McHugh ofPoliticodescribed the film as "an allegory for all of us living with the omnipresentElon Musk,Donald Trump, andJeff Bezos",[76]while James Downie ofMSNBCclaimed Norton's character Miles Bron's "mixture of bluster, hubris, and half-baked ideas will likely bring to mind Twitter owner and part-time car enthusiast Elon Musk."[77]Of the film's relevance toElon Musk's recent takeover of Twitter, Rian Johnson commented, "A friend of mine said, 'Man, that feels like it was written this afternoon.' And that's just sort of a horrible, horrible accident, you know?"[78]Shirley Li ofThe Atlanticpraised the film for "observing the absurd privileges of wealth and skewering the ignorance of the 1 percent" such as in the "overflowing smarm" of Edward Norton's performance as Miles Bron.[79]Clay Cockrell, a therapist for rich people said, writing inThe Guardian, that the film illustrated how the very rich could not trust either their pre-wealth friends, or new friends, as he had seen in real life.[80]
Glass Onionexplores themes like wealth inequality, the impact of technology, the influence of powerful personalities, and even sewage management in today's world.[81]In interviews about the film, director Rian Johnson, producer Ram Bergman, and the actors shared their thoughts on these themes, suggesting different ways to interpret the story.[82]Johnson said the movie aims to make people think, rather than push a specific viewpoint.[83]He believes that mystery stories are great for looking at power and influence, much like Agatha Christie's books, which reflect her keen observation of society.[84][85]
At the95th Academy Awards, the film received a nomination forBest Adapted Screenplay.[86]Its other nominations include sixCritics' Choice Movie Awards(winning two) and twoGolden Globe Awards.[87][88]The film was named one of theten best filmsof 2022 by theNational Board of Review.[89]
Netflix holds the film rights to at least one more film in the series.[33]In September 2022, Johnson confirmed his intention to make more,[90]and, later that month, he and Craig separately said they would continue making further films in the series, so long as they were both involved together.[91]In November 2022, Johnson said he was preparing to work on writing the third film,[92]and, by January 2023, he confirmed he had started writing the script for the third film, stating that it will be tonally and thematically different from the previous installments.[93]Johnson later stated that, although he had approved the subtitle "A Knives Out Mystery" forGlass Onion, he would like to rename the series and add, instead, "A Benoit Blanc Mystery" as a subtitle to future installments.[94]
In October 2023, Johnson spoke further about the progress ofKnives Out 3inTheWrap: "I obviously couldn't work during theWriters Guild of America strike, and now that it's over, I'm diving in full force, and so it's coming along. I've got the premise, I've got the setting, I've got what the movie is in my head. It's just a matter of writing the damn thing."[95]In May 2024, the third film's title was announced asWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.[3]In development since 2023, filming started in June 2024 and wrapped in August 2024, inLondon, and the film is scheduled to be released in 2025. It is set to co-starJosh O'Connor,Cailee Spaeny,Andrew Scott,Kerry Washington,Glenn Close,Jeremy Renner,Mila Kunis,Daryl McCormack,Josh Brolin, andThomas Haden Church.[93][96][97][98][99][100][101][102]Similarly to how the first two films in the series were named after songs,Wake Up Dead Manshares the same title as the closing track ofU2's 1997 albumPop.[103]

There was a lot of confusion and nonsense where I grew up, so I reacted by creating my own little world.[...] I began to see how music could change lives, and I began to dream about a world where every day was like anime and Broadway, where music fell from the sky and anything could happen.
Janelle Monáe Robinson was born on December 1, 1985, inKansas City, Kansas, and was raised inQuindaro, a working-class community of Kansas City.[23]Her mother, Janet, worked as a janitor and a hotel maid.[23][24]Her father, Michael Robinson Summers, was a truck driver.[25]Monáe's parents separated when Monáe was a toddler and her mother later married a postal worker. Monáe has a younger sister, Kimmy, from her mother's remarriage.[23]
Monáe was raisedBaptistand learned to sing at a local church. Her family members were musicians and performers at the localAfrican Methodist Episcopalchurch, theBaptist church, and theChurch of God in Christ.[23][25]Monáe dreamed of being a singer and a performer from a very young age,[22]and has cited the fictional character ofDorothy GalefromThe Wizard of Ozas a musical influence.[26]The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which Monáe bought two copies of with her first check, was another source of inspiration.[27]She performed songs from the album onJuneteenthtalent shows, winning three years in a row.[23]
As a teenager, Monáe was enrolled in the Coterie Theater's Young Playwrights' Round Table,[28][29]which began writing musicals. One musical, completed when she was around the age of 12, was inspired by the 1979Stevie WonderalbumJourney Through "The Secret Life of Plants".[29]
Monáe attendedF. L. Schlagle High School,[25]and after high school, moved toNew York Cityto study musical theater at theAmerican Musical and Dramatic Academy, where she was the only black woman in her class.[28][29]Monáe enjoyed the experience, but feared that she might lose her edge and "sound, or look or feel like anybody else".[28]In a 2010 interview Monáe explained, "I felt like that was a home but I wanted to write my own musicals. I didn't want to have to live vicariously through a character that had been played thousands of times – in a line with everybody wanting to play the same person."[29]
After a year and a half, Monáe dropped out of the academy and relocated toAtlanta, enrolling atGeorgia Perimeter College. She began writing her own music and performing around the campus.[28]In 2003, Monáe self-released ademo albumtitledThe Audition,[30]which she sold out of the trunk of aMitsubishi Galant.[28]During this period she worked at anOffice Depotbut was fired for answering a fan's e-mail using a company computer, an incident that inspired the song "Lettin' Go", which in turn attracted the attention ofBig Boi.[29]
Monáe appeared on thePurple Ribbon All-StarsalbumGot Purp? Vol. 2as well as on OutKast's 2006 albumIdlewild, where she was featured on the songs "Call the Law" and "In Your Dreams".[31]Big Boi told his friendSean Combsabout Monáe, of whom at the time Combs had not yet heard. Combs soon visited Monáe'sMySpacepage and according to aHitQuartersinterview withBad Boy RecordsA&R person Daniel 'Skid' Mitchell, Combs loved it right away: "[He] loved her look, loved that you couldn't see her body, loved the way she was dancing, and just loved the vibe. He felt like she has something that was different – something new and fresh."[32]
Monáe signed to the label, Bad Boy, in 2006. The label's chief role was to facilitate her exposure on a much broader scale rather than develop the artist and her music, as Mitchell noted: "She was already moving, she already had her records – she had a self-contained movement." Combs and Big Boi wanted to take their time and build her profile organically and allow the music to grow rather than put out "a hot single which everyone jumps on, and then they fade because it's just something of the moment."[32]
In 2007, Monáe released her first solo work,Metropolis.It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or "suites", which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series,Metropolis: Suite I (The Chase)in mid-2007, these plans were altered following signing with Sean Combs's label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitledMetropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition)and included two new tracks. The EP was critically acclaimed, garnering Monáe a 51st Annual Grammy AwardsGrammynomination forBest Urban/Alternative Performancefor the single "Many Moons",[33]festival appearances and opening slots forindie popbandof Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for bandNo Doubton their summer 2009 tour.[34]Her single "Open Happiness" was featured in the 2009 season finale ofAmerican Idol.[35]Monáe told MTV about the concept for her new album and also discussed analter egonamed Cindi Mayweather. She said:
Cindy is an android and I love speaking about the android because they are the new "other". People are afraid of the other and I believe we're going to live in a world with androids because of technology and the way it advances. The first album she was running because she had fallen in love with a human and she was being disassembled for that.[36]
In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album,The ArchAndroid. The album was released on May 18, 2010. The second and third suites ofMetropolisare combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter ego, Cindi Mayweather – also the protagonist ofMetropolis: The Chase Suite– becomes amessianicfigure to theandroidcommunity of Metropolis.[37]Monáe announced plans to shoot a video for each song onThe ArchAndroidand create a film,graphic noveland a touring Broadway musical based on the album.[38]TheMetropolisconcept series draws inspiration from a wide range of musical, cinematic and other sources, ranging fromAlfred HitchcocktoDebussytoPhilip K. Dick. The series puts Fritz Lang's 1927 silent filmMetropolis, which Monáe referred to as "the godfather of science-fiction movies", in special regard.[39][40]Aside from sharing a name, they also share visual styles (the cover forThe ArchAndroidis inspired by the iconic poster forMetropolis), conceptual themes and political goals, using expressionistic future scenarios to examine and explore contemporary ideas of prejudice and class. Both also include a performing female android, though to very different effect. WhereMetropolisandroid Maria is the evil, havoc-sowing double of the messianic figure to the city's strictly segregated working class, Monáe's messianic android muse Cindi Mayweather represents an interpretation of androids as that segregated minority, which Monáe describes as "...theOther. And I feel like all of us, whether in the majority or the minority, felt like the Other at some point."[39][41]
Monáe received the Vanguard Award from theAmerican Society of Composers, Authors and Publishersat the Rhythm & Soul Music Awards in 2010.[42]Monáe coveredCharlie Chaplin'sSmileon Billboard.com in June 2010.

In her 2013 interview withfuse, Monáe said "Q.U.E.E.N." was inspired by conversations she shared with Erykah Badu about the treatment of marginalized people, especially African-American women, and the title is an acronym "for those who are marginalized"; Q standing for the queer community, U standing for the "untouchables", the first E standing for "emigrants", the latter standing for "excommunicated" and N standing for "negroid".[54]Thematically,The Electric Ladycontinues the utopian cyborg concepts of its predecessors, while presenting itself in more plainspoken, introspective territory in addition to experimenting with genres beyond conventionalfunkand soul such asjazz("Dorothy Dandridge Eyes"),pop-punk("Dance Apocalyptic"),gospel("Victory") and woozy, sensual vocal ballads ("PrimeTime", featuringMiguel).

The album was nominated forAlbum of the YearandBest Progressive R&B Albumat the66th Annual Grammy Awards.[130]
Monáe has amezzo-sopranovoice.[131]The Telegraphpublished an interview with Monáe, talking about her first studio album, in which the journalist Bernadette McNulty said, "I begin to worry for a moment that Monáe may not just be a humourless science-fictionnerd, but actually an android herself, created in a laboratory as a super-musical cross betweenJames Brown,Judy Garland,André 3000andSteve Jobs, invented to test the desperate incredulity of music journalists." She also compared Monáe to artists such asAnnie Lennox,Lauryn Hill, andCorinne Bailey Rae.[132]Monáe's musical styles have been described as "a soaring orchestral trip enlivened with blockbuster vocals, mysterious imagery and notes of Sixties pop and jazz".[133]The Guardianhas noted some of Monáe's influences asMichael Jackson,Janet Jackson,Prince,Outkast,Erykah Badu,James Brown,Grace Jones,Stevie Wonder,David Bowie,Jimi Hendrix,Bernard Herrmann,Funkadelicand theIncredible String Band.[29]Matthew Valnes likens Monáe's dancing style in the music video for "Tightrope" to that of James Brown.[134]In an opinion piece forThe Quietus,[135]John Calvert places Janelle Monáe within theAfrofuturismmovement, pointing out her similarities toSun RaandGeorge Clinton. He asserts that Janelle Monáe is innovating the genre. Monáe has said she has an alter ego from the year 2719, named Cindi Mayweather.[136]
Inher first EP, Monáe gave this alter ego a back story: she was on the run after breaking the law in her home town of Metropolis by falling in love with a human, Anthony Greendown. Monáe has expanded on Cindi's mythos, saying, "The Archandroid, Cindi, is the mediator, between the mind and the hand. She's the mediator between the haves and the have-nots, the oppressed and the oppressor. She's like theArchangelin theBible, and whatNeorepresents toThe Matrix."[137]In hersecond album, Cindi Mayweather returned to Earth to liberate Metropolitans from the Great Divide, an oppressive oligarchy that used time travel to "suppress freedom and love".[138]Chris Champion ofThe ObserverdescribedMetropolisandThe ArchAndroidas "psychedelic soulwith a sci-fi twist".[139]Matthew Valnes describes Monáe as innovating a more contemporary Neo-Afrofuturism, where the android role is used as a tool to critique the representation of Black female musicians in the funk genre. Funk music of 1960s through 1980s is a prevalent music style influencing Monáe. The website for Monáe's Wondaland Arts Society Collective asserts, "We believe there are only three forms of music; good music, bad music, and funk."[134]Monáe has also referred to herself as a "funkstress".[140]
Monáe's roots in Kansas City, Kansas, where she was born and raised, are evident in her lyrics and style. According to Carrie Battan'sPitchforkfeature on Monáe, the song "Ghetto Woman" directly addresses Monáe's working-class K.C., Kansas mother – as well as the portrayal of working-class black women in U.S. culture – with the line "Carry on, ghetto woman, even when the news portrays you less than you could be."[1]Monáe also told theLondon Evening Standardshe has internalized her KCK (K.C., KS) roots by wearing the working-class uniform of her parents and expressing concern that she cannot let "her community down".[141]On the albumThe ArchAndroid, especially in songs like "Cold War" or "BabopbyeYa", Monáe relates "the dystopian cityscapes depicted in Metropolis to the boarded-up projects of poverty-wracked Kansas".[142]Kansas City, therefore, not only represents Monáe's physical roots within her hometown, but also serves as an important influence on the lyrics and science-fictional setting.
I feel like I have a responsibility to my community and other young girls to help redefine what it looks like to be a woman. I don't believe in men's wear or women's wear, I just like what I like. And I think we should just be respected for being an individual... I've been inVogue, now, and different publications, which is cool, because I think that it just shows a different perspective of how women can dress.
Monáe's signature style is hertuxedowardrobe. She said "I bathe in it, I swim in it, and I could be buried in it. A tux is such a standard uniform, it's so classy and it's a lifestyle I enjoy. The tux keeps me balanced. I look at myself as a canvas. I don't want to cloud myself with too many colors or I'll go crazy. It's an experiment I'm doing. I think I want to be in the Guinness Book of World Records."[143]Monáe's signature look harkens back todandyism.[144]CitingGrace JonesandJosephine Bakeras role models, Monáe takes the classical 18th-century look in the classical white and black pattern.[145]Monáe's signature look can also be attributed to the early days in her career, when she was employed as a maid. She mentioned this in her acceptance speech for the "Young, Gifted, and Black" award at the 2012Black Girls Rock!ceremony.[146]Monáe has been known to distribute theTen Droid Commandments, which encourages her fans to be individuals.[137]The Telegraphalso commented on her image as an artist, saying, "Sitting in a grey, airless record company office, this slight, stiff young woman delivers her speech in slow, deliberate tones, utterly expressionless. Dressed in her trademark starched shirt and tuxedo, hair immaculately coiffed, Monáe's face is an opaque mask of perfection: all silken smooth skin, button nose and glassy brown eyes."[132]Monáe describes tuxedos as a uniform for her career, speaks of wanting to redefine how women dress,[137]and has been featured in the "Style 100" ofInStylemagazine.[147]TheCouncil of Fashion Designers of America Awardshonored Monáe with the Board of Directors' Tribute and the American Ingenuity Award for her "straoridanra ability to experiment in fashion".[148][149]
When it comes to her acting career, Monáe expressed desire to shape it around that ofJohnny Depp, stating that he has a very vast career: "The amount of roles:Willy WonkatoSweeney Toddto all of the dramatic roles. Whatever the Janelle Monáe version of that is. Maybe something even better..."[150]
During a 2011 interview withLondon Evening Standard, Monáe said she "only dates androids", a reference to her musical alter ego found in many of her songs. She also said, "I speak about androids because I think the android represents the new 'other'. You can compare it to being a lesbian or being a gay man or being a Black woman... what I want is for people who feel oppressed or feel like the 'other' to connect with the music and to feel like, 'She represents who I am.'" She added that she would talk about her sexual orientation "in due time".[141]In 2013, Monáe said she wants both men and women to "still be attracted to [her]" and expressed support for theLGBTQ community.[151]
Monáe has said she identifies with bothbisexualityandpansexuality.[23]On January 10, 2020, shetweetedthehashtag#IAmNonbinary, along with a quoted tweet, which trended on Twitter that day.[152][153]Monáe said in an interview withThe Cuta month after the tweet that "I tweeted the #IAmNonbinary hashtag in support of Nonbinary Day and to bring more awareness to the community. I retweeted theSteven Universememe 'Are you a boy or a girl?

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
