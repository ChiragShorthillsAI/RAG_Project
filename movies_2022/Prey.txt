Hulu(/ˈhuːluː/,HOO-loo) is an Americansubscriptionstreaming mediaservice owned byDisney Streaming, a subsidiary of theDisney Entertainmentsegment ofthe Walt Disney Company. It was launched on October 29, 2007, initially as ajoint venturebetweenNews Corporation(later21st Century Fox) andNBC Universal, which was laterbought byComcast. Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initiallybrandedas "Hulu Plus," which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and un-delayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—anover-the-topstreaming television service offering access tobroadcast televisionchannels.
In 2011, Hulu launchedits services in Japan, marking its first and only international expansion. Three years later in 2014, Hulu Japan was acquired byNippon TVand spun off from its American counterpart.[2]Since February 2021, Hulu's original content has since been distributed outside of the U.S. viaDisney+under theStarbrand. In 2019, Disney acquired a majority stake in Hulu as part of itsacquisition of 21st Century Fox, and subsequently acquired the remaining stakes held by AT&T and Comcast in 2019 and 2023, respectively, giving it full ownership. After the acquisition, Disneysoft launchedan integration of Hulu into Disney+ as a content hub in December 2023, allowing subscribers of both services to access Hulu content from within the Disney+ app. Hulu is one of the three streaming services in the Disney Bundle, alongside Disney+ andESPN+.
On January 6, 2025, Disney began its acquisition of a 70% stake inFuboTV, with the latter merging with Hulu's Live TV service. The combined company will remain publicly traded on theNew York Stock Exchange, but will be controlled by Disney executives. As part of the deal, Fubo settled a lawsuit againstESPN Inc.(majority-owned by Disney),Fox Corporation(21CF's successor), andWarner Bros. Discovery(WarnerMedia's successor after its merger withDiscovery, Inc.) over a joint venture known asVenu Sports, with Fubo being granted a preliminary injection to stop its launch in August 2024. The merger will take 12 to 18 months according to Disney and Fubo. Venu Sports was discontinued a few days later.
The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners." Jason Kilar was named Hulu CEO in late 2007.[10][11]NBC shut down its earlier online video effortNBBCin order to focus on Hulu.[12]
The nameHuluwas chosen in late August 2007, when the website went live with an announcement only and no content. It invited users to leave their email addresses for the upcomingbeta test.[13]In October 2007, Hulu began the private beta testing by invitation, and later allowed users to invite friends.[14]Hulu launched for public access in the United States on March 12, 2008.[15]
Hulu began an advertising campaign during NBC's broadcast ofSuper Bowl XLIIIwith an initial ad starringAlec Baldwintitled "Alec in Huluwood."[16]Advertisements have since aired featuringEliza Dushku,Seth MacFarlane,Denis Leary, andWill Arnett.[citation needed]
In July 2007,Providence Equity, the owner ofNewport Television, became one of the earliest "outside" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 millionequity investment,[17]before the company was known as "Hulu."[18]With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an "independent voice on the board."[18]In April 2009,the Walt Disney Companyjoined the Hulu consortium as a stakeholder, with plans to offer content fromABC,ESPNandDisney Channel.[19][20][21][22]
Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

Comcast, the only other shareholder, announced on May 14, 2019, that it had agreed to cede its control to Disney, and reached an agreement for Disney to purchase its 33% stake in the company as early as 2024.[38]
On May 14, 2019, Comcast relinquished its control in Hulu to Disney effective immediately. As a result, the streaming service became a division ofWalt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International(DTCI) with Comcast effectively becoming asilent partner. Under the agreement, Comcast's 33% stake can be sold to Disney atfair market valueas early as 2024. The fair market value will be determined at that time, but Disney guaranteed a minimum valuation of the entire company at $27.5 billion (valuing the Comcast stake as worth at least $9.075 billion).[39]Randy Freer would report to Disney executiveKevin Mayer.[39]
Disney stated that its control of Hulu was the third major component of its direct-to-consumer strategy, complementing its sports streaming serviceESPN+, and its then-forthcomingDisney+.

However, Comcast had not offered reasonable terms for an early buyout[54]and had instead expressed interest in buying Hulu themselves if it were for sale.[53]
On May 18, it was announced that Disney+ and Hulu would remove nearly 60 original films and series on May 26 in order to "cut costs."

In partnership with comScore, Hulu is the first digital company to receive multi-platform measurement at an individual level that includes co-viewing for living room devices.[citation needed]
The reliability of these metrics has been drawn into question, partly due to widely divergent estimates. For example, between May and June 2010, ComScore updated its scoring methodology and its estimates for Hulu. Hulu's viewers would go from 43.5 million to 24 million in one month.[150]In a comScore digital trends report in 2010, comScore's Digital Year in Review report found that Hulu was watched twice as much as viewers who watched on the websites of the five major TV networks combined.[151]
Hulu in May 2018 announced it has surpassed 20 million subscribers in the United States.[91]The tally, which puts the company about 36 million subscriptions behind Netflix, was disclosed at a media presentation at the newly named Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York. Hulu said it has grown total engagement by more than 60%, with 78% of viewing taking place in the living room on connected TVs.[citation needed]

After graduating fromLexington High Schoolin 2006, DiLiegro went on to spend a year atWorcester Academy, where he refined his skills as a basketball player in the school'spostgraduateprogram. He averaged 11 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 blocks at Worcester. This led to DiLiegro receiving a fullathletic scholarshipto play at theUniversity of New Hampshire.[3]
As a four-year starter for theNew Hampshire Wildcatsfrom 2007 to 2011, DiLiegro found his place on the team through defense, rebounding, and outworking his opponents.  He graduated from UNH in May 2011 with the second-highest number of rebounds in program history.[4][5]DiLiegro made ESPN's Top Ten plays of the day on February 19, 2009, for a dunk.[6][3]

DiLiegro won a gold medal with Team USA as a basketball player at the 18thMaccabiah Gamesin 2009 in Israel.[7]
In 2019, DiLiegro was invited to work as astand-inonFree Guy, which was filming in his native Boston. While on the set, stunt coordinator  Chris O’Hara suggested to DiLiegro to look into acting.[5]Just two weeks later, DiLiegro was cast to play Protein in the Netflix showSweet Home.

He stars in thePredatorfilmPreyas thePredator;[12][13][14]He performed all the acting, stunts andmotion captureof the creature. Prior to filming, he lost 25 pounds and spent months trainingparkour,martial artsand strengthening his neck due to the new design of the Predator, which sat the 15 poundanimatronichead on top of his head, forcing him to shoot every scene essentially blind.[15][16][17]
DiLiegro conducted a substantial amount of research in preparation for his role as the Predator:
"I went to mime school," remarks DiLiegro.  "With this character I have task of telling a story to people nonverbally and there is an interesting factor with the Predator.  You have to give the Predator a sense of personality without humanizing him.  Because Predators carry this level of anonymity. I created a backstory for him. I don’t want to say it because I don’t want to create canon.  It had a little hubris and maybe toyed with Naru (Amber Midthunder) too much and ultimately it got to him.  It was an interesting task telling his story, what motivated him and made him fearful without using words."[17]
DirectorDan Trachtenbergon DiLiegro's performance:
"Dane brought a lot to the performance... We're getting much more character, and storytelling, and fun little nuance-y bits from him as he interacts with what he's dealing with; and so much of what Dane brought to that character is what we embraced... but also, something I had not considered at all. And I'm so thankful for, is Dane's attitude as a human. He's a professional athlete, and you can tell, what I felt, is this guy was raised by a lot of coaches in his life. And I'm not an athlete, I love sports movies, I don't know anything about [sports], so I recognize it just from watching. But he just had this, you know, he didn't complain, he could be sweating and in the most pain or whatever, and he didn't complain, he kept on going because it's the suit and it doesn't always work and you got to keep at it. 
But, the head is 15 pounds on top of his head, and he's looking out through the neck, so to get the Predator to look forward, which it's doing for most of the movie, if not all of it, he has to be looking straight down at the ground. So he's holding 15 pounds in a very weird way, and it's not just looking down, he has to do a weird hunch or whatever. And that's just to look like you're not a dork in a suit, thats just to make it look normal, and then he has to do all the crazy, just walking is a thing, and all the action, take, after take, after take, in hot hot hot [weather], you know? and having that, like, "I want to make it great. How do I? Let's go one more." That attitude is why his version of this creature is getting the accolades that it's getting, you know? It's really the whole personhood of Dane is part of the reason why this Yautja kicks so much butt."[18]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
