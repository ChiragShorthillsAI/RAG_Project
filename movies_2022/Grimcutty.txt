Yael Tygiel ofColliderincludedGrimcuttyin their "Best Movies on Hulu Right Now" list, and described it as a "grizzly and terrifying movie."[8]Mike Mack ofLaughing Placecalled the film a "fine watch if you’re looking for something new," complimenting the story and the performances of the actors.[9]Sean Shuman ofMovieWebasserted, "Grimcuttymay not be a perfect movie, but it's an interesting encapsulation of just how quickly misinformation can wreak havoc, even if it's spread with good intentions."[10]Johnny Loftus ofDecidersaid, "It’s too long, and a character checking a phone or their email will never be as compelling to watch as Hollywood wants it to be. ButGrimcuttyhas a strong cast in its favor, and derives some scary-adjacent chills from setting its main baddie loose to grimly grab at teens in trouble."[11]
Matt Donato ofPastegaveGrimcuttya grade of 5.5 out of 10, and said the film "works itself backward into a forgettable cyber-folktale fate."[12]Shrija Ganguly ofSportskeedastated thatGrimcuttyhas "some good horror content," and complimented the performance ofUsman Ally, but stated that the film has too manyloopholes.[13]Lindsay Traves ofPajibaasserted that the film is "born of an interesting idea," but said that the execution was "unfortunately boring."[14]Kyle McWilliams ofMashablesaid that the "scares are overshadowed by over-explanation," writing, "If the movie trusted its audience more in collecting the thematic goods, there could be space to discover even deeper horrors within the depths of online culture. Instead, the spoon-feeding approach kills the thrills and the fun."[15]
Joe Lipsett ofBloody Disgustinggave the film a grade of 2 out of 5 and complimented the performance ofSara Wolfkind, but called it a "messy film, complete with substantial logic gaps, more than one scenery-chewing performance, and a run time that isn’t earned by its relatively thin, repetitive script."[16]Brian Costello ofCommon Sense MediagaveGrimcuttya grade of 2 out of 5, said the presence of positive messages is almost non-existent, and noted the absence of positive role models across the characters.[17]Loric C. ofReady Steady CutgaveGrimcuttya grade of 1.5 out of 5 and found the movie to be a "weak offering to the horror genre."[18]

Hulu(/ˈhuːluː/,HOO-loo) is an Americansubscriptionstreaming mediaservice owned byDisney Streaming, a subsidiary of theDisney Entertainmentsegment ofthe Walt Disney Company. It was launched on October 29, 2007, initially as ajoint venturebetweenNews Corporation(later21st Century Fox) andNBC Universal, which was laterbought byComcast. Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initiallybrandedas "Hulu Plus," which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and un-delayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—anover-the-topstreaming television service offering access tobroadcast televisionchannels.
In 2011, Hulu launchedits services in Japan, marking its first and only international expansion. Three years later in 2014, Hulu Japan was acquired byNippon TVand spun off from its American counterpart.[2]Since February 2021, Hulu's original content has since been distributed outside of the U.S. viaDisney+under theStarbrand. In 2019, Disney acquired a majority stake in Hulu as part of itsacquisition of 21st Century Fox, and subsequently acquired the remaining stakes held by AT&T and Comcast in 2019 and 2023, respectively, giving it full ownership. After the acquisition, Disneysoft launchedan integration of Hulu into Disney+ as a content hub in December 2023, allowing subscribers of both services to access Hulu content from within the Disney+ app. Hulu is one of the three streaming services in the Disney Bundle, alongside Disney+ andESPN+.
On January 6, 2025, Disney began its acquisition of a 70% stake inFuboTV, with the latter merging with Hulu's Live TV service. The combined company will remain publicly traded on theNew York Stock Exchange, but will be controlled by Disney executives. As part of the deal, Fubo settled a lawsuit againstESPN Inc.(majority-owned by Disney),Fox Corporation(21CF's successor), andWarner Bros. Discovery(WarnerMedia's successor after its merger withDiscovery, Inc.) over a joint venture known asVenu Sports, with Fubo being granted a preliminary injection to stop its launch in August 2024. The merger will take 12 to 18 months according to Disney and Fubo. Venu Sports was discontinued a few days later.
The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners." Jason Kilar was named Hulu CEO in late 2007.[10][11]NBC shut down its earlier online video effortNBBCin order to focus on Hulu.[12]
The nameHuluwas chosen in late August 2007, when the website went live with an announcement only and no content. It invited users to leave their email addresses for the upcomingbeta test.[13]In October 2007, Hulu began the private beta testing by invitation, and later allowed users to invite friends.[14]Hulu launched for public access in the United States on March 12, 2008.[15]
Hulu began an advertising campaign during NBC's broadcast ofSuper Bowl XLIIIwith an initial ad starringAlec Baldwintitled "Alec in Huluwood."[16]Advertisements have since aired featuringEliza Dushku,Seth MacFarlane,Denis Leary, andWill Arnett.[citation needed]
In July 2007,Providence Equity, the owner ofNewport Television, became one of the earliest "outside" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 millionequity investment,[17]before the company was known as "Hulu."[18]With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an "independent voice on the board."[18]In April 2009,the Walt Disney Companyjoined the Hulu consortium as a stakeholder, with plans to offer content fromABC,ESPNandDisney Channel.[19][20][21][22]
Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

Comcast, the only other shareholder, announced on May 14, 2019, that it had agreed to cede its control to Disney, and reached an agreement for Disney to purchase its 33% stake in the company as early as 2024.[38]
On May 14, 2019, Comcast relinquished its control in Hulu to Disney effective immediately. As a result, the streaming service became a division ofWalt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International(DTCI) with Comcast effectively becoming asilent partner. Under the agreement, Comcast's 33% stake can be sold to Disney atfair market valueas early as 2024. The fair market value will be determined at that time, but Disney guaranteed a minimum valuation of the entire company at $27.5 billion (valuing the Comcast stake as worth at least $9.075 billion).[39]Randy Freer would report to Disney executiveKevin Mayer.[39]
Disney stated that its control of Hulu was the third major component of its direct-to-consumer strategy, complementing its sports streaming serviceESPN+, and its then-forthcomingDisney+. Hulu would be oriented towards "general" entertainment and content targeting mature audiences.[40]NBCUniversal will continue to license its content to the service through at least 2024, but it will have the option to begin transitioning its exclusivity deals with Hulu to non-exclusive terms beginning in 2020, and to end other content deals beginning in 2022.[41]

However, Comcast had not offered reasonable terms for an early buyout[54]and had instead expressed interest in buying Hulu themselves if it were for sale.[53]
On May 18, it was announced that Disney+ and Hulu would remove nearly 60 original films and series on May 26 in order to "cut costs."

Hulu's viewers would go from 43.5 million to 24 million in one month.[150]In a comScore digital trends report in 2010, comScore's Digital Year in Review report found that Hulu was watched twice as much as viewers who watched on the websites of the five major TV networks combined.[151]

Rob Price at Comic Watch said she was a "bit uneven in her performance, for the most part she was good, but there were times she just didn’t seem genuine."[9]In a positive review of the film, Clement Tyler Obropta at Film Inquiry wrote that "Wolfkind plays the hell out of the role. She’s got bottomless reserves of pathos, and [writer-director John] Ross even trusts her to give a final ASMR address to the audience at the end of the picture. She’s the latest in a line of amazing young actresses emerging in Hollywood, many of whom got their start in horror: Wolfkind stands shoulder-to-shoulder inGrimcuttywithAmber MidthunderinPrey,Jenna OrtegainXandScream,Devery JacobsinRhymes for Young GhoulsandBlood Quantum,Anya Taylor-JoyinThe WitchandSplit,andBlu HuntinThe New Mutants— a legion of Gen Z Final Girls."[10]

Shannon Marie Kahololani Sossamon was born in Hawaii, and was raised inReno, Nevada.[2]Her ancestry includes Dutch, English, French, German, Irish, Filipino, and Hawaiian.[3][4]
Her parents divorced when she was five, and Sossamon and her sister were then raised by her mother, who married Randy Goldman, a salesman and manager of an auto dealership.[5]Sossamon attendedGalena High Schoolin Reno, graduating in 1995.[citation needed]
The day after herhigh schoolgraduation, she relocated toLos Angeleswith two friends, to study dance.[3][6]"Nothing compares to that feeling when you first leave home and arrive somewhere new," she once recalled. "When we woke up in the morning, just making coffee felt amazing. It felt like being so free – just to wake up and make coffee and look at our couch."[3]Theyin her first name was an alteration in 1995.[7]
After moving to Los Angeles in 1995, she began to work as aDJ, booking gigs in local clubs and performance venues.[3]While Sossamon was pursuing a career in dance, she actually never planned to become a professional dancer, recalling: "It was more like I just love to do this. It wasn't clear what I wanted, but I was fine with that. I had never needed a plan. I'm really good at feeling safe in the unknown aspects of planning your life".[8]Around that time, Sossamon established her early career by modeling for various companies includingSassy Magazine, Unionbay Clothing,American Eagle Outfitters, andPlanned Parenthood. She appeared in two television commercials forGapand in music videos for artists such asDaft Punk,The Goo Goo Dolls,Cher,DJ Quik, and the rock group 9xdead.

Sossamon beatKate Hudsonfor the lead female role inBrian Helgeland's adventure dramedyA Knight's Tale, oppositeHeath Ledger.[9]She was cast as Lady Jocelyn, the love interest of a peasant (Ledger) pretending to be a knight. The film premiered on May 11, 2001,[10]and received average reviews,[11]with her part getting an equally mixed response; Robin Clifford forReeling Reviewsconcluded that Sossamon was "pretty but little more than an object of affection"[12]and Rob Blackwelder ofSPLICEDwirecalled her role "the movie's weakest link", noting that although Sossamon was a "wonderfully wicked flirt", her character "isn't terribly well established and she's the most jarringly modern sight in this ancient tale".[13]A Knight's Talegarnered US$117,487,473 worldwide,[14]bringing Sossamon into mainstream audiences. It earned her twoTeen Choice Awardsnominations as well as threeMTV Movie Awardsnominations, including one for "Best Breakthrough Performance".[15]
Sossamon appeared in the music video for "God Gave Me Everything" by Mick Jagger in 2001. The video was directed by Mark Romanek and features Jagger, Lenny Kravitz, and Sossamon.
In 2002, Sossamon starred in the romantic comedy40 Days and 40 Nights, as Erica Sutton, the love interest ofJosh Hartnett's character, Matt Sullivan. It received mixed reviews from critics, but was a major box office success, earning a worldwide total of US$95,146,283 on a production budget of US$17 million.[16]Sossamon's part gained critical acclaim in general;About.comnoted that she was "already making a name for herself as a romantic leading lady. With starring roles opposite two of Hollywood's hottest young actors (Hartnett and Heath Ledger) under her belt, Shannyn's star is rising fast. Her exotic looks separate her from the pack, and her performances have, thus far, been exceptional".[17]Praising Sossamon and co-star Harnett,Elvis Mitchellwrote forThe New York Times: "Mr. Hartnett matches up with Ms. Sossamon, and not only because their eyebrows signal that they are both Vulcans. She is a more direct performer; what she does is not acting – yet – but she can look as if she's listening. Her approach contrasts hilariously with his gentility".[18]Afterwards, both actors received aTeen Choice Awardnomination for "Choice Film Chemistry".[19]
Sossamon subsequently played Lauren Hynde inRoger Avary's darksatiricalensembleThe Rules of Attraction. The film, about a promiscuous college student, included scenes ofsuicide, heavydrug use, and sexual content. It received polarizing reviews from critics.[20][21]Critical response for Sossamon was more favorable, withJoblo.comcommenting that the actress was "very believable and empathetic" as her character.[22]David Noh ofFilm Journal Internationalfound her performance "heartbreaking" and described it as "an uncanny blend of fragile-fey and urchin-tough, marked by a feverish wit which often proves her undoing as much as her salvation".[23]Also showing approval of her portrayal, Avary remarked during an interview the actress was "like a wild animal you can't really control. What she does and what she brings is complete and honest truth to the scene. Something real.” Ellis, meanwhile, stated that Sossamon "hasn't had much of a chance to shine before, but she's a star. She seems freer in this movie than she was before and is totally empathetic, which is a quality that doesn't come easily to most actors".[24]Rules of Attractionis considered aculthit;[25]it grossed US$11,819,244 worldwide, almost tripling its budget (US$4 million).[26]

After Sossamon filmedThe Order, she became pregnant and took a hiatus from working on film productions; "It was almost like she was out on a lark, and she found herself in this big circumstance that she hadn't planned on, which I think made it easier for her to go off and have a baby and stop working", director Helgeland said on the actress' motherhood and subsequent acting break.[8]She has recalled seeing her acting career in a "total stop" after giving birth, but nevertheless described her absence on screen as a "blessing in disguise for many reasons".[31]Her only acting appearance of 2004 was a guest-starring role on theNBCseriesLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit, in the episode “Doubt”.[32][33]

She played Josie in the dramedyUndiscovered, which followed a group of aspiring entertainers who intend to establish their careers inLos Angeles.

Sossamon signed on as a series regular onCBS' vampire dramaMoonlight, to play the character of Coraline Duvall. The series began airing on September 28, 2007, and was watched by 8.54 million viewers,[56]finishing first among total viewers and adults 18–49 for its night.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
