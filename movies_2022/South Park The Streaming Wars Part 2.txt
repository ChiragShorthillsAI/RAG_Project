"South Park The Streaming Wars Part 2" is a 2022 Americanadult animatedcomedytelevision specialepisode written and directed byTrey Parker. It is the fourthSouth Parktelevision special and 319th overall episode of the television series, and was released onParamount+on July 13, 2022.[1][2][3]It concludes the storyline that began in its predecessor, "South Park The Streaming Wars".
Amidst the streaming wars, the drought in South Park has significantly worsened. In court,Eric Cartmansues his motherLiane, forcingStan Marsh,Tolkien Black,Butters StotchandKyle Broflovskito testify about how Cartman used the money they earned to pay for his breast implants; the case is ultimately dismissed. Elsewhere,Randy Marshwakes up on a bench, surrounded by fearful onlookers. Police tranquilize Randy and transport him to the hospital, whereDetective Harrisexplains that Randy went "full nuclearKaren". Meanwhile, Tolkien searches the late Robert Cussler's abandoned home for clues about his missing father,Steve. When he tells Cartman of Cussler's death, Cartman surmises that Tolkien is having sex with Liane, believing it to be why she is standing up to Cartman.
At aDenvercity council meeting,Pi Piproposes hispitch deckto have hiswater park, and subsequently the entirety ofColorado, run entirely onurine. His service is endorsed by celebrities who promotedcryptocurrencyandNFTs. Meanwhile, a remorseful Randy abandons his marijuana farming business and resumes hisgeologyprofession, searching for a solution to the drought. As Denver is about to commission Pi Pi's service, Randy arrives and proposes building adesalinationplant, which Denver accepts. Enraged, Pi Pi orders his staff, includingManBearPig, to get rid of Randy. Cartman and Butters spy on Tolkien at his house; when Tolkien confronts them, Cartman reveals his research on the drought. Cartman, Butters and Tolkien tell Harris of their research; Harris, believing that Steve is behind the drought, reveals that ManBearPig is likely being exploited as it fears for its mate, PigBearGirl; and their offspring, Chuck Chuck. When Harris reveals a photo of Steve at the water park, the boys realize he must be there. Steve regains consciousness in a sewer; noticing his patched-up wound, he realizes that PigBearGirl and Chuck Chuck tended to him.
Construction of the desalination plant begins as Randy realizes that there will be an issue transporting saltwater uphill to the plant. As Cartman, Butters and Tolkien survey the waterpark, they locate an employee entrance near the water slide seen in Harris' photo. Inside, they discover Chuck Chuck before being trapped by security. Pi Pi tells the boys his plans to have everyone invest in his urine service and eliminate the boys. Harris visits Linda Black at Credigree Weed, revealing his intent to kill Steve if he finds him, while Steve eavesdrops on their conversation. Randy receives a call from his coworkers that ManBearPig, referred to as "climate change," has destroyed the plant, presumably in search of Randy. Steve finds Randy and tells him of Pi Pi's plan. Randy's family convinces him to revert to his Karenpersona, using a strain of marijuana Sharon had saved.
As Pi Pi films his latest commercial, Randy, as Karen, forces his way into the waterpark and reveals Pi Pi's plan to everyone present. The distraction allows the kids to escape with the help of Chuck Chuck and PigBearGirl. Tolkien and ManBearPig are reunited with their respective families. Now free from Pi Pi's control, ManBearPig decapitates him. Randy convinces Cartman and other women with breast implants to drain their saline implants and power the desalination plant. The plant restores water to the Denver area as ManBearPig and his family return to the woods. When Linda suggests that Chuck Chuck should be killed before he ends up like his father, Stan instead suggests that the people reach out to him, but Randy dismisses this, inviting everyone to simply smoke some marijuana.
On August 5, 2021,Comedy Centralannounced that Parker and Stone had signed a $900 million deal for extending the series to 30 seasons through 2027 and 14 feature films, exclusive to the Paramount+ streaming platform. It was eventually confirmed that they would be rolled out as two films per year.[4][5]Parker and Stone would later state that the projects would not be feature films, and that it wasViacomCBSwho decided to advertise them as movies.[6]Subsequent advertising and branding has indicated that these are more properly classified as television specials.
"Streaming Wars Part 2" was announced with its release date and synopsis on June 29, 2022.[1]
Spencer Legacy withComingsoon.netrated the episode a 9 out of 10, which the site equates to "Excellent", and stated in the summary of his review that the episode "is a strong step up from the first part, featuring a mix of both sharp commentary and stupid yet hilarious gags. Randy had a neat arc that old-school fans will appreciate, and no celebrity was spared fromSouth Park's hilarious wrath. Whether we get another special or season 26 next, the show is in a good spot, ripe with opportunities for silly stories and topical jabs. Even if you didn't dig the first part of The Streaming Wars, I recommend checking out Part 2, as it's a fun burst of classic South Park comedy."[7]
David Pierce withThe Vergeparticularly enjoyed the episode's roast of celebrities who have endorsedcryptocurrencyandNFTsin commercials, stating "Matt Damonmaking that 'Fortune Favors The Brave' commercial forCrypto.comwill go down in history as one of the best things that ever happened toSouth Park...The show has been making fun of crypto, Damon, and that phrase ever since. But withSouth Park The Streaming Wars Part 2, which just hit Paramount Plus, the show's crypto jokes hit a new level."[8]
John Schwarz withBubbleblabber.comrated the episode a 9 out of 10, which the site equates to "Awesome: Not quite perfect, but you should watch whatever this is even if you think you're not a fan of the franchise or are familiar with the subject matter", noting how he particularly enjoyed the releases of adult animation specials on Paramount+. He stated in his review: "In the last 45-days, Paramount+ has sandwiched twoSouth Parkmovies witha newBeavis and Butt-Headmoviein the meaty middle, making this the most fulfilling event-filled summer yet for adult animation. I don't know if more specials are hitting by the end of the summer as of this writing, but I'm loving this back and forth betweenMike Judgeand Matt/Trey as it's making both creative camps come forward with their best stuff. As stupid as it is that Cartman gets boobs inSouth Park The Streaming Wars Part One, it's equally as dumb for Beavis and Butt-head to be sent to space.South Park The Streaming Wars Part Twoanswers back with a piss-filled tour de force that will have people talking for weeks...just in time for Paramount+ to hit us with hopefully another adult animated comedy special of some kind."[9]

Comedy Centralis an Americancablechannelowned byParamount Globalthrough itsnetworkdivision'sMTV Entertainment Groupunit, based inManhattan. The channel carries comedy programming in the form of both original, licensed, andsyndicatedtelevision series,stand-up comedyspecials, andfeature films.
As of November 2023[update], Comedy Central is available to approximately 68,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2011 peak of 99,000,000 households.[1]
On November 15, 1989,Time-Life, the owners ofHBO, launchedThe Comedy Channelas the firstcable channeldevoted exclusively to comedy-based programming. On April 1, 1990,Viacom(who ownedMTV,VH1, andNickelodeon) launched a rival channel calledHa![2]that featured reruns ofsituation comediesand some originalsketch comedy.
The Comedy Channel's programs were broadcast from the HBO Downtown Studios at 120 East 23rd Street in Manhattan. The format prior to the merger with Ha! included several original and unconventional programs such asOnion WorldwithRich HallandMystery Science Theater 3000, as well as laid-back variety/talk shows hosted by comedians, includingThe Sweet LifewithRachel Sweet,Night After Night with Allan Havey,Sports Monster, andThe Higgins Boys and Gruber, the latter of whom performed sketches in between showings of vintage television series likeSupercar,Clutch Cargo, andLancelot Link, Secret Chimp.
The standard format for The Comedy Channel's shows usually involved the various hosts introducing clips culled from the acts of stand-up comedians as well as classic comedies of the 1970s and 1980s, such asYoung FrankensteinandKentucky Fried Movie, presented in a style similar to music videos. In the early days, certain hours of the day when clips were shown without "host segments" were dubbedShort Attention Span Theater. In 1990, hosts under this title,Jon StewartandPatty Rosborough, were introduced. ComedianMarc Maronalso hosted the series.
While The Comedy Channel broadcast mostly low-budget original programming,[3]Ha!'s schedule featured sitcom and sketch comedy reruns (many of which had been previously licensed for sister networkNick at Nite) as well as complete 90-minute reruns ofSaturday Night Livefrom the sixth through 16th seasons.
After two years of limited distribution, the two channels merged into one, relaunching onApril 1, 1991, asCTV: The Comedy Network. On June 1, 1991, the network changed its name to Comedy Central[4]to prevent issues with theCanadianbroadcast television networkCTV, which would eventually be its Canadian content partner throughThe Comedy Networkwhen that channel started operations six years later.
Around this time, the network introduced their now-iconic logo, which is a globe showing theAmericaswith tall buildings on theNorth Americanpart and a black marquee ring (see below).
Comedy Partners was originally a partnership ofHome Box Office, Inc., the subsidiary ofTime Warnerthat owned The Comedy Channel and HBO's half and Viacom Hearty Ha! Ha!LLC, the subsidiary that owned Ha! and Viacom's half of the network during its first years on air.[5]Viacom bought out AOL Time Warner's half in April 2003 for $1.23 billion.[6]Despite HBO's exit from the venture, the Viacom Media Networks division in charge of Comedy Central is still called Comedy Partners, currently being apartnershipofParamount Global Content Distribution, the operating subsidiary of Paramount of whichParamount Media Networksis a division and Viacom Hearty Ha! Ha!LLC, the subsidiary that owned Ha! and Viacom's original half of the network.[7]
From the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, much of theprogrammingon Comedy Central and its predecessors consisted ofcomedy films, sitcom reruns, half-hour specials, and clip shows featuring comedians. Except for the cult favoriteMystery Science Theater 3000, the channel had a relatively small viewership. A notable early success wasPolitically IncorrectwithBill Maher, which after showing promise on Comedy Central was quickly snapped up byABC. Additionally,The Daily Showhad got its start with original hostCraig Kilborn, although it would take a few more years for the show to reach high popularity (and a shift toward a focus on political humor) with the introduction ofJon Stewartin 1999[8](who was former co-host ofShort Attention Span Theaterfrom 1991).
Dr. Katz, Professional Therapistwas also a notable original program from this era, as well as the game showWin Ben Stein's Money. Successful non-original programming included Canadian comedy groupThe Kids in the Halland British shows such as the UK edition ofWhose Line Is It Anyway?(the predecessor of the U.S. version, featuring much of the same American cast as would later be seen in the U.S.) and the sitcomAbsolutely Fabulous. Some later seasons ofAbFab, as it was informally known, were partially financed by Comedy Central. Comedy Central also had the national rights to broadcast reruns of Seattle'sAlmost Live!between 1992 and 1993.
The channel made a breakthrough whenSouth Parkpremiered in 1997. Being one of the first major basic cable shows to carry theTV-MArating for mature audiences, the show was considered too controversial to be picked up by any mainstream network;[9]For example,Fox(known forThe Simpsons) refused to pick up the series due to the over-the-top offensive content at the time. Asword of mouthspread, the number of people who requested that Comedy Central should be added to their cable providers increased, and the channel became available in over 50% of American homes by 1998.
On October 30, 2000, Comedy Central introduced a modernized version of its globe logo, by straightening and modernizing the buildings as well as removing the transmitter and marquee. The management of the network said that the transmitter of the 1991 logo was said to "communicate the 1950s broadcast era". In 2002,Comedy Central Recordswas formed as a means of releasing albums by comedians that have appeared on the network.[10]
By 2003,Viacomgained full ownership of Comedy Central, and since 2003, Comedy Central has created atraditionof roasting comedians in the style of theNew York Friars' Clubroasts. During these roasts, friends of the roastee, along with other comedians, take turns making fun of the roastee, the other roasters, and occasionally audience members. So far, the roastees have includedDenis Leary,[11]Jeff Foxworthy,[12]Pamela Anderson,[13]William Shatner,[14]Flavor Flav,[15]Bob Saget,Larry the Cable Guy,Joan Rivers,Rob Reiner,David Hasselhoff,Donald Trump,Charlie Sheen,Roseanne Barr,James Franco,Justin Bieber,Rob Lowe,Bruce Willis, andAlec Baldwin.
The success ofSouth Park, despite its mature content, encouraged the network to continue to push the limits on adult language. Every late Friday (early Saturday morning) and Saturday night (early Sunday morning) at 1 a.m.ET/PT, a movie, comedy special, or animated program is shown unedited for language as part of a block called theSecret Stash. It premiered on July 4, 2003, with the unedited cable television debut ofSouth Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.[a]Though no language is censored on the Secret Stash, most nudity in the programs is still edited out, except for limited nudity allowed in animated programs such asDrawn Together, andrear nudity.
In late 2004, it was reported that the four highest-rated shows on Comedy Central were, in descending order,South Park,Chappelle's Show,The Daily ShowandReno 911!. Shortly thereafter,Dave Chappellebacked out of the much-anticipated third season ofChappelle's Show.[16]Meanwhile,The Daily Showcontinued to climb in the ratings. In October 2005, on the occasion of a new three-year contract forSouth Parkand the launch ofDaily Showspin-offThe Colbert Report, it was reported thatSouth ParkandThe Daily Showwere the two highest-ratedshows on Comedy Central. Comedy Central chiefDoug Herzogwas reported as saying that he hoped to continue to air new seasons ofSouth Parkforever, and thatThe Colbert Reportfulfilled a long-held plan to extend theDaily Showbrand.
On April 5, 2006, in a controversial two-part episode arc titled "Cartoon Wars Part I" and "Cartoon Wars Part II",South Parktouched the issue of therecent protestover the Danish cartoon drawings depicting the Muslim prophetMuhammad. The image of Muhammad did not appear in the episode. The episode also mocked fellow cartoonFamily Guy. On April 13, 2006, Comedy Central issued a statement[17]which appears to confirm that the network prohibited the show's creators from airing an image of Muhammad. The statement reads,"In light of recent world events, we feel we made the right decision."An anonymous source close to the show indicated[citation needed]thatSouth ParkcreatorsTrey ParkerandMatt Stonewere informed of the policy several weeks earlier and wrote this story arc in protest. This was a change of policy for Comedy Central, having allowedSouth Parkto portray an image of Muhammad in an earlier episode, "Super Best Friends". Oddly enough, an image of Muhammad was still briefly visible in the opening credits of the "Cartoon Wars" episodes (the image had been there as a call-back to "Super Best Friends").
On January 15, 2007, MTV Networks International launched Comedy Central in Germany which is available for free throughout Europe. The channel airs 33 shows either dubbed in German or subtitled while also airing locally produced shows.[18]On April 30, Dutch channelThe Boxwas relaunched as the Dutch version of Comedy Central during theprimetimeand overnight hours timesharing withNickelodeon.[19]On May 1, 2007, Comedy Central expanded to Italy, replacing Paramount Comedy.[20]
On June 27, 2007,CTVglobemedia-owned networksCTVandThe Comedy Networkobtained the exclusive Canadian rights to the entire Comedy Central library of past and current programs on all electronic platforms, under a multi-year agreement withViacom, expanding on past programming agreements between the two channels. Canadian users attempting to visit Comedy Central websites were redirected to The Comedy Network's website. The Canadian channel retains its brand name, but the agreement is otherwise very similar to the earlier CTV–Viacom deal forMTV in Canada.[21]As of 2011, this geocaching no longer applies and both the Comedy Central and The Comedy Network websites can be accessed worldwide, except for videos which remain only accessible within each respective country.
In December 2007, Comedy Central picked up a show hosted byLewis BlackcalledLewis Black's Root of All Evil,[22]which debuted in March 2008. On January 9, 2008, it was announced the Comedy Central and MTV would allow the streaming its programs online for free starting in February that year.[23]On January 24, Scott Landsman became the Vice President of Original Programming and Development at the network.[24]

The grant allowed Comedy Central to broadcast on theterrestrialtelevision network between January 1, 2009, and March 31, 2014, after which a new request had to be submitted to continue broadcasting.[25]Comedy Central's U.S. flagship network picked up a remake ofThe Gong Showhosted byDave Attell,[26]star of his former self-titled Comedy Central seriesInsomniac, which debuted in July 2008. Another new show calledReality Bites Back[27]premiered afterThe Gong Show with Dave Attell.

The network also played a role in the revival of the animated seriesFuturama, whichFoxhad canceled in 2003. New episodes began airing on Comedy Central in 2010. But in May 2013, Comedy Central released a statement saying that the contract betweenFuturamaand Comedy Central would not be renewed and that the summer of 2013 would beFuturama's final season on the air. However, episodes continue to run weekly on Comedy Central.[33]
In 2009, Comedy Central launched a1080ihigh definitionsimulcastfeed,[34]which was available on all major cable and satellite providers. The standard definition Comedy Central downscales the HD feed and broadcasts in 16:9 letterboxed to fit the 4:3 ratio. The network also introduced the Internet viral video reaction showTosh.0, hosted by comedianDaniel Tosh. During its second year in the summer of 2010, it became the most viewed show; overtakingThe Daily ShowandThe Colbert Reportfor male audiences aged 18–49.[citation needed]Segments fromTosh.0's past seasons have received more views on Comedy Central'sYouTubechannel than any other show.
South Parkepisodes "200" and "201" aired in April 2010, revisiting the issue of the Islamic religious figureMuhammad's perceived immunity to parody, for fear of violent retaliation. The Super Best Friends returned, but Muhammad was entirely covered by a black bar reading "CENSORED" through all of his screen time. By the second episode of the two-parter, Comedy Central decided to censor every instance of his name, as well as three entire monologues, from the end of the show. The monologues dealt with the subjects of censorship and intimidation but did not use Muhammad's name.Trey ParkerandMatt Stonehave since issued a statement to the press, confirming that the "bleeps" were added weeks after the show was finished and that Comedy Central has refused to let them post the original version ofSouth Park, in addition to retroactively removing the original "Super Best Friends" episode.Trey Parkerthreatened to quit the show after this incident.[35]
On December 9, 2010, Comedy Central introduced a new logo for the network that launched on January 1, 2011, which left behind the previous theme of a world-sized "tower" broadcasting the network/skyscrapers, in favor of an image of two "C"'s, with one of them and the word "Central" turned upside-down within the new logomark. The new logo was designed to represent the network's unique brand of comedy (with some drawing comparisons to thecopyright symbolas inspiration for its design and use), and to provide the network with a logo that could be easily used across different platforms, such as social media. However, the "bars" version of the logo used from 2000 to 2011 was intended to be Comedy Central's new logo as part of a planned rebranding in 2010, and the network used it short-lived until the network started a logo nicknamed the "Comedymark".[36][37]The logo's resemblance to the one used by theFederal Communications Commissionwas also pointed out.[38][39]It went on to win several industry awards.[40]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
