Inspired by Gray's childhood experiences,[5]the story follows a youngJewish-Americanboy who befriends an African-American classmate and begins to struggle with his family's expectations and growing up in a time of inequality and prejudice. It was shot inNew JerseyandFresh Meadows, Queens, where Gray grew up.

In 1980Queens, New York City, on his first day in sixth grade,Jewish-AmericanPaul Graff becomes friends with a rebelliousAfrican-Americanclassmate, Johnny Davis. Johnny was held back by a year and gets harsher treatment from their teacher when they both joke around in class. Paul often disassociates from his schoolwork and draws pictures instead.
Paul lives with his financially stable family. He is close with his maternal grandfather, Aaron Rabinowitz, who encourages him to pursue his aspiration to become an artist. His well-meaning but strict parents, Esther and Irving, are less convinced of Paul's career prospects as an artist. At night, Aaron tells Paul the story of how Aaron's mother escapedantisemiticpersecution inUkraine, fleeing toLondonbefore eventually emigrating to the U.S. with Aaron and her British husband.
One day, Paul and Johnny are caught smoking ajointin the restrooms, unaware that it's an illegal drug. Furious, Esther allows Irving to beat Paul as punishment. In the hope that he becomes more disciplined, Paul is sent to theForest Manor Prepprivate school by his parents,[5]where his older brother Ted is studying. Meanwhile, Johnny stops going to school after being relegated to special education.
Forest Manor is financially supported by famous businessmanFred Trump, who also supportsRonald Reaganin the upcomingpresidential election. Many of the students are also Reagan supporters. On Paul's first day, Fred's daughterMaryanne, one of the school's famous alumni, gives a speech to the students about working to earn their success. Paul sees the school's advantages over his previous school but doesn't feel welcome. He is also unnerved by other students' racist comments when Johnny meets with him during recess. Johnny begins living in secret at Paul's clubhouse, having nowhere to go other than living with his sick grandmother, wherefoster systemworkers searching for Johnny have begun to visit regularly.
While playing at the park on the weekend, Paul tells Aaron of his struggles at school and how he did nothing when he witnessed racism. Aaron encourages Paul to stand up against prejudice when he sees it, reminding him that while antisemitism still covertly persists, he and his family still have the privilege of being white. Shortly after, Aaron dies of bone cancer, with the family mourning his loss.
Tired of living under high expectations from family and school, as well as the unfair treatment of Johnny, Paul convinces Johnny to steal a computer from school and sell it so they can run away together. After stealing the computer, they are arrested for trying to pawn it. While being interrogated, Paul confesses that it was all his plan. But knowing that he has no options in life, Johnny takes the blame to let Paul go, much to Paul's dismay. Paul and Johnny bid farewell, as Irving arrives to take him home with no consequences because Irving once did the interrogating officer a favor. At home, Irving confesses to Paul that he is sympathetic to his frustration with America's unfair racial inequality, but tells him that they need to survive to have a good life. The two agree to not tell Esther what happened, as she is still mourning her father.
Days later, the Graff family are disappointed by Reagan's victory in the election, while Paul is focused on schoolwork. During aThanksgivingdance at school, Fred Trump addresses the students, expressing hope that they'll become the next successful elite. A disillusioned Paul leaves during the speech.

The film premiered at the2022 Cannes Film Festivalon May 19, 2022, where it received a seven-minute standing ovation.[20]It began alimited releasein the U.S. on October 28, 2022, before expandingnationwideon November 4.[21]It was distributed in the U.S. byFocus Featuresand internationally byUniversal Pictures.[21]
Armageddon Timewas released onVODplatforms on November 22, 2022,[22]followed by release onhome media(Blu-ray and DVD) on January 3, 2023, byUniversal Pictures Home EntertainmentandStudio Distribution Services.[23]
The film grossed $1.9 million domestically and $4.7 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $6.5 million. Sources such asVarietyattributed this performance to poor marketing, a mixed audience reception and the general public losing interest in supportingprestige filmsin favor ofMCU franchiseandhorror filmsin a movie-going environment altered by thepandemic.[24][25]
Gray called the film's financial performance a "failure" and warned that films of its kind would continue to fail commercially, adding,[26]
You’re now in a situation where literally every single one of these [non-franchise] movies is not doing well, and in some ways, that’s the great equalizer ... But you also know as a film person that has absolutely no bearing on the long-term reaction to a film. I’m a film person, and I have no idea what the box office receipts were of, you know,A Clockwork Orangeor something. So I try to divorce myself from that as well. Because I can’t do anything about it.
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 75% of 224 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's consensus reads: "Armageddon Timefinds writer-director James Gray excavating his own past and returning with a well-acted drama refreshingly free of nostalgia."[27]Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 74 out of 100 based on 54 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[28]
FilmmakerAlexander Paynepraised the film, saying "James’ film is about himself and his family, but I saw myself and my own struggles with myself and with family. I heard echoes of myself in the choices I made as a kid and continue to make as I stumble my way through life. But no matter how maladroit the actions of his characters, James Gray paints them with compassion and understanding. Understanding — what else is there? We’re not bad people. We’re just doing it all for the first time."[29]

Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]

The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Jeremy Strong(born December 25, 1978) is an American actor.[1]Known for his intensemethod actingstyle in roles across both stage and screen,[a]he has receivedvarious accolades, including aPrimetime Emmy Award, aTony Awardand aGolden Globe Award, as well as nominations for anAcademy AwardandBAFTA Award. In 2022, Strong was featured onTime'slist of the100 most influential people in the world.[3][4]
A graduate ofYale University, Strong continued his acting studies at both theRoyal Academy of Dramatic Artin London and theSteppenwolf Theatre Companyin Chicago. His first off-Broadway performance was as a distraught soldier in theJohn Patrick ShanleyplayDefiancein 2006, with his Broadway debut being in the role ofRichard Richin the 2008 revival of theRobert BoltplayA Man for All Seasons. His film debut came that same year with the comedyHumboldt County, and he played small roles in the 2012 filmsLincolnandZero Dark Thirty, before receiving early recognition forParkland(2013) andThe Big Short(2015). Strong gained international recognition with his portrayal ofKendall Royin theHBOdrama seriesSuccession(2018–2023), which won him thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.
Strong went on to feature in the filmsThe Gentlemen(2019),The Trial of the Chicago 7(2020), andArmageddon Time(2022). In 2024, he returned to Broadway playing Thomas Stockman, the conscientious doctor in a small town, in the revival of theHenrik IbsenplayAn Enemy of the Peopleearning aTony Award for Best Actor in a Play. That same year, Strong received praise for his portrayal ofRoy CohninThe Apprentice, which earned him nominations for theBAFTA,Golden Globeand theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
Strong was born on Christmas Day 1978 inBoston, Massachusetts, to Maureen and David Strong. His mother is of Irish descent, and his father's family is Jewish, originally from Russia; his paternal grandfather worked as a plumber inQueens.[5][6][7]His mother worked as a hospice nurse, and his father worked injuvenile jails.[2]He lived in a "rough neighborhood" in theJamaica Plainarea of Boston, a place he often regarded as "somewhere I just wanted to get out of". His family was working class. Since his parents could not afford to go on vacations outside the Boston area, they put a canoe on cinder blocks in the family's backyard; Strong and his brothers would often sit in it and pretend to take trips.[2]His parents had a tumultuous relationship throughout his childhood and eventually divorced.[8]
When Strong was 10, his parents moved the family to the suburb ofSudbury,[9]for better schools. Strong recalled Sudbury as "a kind of country-club town where we didn't belong to the country club". His interest in acting began there, as he became involved with a children's theater group and performing in musicals. Among his costars in the children's theater group wasChris Evans' older sister; Evans remembers being impressed by Strong's performances. Later, Evans and Strong acted with each other in a high school production ofA Midsummer Night's Dream.[2]
Strong particularly idolized actorsDaniel Day-Lewis,Al Pacino, andDustin Hoffman—all famous for the lengths they went to preparing for roles—putting posters of their films on his bedroom wall and avidly following news of their careers as well as reading every interview they gave. When the 1996 film version ofArthur Miller'sThe Cruciblewas filmed near Boston, starring Day-Lewis, Strong got a job on the film's greenery crew—at one point holding up a branch outside a window during the filming of a scene. Strong worked on the sound crew forAmistad, holding aboom mikeoverAnthony Hopkinsas he made a speech, and he helped to edit Pacino's directorial debutLooking for Richard.[2]
After high school, Strong applied to colleges with a letter of recommendation fromDreamWorks, which had madeAmistad. He was accepted at Yale University and granted a scholarship, intending to study drama.[10]On his first day in class, he found the professor's discussions ofKonstantin Stanislavskiand accompanying blackboard illustrations so alienating that he decided immediately to change his major to English.[2]
Strong continued to act and starred in a number of plays at Yale, all of them produced through the student-runYale Dramatic Association, known as Dramat. The plays were all ones that Pacino had performed, such asAmerican Buffalo,The Indian Wants the Bronx, andHughie. Strong arranged an offstage visit from Pacino, which did not go down well with other members of Dramat, because it was budgeted so extravagantly that it nearly bankrupted their organization. Despite claiming not to remember the cost overruns, Strong admitted to being a "rogue agent" in planning the event. During one summer at Yale, Strong received an internship with Hoffman's production company. He also studied at theRoyal Academy of Dramatic Artin London and theSteppenwolf Theatre Companyin Chicago.[2]
After Yale, Strong moved to New York in 2001. He lived in a small apartment inSoHo, above a restaurant where he waited tables. Strong described it as a state of "gilded squalor" in the words ofFrancis Bacon (artist), with little but his bed, books, and a closet with expensive clothing. When not working he persuaded local FedEx offices to give him some free envelopes in which he put headshots and recordings of himself performing monologues to distribute to talent agencies. For almost a year, he got no calls for auditions. In an attempt to get representation, Strong contacted his former high school classmateChris Evans, who had become successful afterNot Another Teen Movie. Evans set up a meeting between Strong and his agent atCreative Artists Agency, who chose not to sign Strong.[2]
The following summer, Strong got a spot in the summer company at theWilliamstown Theatre Festivalin western Massachusetts. Strong continued to work offstage in theater and film. In 2003, his position as an assistant at an independent film production company led to his service as Day-Lewis's personal assistant onThe Ballad of Jack and Rose, released two years later. On set, he was so devoted to attending to Day-Lewis, who lived apart from his family during the shoot, that crew members nicknamed himCletusafterthe character fromThe Simpsons, for his focus on menial tasks. Strong has stated that at the end of the shoot, Day-Lewis wrote him a note "that contains many of what have become my most deeply held precepts and beliefs about this work". He has not publicized the contents of the note out of respect for Day-Lewis.[2]
Strong returned to Williamstown in 2004 when he was cast withJessica Chastain,Chris Messina, andMichelle WilliamsinThe Cherry Orchard. He became friends with all three actors, and for intermittent periods in the late 2000s, he lived in the basement of Williams' townhouse in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Boerum Hill when he could not afford his own apartment.[2]
During the mid-2000s, he worked as a typist for playwrightWendy Wasserstein. At night, he performed the role of an alcoholic Irishman in a one-manConor McPhersonplay in a small bar in Midtown Manhattan. After Wasserstein discovered how much time Strong was spending observing her building's Irish doorman for the part, she considered writing a play based on Strong and the doorman but was unable to proceed with it before her death in 2006.[2]Frank Rich, one of Wasserstein's close friends, said Strong was "her assistant, slash—to some extent—caregiver."[11]
By that time, Strong had begun gettingoff-Broadwayroles. He took part in Marine weapons training atCamp Lejeuneto prepare for his role as a marine in theJohn Patrick ShanleyplayDefiance(2005). David Rooney described Strong's character as a "a distraught, uneducated soldier from the small-town South". Rooney described his performance as "intense" noting, "while [the] dramaturgical shortcomings hamper the actors...Strong has emotional impact in his single scene."[12]Strong immersed himself in early17th-centuryDutch philosophyto play a youngBaruch SpinozainDavid Ives'sNew Jerusalemin 2008. Also in 2008, Strong was asked tounderstudywith six hours' notice for an actor who had a family emergency; by the next night, he had memorized all the character's lines. He received favorable notice for this performance, and he was able to sign with an agent.[2]
Later in 2008, he made hisBroadwaydebut inA Man for All Seasonsat theAmerican Airlines Theatre.[10]Strong portrayedSir Richard RichoppositeFrank LangellaasSir Thomas More.Ben BrantleyofThe New York Timesdescribed Strong as "talented" actor portraying the "ambitious moral-chameleon".[13]He was chosen as the 2008/2009 Leonore Annenberg Fellow by Lincoln Center Theater and nominated for theLucille Lortel Awardfor Outstanding Lead Actor twice within a three-year period.[14][15]Strong'sDefiancerole helped secure his first film role inHumboldt County.[9]He playedAbraham Lincoln's secretaryJohn George Nicolayacting oppositeDaniel Day-LewisinSteven Spielberg's historical dramaLincoln(2012).
He went on to playCIAanalyst inKathryn Bigelow's historical dramaZero Dark Thirty(2012),Lee Harvey Oswaldin political dramaParkland(2013),James ReebinAva DuVernay's civil rights dramaSelma(2014), and a real estate developer inAaron Sorkin's dramaMolly's Game(2017).[16]Strong was set to play a leading role in a major film for the first time inKathryn Bigelow's period crime dramaDetroit(2017) as a soldier and practiced his marksmanship in preparation, but was fired from the film after the first day of shooting because, according to Bigelow, "the character wasn't working in the story". Strong later persuaded her to give him another part in the film.[2]
Strong's role in the 2015Adam McKayfilmThe Big Shortled McKay to offer him a part in the TV seriesSuccession.[9][17]He initially was interested in playing Roman Roy, the family's wisecracking youngest son, but after the part was given toKieran Culkin, Strong auditioned for the part of the middle son Kendall Roy. The role was a career breakthrough for him gaining prominence. Strong's performance in the role has received universal acclaim from critics, and his performance won him aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Seriesin 2020.[18][2]He also received theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama[19]and aScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Ensemble in a Drama Series.TVLinenamed Strong "Performer of the Year" in 2021 for his work onSuccession, writing, "For three seasons now, Strong has been carefully crafting a portrait of a little boy lost, a man who knows how to play the corporate hero but doesn't know how to be OK with himself....Successionremains one of the best shows on television in large part because Strong's central performance is so complex and so fascinating."[20]
Strong appeared inGuy Ritchie's action comedyThe Gentlemen(2019), a film that he did not want to discuss on the record withThe New Yorker.[2]In 2020 he reunited with Sorkin playing a central role as anti-war activistJerry Rubinpart of theChicago Sevenin theAaron SorkindirectedNetflixdramaThe Trial of the Chicago 7(2020). David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote "Strong gives Jerry a touching puppy-dog innocence and vulnerability".[21]For his performance he was nominated for aScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.[22]The film received critical acclaim as well as nominations for 6Academy Awards.[23][24]In November 2021, it was reported that Strong was to star in and produceThe Best of Us, a TV series about the9/11 first responders.[25]He acted in theJames Graycoming-of-agedramaArmageddon Time(2022) alongsideAnne HathawayandAnthony Hopkins. The film had its world premiere at the2022 Cannes Film Festival.[26]Justin ChangofNPRwrote, "Strong is terrific — and very un-Kendall Roy-like — as Paul's father, a plumber with a big heart and a fierce temper".[27]
In 2024, Strong returned toBroadwayin theAmy Herzogadaptation of theHenrik IbsenplayAn Enemy of the Peopledirected bySam Gold.[28]He won theTony Award for Best Actor in a Play, for his role as Dr. Thomas Stockmann, a principled doctor who attempts to alert the public that their town's spa water is contaminated.[29]He next portrayedRoy Cohn, a ruthless lawyer and mentor toDonald Trump, played bySebastian Stan, in the biographical dramaThe Apprenticewhich premiered at the2024 Cannes Film Festival.[30]Owen GleibermanofVarietydescribed his performance as "magnetic".[31]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporternoted, "It’s to Strong’s credit that, while playing an odious, utterly irredeemable human being, he finds notes of pathos in Cohn’s decline."[32]
Strong will next playJon Landau, manager forBruce Springsteen, in the upcoming biographical filmDeliver Me from Nowherewhich will be based on the book of the same name about the making of Springsteen's 1982 albumNebraska.[33]He will also joinJames Gray's next film.[34]
Like his idolsDaniel Day-LewisandDustin Hoffman, Strong prepares intensely for his roles, often to replicate some aspect of the character whether or not it is prominent in his portrayal. He has stated, "I think you have to go through whatever the ordeal is that the character has to go through". ForThe Judge, where he played the main character's developmentally disabled younger brother, he spent time with an autistic man as Hoffman had forRain Man, and he requested personalized props for the character not mentioned in the script. "All I know is, hecrosses the Rubicon", saidRobert Downey Jr., his costar inThe Judge.[2]ForThe Big Short, Strong followed his real life counterpart Vincent Daniel, and observed his mannerisms, which included constantly chewing gum, something Strong did in all of his scenes.[35]In preparation for hisSuccessionaudition for Kendall Roy, he readMichael Wolff's biography of media mogulRupert Murdochandhis family, which mentions that Murdoch's sonJamesis known for lacing his shoes very tightly; Strong thus did the same for the audition, believing that it expressed the character's "inner tensile strength".[2]
Strong's devotion to his craft occasionally has led to personal injury. In the first season ofSuccession, Kendall had to run a considerable distance to be present at an important corporate board meeting after his limousine gets stuck in traffic. Because Strong wanted to be genuinely sweaty and breathless in every take, he ran as fast and far as he could inTom Forddress shoes and fractured his foot. Two seasons later, he jumped off a 5-foot-high (1.5 m) platform, wearingGuccishoes while filming the episode "Too Much Birthday",[36]impacting his tibia and femur and requiring a leg brace. The take ultimately was not used.
Strong seldom rehearses, saying he wants "every scene to feel like I'm encountering a bear in the woods", an approach he admits may not be popular with his costars. OnThe Trial of the Chicago 7, Strong asked to be sprayed with tear gas. Director Aaron Sorkin stated "I don't like saying no to Jeremy... But there were 200 people in that scene and another seventy on the crew, so I declined to spray them with poison gas".[2]
OnSuccession, Strong intentionally deepened his alienation from the rest of the cast by timing his visits to the makeup trailer so that he is the only one there at the time. His costar Kieran Culkin has described Strong as being in "a bubble" before shoots: "It's hard for me to actually describe his process because I don't really see it".[2]Culkin has stated that Strong's methods are not intrusive to his own process.[37]Matthew Macfadyenhas described Strong's techniques as "not the main event... That's not to say that's wrong. That's just not useful".[38]Brian Cox, who portrays Strong's character's father on the show, has expressed his concerns that Strong's intense approach to acting may lead to early burnout. However, he added that Strong's performance "is always extraordinary and excellent".[39]During the shooting ofThe Big Short, Strong similarly reduced the interactions with his cast mates, although he admitted to having a good time, he also found it to be "distracting" and "depleting," recalling, "These guys can all be in a comedy, but I need to feel like I’m in a global warming catastrophe documentary."[35]
Such techniques are often referred to asmethod acting, but Strong prefers the term "identity diffusion" because he does not draw on his own life experience. "If I have any method at all, it is simply this: to clear away anything—anything—that is not the character and the circumstances of the scene... And usually that means clearing away almost everything around and inside you, so that you can be a more complete vessel for the work at hand". He quoted jazz pianistKeith Jarrettto explain his approach to acting: "I connect every music-making experience I have, including every day here in the studio, with a great power, and if I do not surrender to it nothing happens".[2]
Strong admits the intensity he brings to his work might cause him problems, and he has stated "I don't know if I even believe in balance... I believe in extremity". On the contrary, his wife, a psychiatrist, has stated that "He does a really good job of maintaining what he's doing but also creating a space for the family and a normal life".[2]
Strong tends to pick films based on actual events, such asSelma,Detroit, andThe Trial of the Chicago 7. He has mentioned his preference for such films, saying he "never wanted anything more than to be part of telling stories that feel meaningful, films about social justice in particular."[40]
Along with Day-Lewis, Hoffman, and Pacino, Strong has mentionedIsabelle Huppert,Meryl Streep,Philip Seymour Hoffman,Anthony Hopkins,Ben Kingsley,Laurence Olivier,Robert Duvall,Ian Holm, andKenneth Branaghas his influences.[9][41][42]
In 2016, Strong married Emma Wall, aDanishpsychiatrist; they had met four years earlier at a party in New York duringHurricane Sandy.[2]They have three daughters.[9][43][44][45][46]They reside in New York and have homes inCopenhagen[46][47]andTisvilde.[2]
Strong has receivednumerous accoladesover his career for his roles on stage and screen. For his role asKendall Royin theHBOdrama seriesSuccession(2018–2023) he received aPrimetime Emmy Award, aGolden Globe Award, aCritics' Choice Movie Awardand twoScreen Actors Guild Awards.

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
