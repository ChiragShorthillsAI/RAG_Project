The film tells the story ofSuperman's pet dog Krypto and shelter dogAcewho work with other animals to save captured superheroes fromLex Luthorand Lulu.
During the early days of Warner Animation Group, Stern pitched the film in 2012, after working in an animal shelter, where he noticed how older animals were less likely to be adopted and wondered about the idea of those pets having superpowers. He was hired to write and direct a film about DC'sLegion of Super-Petsin July 2018. Levine and Patricia Hicks joined the project in January 2019 as co-director and producer, respectively. Johnson was signed on to voice Krypto in May 2021, while other main cast members were confirmed to join the voice roles by June 2021, including Hart, McKinnon, Krasinski, Bayer, Lyonne, Luna, Maron, and Reeves. The inspiration for the film's animation style came fromArt Decoarchitecture and illustratorJ.C. Leyendecker. The animation was provided byAnimal Logic.
DC League of Super-Petshad its premiere in Los Angeles on July 13, 2022, and was released in the United States on July 29. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $207 million worldwide on a $90 million budget.DC League of Super-Petsis the last film to be produced and released under the Warner Animation Group name before the animation studio label became Warner Bros.

Supermangrows up with aKryptonianLabrador RetrievernamedKrypto, who goes by the name Bark Kent in everyday life. Krypto feels jealous when Superman starts datingLois Lane, so Superman goes to ananimal shelterto find Krypto a friend. ABoxernamedAcetries to escape the shelter, but Krypto stops him. Later, Superman and Krypto spot their archenemy,LexCorpCEOLex Luthor, reeling in a meteor strapped with orangekryptonitewith a tractor beam, intending to gain superpowers. He is easily defeated as the two are aided by theJustice League, formed by Superman himself,Batman,Wonder Woman,The Flash,Green Lantern,Cyborg, andAquaman.
Meanwhile, Lulu, aguinea pigtest subject from LexCorp sent to the shelter, reels in a piece of orange kryptonite with her own tractor beam, which gives hertelekinesis. Unbeknownst to her, everyone else in the shelter also gains superpowers. Ace is now super-strong and nigh-invulnerable; PB, apotbellied pig, can change size; Merton, a nearsightedturtle, becomes super-fast; and Chip, a paranoidsquirrel, gainselectrokinesis. While at home, Superman and Krypto have an argument when the former plans to propose marriage to Lois. However, Clark is captured by Lulu. Krypto tries to save him, but loses his powers when he was eating some tiny shard of a green kryptonite was hidden inside a piece ofJarlsberg cheese. Later, Krypto comes across the shelter pets, who agree to help him.
Meanwhile, Lulu recruits a group of guinea pigs, captures the Justice League, and heads to Stryker's Island to free Luthor. The shelter pets try to stop her, but fail miserably; in the process, Lulu taunts Krypto about Clark's engagement plans and even shows him the engagement ring. They regroup in theHall of Justice, where Ace tells a distraught Krypto he used to be the puppy of a family with a toddler. One day, the toddler nearly fell down the stairs when Ace bit her arm and pulled her to safety. Upon seeing the bite-marks, the parents assumed Ace attacked her and sent him to the shelter as the wild animal. However, Ace stands by his actions and ideals. Encouraged, Krypto leads the pets to LexCorp. While there, akittennamed Whiskers, (who Lulu rescued from the shelter last night) and can now create weapons at will, attack them, but the team traps her. At Stryker's Island, the shelter pets confront Lulu, but put themselves in prison cells when she threatens to kill Krypto. Lulu frees Luthor, who betrays her and locks her in his cell while freeingMercy Graves. Lulu breaks out easily and decides to destroy the Justice League and Luthor herself.
The Kryptonite passes through Krypto's system, restoring his powers. He breaks himself and the other super pets out of prison, and attempts to free the Justice League, but Lulu launches them into space, along with Luthor. In order to stall Krypto, she attempts to kill Lois. However, the other super pets rescue the Justice League while Krypto saves Lois and defeats Lulu, but she absorbs the orange kryptonite, becoming a mutatedkaiju-sized version of herself. The League and the pets team up to stop her. Realizing she has become too powerful, Krypto decides to use the "Solar Paw Punch", a move that can defeat any supervillain, but will likely kill the user. The attack causes a massive explosion that removes the kryptonite from Lulu's brain and, shortly thereafter, she is returned to normal and falls back to earth, where her redeemed henchmen, Mark and Keith, trap her in a hot dog stand. Krypto accepts his fate, but Ace uses his invulnerability to save him.
In the aftermath, Krypto allows Clark to marry Lois. The shelter pets, Mark, and Keith get adopted by the rest of the Justice League: Ace by Batman, PB by Wonder Woman, Merton by The Flash, Chip by Green Lantern, Mark by Cyborg and Keith by Aquaman. Sometime later, the pets have formed their own superhero team called the "League of Super-Pets".
In amid-credits scene, Luthor is still trapped in his prison asking any passing super-animals to free him, without success. Meanwhile, Lulu is freed by Mercy, who adopts her. In apost-credits scene, Krypto and Superman encounterBlack Adamand his dog, Anubis. Krypto tricks them into flying toPluto.
In July 2018,Jared Sternwas hired to write and direct an animated film aboutDC'sLegion of Super-Pets.[24]In January 2019, it was announced that Sam J. Levine would serve as co-director with Stern, and that Patricia Hicks had signed on as producer.[25]The film was pitched by Stern in 2012, during the early days of theWarner Animation Group.[26]
In May 2021, it was announced thatDwayne Johnson[10]would star as the voice ofKrypto the Superdog. In addition to starring in the film, he, alongsideDany Garcia, Hiram Garcia, and Stern would be joining Hicks as producers; whileJohn Requa,Glenn Ficarra, andNicholas Stollerwere set to executive produce.[27]
In June 2021, additional cast members were announced, withKevin Hartstarring as the voice ofAce the Bat-Houndin the film. Additionally,Kate McKinnon,John Krasinski,Vanessa Bayer,Natasha Lyonne,Diego Luna, andKeanu Reeveswere cast in undisclosed roles. The following week,Jameela Jamiljoined the film.[10][28]By September 2021,Marc Maronhad joined the cast as the voice ofLex Luthor.[11]By November of the same year, additional roles were revealed to be: Chip,Green Lantern's squirrel (Luna); Merton,The Flash's turtle (Lyonne); PB,Wonder Woman's pig (Bayer),Superman(Krasinski) and newer additions,Thomas MiddleditchandBen Schwartz.[6][7]In March 2022, Reeves was revealed to be voicingBatman.[12]The following month, it was revealed thatDascha Polancowould be voicingJessica Cruz / Green Lantern.[20]Three weeks before the film's release, the remainder of the cast for the Justice League andLois Lanewere announced in July 2022 through posters.[29]
Stern developed a pitch for the film after working in an animal shelter, where he noticed how older animals were less likely to be adopted and wondered "what if those pets got superpowers?".[30]Stern was originally unsure what DC characters he was allowed to incorporate in the film, though he added Luthor after the character was suggested by DC. This led to the concept of the villain, Lulu, being a guinea pig, as Stern felt "guinea pigs are someone who would have a chip on their shoulder" due to them being used as test subjects, and Lulu being Lex's test subject served as a parallel with Krypto and Superman's relationship.[26]
According to Stern, DC executives suggested adding satirical jokes regarding their properties, which Stern felt allowed the film to make fun of the characters while portraying them respectfully.[26]Stern said the humor regarding DC characters was meant to be rooted in the film's focus on pets, such as portraying Superman as a dog owner or Batman as "a guy who really could use a pet".[26]Early drafts for the movie had Ace in a more prominent role, but his role was changed to co-lead once the filmmakers concluded the focus for the film should be on Krypto's relationship with Superman.[26]
The animation was provided byAnimal LogicinSydneyandVancouver, which also provided animation for theWarner Animation Group'sThe Lego Movieseries.[31]Approximately 70 animators worked on the film. Animators worked on the film for 2 years, as well as an extra 3–4 months after the film's release date was delayed by a year.[30]
The film's art style was inspired byArt Decoarchitecture and illustratorJ.C. Leyendecker, as well as the Art Deco style from the originalSupermancomics.[32][30]Stern wanted the characters and environments to have both visible brushstrokes and "chunky heroic shapes".[30]Character designers Mayumi Nose and Matt Williamês drew inspiration from theSuper Friendsanimated series and Superman comics from theSilver Age of Comic Booksfor the designs of the characters, while still having a comedic edge to them.[30]
The artists aimed for the film's visuals to reflect the optimistic tone from theSupermancomic books, while also being relatable and cartoonish.[32]In order to accomplish this, they had the visuals to be mainly vertical and have a "painted feel".[32]The artists were influenced by theSupermancomics from theGolden Age of Comic Books, particularly in those comics' painting style.[32]
The film's original score was composed bySteve Jablonsky.[33]The film's score album was released on July 29, 2022, byWaterTower Music.[34]TheTaylor Swiftsongs "Message in a Bottle (Taylor's Version)" and a re-recording of the song "Bad Blood", "Bad Blood (Taylor's Version)", are also featured in the film;[35][36]along with other songs on the soundtrack,Queen’s “You’re My Best Friend”,Sturgill Simpson’s “Sing Along”,R.E.M.'s cover of "Superman",A Tribe Called Quest's “Electric Relaxation”,The Pharcyde’s "Passin' Me By", Bill Beach's "Tudo É Relativo",Europe’s “The Final Countdown”,Percy Faith & His Orchestra’s “Theme fromA Summer Place”,Burt Bacharach’s "What the World Needs Now Is Love",The Chemical Brothers’ “Block Rockin’ Beats” andCanned Heat’s “Let's Work Together.”[37][38]
Also included is the original ballad "Count On Me", written and produced by Jeremy Silver and performed by Jac Ross.[39][40]The song plays during an emotional flashback montage sequence where Ace used to have an idyllic home life with a family.
The soundtrack intermittently features themes of other superhero films fromJohn Williams' "Theme from Superman (Main Title)",Danny Elfman’s “Batman Theme (Main Title)” toCharles FoxandNorman Gimbel’s “Wonder Woman Theme” from thepopular 1970s television seriesand one other cinematic soundtrack song,Charles Bernstein's "Jump Rope" fromA Nightmare on Elm Street, as sung by Whiskers as she hunts down the Super-Pets in a dead-end street.[41][38]
On May 24, 2022,Warner Bros. Consumer ProductsandDC Comicsannounced the release of merchandise inspired by the film in collaboration withFisher-Price. The products include apparel, pet accessories, toys, collectibles, costumes and furniture.McDonald'salso announced that their Happy Meals would have toys based on the film.[42]
In January 2019, the film was scheduled to be released on May 21, 2021.[25]The release date was later pushed back to May 20, 2022, in favour ofThe Matrix Resurrections, another WB film starring Reeves.[43]It was then pushed back to July 29, 2022 (taking the release ofBlack Adam, which also stars Johnson), among other films from Warner Bros. getting pushed due to production delays.[44][45]DC League of Super-Petspremiered in Los Angeles on July 13, 2022.[46]This was the final production under the name Warner Animation Group before the studio's rebranding in June 2023.[47]

It gets the fun done for family audiences."[60]Clarisse Loughrey ofThe Independentcriticized its "limited imagination", adding: "The film is desperately craving an angle—one that certainly can't be fulfilled by the fact all the pet ownership jokes have already been used up by theSecret Life of Petsseries."[61]

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]
Warner Bros. owns some shared universes. Some of them are based on books and comics, including some of the highest grossing IP's in the movie industry.

DC Studiosis an American film and television production company that is a division ofWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD). It is responsible for the production of live-action and animated films and television series, as well as video games, based on characters from theAmerican comic bookpublisherDC Comics, primarily as part of its flagshipmedia franchiseandshared universe, theDC Universe(DCU). The studio has been led by writer/directorJames Gunnand producerPeter Safranas its co-chairmen and co-CEOs since it was formed in November 2022.
The studio's predecessor,DC Films, was formed in May 2016 as a division ofWarner Bros. Picturesto oversee DC-based film productions, primarily those from its shared universe franchise theDC Extended Universe(DCEU). It was led by DC comic book and television writerGeoff Johnsand Warner Bros. producer Jon Berg as co-chairmen. After several DCEU films received poor reception and underperformed financially, the duo stepped down by the end of 2017, and the division was reorganized, withWalter Hamadahired as the studio's president. Following the merger of DC and Warner Bros. ownerWarnerMediawithDiscovery, Inc.in April 2022, WBD overhauled operations, resulting in Hamada stepping down in October 2022. DC Films was then dissolved in favor of DC Studios, a new division with greater oversight of DC media. Gunn and Safran, who had worked on some DCEU projects, were hired to lead the studio, and the duo began work on the DCU as a new franchise to serve as asoft rebootof the DCEU.
From 2016 to 2023, DC Films produced 13 films within the DCEU, fromSuicide Squad(2016) toAquaman and the Lost Kingdom(2023), alongside two standalone films,Joker(2019) andThe Batman(2022).Jokerand the studio's filmAquaman(2018) are among the50 highest-grossing filmsof all time, withJokerbecoming the firstR-rated filmto gross over $1 billion. The first DC Studios production is the television seriesThe Penguin(2024), a spin-off fromThe Batman. DC Studios plans to release films and television series within the DCU, starting with the animated seriesCreature Commandosin 2024, and the filmSupermanin 2025. Productions that are not part of the DCU are set to be part of the "DC Elseworlds" label. The studio's first animated film will beDynamic Duo(2028).
After the divisive reception toBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016),Warner Bros. Picturessought to stabilize the direction of its media franchise andshared universe, theDC Extended Universe(DCEU). In May 2016, the studio reorganized to have genre-responsible film executives, thusDC Entertainmentfilms under Warner Bros. Pictures were placed under a new division, DC Films, to be led by Warner Bros.executive vice president, Jon Berg, and thechief creative officerofDC Comics,Geoff Johns. This was done in hopes of competing more directly withMarvel Studios' franchise, theMarvel Cinematic Universe. Johns kept his role at DC Comics, and reported to DC Entertainment's president,Diane Nelson, while Berg reported to Warner Bros. Pictures' president, Greg Silverman.[3]The division's formation was not designed to override the "director-driven" mandate.[8]
Justice League(2017) had one of the biggest film budgets (nearly $300 million) but grossed about $96 million in its opening weekend. An analysis inThe Washington Postexpected that there would be a course correction again, with a possible change in leadership.[9]Forbescontributors felt that the course correction would be for DC Films to give up on the shared universe, while continuing with theWonder Womanfilms and occasionally other films, as Warner Bros. had other franchises they could work with.[10]Despite this, in December, the studio reiterated their planned film slate for the DCEU.[11]That same month, Warner Bros. announced that a new strategy and organization of DC Films would occur, with Berg leaving his position as the studio's co-president of production to form a Warner Bros.–based production company withRoy Lee.[12][13]Johns was expected to remain involved in future DC films moving forward in an advisory role while continuing as the president and chief creative officer of DC Entertainment, with Warner Bros. expected to hire a new studio head.[12]In January 2018, Warner Bros. executiveWalter Hamadawas appointed as the new president of DC Films, to oversee the films in the DCEU. Hamada was closely associated withNew Line Cinema, and helped develop horror films, such asIt(2017) andThe Conjuringfilm franchise.[14]Johns subsequently left his role at DC Entertainment that June and he was no longer involved with the DCEU.[7]
In April 2022, after the merger between Warner Bros.' parent companyWarnerMediaandDiscovery, Inc.to formWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the new CEODavid Zaslavwas exploring a restructuring of DC Entertainment, including having a creative leader akin to Marvel Studios presidentKevin Feigeto lead its film and television projects.[15]Later in July,Toby Emmerichstepped down as the head of the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group. The group was restructured to give DC Films, Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, andWarner Animation Grouprespective leadership. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De LucaandPamela Abdybecame the co-executives of Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. They were also temporarily signed to oversee the remaining units of the group until the new positions were filled.[16][17]
When the release of the filmBatgirlwas canceled by WBD in August, Hamada was not consulted regarding the decision and only learned about it when De Luca and Abdy informed him at a test screening forBlack Adam(2022). Hamada was upset and considered resigning, but agreed to stay untilBlack Adam'srelease.[18]Later that month,Dan Linentered talks to oversee DC's film and television divisions.

Gunn oversees the creative development of DC projects, while Safran supervises the production side. Their roles officially began on November 1, 2022.[1][25][2][26]
In November, Gunn said that the studio would focus on multiple DCU live-action and animated projects, but also stated that they would acknowledge fan responses and complaints,[27]and confirmed all subsequent DC projects would be released under the DC Studios banner, including those that were filmed before the formation of the studio.[28]In December, Gunn announced that he was writing a new Superman film that would feature a younger actor in the role.Henry Cavillwas not set to return asSuperman, whileBen Affleck, who portrayedBruce Wayne / Batmanin the DCEU, was reported to be in talks to direct a new DC Studios project, before Affleck stated that he was not interested in directing a DC film.[29][30]Gunn later revealed that new DC films would have an equal focus on popular and obscure characters, drawing inspiration from the DC animated seriesJustice League Unlimited(2004–2006) andYoung Justice(2010–2022).[31][32]

A slightly different DC Studios logo animation is used for the end credits onThe Penguin, while a separate logo and opening animation are set to be used for future projects released under the "DC Elseworlds" banner.[45]

Pictures co-chiefs De Luca and Abdy, without the involvement of Gunn, Safran, or DC Studios, although the DC logo used before that studio's formation is included in the credits. At the time of the film's release later that month, Gunn said that "[a]ll future films with DC characters [would] be DC Studios" productions moving forward,[49]and he later clarified that the studio would release every subsequent film and television adaptation from DC.[45][50]Ahead of the premiere of the DCU seriesCreature Commandosin December 2024, DC Studios announced the unscripted biweekly video podcast seriesDC Studios Showcase: The Official Podcast, produced byOBB Soundfor the streaming serviceMax.[51]Later that month, they also announced the launch of its DC Studios Fan First newsletter via DC's website, to provide updates on the company's projects, with an introduction message written by Gunn.[52]In February 2025, DC Studios announced that it had greenlit three "younger-skewed" animated series—Starfire!,My Adventures with Green Lantern, andDC Super Powers—which were being co-produced with Warner Bros.

Lyonne has joked that her family consists of "my father's side,Flatbush, and my mother's side,Auschwitz".[2]Her grandmother, Ella,[15]came from a large family, but only she and her two sisters and two brothers survived, which Lyonne has attributed to their blond hair and blue eyes.[2]Lyonne's grandfather, Morris Buchinger, operated a watch company in Los Angeles. During the war, he hid in Budapest as a non-Jew working in a leather factory.[2]Lyonne lived the first eight years of her life inGreat Neck, New York.[10][16]She and her family emigrated to Israel, where she spent a year and a half.

Of her time working as a child actor, Lyonne later said, "I had to become coherent and a businesswoman at six. By 10, I was a jaded professional … I don't think [my parents] knew better.

After playing a string of people's daughters [in other films], Lyonne really comes into her own here as an actress, registering as a person and not merely someone's little girl".[27]
In 1999, Lyonne starred as Megan Bloomfield, a sexually confused teenager, in the satirical romantic comedyBut I'm a Cheerleader. Despite a mixed critical reception upon release,[28]the film was instrumental in raising awareness of the harms ofconversion therapy,[29]and has since developed acult following.[30]In the same year, Lyonne played the small but crucial part of Jessica—a role she reprised in two of the film'ssequels—inAmerican Pie(1999),[31]which grossed over US$230 million at the box office.[32]Other film appearances in 1999 included Christine inDetroit Rock Cityand a headline role inFreeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby.

Club, "The actor has experienced a remarkable resurgence in the past few years … Here, she channels her storied past to play Lou... drug-addled... plays to Lyonne's strengths—a bluntly outsized personality, brash but likable, with a self-destructive streak bigger than the podunk town in which the story unfolds".[46]Other film credits of hers includeSleeping with Other People,Hello, My Name Is Doris,Addicted to Fresno,Hashtag Horror(all 2015);Yoga Hosers,The Intervention(both 2016);Handsome(2017),Show Dogs(2018),Honey Boy(2019), andJames Gray's science fiction thrillerAd Astra(2019).

After battles with addiction and other health scares [in] the early-2000s, [Lyonne] has managed to revive her career … a personal narrative arc that clearly informs Nadia's constant brushes with her own mortality … Lyonne is such an idiosyncratic screen presence — not to mention so distinctly New York/Jewish/aggro — that most of the roles she's played, particularly as an adult, have barely bothered to delve beneath the surface of that persona … Nadia, on the other hand, is unmistakably Lyonne … It goes deeper and wider than anything she's gotten to play [since] her teenage days in indie films likeSlums of Beverly HillsandBut I'm a Cheerleader.[49]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
