The film starsColin Firth,Kelly Macdonald,Matthew Macfadyen,Penelope Wilton,Johnny FlynnandJason Isaacs. This wasPaul Ritter's final film appearance, and was dedicated to his memory.
Operation Mincemeathad its world premiere at the 2021 British Film Festival in Australia, and was released in the United Kingdom on 15 April 2022 byWarner Bros. Pictures. It was released onNetflixin North American and South American countries on 11 May 2022. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $15.7 million worldwide against a $6.3 million budget.
In 1943, theUnited Kingdomis entrenched inWorld War II. Lieutenant CommanderEwen Montagu, aJewishbarrister, remains in England while his wife Iris and their children travel to safety in theUnited States. Montagu takes a break from practising law when he is appointed to theTwenty Committee. His secretary, Hester Leggett, comes with him.
Prime MinisterWinston Churchillhas promised the US that theAllieswill invadeSicilyby July of that year to push further north. Sicily is considered an obvious target and may be defended by theWehrmacht. AdmiralJohn Godfreythinks that Britain must trickNazi Germanyinto believing the Allies will invadeGreece.Charles Cholmondeleyproposes an operation from theTrout Memo, which would entail a corpse carrying false secrets washing ashore. Despite Godfrey's doubts, he gives Montagu and Cholmondeley permission to plan the operation with Lieutenant CommanderIan Fleming.
Montagu and Cholmondeley obtain the body of avagrantnamedGlyndwr Michael, who died by possiblesuicidal poisoning. He is given the false identity of Major William Martin,Royal Marines, with a detailed backstory and ID photos. A widowed secretary in the office, Jean Leslie, offers a photo of herself to serve as Martin's fake fiancée, "Pam". The team fabricate items for Martin to carry in his pockets, including theatre tickets, personal bills and a love letter from "Pam" written by Hester. Cholmondeley has a crush on Jean, but soon realises that Montagu and Jean share romantic feelings. This causes Cholmondeley to grow jealous and occasionally lash out at Montagu. Complications ensue when Michael's sister arrives to claim his body, but she is turned away by Montagu and Cholmondeley.
Godfrey suspects that Montagu's brother,Ivor, is a spy for theUSSR. He bribes Cholmondeley to spy on Montagu and, in return, Godfrey will locate and return the remains of Cholmondeley's brother, who was killed in action inChittagong,Bengal. Cholmondeley reluctantly agrees.
SpecialistMI5driverSt John "Jock" Horsfalltransports Montagu, Cholmondeley and the corpse to the submarine base atHoly Loch. The corpse is then loaded onto the submarineHMSSeraph. On 30 April,Serapharrives in theGulf of Cádizand drops the corpse into the ocean. It is found by fishermen inHuelva,Spain. Operation Mincemeat staff attempt to get the fake documents toMadrid. The mission is hampered by bad luck, as the Spanish have resisted Nazi influence more than expected. Captain David Ainsworth, the Britishnaval attachéin Madrid, meets with Colonel Cerruti of the Spanish secret police in one last attempt to get the papers to the Germans. When Martin's personal items are returned to London, a specialist works out that the documents have been tampered with. This gives Operation Mincemeat staff hope that Germany retrieved the false information.
Jean is threatened by Teddy, a waiter at a club the team has frequented, claiming to be a spy for ananti-Hitler plotwithin Germany. She tells him that Major Martin was travelling under an alias but the classified information was genuine. After Teddy leaves, Jean informs Montagu and Cholmondeley. They come to believe that ColonelAlexis von Roenne, who controls intelligence in theGerman Army High Command, sent Teddy to verify information so Roenne could undermine Hitler but they have no way of being sure. Montagu takes Jean to his home for protection, but she accepts a job inSpecial Operationsand soon leaves London.
On 10 July, theAllied invasion of Sicilybegins. News arrives that the Allies suffered limited casualties, the enemy is retreating, and the beaches have been held. Afterwards, Cholmondeley admits he received his brother's remains in return for spying on Montagu. Feeling sympathetic and relieved that Operation Mincemeat was a success, Montagu offers to buy Cholmondeley a drink even though it is eight in the morning. The epilogue says that Montagu reunited with Iris after the war, Jean married a soldier, Hester continued as Director of the Admiralty Secretarial Unit and Cholmondeley remained with MI5 until 1952, later married and travelled widely. Major William Martin's identity was revealed to be Glyndwr Michael in 1997 when an epitaph, with his real name, was added to Martin's headstone in Spain.
In addition, other notable historical figures are briefly included in the film, withAlexander BeyerasKarl Kuhlenthal, Nico Birnbaum as ColonelAlexis von Roenneand  Pep Tosar asAdmiral Moreno.

Internationalacquired the distribution rights to the film in the UK, Republic of Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Benelux.[10]The film had its world premiere at the 2021 British Film Festival in Australia,[11]and was released in cinemas on 15 April 2022.[12]Netflixpurchased the rights to the film in North and Latin America, and it was released on the streaming service in those territories on 11 May 2022.[10]

On the review aggregator websiteRotten Tomatoes, 83% of 113 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "If its fact-based story proves more fascinatingly outlandish than it's presented here,Operation Mincemeatremains an engaging and well-acted wartime drama."[14]Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[15]
Christy Lemire, writing for RogerEbert.com, assigned the film a 3 out of 4 stars, stating that "The story itself is so absurd and is told with enough surprises and dry humor that it’s constantly engaging."[16]Stefan Pape ofCommon Sense Media, giving it 4 out of 5 stars, praises director John Madden and says "This drama — based on real events — is such a brilliantly cinematic story, it almost feels as if it would have been impossible to get wrong. That said, Operation Mincemeat still required an accomplished, deft hand to bring it to life, and do it the justice it deserves. Thankfully director John Madden more than delivers."[17]
The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave it a mixed review of 3 out of 5 stars, praising the performances but criticising it as "another of the 'home front wartime' Britfilms". He goes on to call the film "watchable enough, but [it] perhaps can’t find a fictional way into the stranger-than-fiction outrageousness of the scheme itself."[18]

He has also campaigned on issues of asylum seekers, refugees' rights and the environment. He commissioned and co-authored a scientific paper on a study of the differences in brain structure between people of differing political orientations.[7]
Firth was born in the village ofGrayshott, Hampshire,[8]to parents who were academics and teachers. His mother, Shirley Jean (néeRolles), was acomparative religionlecturer at King Alfred's College (now theUniversity of Winchester); and his father, David Norman Lewis Firth, was a history lecturer at King Alfred's and education officer for theNigerian government.[9][10][11]Firth is the eldest of three children; his sisterKateis an actress and voice coach, and his brotherJonathanis also an actor.[12]His maternal grandparents wereCongregationalistministers and his paternal grandfather was anAnglicanpriest. They did overseasmissionarywork, and both of his parents were born and spent part of their childhoods inIndia.[13][14][15]
As a child, Firth frequently travelled due to his parents' work, spending some years inNigeria.[16]He also lived inSt. Louis,Missouri, when he was 11, which he has described as "a difficult time".[17]On returning to England, he attended the Montgomery of Alamein Secondary School (nowKings' School, Winchester), which at the time was a statecomprehensive schoolinWinchester, Hampshire. He was still an outsider and the target ofbullying. To counter this, he adopted the local working-class Hampshire accent and copied his schoolmates' lack of interest in schoolwork.[18]
Firth began attending drama workshops at age 10, and by 14 had decided to be a professional actor. Untilfurther education, he was not academically inclined, later saying in an interview, "I didn't like school. I just thought it was boring and mediocre and nothing they taught me seemed to be of any interest at all."[17]However, atBarton Peveril Sixth Form CollegeinEastleigh, he was imbued with a love ofEnglish literatureby an enthusiastic teacher, Penny Edwards, and has said that his two years there were among the happiest of his life.[19]
After hissixth formyears, Firth moved to London and joined theNational Youth Theatre, where he made many contacts and got a job in thewardrobe departmentat theNational Theatre.[18]He subsequently studied atDrama Centre London.[20]
Firth playedHamletin the Drama Centre end-of-year production, and in 1984, Firth made his film debut as Tommy Judd, Guy Bennett'sstraight,Marxistschool friend in thescreen adaptation of the play Another Country(withRupert Everettas Guy Bennett).[21][22]It was the start of a longstanding public feud between Firth and Everett, which was eventually resolved.[23]He starred with SirLaurence OlivierinLost Empires(1986), a TV adaptation ofJ. B. Priestley's novel.[24]
In 1987, Firth and other up-and-coming British actors such asTim Roth,Bruce PayneandPaul McGannwere dubbed the 'Brit Pack'.[25]That year, he appeared withKenneth Branaghin the film version ofJ. L. Carr'sA Month in the Country.[26]Sheila Johnston observed a theme in his early work of playing those traumatised by war.[27]He portrayed real-life British soldierRobert LawrenceMCin the 1988 BBC dramatisationTumbledown. Lawrence was severely injured at theBattle of Mount Tumbledownduring theFalklands War, and the film details his struggles to adjust to his disability whilst confronted with indifference from the government and public. It attracted controversy at the time, with criticism coming from left and right sides of the political spectrum.[27]Despite this, the performance brought Firth a Royal TV Society Best Actor Award, and a nomination for the 1989BAFTATelevision Award.[28]In 1989, he played the title role inMiloš Forman'sValmont, based onLes Liaisons dangereuses.[29]Released just a year afterDangerous Liaisons, it did not make a big impact in comparison. That year he also played a paranoid, socially awkward character in theArgentinianpsychological thrillerApartment Zero.[30]
Firth finally became a British household name through his role as the aloof, haughty aristocratMr. Darcyin the 1995BBCtelevision adaptation ofJane Austen'sPride and Prejudice. Producer Sue Birtwistle's first choice for the part, he was eventually persuaded to take it despite his unfamiliarity with Austen's writing.[31]He and co-starJennifer Ehlebegan a romantic relationship during the filming, which received media attention only after their separation.[32]Sheila Johnston wrote that Firth's approach to the part "lent Darcy complex shades of coldness, even caddishness, in the early episodes".[27]The series was an international success and unexpectedly elevated Firth to stardom[32]—in some part due to a scene not from the novel, where he emerges from a lake swim in a wet shirt.[33]Although he did not mind being recognised as "a romantic idol as a Darcy with smouldering sex appeal"[34]in a role that "officially turned him into a heart-throb",[35]he expressed the wish not to be associated withPride and Prejudiceforever.[36]He was, therefore, reluctant to accept similar roles and risk becomingtypecast.[18]
For a time, it did seem as if Mr. Darcy would overshadow the rest of Firth's career, and there were humorous allusions to the role in his next five movies.[37]The most notable was his casting as the love interestMark Darcyin thefilm adaptationofBridget Jones's Diary, itself a modern-day retelling ofPride and Prejudice. Firth accepted the part as he saw it as an opportunity to lampoon his Mr. Darcy character.[38]The film was very successful[39]and critically well-liked.[40]A2004 sequelwas mostly panned by critics[41]but still financially successful.
Prior to this, Firth had a significant supporting role inThe English Patient(1996) as the husband ofKristin Scott Thomas's character, whose jealousy of her adultery leads to tragedy. That year he also played the husband of the character of Kristin's sister,Serena Scott Thomas, in the television miniseriesNostromo. Of the two he said "Serena was a much more faithful wife."
He next played the lead role as a school teacher and obsessedArsenal F.C.footballfan in the romantic fictional adaptationFever Pitch(1997) ofNick Hornby’s million-selling autobiographical essayFever Pitch: A Fan's Life.
He had parts in lightromanticperiod piecessuch asShakespeare in Love(1998),Relative Values(2000) andThe Importance of Being Earnest(2002).  He appeared in several television productions, includingDonovan Quick(an updated version ofDon Quixote) (1999),[42]and had a more serious role as Dr.Wilhelm StuckartinConspiracy(2001), concerning the NaziWannsee Conference, for which he was nominated for aPrimetime Emmy Award.[43]
Firth featured in the ensemble all-star cast ofRichard Curtis'sLove Actually(2003), another financial success[44]which divided critics.[45][46]He was also given solo billing as the romantic lead inHope Springs, but it received very poor reviews[47][48]and made little box-office impact.[49]He starred asAmanda Bynes' character's father in the 2003 teen comedyWhat A Girl Wants, which was based on the playThe Reluctant Debutante.[50]He played painterJohannes VermeeroppositeScarlett Johanssonin the 2003 releaseGirl with a Pearl Earring; some critics praised the film's subtlety[51]and sumptuous visuals,[52]whilst others found it almost restrained, tedious and bereft of emotion.[53]Nevertheless, it received mostly favourable reviews, was moderately successful[54]and earned several awards and nominations.
In 2005 Firth appeared inNanny McPheewithEmma Thompson, in which he plays a struggling widowed father, it was a rare venture for him into thefantasygenre.[55]He also appeared inWhere the Truth Lies, a return to some of his darker, more intense early roles, that included a notorious scene featuring abisexualorgy.[56]Sheila Johnston wrote that it "confounded his fans", but nonetheless that his character "draws knowingly on that suave, cultivated persona",[57]which could be traced from Mr. Darcy. Other films from this time includedThen She Found Me(2007) withHelen HuntandThe Last Legion(2007) withAishwarya Rai.
In 2008, he played the adultBlake Morrisonreminiscing on his difficult relationship with his ailing father in the film adaptation of Morrison's memoir,And When Did You Last See Your Father?It received generally favorable reviews.[58][59]Peter BradshawofThe Guardiangave it four out of five stars.[60]Manohla DargisinThe New York Timessaid: "It's a pleasure to watch Mr. Firth–a supremely controlled actor who makes each developing fissure visible–show the adult Blake coming to terms with his contradictory feelings, letting the love and the hurt pour out of him."[61]Philip FrenchofThe Observerwrote that Firth "[does] quiet agonising to perfection."[62]However, Derek Elley ofVarietycalled the film "an unashamed tearjerker that's all wrapping and no center."  While he conceded that it was "undeniably effective at a gut level despite its dramatic shortcomings", he added, "Things aren't helped any by Firth's dour perf, as his Blake comes across as a self-centered whiner, a latter-day Me Generation figure who's obsessed with finding problems when there really aren't any."[63]
The film adaptation ofMamma Mia!(2008) was Firth's first foray intomusicals. He described the experience as "a bit nerve-wracking"[64]but believed he got off lightly by being tasked with one of the less demanding songs,Our Last Summer.[65]Mamma Miabecame the highest grossing British-made film of all time,[66]taking in over $600 million worldwide.[67]LikeLove Actually, it polarised critics, with supporters such asEmpirecalling it "cute, clean, camp fun, full of sunshine, and toe tappers",[68]whereas Peter Bradshaw inThe Guardiansaid the film gave him a "need to vomit".[69]Carrie Rickey inThe Philadelphia Inquirerdescribed Firth's performance as "the embodiment of forced mirth."[70]That year, Firth also starred inEasy Virtue, which screened at the Rome Film Festival to excellent reviews.[71]He starred inGenova, which premiered at the2008 Toronto International Film Festival.[72]In 2009 he appeared inA Christmas Carol, an adaptation ofCharles Dickens' novel, using theperformance captureprocedure, playing Scrooge's optimistic nephew Fred.[73]
At the66th Venice International Film Festivalin 2009, Firth received theVolpi Cupfor Best Actor for his role inTom Ford's directorial debutA Single Man,as a college professor grappling with solitude after the death of his longtime partner. His performance earned him career-best reviews and Academy Award, Golden Globe, Screen Actors' Guild, BAFTA, and BFCA nominations; he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in February 2010.[74]
Firth starred in the 2010 filmThe King's SpeechasPrince Albert, Duke of York/King George VI, detailing his efforts to overcome his speech impediment while becoming monarch of the United Kingdom at the end of 1936.

If you were ever, say, on a Jewish holiday, identifiably Jewish, there was lots of violence around. But particularly when I was 16, in 1979, the National Front were really taking hold, there were leaflets at school, andSieg Heilingand peoplegoose-steppingdown the road and coming after us."[7]Following in the footsteps of his three brothers (one who became a doctor, one a lawyer, and one an accountant),[6]he studied law atBristol Universityfrom 1982 to 1985, becoming involved in the university's theatre club there; he eventually acted in over 30 plays and performed each summer at theEdinburgh Festival Fringe, first with Bristol University and then twice with the National Student Theatre Company.
