In the 1870s, several years after the end of theCivil War, veteran Jeb McAllister and his wife Hattie struggle to raise their adolescent son Will and infant daughter in the wilds ofMontana.[6]Hattie is disillusioned with the drudgery of frontier life and wants to move back east to her parents' land, while Jeb wants to be self-reliant and capable of raising their family on their own. After Jeb leaves to go to town to find work so they can raise money for traveling, four strangers arrive and ask Hattie for some food and water. A short time later she finds humanscalpstied to their saddles, so she draws a shotgun on the men and kicks them out of her home.
However, the outlaws, led by "The Captain", do not go far. Instead, a stand-off begins after the men repeatedly attempt to break into the McAllister cabin but are foiled by Hattie and Will, with one outlaw being killed. As night falls, Hattie realizes that the reason the outlaws are unwilling to leave is that they are looking for Jeb (who is still in town) and want to use her and their children as bait. Jeb, meanwhile, after failing to find any work and spending the evening drinking in a saloon, notices wanted posters of the men and recognizes them from his past during the war. Jeb rushes back to the cabin and finds it on fire. He helps his family slip away and they attempt to hide in the wilderness.
Will manages to hide with his baby sister, but Hattie is captured by the outlaws. Jeb tries to save her but he is also captured and the pair are taken back to their burned out cabin. The Captain turns out to be Jeb's former commander in the Confederate Army. He wants Jeb to pay for accidentally killing his only daughter after betraying him and his family to Union soldiers during the war. Jeb and Hattie are dragged out to face alynching. However, Hattie tricks the Captain into leaving her alone with one of his men; when he tries to rape her she draws a hidden knife and kills him. Arming herself with a rifle, Hattie emerges from the cabin, and after a brief shoot-out, she kills the Captain and Jeb kills the remaining outlaw. The McAllister family rebuilds their cabin with money from the bounty on the dead outlaws.
Additionally, Travis Mills, Izzy Marshall, Jeremy Gauna, and Thomas White Eagle are among the supporting cast.[7]

Mark PolishandMichael Polish(born October 30, 1970), known informally as thePolish brothers, are American twin filmmakers. Michael usually directs their films, and Mark often has an acting role.
The Polish brothers were born inEl Centro, California. Their father is from Montana, and is of part Austrian ancestry.[1]He used to work at theDEAin Sacramento.[2]Their paternal grandfather worked on the dams of Montana.[3]Their mother's family is Mexican.[4]The brothers were raised Catholic.[5]
The Polish brothers began their film career with the 1999Sundancedebut of their first feature,Twin Falls Idaho.[6][7]Theidentical twinsiblings wrote and starred in the tale ofconjoined twins. Michael directed.Sony Pictures Classicsbought the rights for theatrical distribution of the film, whichJanet MaslinofThe New York Timessaid had "style, gravity and originality to spare."[8]
Michael Polish, in an interview withRobert K. Elderfor the bookThe Film That Changed My Lifesaid much of his own inspiration came from watchingOnce Upon a Time in Americain his youth.[9]
... Internally it speaks to me, as just a human, a person alone. I can watch this movie alone and be a fan. Whether a filmmaker or not, I can be a fan because it has so many symbols and situations that reflect life itself, growing up. Even growing up in the suburbs, you still have friendships the same way these kids have friendships.[10]
In 2000, the Polish brothers followed upTwin FallswithJackpot, the story of a deludedkaraokesinger (Jon Gries) on a tour of American dive-bars. It won the 2001Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Awardand the 2001Seattle International Film FestivalNew American Cinema Award. The film was distributed theatrically by Sony Pictures Classics.
In 2002, the brothers were offered the opportunity to make a mainstream film. Instead, they began to put together the independent filmNorthfork.  When financing collapsed days beforeprincipal photography, the filmmakers signed their house to creditors, and paid for their movie with personal credit cards. StarringJames WoodsandNick Nolte,Northforkwas chosen as an early selection by the Sundance Film Festival, and when the movie premiered at Sundance in 2003,Roger Ebertcalled it "a masterpiece."[11]
In 2005, the Polish brothers, along with producing partner Jonathan Sheldon, wrote and releasedThe Declaration of Independent Filmmaking. The book, a how-to guide for first-time,do-it-yourselffilmmakers, follows the filmmaking process and gives firsthand accounts of the Polish Brothers' travails in making their films.The Library Journalsaid the Polish Brothers "write in a way that illuminates the details more clearly than most technical scribes."
In 2006, the brothers would team withWarner Independentfor their fourth film,The Astronaut Farmerabout a formerNASAastronaut, Charles Farmer (Billy Bob Thornton), who has been obsessively building a rocket in his barn.Warner Bros.released it throughout North America in 2007.[12]
The brothers then shot two films back-to-back, just days apart while launching their new production company Prohibition Pictures with partners Ken Johnson, Janet DuBois, and Jonathan Sheldon. The Polish Brothers' fifth film,Manure(with Billy Bob Thornton andTÃ©a Leoni) began shooting on May 27, 2008 and was released at the Sundance Festival the following year asThe Smell of Success), and the Polish Brothers' sixth film,Stay Cool(withWinona Ryder, Mark Polish,Chevy Chase,Sean Astin,Hilary Duff,Jon Cryer,Josh Holloway) began filming in July 2008 (and was shown at Tribeca Festival in 2009).[13]
In May 2010, the Polish brothers began filmingFor Lovers Only. Said to be inspired by the French New Wave andClaude Lelouch's 1966 double Oscar-winnerA Man and a Woman, the romance focuses on a journalistStana Katic(Castle) in Paris on assignment, who runs into a lover (Mark Polish) from her past. Presumably enraptured by reconciliation, the pair flee Paris and travel "by train, car, and motorcycle as their love affair takes them across France from Normandy to St. Tropez."
In 2013, Michael directed American adventure drama,Big Sur, an adaptation of the1962 novelof the same name byJack Kerouac. The story is based on the time Kerouac spent in Big Sur, California and his three brief sojourns to friendLawrence Ferlinghetti's cabin in Bixby Canyon. The film debuted on January 23, 2013 at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, where it received generally positive reviews.[14]
In 2014, it was announced that Mark would write, direct, and star inHeadlock. The film also starredDianna AgronandAndy Garcia.[15]
In July 2011, Michael began dating actressKate Bosworth, and on August 31, 2013, the couple married inPhilipsburg, Montana.[16]They separated in August 2021.

In an interview with Ariel Helwani, the UFC fighterBobby Greenaccused Cerrone of sexually harassing his female fans at UFC Fan Expo signing in 2014 . According to Green, he groped and behaved inappropriately towards the women that came to take a photo with him.[172][173][174]
"He's groping these women. They've got husbands, they've got fiancees, they've got boyfriends, I'm like, that's messed up man, just because this guy's a nerd and he can't do anything to you, you're going to do this to him. Girlfriend's cute, Donald Cerrone, picks her up, grabs her ass, starts grabbing on there and stuff and he's like 'I'm Donald Cerrone.' I'm like, 'you're going to piss somebody off, you get the wrong person they're going to get pissed.' He's like, 'what are they going to do to me, I'll knock them out.' "
In an interview with Sherdog, Cerrone denied these accusations. "That was two years ago, ya' know? Why didn't any of this come out? Why didn't a fan file a lawsuit or say, 'Yo, Cowboy is groping my wife,' c'mon." he said of the alleged incidents.[175]
As part of histrash talkto describeJamie Varnerin a build up of their second fight atWEC 51in 2010, Cerrone commented that Varner is "afag" and that he hoped to kill him in the ring. After WEC officials publicly condemned his remarks, he apologized for the death threats on Twitter, but did not mention the slur usage in his apology.[180][181][182]
Cerrone was widely criticized for his use of a homophobic slur to describeDaniel Cormier's performance againstAnderson SilvaatUFC 200during a Q&A at UFC Fan Expo, where he was taking part in a panel covering the event along withCM Punkand Joe Gooden. When talking with CM Punk about the worst performances of that night, he criticized Cormier's wrestling-heavy game plan asking "How you going to give up weight and fight like a fag, man?".[183][184]
After an immediate backlash, a UFC senior official told the MMA Junkie portal that the organization was "incredibly disappointed by Cerrone's comments" and will be meeting with him to discuss the severity of the situation. Cerrone reacted to the criticism with a since-deleted Instagram post, which showed a photo of him wearing a then-recently released UFC rainbow T-shirt in support of theLGBTQcommunity and in which he apologized for his choice of words.[185]
WhileJason Elliswas interviewing Cerrone on hisradio show, Ellis mentioned he is bisexual and has had sexual relationships with men, which appeared to make Cerrone uncomfortable. During his appearance on an episode ofThe Joe Rogan Experiencepodcast some weeks later, Cerrone called Ellis "a faggot", adding that he had not wanted to say it to Ellis directly. Ellis voiced his disappointment with Cerrone's statements in an interview with outsports.com.[186][187]
When discussing U.S. presidentDonald Trump's attempts to ban transgender people from serving in the US armed forces on an episode ofThe Fighter and the Kidpodcast, Cerrone objected to the host,Brendan Schaub, using female pronouns to describe a trans woman, and stated: "I'm just saying, if you got a dick, you're a dude."[188]
Until 2009, Cerrone was one of a number of MMA fighters sponsored by Hoelzer Reich, a t-shirt company that includes symbols such as theIron Crosson its t-shirts, which detractors have stated isNaziimagery. The brand was banned by the UFC in 2009.[189][190][191]
