Gabriel Tancredi, a former Marine turnedmob enforcer, breaks hiscode of conductto save a police officer, Vanessa, who witnessed a failed assassination attempt ordered by Arnold Solomon, his friend and ruthless mob boss.
The film was shot in the state ofGeorgia, beginning in April 2021.[2]White Elephantis one of the last films to starBruce Willis, who retired from acting because he was diagnosed withfrontotemporal dementia.[3]DirectorJesse V. Johnson, who previously worked with Willis when he himself was a stuntman, told theLos Angeles Timesthat "it was clear that he was not the Bruce I remembered". Willis's lines were filmed at a quicker pace at the suggestion of his assistant, Stephen J. Eads. Several crew members recalled Willis appearing confused on set. One of the crew members said, "It was less of an annoyance and more like: 'How do we not make Bruce look bad?'. Someone would give him a line and he didn't understand what it meant. He was just being puppeted." Production supervisor Terri Martin said, "He just looked so lost, and he would say, 'I'll do my best.' He always tried his best." Johnson would later be asked if he wanted to film another movie with Willis but the director declined the offer, stating, "it was decided as a team that we would not do another. We are all Bruce Willis fans, and the arrangement felt wrong and ultimately a rather sad end to an incredible career, one that none of us felt comfortable with."[4]
The film was released in select theaters in the United States byRLJE Filmsand on streaming onAMC+on June 3, 2022.[5]
As of May 26, 2023,White Elephantgrossed $49,477 in the United Arab Emirates, Russia, and Portugal.[1]

Roger Moore ofMovie Nationgave a negative review and wrote, "judging from the inane script, the unhurried direction...and by the destruction wrought when machine guns tear up cars, houses and people (nothing graphic enough to be honest), it's obvious that the budget here went to actors and ordnance."[7]Dom Sinacola ofPastealso gave a negative review, summarizing the film was "like the work of an artist still searching for inspiration."[8]
Tae Kwon Do Life Magazinepraised Michael Rooker's performance in the film, "This is his best performance, by far.   He is very memorable in this role."[9]

For many of its titles, Image has exclusive audio and broadcast rights as well as digital download rights to approximately 2,100 video programs and over 400 audio programs containing more than 6,000 tracks. The company is headquartered inChatsworth, California.
Founded in 1981 as aNASDAQ-listed public company known as Image Entertainment, Image began as a distributor ofLaserDiscs, whose sound and picture quality surpassed that ofVHSandBeta, the dominant tape formats of the time. In its earlier years, the company originally distributed X-rated titles in addition to mainstream titles.[4]Image successfully secured exclusive output deals with major studios such asUniversal Studios,20th Century Fox,Orion Pictures, andThe Walt Disney Company, and grew to become the dominant distributor of the format. The company was trading under the symbol "DISK".
In August 1994, Image entered theCD-ROMmarket, releasing movies on the CD-ROM format.[5]
As the 1990s came to a close and Laserdiscs gave way to DVDs, Image re-focused on the fledgling format that quickly came to dominate the home video marketplace. While studios were busy managing the transition from VHS to DVD, Image began to acquire DVD rights to long-form music concert programs, television programming, foreign films and a broad array of special interest programming fromGRB Entertainment,20th Television/Foxstar Productions,Orion Pictures,Playboy Home EntertainmentandUniversal Pictures, all of which were being ignored by the major studios and music labels.[6]
In 2005, Image signed a distribution deal withBandai Visualto distribute selectanimetitles under the Honneamise label.[7]The deal ended in March 2007, when Bandai Visual switched over toGeneon USA.[8]

By the 10th anniversary of the DVD, Image has once again established itself as a dominant distributor of independently produced programs. In 2008, Image began to expand its release schedule to include feature films.
On August 31, 2010,Sony Pictures Home Entertainmentpartnered with Image Entertainment in a multi-year agreement, marketing and distributing some DVDs and Blu-rays by Image. Image retains its own sales and marketing.[9]The deal was expired in April 2012, when Mill Creek Entertainment agreed to release the most ofSony Pictureslibraries. On April 27, 2011, Image Entertainment made a long-term agreement withLakeshore Entertainmentto distribute their film library on home media. This also gave them access to theNew World Pictureslibrary which Lakeshore acquired in 1996, with many of the titles not issued on Blu-ray at the time.[10]Incidentally, Image originally released a number of New World titles on laserdisc from the late 80's to early 90's. 
On April 2, 2012, it was announced that RLJ Acquisition, Inc. had entered into an agreement to acquire Image Entertainment as well as Acorn Media and plan to merge the two companies. The two companies operate under the banner "RLJ Entertainment".[11]The company was then renamed RLJ Entertainment.[12]In 2014, RLJ acquired British media distributor Acorn Media UK, this deal also included 64% inAgatha Christie Limited.[13]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
