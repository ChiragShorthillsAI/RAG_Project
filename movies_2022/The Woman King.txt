The Woman Kingis a 2022 Americanquasi-historicalaction-adventure filmabout theAgojie, the all-female warrior unit that protected theWest Africankingdom ofDahomeyduring the 17th to 19th centuries. Set in the 1820s, the film starsViola Davisas a general who trains the next generation of warriors to fight their enemies. It is directed byGina Prince-Bythewoodand written byDana Stevens, based on a story she wrote withMaria Bello. The film also starsThuso Mbedu,Lashana Lynch,Sheila Atim,Hero Fiennes Tiffin, andJohn Boyega.
Bello conceived the idea forThe Woman Kingin 2015 after visitingBenin, where the kingdom used to be located, and learning the history of the Agojie. She recruitedCathy Schulmanto develop it into a feature film, pitching it to several studios, who turned it down due to financial concerns. After they met withTriStar Picturesin 2017, the film wasgreenlitin 2020. Production began in South Africa in November 2021, shut down due to theCOVID-19Omicron varianta few weeks later, and resumed in early 2022.Polly Morganwas the cinematographer. During post-production, the musical score was composed byTerence Blanchard, and the editing was completed byTerilyn A. Shropshire.
The Woman Kinghad its world premiere at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 9, 2022, andSony Pictures Releasingreleased the film in theaters in the United States on September 16, 2022. Following the festival screening, the film received generally positive reviews from critics,[5][6]with praise directed towards Davis's performance and the action choreography. However, it received criticism forhistorical distortionof slavery.[7]It was named one of the top ten films of 2022 by theAmerican Film Instituteand theNational Board of Review. At the28th Critics' Choice Awardsthe film received nominations forBest Costume Design,Best Acting Ensemble,Best Director, andBest Actressfor Davis. Furthermore, Davis also earned Best Actress nominations at theGolden Globes,Screen Actors Guild,BAFTA Film Awards, andNAACP Image Awards.
It was the last film to be distributed byEntertainment Onein Canada before the distributor's Canadian division was shut down on June 29, 2022, along with its Spanish distribution shortly before its release.
In theWest Africankingdom ofDahomeyin 1823,[8]General Nanisca, leader of the all-female regiment of warriors, theAgojie, liberates Dahomean women who were abducted byslaversfrom theOyo Empire. This provokes KingGhezoof Dahomey to prepare for an all-out war with the Oyo.
Nanisca begins to train a new generation of warriors to join the Agojie to protect the kingdom. Among these warriors is Nawi, a strong-willed girl who was offered by her father to the king when she refused to marry men who would beat her. Nawi befriends Izogie, a veteran Agojie. She also reveals to Nanisca that she is adopted and shows a scar on her left shoulder, shocking her.
Portugueseslave tradersled by Santo Ferreira and accompanied by the half-Dahomean Malik arrive as part of an alliance with the Oyo, led by General Oba Ade. Nawi encounters Malik while the latter is bathing, and the two become friends.
Shortly after graduating from training to become a full-fledged Agojie, Nawi sneaks off to speak with Malik and learns that the Oyo are planning to attack. She reports this to Nanisca, who tells her off for her recklessness. Amidst a heated argument between the two, Nanisca reveals that in her youth, she was captured by Oba, raped, and impregnated. After giving birth to a daughter, Nanisca embedded ashark toothin her left shoulder before giving her away. Nanisca helps Nawi extract the tooth, confirming that she is her biological daughter.
Nanisca leads the Agojie in an attack on the Oyo. The attack is successful, but Oba escapes and Nawi, Fumbe and Izogie are captured. With Nawi's advice, Fumbe escapes and reports the others' fate to Nanisca. Ghezo prepares to bestow the title ofWoman King, his partner and equal in ruling Dahomey, upon Nanisca, but refuses to authorise a rescue mission for the captive Agojie.
Meanwhile, Izogie is killed in an escape attempt and Malik buys Nawi to protect her. Nanisca defies orders and sets out with a group of like-minded warriors to rescue the captives. The chaos allows Nawi to escape and rejoin Nanisca. Malik frees several other slaves who drown Ferreira, and Nanisca kills Oba in single combat.
The triumphant Agojie return to Dahomey, where Ghezo privately and briefly admonishes Nanisca for disobeying him, before crowning her the Woman King. After the festivities, Nanisca and Nawi privately acknowledge their familial relationship.
The Woman Kingwas produced byMaria BelloandCathy Schulman, written byDana Stevenswith contributions byGina Prince-Bythewood, and directed by Prince-Bythewood.[20]It is a co-production betweenTriStar PicturesandEntertainment One.[1]
In 2015, Bello went to the West African nation ofBeninto learn the history of the Agojie. Convinced she had found a story worth telling, she returned to Los Angeles and recruited Schulman, then head of organization Women in Film, to help her make the film.[2]On September 19, 2015,[21][22]Bello used a moment when she was presenting actressViola Daviswith an award at theSkirball Cultural Centerin Los Angeles to pitch her idea for the movie in front of the crowd, who cheered at the notion of seeing Davis in the lead role.[2][20]
Schulman first tried to set up the film atSTXfilms, where she was the head of the production, but the studio was only willing to offer an unsatisfactory $5 million.[23]After leaving STX in 2016, Schulman worked with Bello, Davis, and Julius Tennon, Davis's husband and producing partner at JuVee Productions, to take the idea elsewhere.
Studios who turned it down cited an unlikely chance for the film to turn a profit; others, according to Davis, wanted to cast light-skinned, well-known actresses, which they refused to do for historical accuracy and the audience's sake. Prince-Bythewood, also in 2016, was approached to write the screenplay but could not commit due to a scheduling conflict withSilver & Black.[23][24]In 2017, without a script or director, the producers met with TriStar's then-chiefHannah Minghellaand then-senior vice presidentNicole Brown. Within two years, Brown had taken over Minghella's position and madeThe Woman Kingone of TriStar's top priorities.[2]
In early 2018, the commercial success of the superhero movieBlack Panther, which featured a fictionalized version of the Agojie, further motivated the crew to move forward with the project. In March 2018, Davis andLupita Nyong'owere announced to star;[9]Nyong'o's role was ultimately played byThuso Mbedu. Lupita dropped out after learning about Dahomey's "legacy of violence."[25]Prince-Bythewood read the screenplay once it was completed and came on board to direct, and in 2020,The Woman Kingwasgreenlitwith a $50 million budget.[2][24]
Prince-Bythewood referenced epic films likeThe Last of the Mohicans(1992),Braveheart(1995), andGladiator(2000) as influences. Her background in sports gave her a perspective on the realism of fight scenes.[2]In crafting the story, she sought for the women to be multi-faceted in both their fighting ability and their emotional reactions.[20]She worked with production designer Akin McKenzie to learn about the Agojie. Their research included books, out-of-print texts, photographs, and writings byPrincetonprofessorLeonard Wantchekon. "The biggest eye-opener," she said, "was how much misinformation there is about these women and this culture, given that so much of their history was written from the colonizer's point of view. So it was really about separating the texts that were from that point of view, which were so disparaging and disrespectful, from the truth."[23]
For four months before the shoot, the cast performed 90 minutes a day of weight lifting with trainer Gabriela Mclain, followed by three-and-a-half hours of fight training with stunt coordinator Danny Hernandez, which included running, martial arts, and working with swords and spears. Davis was inspired by pro boxerClaressa Shields.[2]
In November 2021, the cast and crew flew to South Africa for a five-month shoot. Prince-Bythewood prioritized department heads who were women and people of color,[2]including cinematographerPolly Morgan,[26]production designer Akin McKenzie, costume designer Gersha Phillips, hairstylist Louisa Anthony, visual effects supervisorSara Bennett, and editorTerilyn Shropshire. Makeup was handled by a local, South African artist, Babalwa Mtshiselwa. "The thing is for women and people of color," Prince-Bythewood said, "often the résumés are not long because it's about lack of opportunity, not lack of talent. So when you’re in my position, it's important to look past that résumé."[2]
For a sequence in which a character is remembering a sexual assault, Prince-Bythewood referencedChristine Blasey Ford's testimony atBrett Kavanaugh'sSupreme Court nomination hearingand asked the actress to read theRoxane GaybookHunger, a memoir about Gay's rape.[2]Filming for the first two weeks took place in the coastal province ofKwaZulu-Natalfor the shooting of jungle scenes. They then moved to the coastal city ofCape Town, where the majority of filming would take place.[24]In their third week in South Africa, theCOVID-19omicron varianthit the production; Davis and Tennon were among the infected. Production shut down for a few weeks and resumed in mid-January 2022. This production halt forced them to re-rehearse a battle sequence with hundreds of performers. Prince-Bythewood called it the hardest shoot of her career.[2]
Editing was completed byTerilyn A. Shropshire, who worked on Prince-Bythewood'sThe Old Guard(2020).[27]The film's musical score was composed byTerence Blanchard, who worked with Prince-Bythewood on her first filmLove & Basketball(2000) and the television showsShots FiredandSwagger.[28][29]For the score, Blanchard enlisted the nine-voice Vox Noire ensemble, who worked with him on his operaFire Shut Up in My Bones, with jazz singerDianne Reevesas hissoloist. They recorded for five days with the 78-memberRoyal Scottish National OrchestrainGlasgow, Scotland. Additional recordings occurred in New York with Vox Noire and Colorado with Reeves. Ghanaian-Americanmezzo-sopranoTesia Kwarteng led the choir. Three numbers by South African composerLebo Mof chants and dances were also performed in the film. The song in theend credits, "Keep Rising," was an original piece written byJessy Wilson,Jeremy Lutito, andAngélique Kidjoand performed by Kidjo forWarner Chappell Musicin late 2020, and later sold to Sony. The soundtrack album was released on September 16, 2022, byMilan Records.[30][31]

The Woman Kinggrossed $67.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $27.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $94.4 million[3][4]
In the United States and Canada,The Woman Kingwas projected to gross around $12 million in its opening weekend, with some studios estimating it could reach as much as $16 million.[39]The film made $6.8 million on its first day, including $1.7 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to over-perform and debut at $19.05 million from 3,765 theaters, topping the box office. Of the opening-weekend audience, 60% were female, 58% were over the age of 35, and 59% were African American.[35]In its second weekend, the film made $11.1 million (a drop of 42%), finishing behind newcomerDon't Worry Darling.[40]In its third weekend, the film made $6.8 million, finishing third.[41]
The Woman Kingreceived positive reviews from critics for the cast's performance, including Viola Davis's starring role andThuso Mbedu's breakout performance, and its action choreography, while some minor disappointment was expressed with the script.[7]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 94% of 276 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's consensus reads: "All hail Viola Davis!The Woman Kingrules."[42]OnMetacriticthe film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[43]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film a rare average grade of "A+" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave the film a 95% overall positive score.[citation needed]
Lovia Gyarkye ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote, "A crowd-pleasing epic—thinkBraveheartwith Black women."[44]Robert Daniels atRogerEbert.comsaid, "WhenThe Woman Kingworks, it's majestic... The magnitude and the awe this movie inspires are what epics likeGladiatorandBraveheartare all about."[45]Kate Erbland ofIndieWiresaid, "A hell of a time at the movies, a seemingly 'niche' topic with great appeal, the sort of battle-heavy feature that will likely engender plenty of hoots and hollers."[46]/Film's Chris Evangelista said it was "an absolute blast. It's a film that isn't afraid to get you cheering."[47]BBCcritic Caryn James wrote, "It is a splashy popcorn movie with a social conscience."[48]
Jamie Broadnax ofBlack Girl Nerdscalled Viola Davis's performance a career best.[7][49]Gyarkye said, "The Oscar-winning actress, known for digging into her characters' psyches, accesses an impressive level of emotional depth and nuance as Nanisca."[44]The Wrap's Martin Tsai wrote, "Davis truly gets to flex the full range of her acting chops. A performance of this caliber is rare in what's essentially an action flick."[50]Chris Bumbray ofJoBlowrote, "Her raw intensity is backed up by a newly jacked physique that makes her an imposing action heroine, and she performs exceptionally well in the numerous action scenes."[51]Other cast members who were praised included Lashana Lynch (Evangelista at/Filmand Reuben Baron atLooper.comcalled her the film's standout)[47][52]and Thuso Mbedu, who was called a "breakout star" by several critics;[45][47][52]Tim Grierson atScreen Internationalsaid that she "nearly steals the show" with an "exceptional supporting performance".[8]
James said that the representation of history and culture "leans toward fantasy in its heroic moments, but is rooted in [the] truth about war, brutality, and freedom."[48]Gyarkye said that it "begins as portraiture and then surrenders to melodrama when faced with the challenges of translating history for the screen and constructing a coherent geopolitical thread."[44]Reuben Baron ofLooper.comwrote, "The Woman Kingis an 8/10 for entertainment value, and 4/10 for how it deals with history." On the aspect of spectacle, critics said they wanted more action movies likeThe Woman King.[52]Erbland said, "If this is what a Hollywood-ized and -sized blockbuster looks like in 2022, bring it on. Bring them all on."[46]Evangelista concluded in his review, "Maybe one day we'll get to a point where such a movie doesn't feel groundbreaking, but here we are."[47]
The Africa Reportdescribes the response from Benin, where the movie is set, as mixed, with some Beninese reactions pointing out the historical errors and the liberties taken in the representation of the Benin culture by replacing elements such as song and dance with South African substitutes and others responding positively to the depiction of Benin historical events in a major Hollywood production.[53]
The Woman Kingis set in 1823 in the Kingdom ofDahomey, now southernBenin.[86][87]The kingdom existed from around 1600 through 1904, and theAgojieexisted for most of that time; they formed at some point between the mid-1600s and the early 1700s and likely started waging military campaigns in the 1800s.[88][89]
Initially, the Agojie were recruited from among the king of Dahomey's wives. During the rule of KingGhezo, Agojie warriors were recruited from a wider pool, includingprisoners of warcaptured from neighboring states.[90]Other Agojie served voluntarily, while still others were involuntarily enrolled by their fathers or husbands.[86][88]Under Ghezo's rule, the Agojie grew from 600 warriors to roughly 6,000, comprising one third of the Dahomean military.[88]
Dahomey had been paying tribute to theOyo Empire, its adversary in the film, since 1748.[89]In 1823, Ghezo successfully liberated Dahomey from being a tributary of the Oyo, as depicted in the film.[86]
King Ghezo (played byJohn Boyega) was a historical figure who ruled Dahomey from 1818 to 1858 during the kingdom's political and economic "golden age."[86]However, other characters in the movie, including the Agojie general Nanisca (played byViola Davis), Nanisca's daughter Nawi (played byThuso Mbedu), and the slave trader Santo Ferreira (played byHero Fiennes Tiffin, —are fictional.[86][88]
Nanisca's name was likely inspired by an Agojie teenage recruit of the same name, whose fierce execution of a prisoner was recorded by a French naval officer in 1889.[86][88]The character of Nawi was named after the last surviving Agojie warrior to have combat experience, who died in 1979.[86][88][91]Kevin Lang ofHistory vs. Hollywoodspeculated that Ferreira was loosely inspired byFrancisco Félix de Sousa, a Brazilian slave trader who in reality was an ally of Ghezo and became an important figure in the Dahomey slave trade.[88]
Agojie warriors were considered to be formally married to the king, which made themcelibate.[86][88][91]Lang argued that this made the film's romance subplot between Nawi and Malik (played byJordan Bolger) implausible.[88]However, some Agojie became pregnant (either through consensual sex or rape, as depicted in the film), and some married and had children after their service.[90]
According to Meilan Solly ofSmithsonian, Dahomey was "a key player" in theAtlantic slave trade; it began the sale ofWest Africancaptives to Europeans in the late 17th and the early 18th centuries.[86]In 1727, Dahomey seized the port city ofOuidah, which became the second-largest supplier of captives in the slave trade. Between 1659 and 1863, nearly one million African slaves were sent to the Americas via Ouidah, which was under Dahomean control until 1892.[89][92]In the film, however, Ouidah is depicted as being under control of the Oyo Empire.[92]
InThe Woman King, theMahi people, allies of the Oyo Empire, raid Dahomean villages and sell the subjects into slavery. In reality, the larger Kingdom of Dahomey often led attacks on the Mahi.[89]
During the film, Ghezo tells the story of his half-brotherAdandozan, who was king of Dahomey from 1797 to 1818 after the assassination of his father,Agonglo. Adandozan punished members of the royal family who participated in the plot against Agonglo by selling them into slavery, including one of Agonglo's wives (and Ghezo's mother) Na Agontimé. In the film, Ghezo condemns Adandozan's actions, but when the real-life Ghezo seized power from Adandozan, he sold Adandozan's family members into slavery outside Dahomey.[89]
The character of Nanisca confronts Ghezo about the immorality of selling slaves to the Portuguese and suggests trading inpalm oilinstead. However, Nanisca's anti-slavery stance is at odds with the actions of real-life Agojie generals such asSeh-Dong-Hong-Beh, who sought to acquire captives by raiding theEgbafortress ofAbeokutain 1851.[88]Abeokuta was a rival of Dahomey and had begun to challenge its historical dominance of the slave trade. The historian John C. Yoder suggested that in the mid-1840s, some Agojie began to oppose conflict with Abeokuta and to support a more moderate stance on the slave trade. However, that interpretation was challenged by the historian David Ross.[88][93][94]
While Ghezo briefly explored palm oil production as an alternate revenue source for the kingdom, he quickly resumed the slave trade after the palm oil industry proved less profitable.[86]Ghezo ultimately agreed to end Dahomey's participation in the overseas slave trade in 1852 because of pressure from the British government.[86]However, the kingdom continued to use slaves on its palm oil plantations after this date.[87][88]Dahomey also continued to send slaves to Brazilian and Cuban slave traders until the 1860s.[89][90]
Los Angeles Timesreported that online critics complained that "the movie seemingly uplifts the women without fully acknowledging that the Dahomey tribe sold other Africans into slavery" though others defended the film.[95]The Conversationsaid "the film has drawn controversy from many angles." Before the film's release, online commentators commented on the perceived savagery of the kingdom, particularly by spotlighting rituals that involved human sacrifices. That narrative of criticism was broadened by the voices ofAmerican Descendants of Slavery(ADOS), which vehemently called for a boycott of the film by arguing it glorified a kingdom responsible for brutalizing its ancestors. Adding to the chorus of disapproval were specialists in 19th-century Dahomey history, who raised flags over inaccuracies in the film's representation of the slave trade. Moreover, a segment of the social media populace, advocating for the portrayal of more positive black stories, questioned the decision to focus on Dahomey. They suggested that other historical narratives, such as those exemplified by figures likeToussaint Louverture, would have been more appropriate and uplifting subjects for cinematic exploration.[96]
OnThe Mary Suewebsite, Rachel Ulatowski wrote, "The major reason for the controversy surrounding The Woman King is that it is allegedly historically inaccurate. Now, some individuals touting this claim may not actually care about the accuracy and are just using this as an excuse to boycott a film about Black women’s empowerment. However, some historians have weighed in on the issue, too, which raised some valid concerns. One point that has sparked controversy isThe Woman King‘s historically inaccurate depiction of the kingdom of Dahomey’s attitude towards slavery."[97]
On social media, the hashtag #BoycottWomanKing was trending for days.The Wrapnoyed, "Critics don’t have an issue with Davis playing a strong Black leader in “The Woman King,” but are alarmed that the history of the Dahomey tribe, who sold other Africans into slavery, has beenwhitewashed."[98]Viola Davis responded to a calls for a boycott of the movie by arguing that "Most of the story is fictionalized. It has to be," while Tennon stated that "We have to entertain people. [...] If people want to learn more, they can investigate more."[95]

TriStar Pictures, Inc.(spelled asTri-Staruntil 1991) is an Americanfilm studioandproduction companythat is a member of theSony Pictures Motion Picture Group,[1]part of the multinational conglomerateSony Group Corporation. It is a corporate sibling of fellow Sony studio,Columbia Pictures.
TriStar Pictures was established on March 2, 1982, founded by Victor Kaufman as Nova Pictures, changed a year later to Tri-Star to avoid confusion with thePBSseriesNova.[3]Its most notable releases includeTerminator 2: Judgment Day,Basic Instinct,Rambo: First Blood Part IIand Hollywood’s first everGodzilla.
Originally a joint venture between Columbia Pictures,CBS, andHBO, whose individual video units handled video, broadcast, and pay cable rights to its products,[4]the company scored a number of box-office hits with modestly budgeted fare in the 1980s, as well as fortuitous distribution deals with theProducers Sales Organization,[5]Carolco Pictures[6]and theTaft Entertainment Group.[7]It also expanded ambitiously throughout the decade with the acquisition ofLoews Theatresand the formation ofits own television arm. Among the various hits TriStar scored on its own during the decade wereAbout Last Night,The Muppets Take Manhattan,Real Genius,Nothing in Common,Peggy Sue Got Married,The Principal,Look Who's TalkingandSteel Magnolias.
On November 15, 1985, CBS dropped out of the joint venture, selling its stake to Columbia Pictures.[8]HBO sold its shares to the same studio in 1986 in order to formHBO Pictures.[9]On December 21, 1987, Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. followingThe Coca-Cola Company's merger of Tri-Star and Columbia to become "Columbia/Tri-Star", of which it owned 80% of its stock.[10]In January 1988, CPE's stocks somewhat fell, and Coca-Cola decreased its shares in CPE to 49%. On April 13, 1988, the name of the company reverted to Tri-Star Pictures, Inc.[11]On November 8, 1989, theSony Corporation of Japanacquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment for $3.4 billion. On August 7, 1991, under Sony Pictures Entertainment, the hyphen was officially removed from the name of the studio. TriStar became the first new Americanmajor film studiosinceRKO Pictures, which was founded in 1928.
During the 1990s, TriStar operated autonomously from Columbia. Although its products were mostly indistinguishable from that of its sister studio, it soon scored a string of hits at the box office with such films asSleepless in Seattle,Philadelphia,The Mirror Has Two Faces,Jerry Maguire,As Good as It Gets,BugsyandJumanji, and it also scored a major video hit withDanny DeVito'sMatilda.[12]However, in 1998, the company fell on hard times following the box-office disappointment of its remake of theJapanesemonster filmGodzilla, and Sony quickly responded by merging the studio with Columbia to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Pictures Group.[13]The TriStar name was subsequently used by Sony on a very limited basis until 2004, when the company decided to turn the studio into a genre label that specialized in acquisitions.[14]In 2015, Sony formedTriStar Productionsas a vehicle for film and television productions.[15]TriStar Pictures is currently being used as a vehicle for distribution of products from that new entity and other items from Sony Pictures, including titles fromSony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions.[16]
TriStar Pictures is a member of theMotion Picture Association(MPA).[17]
The concept for Tri-Star Pictures can be traced to Victor Kaufman, a senior executive ofColumbia Pictures(then a subsidiary ofthe Coca-Cola Company),[18]who convinced Columbia,HBO, andCBSto share resources and split the ever-growing costs of making movies, leading to the creation of a new joint venture on March 2, 1982. On May 16, 1983, it was given the name Tri-Star Pictures (when the new company was formed and did not have an official name, the press used the code-name "Nova", but the name could not be obtained as it was being used as the title for thePBSscience series).[3][19]Tri-Star embarked on a 12 to 18 feature film slate per year, with a combined budget of $70 to $80 million and signed producer Walter Colbenz as vice president of the Tri-Star feature film studio, and signed initial development deals with directorJohn Schlesingerand producers Jeffrey Walker and Michael Walker.[20]Tri-Star's first project to roll out wasThe Muppets Take Manhattan.[21]
On May 11, 1984, Tri-Star's first produced film was released,The NaturalstarringRobert Redford. Tri-Star's first release, however, was the film,Where the Boys Are '84; a 1984remakeof the 1960Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) picture,Where the Boys Arethat was co-distributed on behalf ofITC EntertainmentafterUniversalrejected it; the film was a commercial flop.[22]
Many of Tri-Star's productions were released on VHS byRCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video,HBO/Cannon Video, orCBS/Fox Video. In addition, HBO owned exclusive cable distribution rights to the films, with broadcast television licenses going to CBS.[4]
On May 8, 1984, Tri-Star Pictures secured North American distribution rights for the filmSupergirlfromWarner Bros., which enabled the film to be ready for distribution by Christmas 1984.[23]On May 15, 1984, the studio hit big through its association withCarolco Pictures, with the release ofRambo: First Blood Part II, which eventually became a smash hit for the studio the following year.[6][24]The company also partnered withProducers Sales Organizationto handle theatrical distribution of the PSO titles,[5]while both Tri-Star and Columbia struck a deal for film financing with Delphi Film Associates.[25]
CBS dropped out of the Tri-Star venture in November 1985.[8]HBO also dropped out of the venture and sold half of its shares to Columbia Pictures following a month.[9][26]Despite the changes in majority ownership, Tri-Star continued ambition-laden expansion plans. Chief among these plans was an expansion of their successful relationship with Carolco; a new extension of their pre-existing deal included Tri-Star gaining theatrical distribution rights to various Carolco projects, includingRambo IIIandAir America;Carolco retained all foreign, cable, television and videocassette rights.[27]Taft/Barish Productions, a joint venture ofTaft BroadcastingandKeith Barish Productions, signed a $200 million domestic distribution deal with Tri-Star (much like Carolco, Taft/Barish retained non-theatrical and ancillary distribution rights). Of the four films to emerge from this pact, onlyThe Running Manwould become a major success.[7]
Another avenue of expansion was acquiring the storiedLoews Theaterschain of cineplexes in October 1986 for $300 million, after a deal to purchaseUnited Artists TheatersfromTele-Communications, Inc.did not come to fruition. At the time, Loews had 260 theaters in six states.[28][29][30]
1987 was another ambitious year for Tri-Star; plans were in place to take Tri-Star from a relatively new, untested film company into a major film studio. Components of these plans included the formation ofTriStar Television, and joining forces withStephen J. CannellProductions andWitt/Thomas/HarrisProductions to create a television distribution company known as TeleVentures; they also proposed forming their own home video label, Tri-Star Video, taking over from the trio of distributors (RCA/Columbia, CBS/Fox and HBO/Cannon).[31][32]A full-on international distribution arm was also in the planning stages.[33]Another distribution deal was signed by Tri-Star andHemdale Film Corporationin September 1987, but only one film,High Tide, would result from that deal.[34]
However, Tri-Star's ambitions were curtailed by yet more change in ownership.The Coca-Cola Companyboosted its stake in Tri-Star to 29.3% that September.[35]That December, following several high-profile flops (includingIshtar), Coca-Cola began a plan to get out of the media industry; Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc., and Coca-Cola sold its entertainment business to Tri-Star for $3.1 billion. Coca-Cola would then gradually reduce their holdings in the new company to 49%. Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names; a new Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. entity was created in April 1988.[10][11]
As a result, Tri-Star's television division was consolidated into a single operating entity withColumbia/EmbassyTelevision and Coca-Cola Television to form a new incarnation ofColumbia Pictures Television.Merv Griffin Enterpriseswould continue to operate separately.[36][37]Similarly, Tri-Star's nascent video division was absorbed into RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video.[38]
In 1989, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. was acquired by Japanese conglomerateSony Corporation, which merged Columbia and Tri-Star, but continued to use the separate labels. On July 11, 1990, Tri-Star Pictures dissolved and sold its venture in TeleVentures to Stephen J. Cannell Productions and TeleVentures became Cannell Distribution Co. Most of the series and the Tri-Star film packages that were distributed by TeleVentures were transferred to Columbia Pictures Television Distribution.[39]Sony Pictures Entertainment later revived TriStar Television as a television production banner in 1991 (by way of acquiring rights to shows fromNew World Television) and merged with its sister television studioColumbia Pictures Television(CPT) to formColumbia TriStar Television(CTT) on February 21, 1994.[40][41]Both studios continued to operate separately under the CTT umbrella until TriStar Television folded in 1999 and CPT folded in 2001.
In addition to its own slate, TriStar Pictures was the theatrical distributor for many films produced byCarolco Pictures(the rights to only one of its films,Cliffhanger, has been retained by TriStar). TriStar Pictures also theatrically distributed someFilmDistrictfilms. In 1992, TriStar Pictures, along withJapan Satellite Broadcastingsigned an agreement withThe IndieProd Companyto distribute movies produced by IndieProd in order to fill the void left by Carolco, whose deal with TriStar Pictures was on the verge of expiring amid financial troubles.[42]
Around summer 1998, SPE merged Columbia and TriStar to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group, but just like Columbia Pictures Entertainment, both divisions continued producing and distributing films under their own names. Some of the movies slated to be released by TriStar Pictures, includingStepmomwould go to Sony's flagship labelColumbia Picturesfollowing the merger.[13]
TriStar was relaunched on May 13, 2004, as a marketing and acquisitions unit that had a "particular emphasis on genre films".[14]Screen Gems' executive vice president Valerie Van Galder was tapped to run the revived studio after being dormant.[43]However, the release of its 2013 filmElysiumrepresented the label's first big-budget release sinceThe Mask of Zorroin 1998.
The same year, former20th Century Foxco-chairmanTom Rothmanjoined Sony Pictures and createdTriStar Productionsas a joint venture with existing Sony Pictures executives. The new TriStar would develop, finance and produce up to four films per year, as well as television programming and acquisitions, starting on September 1.[15][44][45]Sony's TriStarPicturesunit is currently being retained for "other product, including titles fromSony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions", and is distributing product from TriStar Productions.[16]
TriStar's logo features the winged horsePegasus(either stationary or flying across the screen). The idea came from executive Victor Kaufman and his family's interest in riding horses. The original logo was created with the assistance ofSydney Pollack, who was an adviser at Tri-Star. The horse in the original filmed logo was the same one used in Pollack's filmThe Electric Horseman.[46]

Specifically, Prince-Bythewood's films frequently challenge popular portrayals of women of color rooted in cultural stereotypes by presenting women as passionate and ambitious figures committed to the realization of their goals.[37]Furthermore, Prince-Bythewood's films work to resist negative conceptions and ideologies about the ability of women to be dynamic; people who are both successful in their professional pursuits and in their maintenance of romantic relationships. Commenting on her filmLove & Basketball, Prince-Bythewood spoke to normalizing the idea that women can balance working toward career aspirations and being romantic partners: “Girls are often told you can’t have both, so I just wanted to normalize the belief that you can have both. I wanted to normalize girls like Monica, who were girls like me, who grew up playing sports and were… made to feel different”.[37]This element of Prince-Bythewood's work - one that challenges expectations in arenas of society that refuse women's (particularly black women's) ability to solidify their own subjectivity through passionate and purposeful vocational pursuits while also being desired romantically - has led some to label her work as romance films, in what some consider an oversimplification and dismissal of underlying womanist narratives and themes.[37]
Additionally, throughout her work, Prince-Bythewood has indicated a particular investment in spotlighting the humanity of the female characters that her films depict.[38]According to Christina N. Baker, Prince-Bythewood forefronts the humanistic quality of her film's characters through the development of narratives that demonstrate the complexities of human emotion. In producing narratives that highlight the intricacies of feeling, thought, and behavior, Prince-Bythewood works to dispel limiting images and representations of women that regard them as objects of desire and self-sacrifice whose purpose is centralized around being in service of others, who are often men, around them.[37]When asked byKathleen Newman-Bremangwhy highlighting emotion within her film's female characters is a significant element of her work in a discussion at the 47thToronto International Film Festival (TIFF)withViola Davisoriented around the debut ofThe Woman King(2022), Prince-Bythewood said “It’s showing our humanity. People don’t see our humanity. So, it’s important to put it up on screen”.[39]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
