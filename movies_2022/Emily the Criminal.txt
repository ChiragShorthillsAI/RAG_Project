As Youcef tends to her wounds, they discuss their aspirations. Emily, an aspiring artist, wishes to visit South America, while Youcef plans to purchase a rental property. Emily asks for a bigger role in his operation, and Youcef teaches her how to make fake credit cards. He gives her ataserfor protection and instructs her not to sell stolen goods at her home or scam the same store twice in a week. When Youcef's partner and cousin Khalil discovers them together, Youcef denies working with Emily. While Emilydogsitsfor her childhood friend Liz, a buyer finds her apartment and robs her earnings, taking the dog as well. She tases the buyer and reclaims both.
Emily invites Youcef to a party, which sparks a romance between them. When there is an opening at Liz'sadvertising agency, she gets Emily an interview with her boss Alice. However, at the interview, Emily discovers the "job" is merely an unpaid internship. When Emily objects, Alice calls her spoiled. Emily insults Alice and walks out, refusing to work for free.
At a dinner with Youcef's family, Khalil reveals that Emily has been caught hitting the same store twice within a week, prompting the store to postsecurity footageof her online.

As they arrive at the safehouse, Youcef asks Emily what her assault conviction was for. She replies that she had been dating a guy she frequently fought with, and then implies that one day she snapped and attacked him. She then confesses that her mistake was that she "didn't go far enough", that she "didn't really scare him", because if she had, "he would've never called the police".
Ambushing a guy on lookout, kidnapping him and luring out the other ring members with a fake carjacking, they enter the safehouse, where Khalil severely injures Youcef before Emily can subdue him.

After Plaza read the script, she came on board as a producer, in addition to agreeing to star in the film.[10]
Thematically,Emily the Criminaldiffers from dramas from earlier eras. Critic Sheila O'Malley ofRogerEbert.comwrote, "In a different world, a different time,Emily the Criminalmay very well have been a romantic drama, similar toJacques Audiard'sRust and Bone, mixing romance, criminality, class divides, and moral/ethical dilemmas."[11]
"The pace of the film is deliberately relentless", stated Vanessa Zimmer ofSundance, with the character of Emily charging "'full-octane' through her difficulties."[12]Confirming this in anAmerican Film Instituteinterview, writer and director John Patton Ford says he intended "to grab you really unapologetically and just take you on this ride, and to never really give you much of a choice but to watch it…to have that kind of a raw effect upon an audience."[13]
The film premiered at the2022 Sundance Film Festivalon January 24.[12][14]In February 2022,Vertical EntertainmentandRoadside Attractionsacquired distribution rights for the United States and Canada, andUniversal Picturesacquired international rights.[15][16]It was released on August 12, 2022.[17][3][4][18]Netflixbegan carrying the film in the United States on December 7, 2022.[19]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 94% of 196 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "A taut thriller that contains a wealth of social commentary,Emily the Criminalis stolen by Aubrey Plaza's terrific work in the title role."[18]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 75 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[21]
Deadline Hollywood'sDamon White wrote: "[While] Ford doesn't insult us with clichés about kick-ass heroines, he does give us a deceptively rich script that explains where Emily has come to—and where she will go, ensuring a satisfying ending that, while dark, doesn't feel too sugar-coated."[22]
Kate Erbland fromIndieWiregave the film an A− and wrote of Plaza's character Emily: "Is she likable? Is she redeemable? Is she a hero? As Emily might ask, who gives a fuck? With a film and a star this in control of its pitch-black material, she's not wrong. We're just along for the ride, and wouldn't have it any other way."[23]
Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiangave the film four out of five stars and praised Ford's direction, calling it "an undeniably striking debut, slick and involving enough to have us curiously excited for whatever he decides to do next".[24]
In May 2024, it was announced thatLegendary Televisionhad acquired the rights to adapt the film into a TV series. Plaza and Ford will serve as executive producers alongside the film's producers, with the latter returning as director, although Plaza will not reprise her role.[25]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
