Pearlis a 2022 Americanhorrorfilm directed, produced, and edited byTi West, whoco-wrotethe screenplay withMia Goth. It is the second installment in West'sXfilm seriesand a prequel toX(2022). Goth reprises her role as thetitle character, with a supporting cast featuringDavid Corenswet,Tandi Wright,Matthew Sunderland, and Emma Jenkins-Purro. The film serves as anorigin storyfor the titular villain, whose fervent aspiration to become a movie star clashes with her home life and violent tendencies, leading to violent acts on her family's Texas homestead in 1918.
West began co-writing a prequel script stemming from his collaboration with Goth while filmingX. Motivated by theimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema, filming started in New Zealandimmediately after the first film, usingXsets and theAvatar: The Way of Watercrew and taking pandemic safety precautions.Pearldrew inspiration from the works ofDouglas Sirk,Technicolorfilms likeThe Wizard of Oz(1939) andMary Poppins(1964), andDisney films. It had its world premiere at the79th Venice International Film Festivalon September 3, 2022, and was released in theaters in the United States on September 16, 2022, byA24. The film grossed over $10 million and received positive reviews from critics.
MaXXXine, a third film in the series and a direct sequel toX, was released on July 5, 2024. Goth reprised her other role from the first film.
In 1918,Pearlis a young woman living with herGerman immigrantparents on their farm in Texas, while her husband, Howard, serves inWorld War I. Her father is infirm and paralyzed, and her strict mother, Ruth, insists that she help care for both him and the farm as they isolate themselves to protect against theSpanish flu pandemic. Pearl aspires to be a chorus girl or a film star, which Ruth disapproves of, and chafes under the isolation. Pearl also shows signs of repressed rage and violence. She abuses her father in secret and kills animals, which she feeds to an alligator she nicknamedTheda.
One day while visiting town, Pearl meets aprojectionistwho takes a liking to her. After returning to the farm, Pearl continues to show signs of mental disturbance as she dances with a scarecrow in a cornfield and masturbates with it. During supper, Ruth berates Pearl and withholds her food, as Pearl claimed to have bought sweets on the way home to explain the missing 8 cents she spent on her ticket to the pictures.
Pearl hears from Mitsy, her wealthy sister-in-law, of an audition to find new dancers for a troupe around the state, and envisions it as her ticket out of spending her life living on the farm and having to care for her father. She later visits the projectionist, who shows her the illicitstag filmA Free Rideand encourages her to pursue her dreams. Pearl comments that she cannot abandon her family and she says, "If only they would just die."
That night, Ruth and Pearl get into an argument over dinner as she reveals that she knows about Pearl visiting the movies. Pearl confesses she wants to audition and asks for Ruth's permission, to which she declares Pearl as her biggest failure. An altercation erupts during which Pearl shoves her mother against the hearth, causing her dress to catch fire. As she burns, Pearl pours boiling water onto her to douse the flames and then drags her into the basement while leaving her father alone in the room. She then flees to the theater, where she has sex with the projectionist.
The following morning, the projectionist drives Pearl home to prepare for the audition. However, he is disturbed by her sudden agitated behavior, as well as the sight of a rotting pig that her mother-in-law left for Ruth several days before. As he tries to leave, Pearl erupts into a fit of rage at the perceived abandonment and stabs him to death with a pitchfork. She pushes his car into a pond, where Theda eats his remains. Pearl dresses herself in one of Ruth'sBelle Époquegowns and dresses up her father before smothering him to death using a pillow cover.
Pearl arrives at the church to attend the audition. She thinks her dance performance will impress the talent scouts, but is rejected for not being young, blonde, or "all-American". Mitsy accompanies her home in an attempt to console her, which results in Pearl launching into a lengthy confession regarding many things, from resentment toward her husband and having an affair to killing animals, her parents and the projectionist. Pearl then coerces a stunned Mitsy into confessing that she won the audition. As Mitsy tries to leave, Pearl chases her down the driveway and kills her with an axe.
Pearl dismembers Mitsy's body and feeds the remains to Theda, then goes into the basement and lies next to Ruth's corpse. She decides to atone for her crimes by creating a home for Howard. Some time later, Howard returns and is greeted with the long-decomposed bodies of Pearl's parents seated at the dining table around the rotting feast. As Howard stares in horror, Pearl greets him with a protracted, pained smile, saying, "I'm so happy you're home."
Ti Westbegan writing a script for the prequel film during production onX. He stated that the prequel project had developed from a story he had collaborated on withMia Goth, and that he had seen it either as becoming a potential film, or simply serving as abackstoryfor Goth's role asPearlin the first movie.[5]After the onset of thecoronavirus pandemic, seeing itsimpact on the cinema industry, West stated that he had been inspired to continue working and had decided to begin production of the prequel immediately afterwrappingon the previous installment. West stated that he had pitched his idea of a new franchise toA24and had been surprised when theygreen-lithis projects. The filmmaker stated that he intends each film to have its own distinct style andgenreofhorror. Describing his approach toX, he said he was heavily influenced byThe Texas Chainsaw Massacrefranchiseand by the works ofMario Bava, which explore how the rise ofindependent filmmakingaffected society. RegardingPearl, he described it asDouglas Sirkmelodramameeting theTechnicolorstyle ofMary PoppinsandThe Wizard of Oz, made as a "dementedDisneymovie", and said it will explore howHollywoodfilmmaking has influenced people. West stated that he intends to continue this trend of exploring diverse styles and genres in future installments. The movie is a joint-venture production between A24 and Little Lamb Productions.[5][6][7][8][9]
Mia Goth reprises her role as a younger version ofPearl, the elderly woman from the first film.[7][8][9][5]In July 2022, it was revealed thatDavid Corenswet,Tandi Wright,Matthew Sunderland, and Emma Jenkins-Purro would feature as the supporting cast.[10]
Principal photography was revealed to have begun in secret immediately following the completed photography onX. Filming started inNew Zealand, took placeback-to-backwith the first movie and used the same sets that were built forX. West worked with the production crew ofAvatar: The Way of Water(2022), who were taking a break from production on that film at the time. West stated that, despite the production taking place during theCOVID-19 pandemic, the production crew had already completed their required period ofself-isolation, and were therefore able to work safely and efficiently together during the pandemic. He said: "I came out of quarantine and I was like, 'We're already building all of this stuff, it'sCOVIDand we're on the one place on Earth where it's safe to make a movie.'"[7][8][5][11][12]
In March 2022, having completed filming, West announced that he was currently working oneditingthe movie, that he would go toNashville, Tennessee, following the March 2022SXSW Film Festival, to record theorchestral scorefor the soundtrack with Tyler Bates and Timothy Williams, and that the film was expected to be finished in May.[8][5][11]
The film score was released throughA24 Musicon September 23, 2022. Bates and Williams shared a liking of film scores from theclassical Hollywood cinemamostly fromBernard Herrmann,John Barry,Henry Mancini,Ennio MorriconeandMaurice Jarre.[13][14]In contrast toX, the duo wanted to produce a stylistically classical approach from that period, so that people could conceive it as a classic film over aslasher-horror film.[13]
AfterChelsea Wolfe's cover of "Oui, Oui, Marie" appeared inXand onits accompanying soundtrack,[15]Pearlfeatures the original,Arthur Fields' version of the song asdiegetic musicwhen Pearl goes to seePalace Follies. Pearl also makes a reference to the song when she exclaims "Au revoir, poor Johnny!" after pushing the projectionist's car into the pond.
Pearlhad its world premiere at the79th Venice International Film Festivalon September 3, 2022,[16]and was released in theaters in the United States on September 16, 2022.[17]

OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 211 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's consensus states: "Pearlfinds Ti West squeezing fresh gore out of the world he created withX– and once again benefiting from a brilliant Mia Goth performance."[23]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100 based on reviews from 39 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[24]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave the film a 75% overall positive score, with 54% saying they would definitely recommend it.[21]
Reviewing the film following its Venice Film Festival premiere,Peter BradshawofThe Guardianpraised West's direction and Goth's "grandiose performance", assigning it a perfect rating of five stars and remarking: "Perhaps I shouldn't have enjoyedPearlas much as I did: but it's clever, limber, gruesome and brutally well acted. A gem."[25]In his review forThe Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney described it as a "cleverly packaged pandemic production with narrative echoes of that global anxiety", praising the screenplay, cinematography, score, and Goth's performance—which he compared toShelley DuvallinThe Shining(1980).[26]In a year-end retrospective for Daily Grindhouse,Preston Fasselnamed the film as the best horror movie of 2022 as well as "the best film of the year, period, and a bona fide cinematic classic that deservesCriterionstatus ASAP."[27]In a negative review, Ewan Gleadow ofCult Followingwrote that while West "doubles down on what madeXsuch a chilling feature and consolidates what he is good at", the film ultimately "feels like a weak parody of theMGMdays ofThe Wizard of Oz."[28]Similarly, Derek Smith ofSlant Magazinethought that, whileThe Wizard of Ozreferences were "purposeful", they lacked "follow through", creating an impression that the film is more focused on showcasing its "cleverness" rather than enhancing its narrative or character depth.[29]
FilmmakerMartin Scorsesewas reportedly impressed by the film, calling it "mesmerizing" and stating that it was "powered by a pure, undiluted love for cinema".[30][31]The New York Timesnamed the character of Pearl one of the 93 most stylish people of 2022, highlighting her "blood red dress, lacy blue bow, smudged makeup, boots … and ax".[32]Goth's performance as thetitular characterwas cited byEntertainment Weeklyas one of the best of the year.[33]The Independentdescribed the character as acultural horror icon,[34]while the phrase "I'm a star" became a well-knownInternet memeamongGen-Zyouth.[35]
MovieWebconcluded that "Pearl embodies the ideology of theAmerican Dreamdistorted by herpsychopathy: she wants success and prosperity but rebukes its working-class mentality; she will take from everyone around her and destroy anyone in her way. Combined, these characters become a social commentary on America's destructive nature towards its most vulnerable citizens."[36]
West announced in March 2022 that he was working on the script for a third movie in the film series, to be set chronologically after the events ofXand intended to explore another subgenre of horror and continue depicting how cinema in general, and the development ofhome video releasesin particular, have influenced society. West stated that, while a viewer can watch each movie independently without having seen the previous film, they are made to "complement each other".[9][5]In describing his creative processes during the development of these films, West stated, "I'm trying to build a world out of all this, like people do these days." The filmmaker further noted, "You can't make a slasher movie without a bunch of sequels."[8]
In September 2022, at the first Midnight Madness showing ofPearlfor the2022 Toronto International Film Festival, a third film was officially announced with a short teaser playedafter the credits. The clip was later released online for those not present at the event. West once again served as writer/director and one of the producers, while Mia Goth reprised her role from the first movie. TitledMaXXXine, the film takes place in 1985 and serves as a sequel toX, centered around Maxine, the only survivor of the "Massacre ofX" as she continues to pursue fame inHollywood. Though principal photography had not yet begun, the teaser trailer wasshot, with the film fast-tracked to beinggreen-litby A24, following the successes of the previous two installments. Jacob Jaffke, Kevin Turen, and Harrison Kreiss produced, while Goth additionally served as an executive producer.[53][54][55]It was released on July 5, 2024.[56]

In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
