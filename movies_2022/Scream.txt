Screamis a 2022 Americanslasher filmdirected byMatt Bettinelli-OlpinandTyler Gillett, and written byJames VanderbiltandGuy Busick. It is a sequel toScream 4(2011), the fifth installment in theScreamfilm series, and the first in the series not directed byWes Craven, who died in 2015 and to whom the film is dedicated. It is also the first film in the franchise not to be produced byDimension Filmsdue to it becoming defunct in 2019, and the first film to be distributed byParamount Pictures.[5]The film starsMelissa Barrera,Kyle Gallner,Mason Gooding,Mikey Madison,Dylan Minnette,Jenna Ortega,Jack Quaid,Jasmin Savoy Brown, andSonia Ammar, withMarley Shelton,Skeet Ulrich,Roger L. Jackson,Heather Matarazzo,Courteney Cox,David Arquette, andNeve Campbellreprising their roles from previous installments. The plot takes place twenty-five years after the original Woodsboro murders fromScream(1996), when yet anotherGhostfaceappears and begins targeting a group of teenagers who are each somehow linked to the original killings.
Although fifth and sixthScreaminstallments were discussed after the release ofScream 4in 2011, Craven, writerKevin Williamson, and executive producerHarvey Weinsteinhad doubts about proceeding with more films following the less-than-expected box office performance of the fourth film. After the 2017sexual assault allegations against Weinsteinand the closure ofthe Weinstein Company, the rights to theScreamfranchise were obtained bySpyglass Media Groupin November 2019, who confirmed a new film would later be made. The following year, Williamson, who was returning as an executive producer, confirmed the film would not be a reboot and that Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett had been hired in March 2020 to direct the film. Campbell and Arquette were confirmed to be returning later that month, with Cox and the new cast members joining throughout the middle of the year. Filming took place between September and November 2020 inNorth Carolina. To avoid any plot leaks, numerous versions of the screenplay were produced, and several additional scenes were filmed.Brian Tyler, a frequent collaborator of Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett, was hired to compose and conduct the film's score, replacingMarco Beltrami, the composer of the previous four films.
Screamwas released in the United States on January 14, 2022, byParamount Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction, performances and tribute to Craven, with some calling it the bestScreamsequel.[6]It was also a box-office success, grossing over $138million against a production budget of $24million. A sequel,Scream VI, was released on March 10, 2023.
25 years afterBilly LoomisandStu Macher's killing spree in Woodsboro,[a]high school student Tara Carpenter is home alone when she is attacked byGhostfaceand left hospitalized.
InModesto, Tara's estranged older sister Sam Carpenter is informed about the attack. She returns to Woodsboro with her boyfriend Richie Kirsch to visit Tara at the hospital. There, Sam is reunited with Tara's friend group: Wes Hicks, Liv McKenzie, Amber Freeman, and twins Chad and Mindy Meeks-Martin. That night, Vince Schneider—Stu's nephew and Liv's ex-boyfriend—is killed by Ghostface. After an encounter with Ghostface at the hospital, Sam reveals to Tara that she has been dealing with hallucinations of Billy Loomis, who had an affair with their mother in high school and whom she discovered as a teenager was her biological father. Sam's discovery of her true parentage led to their parents' divorce and is the primary reason for her estrangement from Tara.
Sam and Richie seek help fromDewey Riley, who is now divorced fromGale Weathers. Dewey contacts Gale andSidney Prescottto warn them about the return of Ghostface. He joins Sam and Richie at the Meeks twins' home, where he briefly reunites with their mother, Martha Meeks,Randy Meeks' sister. Mindy deduces that the killer is creating a "requel", targeting Tara and her friends as the new generation while using Sam's connection to Billy to lure the legacy survivors. Ghostface murders Wes and his mother, SheriffJudy Hicks, at their home. Dewey reunites with Gale, who has returned to town to cover the story. At the hospital, Tara and Richie are attacked by Ghostface but are saved by Dewey and Sam. The Carpenter sisters and Richie escape, but Dewey is killed when he attempts to finish off Ghostface.
Sidney arrives in town after learning of Dewey's death and meets Gale and Sam at the hospital. Sidney asks Sam to help stop the killer, but Sam declines, choosing to leave town with Richie and Tara. Sidney and Gale follow the trio to Amber's house, revealed to be Stu's former home, where the original Woodsboro massacre took place. During a party in Wes' honor, the Meeks twins are attacked by Ghostface. As the friend group gathers, Amber pulls out Dewey's gun and shoots Liv in the head, revealing herself as the killer. Sidney and Gale arrive, and Richie is revealed to be Amber's accomplice. He stabs Sam, and together, he and Amber take the Carpenter sisters, Sidney, and Gale into the kitchen where Sidney first confronted Billy and Stu.
Richie and Amber explain that they are fans of theStabfilm series who met online. Disappointed with the direction of the most recentStab 8, they initiated a new killing spree to inspire a fresh installment based on true events and planned to frame Sam as the culprit. Sam attacks Richie, while Tara attacks Amber but is incapacitated. Sidney and Gale fight Amber, ending with Gale shooting Amber, causing her to fall onto a lit stove and catch fire. Richie chases Sam, who sees a hallucination of Billy that guides her to Amber's abandoned knife. Embracing her paternal legacy, Sam repeatedly stabs Richie and slits his throat before shooting him to ensure he is dead. A horribly burned Amber attempts to attack the group again but is fatally shot by Tara.
Tara and the Meeks twins are taken to the hospital, while Sam thanks Sidney and Gale for their help. Gale decides not to write a book about the new murders to avoid giving the killers notoriety, opting instead to write a tribute to Dewey. Sam joins Tara in the ambulance as the night's events are reported on the news.

In 2011,Wes Cravenconfirmed he was contracted to work on a fifth and sixth installment of theScreamfranchise, to be made if the fourth film achieved a successful release and reception.[14]Following difficulties with script rewrites onScream 2,Scream 3, andScream 4, often with pages only being ready on the day of filming, and the related stress of the situation, Craven stated that he would need to see a finalized version of a script forScream 5before committing to the production.[15]Kevin Williamsonalso confirmed he had contractual obligations for scripts forScream 4andScream 5, having submitted concepts for three films leading up toScream 6, though his contract for the sixth film had not yet been finalized. Williamson indicated that if aScream 5were to be made, it would be a continuation of the story of the characters who lived throughScream 4but thatScream 4would not include any cliffhangers that led into the potential sequel.[16]
Before the release ofScream 4, actorDavid Arquettealso supported a potential future of the franchise, stating "[the ending] definitely leaves it open," before adding that he would welcome the opportunity to play the character of Dewey in future installments.[17]In May 2011, executive producerHarvey Weinsteinconfirmed that a sequel was possible, saying that despiteScream 4performing belowthe Weinstein Company's financial expectations, he was still happy with its box office gross.[18]In February 2012, when asked about the potential for makingScream 5, Williamson stated at the time that he did not know if it would be made, saying "I'm not doing it."[19]
On September 30, 2013, Harvey Weinstein expressed his interest in a fifth installment, stating, "I'm begging [Bob Weinstein] to do the movie and just end it. We've milked that cow."[20]In July 2014, Williamson expressed doubt on a fifth film happening, saying, "I guessScream 4never took off in a way they hoped". He also elaborated on his departure from the series as Craven and his team were "done with him".[21]Williamson later detailed his plans where a proposedScream 5would follow Jill being stalked on a college campus, whileScream 6would feature Gale in the lead and focus on her relationship with Dewey.[22]On June 25, 2015,The Wall Street Journalconducted an interview withBob Weinstein. When asked about the possibility of a film continuation afterScream 4, Weinstein firmly denied the possibility of a fifth installment or any further continuation of the film franchise, citing theMTV television seriesas the right place for the franchise to find new life. "It's like putting an art-house movie in an art-house theater," Weinstein said. "Where the teens reside isMTV."[23]

Southboundpremiered at the 2015Toronto International Film Festivaland released theatrically bythe Orchardon February 5, 2016.[11]The New York Times'Neil Genzlinger gave the film a positive review and wrote "Its five segments do what they're supposed to do—unsettle you—but as a bonus, they also leave you wanting more. These are fragments more than complete stories, and the incompleteness is its own kind of creepiness. The filmmakers aren't after tidy tales, neatly connected and concluded. They know that the human mind finds loose ends unnerving." Richard Roeper of theChicago Sun-Times, who wrote that "It's one of the smartest and scariest movies in recent memory"[12][13]andRolling Stone'sDavid Ehrlich wrote that the movie was "Like episodes ofTwilight Zonethat a bakedRod Serlingmight have written after watchingCarnival of Souls, these chapters are eerie to the extreme, and seedy enough to make you feel like you're watching something you were never meant to see. It gets under your skin because it knows there's nothing scarier than realizing that—no matter how far you drive—the evil in your rearview mirror is always closer than it appears."[14]

She played Diane Weston, the head of a group of high school cheerleaders who conspire and commitarmed robbery. Despite negative reviews, Brendan Kelly ofVarietyfound Shelton to be "good" as "the ridiculously peppy but still smart Diane",[31]and Brian Orndorf ofFilm Fodderwrote: "The star who emerges fromSpiceunscathed is Marley Shelton. She achieves the unthinkable with this script by managing to create somewhat of a character for herself. A clear-eyed beauty, Shelton steals the film away from the sizable cast. She emerges as the only thing to recommend in the muddled and compromisedSugar & Spice."[32]Budgeted at US$11 million, the film made US$16.9 million worldwide and became somewhat of acultfavorite afterwards.[33]
In the slasher filmValentine, Shelton appeared oppositeDenise Richardsas friends who are being stalked by an unknown assailant while preparing forValentine's Day.[34]Released one week afterSugar and Spice,[35][36]the film grossed a modest US$36 million worldwide and was largely panned.[37][38]Mick LaSalleforSan Francisco Chronicle, nevertheless, felt that the lead actors were "vivid, and the characters they play are clearly delineated", while he pointed out Shelton for having a "nice gravity" portraying her role.[39]Her final film of 2001 was the comedyBubble Boy, loosely based on the story ofDavid Vetter, in which she played the love interest of a man living in a sterilized dome (Jake Gyllenhaal).[40][41]ACNNreviewer found the production to be "stupid and devoid of any redeeming features",[42]but Orndorf felt that Shelton made a "strong impression with her empathetic performance and her glowing good looks".[43]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
