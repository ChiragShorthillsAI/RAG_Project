The film's title was announced in July 2019 along with Olsen's involvement, whileJade Halley Bartlettwas hired to write the film that October. Derrickson stepped down as director in January 2020, citing creative differences.

AdemonchasesAmerica Chavezanda version of Stephen Strangein the space between universes while searching for theBook of Vishanti. Strange is killed and Chavez accidentally creates a portal that transports herself and Strange's corpse toEarth-616,[a]where that universe's version ofStephen Strangerescues Chavez from another demon[b]with help fromWong, theSorcerer Supreme. Chavez explains that the beings are hunting her because she has the power to travel through themultiverse.
Recognizing witchcraft runes on the demon, Strange consultsWanda Maximoffbut soon realizes that she is responsible for the attacks. After acquiring theDarkholdand becoming theScarlet Witch, Wanda believes that taking Chavez's powers and traveling through the multiverse will allow her to reunite withBillyandTommy, the children she created during her time inWestview.[c]When Strange refuses to surrender Chavez, Wanda attacksKamar-Tajand kills many sorcerers. Chavez accidentally transports herself and Strange toEarth-838. Wanda uses theDarkholdto "dreamwalk", taking control of her Earth-838 counterpart who lives a suburban life with her own Billy and Tommy. After a surviving sorceress, Sara, sacrifices herself to destroy theDarkholdand break the dreamwalk, an enraged Wanda forces Wong to lead her toMount Wundagore, the source of theDarkhold'spower, to reestablish the dreamwalk.
While searching for help, Strange and Chavez are apprehended by Earth-838's Sorcerer Supreme,Karl Mordo, and brought before theIlluminati, a group consisting of Mordo,Peggy Carter,Blackagar Boltagon,Maria Rambeau,Reed Richards, andCharles Xavier. They explain that through reckless use of their universe'sDarkholdin an attempt to defeatThanos,Earth-838's Strangetriggered a universe-destroying "incursion". After defeating Thanos, the Illuminati executed their Strange to prevent him from causing more harm. Mordo believes that Earth-616's Strange is similarly dangerous, but Wanda reestablishes her dreamwalk at Mount Wundagore and arrives in her Earth-838 counterpart's body before the Illuminati can pass judgment. She brutally kills all the Illuminati except Mordo, whom Strange subdues before fleeing with Chavez. The two escape with help from the Earth-838 version of Strange's ex-fiancé,Christine Palmer, a scientist working with the Illuminati.
Strange, Chavez, and Palmer enter the space between universes to find theBook of Vishanti, which is the antithesis of theDarkhold, but Wanda appears and destroys it. She then takes over Chavez's mind and uses her powers to send Strange and Palmer to an incursion-destroyed universe. Strange defeats the destroyed universe'sStrange, who has been corrupted by hisDarkhold, and then uses thatDarkholdto dreamwalk into the body of his deceased counterpart on Earth-616. With Wong's help, Strange saves Chavez from Wanda and encourages Chavez to use her abilities. Chavez transports Wanda to Earth-838, where she sees Billy and Tommy fearfully recoiling from her while crying for their real mother. Realizing her errors, Wanda relents and uses her powers to bring down Mount Wundagore, simultaneously destroying all copies of theDarkholdthroughout the multiverse and sacrificing herself in the process. Chavez returns Strange and Palmer to their respective universes.
Some time later, Kamar-Taj is under repair and the surviving sorcerers, joined by Chavez, continue training. Strange develops athird eyeas a result of using theDarkholdand dreamwalking into a corpse. In amid-credits scene, Strange is approached by a sorceress[d]who warns that his actions have triggered an incursion that he must help repair. Strange follows her into theDark Dimension.

Co-producerRichie Palmeralso voices one of the Souls of the Damned.[51]
Doctor Strange(2016) co-writerC. Robert Cargillstated in April 2016 thatMarvel Studiosfelt some initial ideas for the film from him and directorScott Derricksonhighlighted too much of the "weird stuff" associated with the comic book characterDoctor Strangeto feature in anorigin story, but told the duo to hold onto them for potential future films.[52]Derrickson revealed in October that he had plans for a sequel, expressing his love for the character and the visual possibilities that come with him. Derrickson said the first film was "the tip of an iceberg. There's so much progress that can be made." He wanted to follow the example ofThe Dark Knight(2008) and introduce a villain in the sequel that would allow them to "go deep [and have] a more visceral experience". StarBenedict Cumberbatchhad signed on for at least one more Doctor Strange film.[53]Derrickson expressed interest in featuring the villainNightmare,[54]and further exploring the charactersJonathan PangbornandHamirafter their small roles in the first film. He explained that he had been "kept in the loop" on how theAvengersfilms were using Strange due to his close relationships withJoe Russo—the co-director ofAvengers: Infinity War(2018) andAvengers: Endgame(2019)—and Marvel Studios presidentKevin Feige.[55]Doctor Strangeco-writerJon Spaihtsexpressed interest in seeing the characterCleaappear in a sequel.[56]In April 2017, Derrickson was reported to be returning for a sequel, beginning work after fulfilling his commitments to the television seriesLocke & Key(2020–2022).[57]
By December 2018, Derrickson had quietly finalized a deal to direct the sequel, with Cumberbatch,Benedict Wong, andRachel McAdamsreprising their respective roles of Dr.Stephen Strange,Wong, andChristine Palmer. Marvel was beginning to search for a writer,[9][58]withThe Hollywood Reporterstating that the script would be written throughout 2019 for a planned filming start in early 2020 and a potential release in May 2021.[9]Feige and Derrickson officially announced the sequel atSan Diego Comic-Conin July 2019, revealing the title to beDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madnessand confirming a release date of May 7, 2021.[19]Derrickson wanted the sequel to be the first scaryMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU) film and explore more of the gothic and horror elements from the comic books than the first installment did,[19][59]with co-producerRichie Palmerexplaining that the film would use themultiverseto explore "each definition of the word madness" and the idea that "the scariest monsters are the ones that dwell within us".[60]Feige revealed that theDisney+seriesWandaVision(2021) would directly set up the film, withElizabeth Olsenreprising her role ofWanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witchfrom the series.[19][61]Additionally, the concept of the multiverse was introduced to the MCU in thefirst seasonofLoki(2021),[62]and explored further in the filmSpider-Man: No Way Home(2021), which is set beforeMultiverse of Madnessand sees Cumberbatch reprising his role as Strange.[63][15]AfterLoki'sfirst-season finalewas released,Tom Hiddlestonwas reported to be reprising his role asLokiinMultiverse of Madness,[64]but ultimately did not appear.[65]
Jade Halley Bartlett, an "up-and-coming screenwriter", was hired to write the sequel's screenplay in October 2019.[66]Barlett said she had developed the film alongside Derrickson, Feige, and other Marvel Studios executivesLouis D'Esposito,Eric Hauserman Carroll, and Palmer for around a year, a process she felt was fun and exciting, and called the creative team scholars of the comic books. She was provided with a binder of everyDoctor Strangecomic book printed for reference to aid her writing.[67]In December, Feige described the multiverse as "the next step in the evolution of the MCU", and said this film would "crack it wide open" in a way that would have repercussions for the Disney+ series and the next films in Marvel Studios'Phase Fourslate.[68]Later in the month, he clarified that the sequel would not be a horror film, as some reports had described it following the Comic-Con announcement, but it would be a "big MCU film with scary sequences". Feige compared these sequences to the filmsRaiders of the Lost Ark(1981),Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom(1984),Gremlins(1984), andPoltergeist(1982), and said Derrickson was good at being "legitimately scary" due to his background making horror films. Feige also revealed that the film would introduce several surprising new characters to the MCU, including one that Marvel Studios had been looking for a way to use in an MCU film for some time;[69]this was later revealed to beAmerica Chavez, who was included because her powers are related to the multiverse.[34]Chavez's co-creatorJoe Caseywas not paid for the character's appearance in the film after he rejected a compensation offer fromMarvel Comicsthat he described as a "pittance".[70]
In January 2020, Marvel Studios and Derrickson announced that he would no longer direct the film due to creative differences. In separate statements, they both said they were thankful for their collaboration so far and Derrickson would remain an executive producer on the film.[71]This was not expected to delay filming, which was set for May 2020.[71][72]Cargill explained that he and Derrickson conceived a story that went in a different direction from what Marvel wanted,[73]and the pair had not yet written a draft of the screenplay so the final film would not be derivative of their work.[74]Derrickson said leaving the film was a difficult decision, but he did not want to compromise on a film that was different from what he wanted to make. His choice to leave was made easier by the fact that he was able to immediately begin work onThe Black Phone(2022), another film he wanted to make.[73]Cumberbatch was not consulted regarding the director change and said he was sad to hear about it, but he respected the decision and how it was handled.[75]Some reports suggested that Derrickson left the film because he wanted to make a "no-holds-barred weird, gnarly, scary movie" similar toA24's filmsThe Witch(2015) orHereditary(2018), and Marvel Studios did not want to go in that direction, but Feige denied this and said the studio loved that idea. He explained that it was their intention for the film to serve as a guide into a "much creepier side" of the MCU, even after Derrickson's departure,[76]and they wanted to explore the "mind-bending frightening side" of the multiverse.[77]
Sam Raimientered negotiations to take over as director by early February.[31]At that time,Chiwetel Ejioforwas expected to reprise his role asKarl Mordo, McAdams was no longer expected to appear,[31]andMichael Waldronwas hired to rewrite the film's script after serving as thehead writerofLoki'sfirst season.[78][79]Raimi signed on to direct the film a few weeks later.[12]He had been reluctant to direct another Marvel superhero film after the mixed critical reaction toSpider-Man 3(2007),[80]feeling that he needed a break from that genre,[81]but he accepted the job because of the challenge of getting the film into production right away and because he was a fan of the Doctor Strange character and Derrickson's work on the first film.[80][81]Raimi was curious how making big-budgeted films had changed since his prior film,Oz the Great and Powerful(2013), and he also had to familiarize himself with the existing MCU storylines and characters for the film.[81]Waldron had three weeks to write a new script draft based on the work done by Derrickson and Bartlett. He said this was "almost impossible",[82]and Raimi felt "very rushed and panicked" trying to meet the May 2020 production start date.[83]TheCOVID-19 pandemicbegan to impact film productions during those first three weeks,[82]and pre-production started taking place remotely.[84]Filming was initially still on track to begin in May 2020,[72]until Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the pandemic, movingMultiverse of Madness'srelease date to November 5, 2021.[85]Raimi was relieved by this delay,[83]which allowed him and Waldron to start writing the script from scratch in a reasonable time, and make the film their own.[82][86]Bartlett had written a draft before the COVID-19 pandemic and said that Raimi and Waldron's version was different from the one she developed with Derrickson.[67]
Waldron watched the director'sSpider-Manfilms(2002–2007) so he could identify Raimi's strengths and write toward them.[87]He describedMultiverse of Madnessas Raimi's return to "big superhero movies", and said it would have every aspect of a Sam Raimi film,[88]including a "slightly scarier direction" which he felt Raimi had a strong track record with.[86][88]Palmer said Waldron's work introducing the multiverse inLokiallowed Marvel Studios to "jump into telling a good story" without having to re-explain those ideas for the audience, and helped bring "a lot of heart to [the] sci-fi concepts".[89]Waldron also used his experience from writing the seriesRick and Morty(2013–present), which helped him "introduce these big sci-fi concepts in ways that were digestible, palatable to the audience and without getting them bogged down in the boring details".[90]Rather than just expanding the stakes of the film, Waldron saw the multiverse as the "emotional heart" of the story that could be used in personal ways, such as using "what ifs" and alternate versions of characters to reflect on the film's protagonists, and exploring the characters' right or wrong choices through their alternate versions. Waldron watchedDoctor Strangeseveral times, saying he became a "student" of that film, to understand Strange's story in the original. He also looked at how the character had developed through his other MCU appearances,[91]and Raimi praised how Waldron's imagination and knowledge of Marvel history contributed to the script.[83]The creative team saw early production work for the animated seriesWhat If...?(2021–present) to learn how Strange was portrayed in that series.[92]
Waldron described Wanda as "the biggest best bullet" that they had,[93]and said she was destined to become a villain in the MCU, as she did in the comics, especially after the end ofWandaVisionrevealed "to her that the family she's built is not real. Then she gets theDarkhold... and learns that there is a real version of her children out there. And if you've got the Book of the Damned whispering in your ear long enough that your kids are out there and you could go get 'em, maybe that can push you to do some terrible things."[82]If she became a villain at the end of the film, he knew another project would get to have the "fun" of using her as a villain. He also wanted to avoid the film getting "overstuffed" by adding a different multiverse-related villain such asJonathan Majors'sKang the Conqueror,[93]and felt that this would create a "watered-down version of Wanda [who] wouldn't be the protagonist, and she wouldn't really be the antagonist".[82]Olsen was hesitant about playing the villain after believing that she would just be "in an ensemble thing", but she came to feel that the combination ofWandaVisionandMultiverse of Madnessallowed her to create a sympathetic character in the series who the audience would therefore have conflicted feelings about when seeing the film.[23]Waldron worked closely with Olsen andWandaVisionhead writerJac Schaefferto ensure Wanda's story was a satisfying continuation of the series,[72]while Raimi also studied the series despite not fully seeing it, particularly key moments that directly impacted their plans for the film, to make sure the film maintained "a proper through line and character-growth dynamic" for her character.[83]It was important to Olsen that the film not repeat what was done inWandaVisionand instead be an evolution of the character, and she requested several adjustments to the script to avoid moments that she found too similar to the series. To justify the many killings that Wanda commits in the film, Olsen focused on the character's perspective of those people being in her way and not listening to her after the loss of her children in the series.[23]
After a planned appearance by Cumberbatch inWandaVisionwas removed late in the development of the series, rewrites to theMultiverse of Madnessscript were required which Feige described as a "wonderful combination of very dedicated coordination, and chaos".[94]These changes include how Strange and Wanda meet in the film.[7]The story ofMultiverse of Madnessis still set up byWandaVision, but the film was developed to also work for viewers who did not watch the series.[95]For consistency with theDarkhold'sappearance, the film's props department designed the prop that was used forWandaVisionand then reused it for the film.[96]While writing his first draft, Waldron felt the film needed to "get drunk [and] find the madness in the multiverse" by introducing alternate universe versions of known Marvel characters. This led to the introduction of theIlluminati, asecret societyfrom the comics. Waldron had been watching the filmAliens(1986) as inspiration for the script's thriller tone, and enjoyed how the "badass" space marines "just get slaughtered" by the titular aliens to set the latter up as scarier villains for the rest of that film. He wanted to do something similar with Wanda by introducing the Illuminati as a group of characters that fans would be excited to see and then have Wanda kill them all. The idea of Strange taking control of a dead body for the end of the film came from Waldron and Palmer discussing how he would be able to confront Wanda from a different universe, with the corpse of another version of Strange having been already established at the start of the film. Raimi, Feige, and Cumberbatch were all excited about the idea, despite Raimi initially wanting to avoid azombiesequence to not repeat what he had done previously with zombie films.[82]
The film's release was shifted again at the end of April 2020, this time to March 25, 2022, afterSony PicturesrescheduledNo Way Hometo the November 2021 date.[97]Until then, Waldron had been writing the script expectingMultiverse of Madnessto be released beforeNo Way Home. He was in contact withNo Way HomewritersChris McKennaandErik Sommersthroughout the writing process, and after the release date change they adjusted their respective scripts so instead ofMultiverse of Madness"blowing the lid on the multiverse" it would pick up afterNo Way Homewith Strange already having multiverse experience. This change had a "knock-down effect" on the rest of the script.[93]There had been early plans to include Strange's new costume fromMultiverse of Madnessand America Chavez inNo Way Home,[98][70]while a brief cameo ofSpider-Manwas planned forMultiverse of Madness, but the pandemic ultimately prevented those plans from coming to fruition.[98]Raimi noted that whereNo Way Homesaw characters from other universes enter the MCU,Multiverse of Madnessfeatures characters from the MCU entering the multiverse and exploring different universes.[26]Ejiofor confirmed his involvement in June,[99]andXochitl Gomezjoined the cast in October.[100]Cumberbatch revealed that month that filming would start in London by the beginning of November,[101][102]with the production not impacted by a national lockdown in England that was set for November 5 to December 2due to increased COVID-19 cases.[103]
Principal photographybegan in November 2020 in London,[104][105]under theworking titleStellar Vortex.[106]Filming was delayed from an initial May 2020 start date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[72]Olsen began filming her scenes by November 25,[105]shootingback-to-backwithWandaVision,[107]and found it odd to transition from the series back to starring in an MCU film.[108][109]At the beginning of December, filming was taking place atLongcross StudiosinLongcross, Surrey,[110]where several New York City blocks and sets for the Sanctum Sanctorum were built by production designer Charlie Woods.[111]McAdams soon signed on to return as Palmer,[37]shortly before Feige officially confirmed her involvement on December 10 along with that of Ejiofor, Wong, and Gomez. He also revealed that Gomez would portray America Chavez.[112][113]Cumberbatch had begun filming his scenes by then, after completing his work onNo Way Home.[105][114][115]He said the film was more collaborative than his previous MCU appearances, for which he felt like he was "just along for the ride".[116]
Many of the actors, including Olsen,[117]Cumberbatch,[75]and Wong, were excited to be working with Raimi.[118]The director said many "dimensionalized visuals" were used during shooting to tell the film's story,[77]as he was able to use his preferred camera techniques such as using the camera and perspective to create a feeling of anxiety for audiences.[117][75][119]John Mathiesonserved as cinematographer,[12]and shot the film withPanavision DXL2IMAX-certified cameras.[120]Raimi encouraged improvisation,[75][118]explaining that the cast could adapt their interactions due to their knowledge of their own characters and that the script often changed shortly before filming for those scenes began.[121]The ending of the film was still "up in the air" when filming began, and Cumberbatch said it took some time for the team to decide on one that tied together all of the characters' stories.[122]Waldron explained that they felt the ending was too happy following all the "bad shit" that occurs in the film and wanted to show that Strange would suffer consequences for his actions—including possessing the corpse of a different version of himself—which tied into Mordo's warning from the first film: "The bill comes due." This led to them adding the ending scene where Strange develops a third eye in his forehead, and Waldron felt this was the sort of twist that horror films often end on.[82]Elaborating on that tone, Olsen said they were going for a "horror show vibe",[123]comparing it to Raimi'sEvil Deadfilms with aspects of the horror genre such as "constant fear". She felt it was "more than a glossyIndiana Jonesmovie" and would be darker than those films,[124][119]with Raimi trying to make "the scariest Marvel movie"[108][109]and create "as much tension for the audience" as possible.[77]
Olsen shot for three weeks before pandemic restrictions increased near the end of December due to asurge of COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom, with another lockdown in England announced from January 6, 2021.[125][126]The scenes of Scarlet Witch massacring the Illuminati were shot at theBritish Museumof London, with Marvel usingCGIto add a new room with a glass entrance and a few statues for the background.[127]Filming resumed in early 2021, and at some point, Cumberbatch had to temporarily pause filming after being in close contact with a member of the production who had a false positive test.[75]In mid-March, Cumberbatch said they were in the middle of production,[114]and Ejiofor had begun filming his scenes in London by then.[128]Filming occurred at Broomfield Hill Car Park inRichmond Parkfor the week of March 25.[129]Shooting took place atFreemasons' Hall, London, for a few weeks in April.[130]On April 15, Feige said they were in the final week of filming,[131]with shooting taking place from that day until April 17 atBurrow Hill Cider Farmin Somerset.Jett KlyneandJulian Hilliard, who respectively portrayed Wanda's sonsTommyandBillyinWandaVision, were reportedly on set at the farm,[132]and were confirmed to be in the film in April 2022.[133]
Bob MurawskiandTia Nolanco-edited the film.[134]Some additional photography had been completed by mid-September 2021,[135]with Olsen and Wong completing their work.[135][118]The film was once again delayed in October, this time to May 6, 2022.[136]Later that month, Cumberbatch said they were in the middle of more additional photography, with further reshoots set for November and December,[137]over at least six weeks in Los Angeles.The Hollywood Reportersaid this photography was "significant" and included two weeks dedicated to filming that could not be completed during principal photography because of actor availability issues and COVID-related slowdowns.[138]Cumberbatch confirmed the reshoots were being used to make adjustments to already shot material, while also filming parts that "were just impossible to do [during principal photography] because of logistics, COVID etc."[139]The Hollywood Reporterlater reported that the reshoots would allow the film to have "more fun with the multiverse" by adding more cameo appearances and variants of established characters, similar toNo Way Homeand the first season ofLoki.[140]The film's teaser trailer was released in late December and confirmed the involvement ofMichael StuhlbargasNicodemus West, reprising his role fromDoctor Strange.[36]It also revealed that Cumberbatch would portray multiple versions of Strange in the film.[15]The reshoots reportedlywrappedduring the week of December 13,[140]but additional filming continued in early January 2022. The latter was completed on January 8.[141]By the end of the month, Raimi had assembled a cut of the film that would be presented to test audiences, and said there was potential for more reshoots to occur if the test screenings found that clarification or improvement were needed;[142]Cumberbatch was working on further reshoots in the United Kingdom by March 13.[143]
Patrick Stewart, who portrayedCharles Xavier / Professor Xin theX-Menfilm series, was revealed to be appearing in the film in an undisclosed role with the release of the full trailer in February 2022;[144][16]Stewart was believed to be reprising the role of Xavier,[145]which had previously been the subject of speculation.[16]A poster for the film, released at the same time, additionally teased the inclusion ofPeggy Carter / Captain Carter, a character who was introduced inWhat If...?.[146]Stewart initially denied that he was in the film,[147]but soon admitted that he was.[148]The trailer also revealed that Topo Wresniwiro would reprise his role ofHamirfromDoctor Strange.[44][43]A creature resembling prominent Doctor Strange villainShuma-Gorathappears in the film, but it is given the nameGargantos, which comes from a different comic book character, because the rights to the name Shuma-Gorath belong toHeroic Signatures.[6]Gargantos' eye was modeled after that of Olsen's to foreshadow her role as the film's antagonist.[149]The cosmic entity theLiving Tribunalalso makes a brief appearance.[150]Discussing Stewart's involvement, as well as assumptions based on the trailer that the Illuminati would be appearing in the film, Palmer said returning actors would not necessarily be portraying characters that had been seen before, and if Marvel Studios were to introduce the Illuminati they would do a "more MCU-driven" version of the group.[151]
The Illuminati's appearance was officially confirmed in March;[152]and the team features actors portraying new versions of their characters from previous projects: Stewart plays anew version of Xavierthat combines elements from his previous performances, including a line of dialogue fromX-Men: Days of Future Past(2014), with elements fromX-Men: The Animated Series(1992–1997);[153]Ejiofor plays a new version of Mordo;Hayley Atwellportrays Captain Carter after voicing theWhat If...?version;Lashana Lynchplays a different version ofMaria Rambeau / Captain Marvelfrom the one she portrayed inCaptain Marvel(2019); andAnson Mountportrays an alternate version ofBlackagar Boltagon / Black Boltfrom his role inMarvel's ABC television seriesInhumans(2017). Also in the group isJohn KrasinskiasFantastic FourmemberReed Richards. Krasinski had been a popular suggestion for the role by fans for some time, especially since the announcement of anewFantastic Fourfilmset in the MCU.[27]When Lynch was approached to return, she assumed she would be playing an ancestor of Rambeau and was surprised to learn she would be an alternate version of Captain Marvel.[154]The Illuminati sequence was filmed in pieces, with many of the actors not being on set together. Krasinski's footage was filmed during reshoots to replace a planned cameo appearance byDaniel Craig, who chose not to film the role because he did not believe a single day of filming was worth the risk of catching COVID-19 and spreading it to his family.[155][156]Craig was reportedly set to portray the characterBalder the Bravein the scene.[155]Olsen did not meet Krasinski while shooting the scene in which Scarlet Witch kills Richards, and she instead filmed the scene with astand-in.[157]Due to safety protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Stewart and other leading actors filmed their scenes in isolation without other actors present, which he found to be frustrating and disappointing.[158]
Waldron said the final line-up of the Illuminati was similar to the one in his first draft,[82]but with some other suggestions coming from Feige. Waldron considered includingNamor, a member of the Illuminati in the comics, but Marvel Studios did not allow the character to appear in any MCU projects before the filmBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever(2022), in which he was played byTenoch Huerta;[153][159]Waldron's first draft also included an Earth-838 counterpart ofEvangeline Lilly'sHope van Dyne / The Waspas a member of the Illuminati, who would have been killed by Wanda clapping her hands to kill her.[160]Storyboardsby artist Soren Bendt for the Illuminati massacre scene suggest that, in addition to Balder the Brave, an Earth-838 counterpart ofObadiah Stane / Iron Monger, who was previously portrayed byJeff BridgesinIron Man(2008), was also considered for the group's lineup.[161]There were also rumors thatTom Cruisewould be portraying an alternate version ofTony Stark / Iron Manknown asSuperior Iron Manin the film after being in contention for the role back in the 1990s beforeRobert Downey Jr.was cast as thetitle characterin 2006. Waldron expressed interest in the idea, but Cruise was never approached due to his filming schedule forMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning(2023) andMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning(2025).[82]Other rumors about potential cameos included an appearance ofRyan Reynoldsreprising his role asWade Wilson / Deadpoolfrom Fox'sDeadpool(2016) andDeadpool 2(2018);[162]Waldron confirmed there had been discussions about bringing Reynolds in to play Deadpool before they decided that the film was not "the right place" to feature him.[163]Another character introduced in the film is Clea, withCharlize Theroncast in the role. Waldron said they wanted to include her in the film but felt they needed to resolve Strange's relationship with Christine Palmer first, so the character's introduction was saved for themid-credits sceneto set her up as a potential new love interest in a future story.[41]
Industrial Light & Magic(ILM),Digital Domain,Framestore,Luma Pictures, Capital T,Sony Pictures Imageworks,Wētā FX,Trixter, Crafty Apes, andPerceptionworked on the visual effects of the film,[164][165]in which an estimated 2,000 VFX shots were created.[166]Framestore worked on the multiverse jumping sequence with Strange and Chavez, while Luma Pictures worked on the Gargantos fight scene.[164]Perception also designed the film's main-on-end title sequence, which employs colorfulRorschach testvisuals because Raimi wanted the sequence to "both complement and contrast the film".[167]Animators fromDisneyworked to create another version of theWalt Disney ProductionsfilmSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs(1937), with a different color palette, for a scene inMultiverse of Madness.[168]Graham Churchyard served as costume designer and created most of the costumes for the film, except for those worn by Black Bolt and Richards, both of which could not be completed in time due totravel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. They were created through visual effects instead.[169]In late August 2022, Waldron revealed that one of the first drafts of the film's script included a post-credits scene involving a seemingly alive Richards, but the idea was scrapped.[170]Another draft of the script included a scene of Strange meeting a variant of himself named Melvin, who would have been depicted as astreet magicianwith no mystical abilities.[168]Gomez noted that Marvel asked for numerous rewrites of the script from Waldron.[171]
Doctor StrangecomposerMichael Giacchinowas set to return for the sequel by October 2019, when Derrickson was set as director.[172]After Raimi took over,Danny Elfmanwas hired as composer; Elfman previously worked with Raimi onDarkman(1990),A Simple Plan(1998),Spider-Man(2002),Spider-Man 2(2004), andOz the Great and Powerful(2013).[173]By February 2021, Elfman had begun working on music to be used during filming, but would not begin work on the actual score for several months.[173]In January 2022, Elfman said he was completing work on the score,[174]including conducting an orchestra atAbbey Road Studiosin London.[174][83]Elfman's frequent collaboratorSteve Bartekworked on the score remotely overZoom.[174]A soundtrack album featuring Elfman's score was released digitally byHollywood RecordsandMarvel Musicon May 4,[175]with three "spoiler tracks" that were excluded from the initial release being made available on May 20.[176]
Elfman referenced Giacchino'sDoctor Strangetheme in a similar way to how he usedAlan Silvestri's theme fromThe Avengers(2012) when working onAvengers: Age of Ultron(2015).[177]The score also features the song "WandaVision!" byKristen Anderson-LopezandRobert Lopez, from theWandaVisionepisode "Don't Touch That Dial", when Wanda is first introduced; Silvestri's "Captain America March" theme fromCaptain America: The First Avenger(2011) for Atwell's Captain Carter appearance;[178]and the main theme fromX-Men '97bythe Newton Brothers, which is an updated version of the main theme fromX-Men: The Animated Seriescomposed byRon Wasserman, for the introduction of Xavier. For legal reasons, the latter theme is credited toThe Animated Seriesmusic executivesHaim SabanandShuki Levy.[178][179]
Ateaser trailerfor the film was played after the end credits ofSpider-Man: No Way Home,[15]before being released online on December 22, 2021.[180]Matt Webb Mitovich ofTVLinecalled it a "rousing, thrilling trailer" and noted the ending that revealed an alternate version of Strange. He believed this wasDoctor Strange Supreme, an alternate version of the character introduced inWhat If...?.[181]Inverse'sAlex Welch felt it was a "suitably psychedelic teaser, full of revelations and fun moments that should leave Marvel fans gobsmacked", and suggested the film would tie together "many of the multiversal threads left hanging" fromNo Way Home,WandaVision, and the first seasons ofLokiandWhat If...?.[182]Writing forDecider, Alex Zalben believed the film was a "direct result" ofWhat If...?, which "instantly mak[es] the animated series far more important than Marvel fans might have originally realized".[183]James Grebey atSyfy Wiresaid there was "a very ominous aura to the whole trailer".[184]Daniel Chin ofThe Ringerfelt the trailer had "creepy imagery" and that it was "expected to separate itself from other Marvel projects even further by weaving in horror elements", while also noting how the film won't have to introduce the multiverse, and can instead explore it even further, and also how it'll be the "first real attempt to blend existing story lines from its Disney+ series with its big-screen properties", while he thought made it the "first major crossover event in Phase 4".[185]Also in December, merchandise began to be made available with the reveal ofMarvel Legendsfigures based on the film.[186]
A teaser aired duringSuper Bowl LVIon February 13, 2022, with the full-length trailer debuting online afterward.[16]Justin Carter atGizmodohighlighted how the trailer continued the first film's "visually trippy" approach to alternate dimensions while adding more horror elements, and was also excited by the brief appearance of America Chavez,[144]while his colleague Germain Lussier felt, compared to the teaser, the trailer "raised the stakes exponentially with all manner of wild revelations and images".[187]Entertainment Weekly'sDevan Coggan also felt the trailer was "trippy" and added that it "seems to have more in common with Raimi's iconic horror films".[188]The Verge'sCharles Pulliam-Moore said the trailer did a better job conveying the film's plot than the teaser, and he felt the film would be the "culmination ofallthe big-picture troubles" teased inWandaVisionandLoki.[189]Many commentators noted the revelation of Patrick Stewart's involvement in the trailer and the implication he could reprise hisX-Menrole of Charles Xavier / Professor X,[144][16][190][145]which led to speculation thatMultiverse of Madnesswould introduce the MCU version of the Illuminati.[191][192][193][194]RelishMix reported that the trailer had 93.12 million views in 24 hours acrossFacebook,Twitter,YouTube, andInstagram, which was the top trailer among those airing during the Super Bowl according to their metrics.

In April 2022,The Hollywood Reporterconfirmed that the film would not be released in Saudi Arabia due to the inclusion of America Chavez, a gay character, giventhe region's censorship of LGBTQ references.[212]Nawaf Alsabhan, Saudi Arabia's general supervisor of cinema classification, said the film had not been banned from the country but revealed that Disney was "not willing" to grant their request of cutting "barely 12 seconds" of a scene in which Chavez refers to her "two moms".[213]The film had been set to release in severalPersian Gulfcountries on May 5, before advanced tickets were removed from cinema websites in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar. Tickets were still available in the United Arab Emirates, whichThe Hollywood Reporterstated was an indication that the film could still be released there.[212]IMAX Corporationalso confirmed that the film would not be released in Egypt.[214]Cumberbatch was disappointed by the countries' decisions to not release the film, saying: "We've come to know from those repressive regimes that their lack of tolerance is exclusionary to people who deserve to be not only included, but celebrated for who they are and made to feel part of a society and a culture and not punished for their sexuality. It feels truly out of step with everything that we've experienced as a species, let alone where we're at globally more as a culture, but frankly, it's just even more reason why this isn't tokenism to include an LGBTQ+ community member".[215]Deadline Hollywoodreported in late April that the film was unlikely to be released in China after a newspaper box forThe Epoch Times, a newspaper that opposes theChinese Communist Party(CCP), was noticed in the film's trailer. It had been submitted for review to Chinese officials by that time.[216]In mid-May, Disney CEOBob Chapeksaid the situation was complicated but noted that the film was already commercially successful without a release in China.[217]

The 67% decline was attributed byDeadline Hollywoodto the "bad word of mouth" on the film and its CinemaScore grade, while EntTelligence saw more than 17% downsize of available seats for the film, resulting in fewer showtimes which also led to the decline.[227]In its third weekend, the film grossed $31.6million.[228]The film grossed $17million in its fourth weekend for a running total of $376.1million, passingThe Batman's $369.3million to become the highest-grossing film of 2022 (later surpassed byTop Gun: Maverick).[229][230]It ended up being thefourth highest-grossing film of 2022in this region.[231]

During what is known as Marvel's "Timely era",Captain Americawas licensed out toRepublic Picturesfora 1944 serial filmonly for the free advertising. Timely failed to provide any drawing of Captain America withhis shieldor any further background, and Republic created a whole new background for the character and portrayed the character using a gun.[11]From the late 1970s through the early 1990s,Marvel Comics GroupandMarvel Entertainment Group(MEG) sold options to studios to produce films based onMarvel Comics characters. One of Marvel's superheroes,Spider-Man, was optioned in the late 1970s, and rights reverted to Marvel without a film having been produced within the allocated time frame. From 1986 to 1996, most of Marvel's major characters were optioned, including theFantastic Four,X-Men,Daredevil, theHulk,Silver Surfer, andIron Man.[12]Marvel's first big-screen adaptation of one of its properties was the 1986 filmHoward the Duck,[13]which was abox-office bomb.[14]MEG was purchased byNew World Entertainmentin November 1986[15]and moved to produce films based on the Marvel characters. It releasedThe Punisher(1989) before MEG was sold toRonald Perelman'sAndrews Group. Two other films were produced:Captain America(1990) released in the United Kingdom on screens and direct to video in the United States, andThe Fantastic Four(1994), not intended for release.[16]
After MEG acquiredToyBizin 1993,Avi Aradof ToyBiz was named president and chief executive officer (CEO) of both the Marvel Films division andNew World Family Filmworks, aNew World Entertainmentsubsidiary. New World was MEG's former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group.[17][18]Marvel ProductionsbecameNew World Animationby 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films, includingMarvel Films Animation.[17][19][20]Marvel Films Animation sharedTom Tataranowiczwith New World Animation as head of development and production.[21]New World Animation (The Incredible Hulk),Saban(X-Men: The Animated Series) and Marvel Films Animation (Spider-Man) each produced a Marvel series for television for the 1996–1997 season.[22][20][23]By the end of 1993, Arad and20th Century Foxstruck a deal to make a film based on theX-Men.[24]In August 1996, New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation were sold along with the rest of New World by the Andrews Group toNews Corporationand theFox Entertainment Group. As part of the deal, Marvel licensed the rights to Captain America, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer to be on theFox Kids Networkand produced by Saban. New World Animation continued producing a second season ofThe Incredible HulkforUPN.[22][25]
On August 7, 1996, Marvel Studios was created by Marvel. Filing with theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionto raise money to finance the new corporation, Marvel,Isaac Perlmutter's Zib, Inc. and Avi Arad sold ToyBiz stocks.[12][26]ToyBiz filed an offering of 7.5 million shares with a closing price of $20.125 at the time, making the offering worth approximately $150 million. ToyBiz sought to sell 1 million shares.[27]Jerry Calabrese, the president of Marvel Entertainment Group, and Avi Arad, head of Marvel Films and a director of ToyBiz, were assigned tandem control of Marvel Studios. Under Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to controlpre-productionby commissioning scripts, hiring directors, and casting characters, providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution. Arad said of the goal for control, "When you get into business with a big studio, they are developing a hundred or 500 projects; you get totally lost. That isn't working for us. We're just not going to do it anymore. Period."[12]Marvel Studios arranged a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox to cover markets in the United States and internationally.[28]
In December 1996, Marvel Entertainment Group underwent aChapter 11 bankruptcyreorganization plan, including Marvel Studios as part of its strategic investment.[29]By 1997, Marvel Studios was actively pursuing various film productions based on Marvel characters, including the eventual filmsX-Men(2000),Daredevil(2003),Elektra(2005), andFantastic Four(2005). Unproduced projects includedPrince Namor, based on the characterNamorand to be directed byPhilip Kaufman, andMort the Dead Teenager, based on the comic book of the same name and written by John Payson andMortcreatorLarry Hama.[30]Marvel's Captain America animated series with Saban Entertainment for Fox Kids Network was set to premiere in late 1998. However, due to the bankruptcy, the series was canceled after only character designs and a one-minute promotional reel were made.[31][32][33]
The first film packaged and licensed by Marvel Studios wasBlade(1998), based on the vampire hunterBlade. The film was directed byStephen Norringtonand starredWesley SnipesasBlade. It was released on August 21, 1998, grossing $70,087,718 in the United States and Canada and $131,183,530 worldwide.[34]Bladewas followed byX-Men, which was directed byBryan Singerand was released on July 14, 2000.X-Mengrossed $157,299,717 in the United States and Canada and $296,250,053 worldwide.[35]BladeandX-Mendemonstrated that widely popular films could be made out of comic book characters not familiar to the general public.[36]Leading up toX-Men'srelease, Marvel Studios negotiated a deal with then-functionalArtisan Entertainment, successful with the low-budgetThe Blair Witch Project, for a co-production joint venture that included rights to 15 Marvel characters including Captain America,Thor(as a television series),Black Panther(with Snipes attached to produce and star),Deadpool,Iron Fist,Morbius, the Living Vampire,Longshot,Power Pack,Mort the Dead Teenager,Ant-Man,[37]and thePunisher.[38]Artisan would finance and distribute while Marvel would develop licensing and merchandising tie-ins. The resulting production library, which would also include television series, direct-to-video films, and internet projects, would be co-owned.[37]By 2001, the success of Marvel Entertainment'sUltimate Marvelimprint comics created leverage in Hollywood for Marvel Studios, pushing more properties into development.[39]
The next film licensed from Marvel Studios wasSpider-Man(2002) byColumbia Pictures, directed bySam Raimiand starringTobey MaguireasSpider-Man. The film was released on May 3, 2002, grossing $403,706,375 in the United States and Canada and $821,708,551 worldwide.[42]The early success ofSpider-Manled the film's studio to issue a seven-figure advance for a sequel. Arad spoke of the deal, "Movies make sequels. Therefore, it's a big economic luxury to know that a movie's going to get a second and third. This is a business of precedence."[43]According to aLehman Brothersanalysis, Marvel Studios made only $62 million for the first twoSpider-Manfilms.[44]Marvel was making more from half the consumer product licensing fees while making relatively little from the films, but it was enough for Marvel to regain its financial footing.[41]In October 2002, Marvel Studios announced deals for the Sub-Mariner andPrimewithUniversal Pictures.[45]
In contrast to the original storylines ofDC Comics'SupermanandBatmanfilms, Marvel films often emphasized more fidelity to its comics, applying set pieces, scenes, plots, and dialogue drawn from them.[36]In 2003,David Maiselapproached Arad about earning Marvel more for its films. Maisel, Arad, and Perlmutter met, leading to Maisel being hired as president andchief operating officer(COO). The studio's office was small onSanta Monica Boulevard, with around a dozen staff members.Kevin Feige, who later became the president of Marvel Studios, was then a junior executive generating script notes for the licensed studios.[41]In January 2003, Marvel, theSci-Fi Channel, andReveille Productionsagreed to develop two pilot films based onBrother VoodooandStrikeforce: Morituri.[46]In December 2003,Lionsgatepurchased Artisan Entertainment and they decided to let all of the character rights Artisan held, except Punisher, revert to Marvel.[47][48]: 279Marvel Studios partnered with Lionsgate in 2004 to produce eight animated films, calledMarvel Animated Features, for the direct-to-DVD market withLionsgate Home Entertainmenthandling distribution.[49][50]The line was a proof of concept for Maisel's later plan.[41]Eric Rollman was hired by Marvel as Executive Vice President of home entertainment & TV production for Marvel Studios to oversee the deal with Lionsgate.[51]
Maisel was hired in 2004 as president and chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self-finance its films.[40][41]Marvel entered into anon-recourse debtstructure withMerrill Lynchthat was collateralized by certainfilm rightsto a total of ten characters from Marvel's vast vault. Marvel received $525 million to make a maximum of ten films based on the company's properties over eight years, according to the parameters of the original deal. Those characters wereAnt-Man,the Avengers, Black Panther, Captain America,Cloak & Dagger,Doctor Strange,Hawkeye,Nick Fury,Power Pack, andShang-Chi.[52]Ambacinsured the films would succeed or they would pay the interest payment on the debt and get the film rights as collateral.[44]Initially, Marvel Studios was in talks with Universal Pictures as a possible distributor, because Universal owned the film rights to both the Hulk and Namor during that time.[53][54]Negotiations dragged on, so the studio began talks withParamount Pictures. In the second quarter of 2005, Merrill attempted to back out of full financing of each film, demanding that Marvel finance one-third of the budget. Marvel took back rights in five foreign territories from Paramount for pre-sell to meet that demand.[41]In September 2005, Marvel announced the Merrill Lynch financing deal with Paramount was on as marketer and distributor. Marvel Studios' parent company Marvel Enterprises, Inc. then changed its name toMarvel Entertainment, Inc.to reflect the change to self-production.[52]
The studio moved to a new location over aMercedes-Benzdealership inBeverly Hills, California. Maisel was also named vice-chairman of the studio, but reported to Marvel Entertainment CEOIsaac Perlmutter.[41]In November 2005,Michael Helfantjoined the studio as president and chief operating officer.[55]Also that month, Marvel gained the film rights to Iron Man fromNew Line Cinema. Marvel then revealed that it had regained the film rights to the Hulk from Universal in February 2006,[56]in exchange for letting Universal own the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulk(2008) and the right of first refusal to pick up the distribution rights to any future Marvel Studios-producedHulkfilms.[57]In April 2006, Thor was announced to be a Marvel Studios production,[58]while Lions Gate Entertainment subsequently dropped theBlack Widowfilm it had in development since 2004 and returned the rights to Marvel.[59]
Maisel and Arad fought over the rate of film releases and the strength of characters in the film lineup. Perlmutter supported Maisel and thus, in May 2006, Arad quit as studio chair and CEO.[40][60]In March 2007, Helfant was "forced out" of the studio while Maisel was named chairman and Kevin Feige was named president of production to replace Helfant asIron Man(2008) began filming.[61][62]In January 2008,Marvel Animationwas incorporated to direct Marvel's efforts in animation and home entertainment markets including then animation efforts with Lionsgate andNickelodeon.[51]In March, the company agreed to a five-picture basic cable distribution withFXfor the filmsIron ManandThe Incredible Hulk, with additional films to be named later.[63]Following the successful opening weekend ofIron Manin May 2008, Maisel had his contract extended through 2010 and Feige was promoted to president of Marvel Studios.[64]In November, Marvel Studios signed a lease withRaleigh Studiosto host its headquarters and production offices and film the next four films on the studios' slate, includingIron Man 2(2010) andThor(2011), at itsManhattan Beach Studios Media Campusfacilities.[65]By September 2008, Paramount added five additional Marvel films' foreign distribution to its domestic film distribution contract.[66]
In 2009, producer Stephen Broussard was tasked with forming a writers program for the studio. The writers were hired for a year to be on call to do emergency script polishes for films in production,[48]: 165as well as develop scripts based on some lesser-known properties, such as Black Panther,Cable, Iron Fist,Nighthawk, andVision.[48]: 165[67]Writers included: Edward Ricourt, who was encouraged to write a script forLuke Cageas it was of high interest to the studio;[48]: 165Nicole Perlman, who chose to write a script based on the2008 Guardians of the Galaxy team;[48]: 167Christopher Yost, who was asked to pitch a Black Panther film for his interview,[48]: 166and took interest in writing scripts about theThunderbolts,Power Pack, andBrian Braddock / Captain Britain;[48]: 173Joe Robert Cole, who initially pitched aWar Machinefilm before joining the writers program where he created scripts for theInhumans;[48]: 169andEric Pearson, who was asked to pitch aCloak and Daggerfilm and also worked to rewrite a Luke Cage script.[48]: 171After Broussard moved on to the production ofCaptain America: The First Avenger(2011), Marvel Studios hired Nate Moore to oversee the writers program, who at times was assisted by the also newly hired executive Jodi Hildebrand. Particular properties Feige was interested in having screenplays for were Black Panther, Iron Fist, and Blade.[48]: 167–168, 171The program was shut down in 2014 before being revived in 2016.[48]: 172In early 2009,Sonyreturned all Spider-Man television rights (including live-action) in exchange for an adjustment to the film rights.[68]
On August 31, 2009,the Walt Disney Companyannounced that it had reached a deal to acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion.[69]The deal was completed on December 31, with Marvel Entertainment becoming a subsidiary of Disney.[70]Both Marvel and Disney stated that the merger would not affect any pre-existing deals with other film studios for the time being,[71]although Disney said they would distribute future Marvel projects withits own studioonce the deals expired.[72]Maisel stepped down from the studio following the sale to Disney.[73]In April 2010, rumors circulated that Marvel was looking to create $20–40 million films based on properties such as Doctor Strange,Ka-Zar, Luke Cage,Dazzler, and Power Pack.[74]Feige responded by saying, while budgets are generally never discussed early in development, Marvel was considering films for all characters mentioned in the rumor, except Dazzler, whose rights were at Fox.[75]
In June 2010, Marvel Entertainment set up a television division within Marvel Studios calledMarvel Televisionto be headed up byJeph Loebas Executive Vice President,[76]under which Marvel Animation would be operated.[77]In October,Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesacquired the distribution rights forThe Avengers(2012) andIron Man 3(2013) from Paramount Pictures[78]with Paramount's logo and credit remaining on those films.[79]In August 2011, at Disney's behest, the studio dismissed most of its marketing department, including EVP of Worldwide Marketing Dana Precious, VP of Worldwide Marketing Jeffrey Stewart, and Manager of Worldwide Marketing Jodi Miller. Disney subsequently began marketing Marvel's films.[80]In April 2012, the Walt Disney Company China, Marvel Studios, andDMG Entertainmentannounced an agreement to co-produceIron Man 3in China. DMG partly financed, produced in China with Marvel, and handled co-production matters. DMG also distributed the film in China in tandem with Disney.[81]
In April 2013, Marvel Studios moved its executive production offices from the Manhattan Beach Studios Media Campus tothe Walt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California.[82]In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights toIron Man,Iron Man 2,Thor, andCaptain America: The First Avengerfrom Paramount.[83][84]In September 2014,TNTacquired the cable rights forAvengers: Age of Ultron(2015),Captain America: Civil War(2016), and three other films, to air on the network two years after their theatrical releases. The films had previously aired on FX since 2008.[85]
In August 2015, Marvel Studios was placed intoWalt Disney Studios, with Feige reporting directly to Walt Disney Studios chairmanAlan F. Horninstead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter. Marvel Television and subsidiary Marvel Animation were left under Marvel Entertainment and Perlmutter's control.[86][87]As of April 2017, Marvel Studios was housed on the second floor of theFrank G. Wells Buildingat the Disney studio lot.[1][2]Fast Companyranked Marvel Studios number eleven on its 2018 World's Most Innovative Companies list.[88]
In September 2018, it was reported that Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for the streaming serviceDisney+, to be centered on "second tier" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films. Characters being considered for series includedLokiandScarlet Witch, with the actors who portrayed the characters in the films expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes, with a "hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a "hands-on role" in each series' development.[89]In October 2019, Feige was given the title ofChief Creative Officer, Marvel, and would oversee the creative direction of Marvel Television andMarvel Family Entertainment, with both being returned to being under the Marvel Studios banner.[90]Two months later, Marvel Television was folded into Marvel Studios, with Marvel Studios overseeing development of all the Marvel Television series in production at the time of its closing.Karim Zreik, Marvel Television's senior vice president of current programming and production, would join Marvel Studios alongside his team to oversee the production of the Marvel Television series inherited by Marvel Studios.[91]
In May 2022, Marvel Studios signed a 20-year licensing deal with Stan Lee Universe to license the name and likeness of Lee for use in future films, television series, Disney theme parks and cruises, various "experiences", and merchandising. A digitally recreated Lee was not expected to make cameo appearances in future projects, rather the deal allows Marvel to use Lee's name, voice, likeness, signature, and existing images and archival material.[92]In June 2023, the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulkreverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.[93]
By October 2023, Marvel Studios was planning to hire dedicated executives to focus on its television efforts, as part of a larger plan tochange its approach to its television series.[94]Production and development executive Richie Palmer was serving as a television executive by January 2024.[95]In May 2024, Marvel Studios revealed that its live-action Disney+ series would be released under a new "Marvel Television" banner, separate from the previous company of the same name, starting withAgatha All Alonglater in 2024.[96]
In June 2021, ahead of Marvel Studios' first solely produced animated seriesWhat If...?, executive vice president of film productionVictoria Alonsonoted that the studio was creating an "animation branch and mini-studio" to focus on more animated content beyondWhat If...?.[97]Marvel Studios outsources the animation for its animated series to third-party animation studios, though executive Brad Winderbaum indicated Marvel would work with fellow Disney studiosPixarandWalt Disney Animation Studios"under the right circumstances".[98]In September 2021, Alonso was promoted to President of Physical, Post Production, VFX and Animation.[99]In November 2021, Marvel Studios announced the animated seriesX-Men '97(2024–present), arevivalofX-Men: The Animated Series(1992–1997) that is set in that series' continuity.[100]The animation branch of Marvel Studios and "mini-studio" is known as Marvel Studios Animation.[7]By April 2022, Marvel Studios had taken over production of the preschool animated seriesSpidey and His Amazing Friends, starting from its second season; the first season was produced under the Marvel Entertainment banner.[101]The "Marvel Animation" name and banner was used for the division's projects by May 2024.[96]
In March 2023, Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios by a group includingDisney Entertainmentco-chairmanAlan Bergmanand Disney's human resources and legal departments for serving as a producer on theAmazon StudiosfilmArgentina, 1985(2022); this was a breach of a 2018 agreement between Alonso and Disney which stated employees would not work for a competing studio.[102][103]Alonso reportedly did not seek permission to work on the film, and was asked by Disney to stop working on the film, as well as not to promote or publicize it, with the situation "deemed serious enough" that Disney requested a new agreement be signed. Despite this, Alonso continued to promote the film following its September 2022 premiere, and was consistently reminded of her agreement and breach of contract, ultimately leading to her firing.[102]Alonso's lawyers refuted this claim, stating Disney was aware of, and agreed to, Alonso's work onArgentina, 1985, and that she was instead "silenced[... and] was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible";[104]this incident was reported to be a disagreement with a Disney executive over the censoring ofgay pride elementsinAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania(2023) to release the film in Kuwait and comply withits restrictive anti-LGBTQ laws.[105][106]A Disney spokesperson reiterated the notion that she was fired due to "an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy" among other "key factors".[104]Disney and Alonso reached a multimillion-dollar compensation settlement in April.[107]
Also at the time of Alonso's firing, criticism from VFX workers was noted,[103]who had raised complaints of Marvel's "demanding post-production schedules". Alonso was described by some as a "kingmaker",[103][7]and "challenging to work with",[105]with Chris Lee atVulturereporting that Alonso was "singularly responsible for Marvel's toxic work environment" with VFX workers.[108][7]Alonso reportedly took days off to produceArgentina, 1985instead of her post-production commitments for the various MCU projects, which in turn resulted in the need to delay several projects in 2022 and 2023.[105]However, Alonso was also described as the "epitome of professional" and supportive on set, with Joanna Robinson ofThe Ringerdescribing the reports as a "gross mischaracterization" and the opposite of Alonso's work.[103][109]Following Alonso's firing, visual effects vendors for the various MCU projects were working with producer Jen Underdahl, the vice president of visual effects and stereo.[102][110]
In August 2023, a group of 52 on-set VFX workers at Marvel Studios filed a petition with theNational Labor Relations Boardfor an election to join theInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees(IATSE) labor union theVFX Union. This was the first time any workers in the visual effects industry had petitioned for union recognition. Lee believed if this group of workers were able to secure union recognition, it "would stand as proof of concept for the overall viability of an industry-wide unionization push", particularly at the post-production effect houses.[111]All of the workers who participated in the election vote that concluded in early September voted unanimously to form a union with IATSE, with the union then set to enter into collective bargaining negotiations with Marvel, beginning at an unspecified date.[112]
Marvel had licensed out the film rights to many of its characters to other studios in the 1990s, starting with theX-Men,[24]theFantastic Four,Spider-Man, andDaredevil, which were followed byCaptain America,Iron Man,Thor, theHulk,Ant-Manand theWasp,Black Widow,Luke Cage, thePunisher,Blade,Ghost Rider,Man-Thing,Black Panther,Deadpool, andPrime, among others.[45][113]
In February 2015, Marvel Studios andSony Pictures Entertainmentannounced that Spider-Man would appear in the MCU, with the character appearing inCaptain America: Civil War(2016) and Sony releasingSpider-Man: Homecoming, produced by Feige andAmy Pascal, in July 2017. As part of the deal, Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films.[114]In June 2015, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal did not allow Spider-Man to appear in any of theMCU television series, as it was "very specific... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed."[115]In September 2019, it was announced that Disney and Sony had reached a new agreement allowing for Spider-Man to appear in athird standalone film(produced by Marvel Studios and Feige) and a future Marvel Studios film.[116]Disney was reported to be co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of the film's profits in the new agreement, while retaining the merchandising rights to the character.[116][117]In November 2021, Pascal announced plans for a fourthSpider-Manfilm set in the MCU, in addition to long-term plans for a new trilogy of films with Marvel Studios, with said film entering active development the following month.[118][119]Sony's agreement specifies that production has to start on a film within three years and nine months of the previous one, and release within five years and nine months, otherwise the rights revert to Marvel.[48]: 295Sony has access to 856 characters within its agreement,[48]: 297includingKingpin, who is able to be used by both Sony and Marvel Studios.[120]
In March 2023,Citigroupfinancial analystJason Bazinet felt Disney may try to include the distribution rights to the Hulk and Namor in any potential sale of the streaming serviceHulutoComcast, the owner ofUniversal PicturesthroughNBCUniversal.[121]In June 2023, the distribution rights toThe Incredible Hulkreverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.[93]
The following table details the rights that have returned to Marvel along with the studios from which they returned and the year in which they returned.
The "Marvel Studios Parliament", otherwise known as "The Parliament", is the creative decision-making committee at Marvel Studios and a "brain trust" of long-time executives who help to elevate each other's projects where possible.[150][151][152][94]The following executives are members of the Parliament:[153]
A number of other executives serve as lead producers on films and television series, working on each project from their inception through their release as managers alongside other executives,[152][162]as part of the Production and Development group. Some of these executives include:[153]
The Visual Development group is an in-house group of artists who work on a film from its start to provide a consistent look for the studio.[157][additional citation(s) needed]
In addition to Meinerding, the group includesAndy Park, Director of Visual Development and Production Illustrator[172][173]
Additionally,Sarah Halley Finnhas served as a frequent casting director for several MCU films and television series.[179]
Starting with the release ofSpider-Manin 2002, Marvel Studios introduced its "flipbook"production logo, created by Imaginary Forces.[191]This logo was accompanied by music from the film's score, sound effects or a song, to lead into the beginning of the film. This was the logo seen in front of all of the studio's films until 2013, when the logo was updated with the release ofThor: The Dark World, again created by Imaginary Forces. Feige stated that since Marvel was now its own entity within the Walt Disney Company, it "felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features" instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel's studio or distribution partners' logos. Feige added that they "didn't want to re-invent the wheel [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel."[192]Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002. They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, and ultimately chose 120 that were "universal and not specific to one character" and created a narrative "where each image spoke to the one before it and after."[191]The new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within theMarvel Cinematic UniversethroughCaptain America: Civil War. With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed byBrian Tyler, who wrote the scores toIron Man 3,Thor: The Dark World, andAvengers: Age of Ultron.[192]It was featured on the filmsThor: The Dark World,Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014), andGuardians of the Galaxy(2014).
In July 2016, another new logo and opening were introduced, featuring an updated fanfare, composed this time byMichael Giacchino, who first worked with Marvel Studios on the score toDoctor Strange(2016). The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.[193]It was first seen in front ofDoctor Strange.[194]The updated logo was created byPerception, which was first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update its logo. Feige specifically requested Perception "to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image, showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo." The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed "How to Build a Universe", which "was designed to pay tribute to [the filmmaking] process by touching on" how a film's origins are inspired by the comics, which then results in a script, followed by concept art, resulting in the final film. Perception looked to the initial "flipbook" logo for inspiration, and paid tribute to it in the new opening, as it opens identically to the flipbook logo. Next, the opening includes "various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays", with Perception picking "both iconic fan-favorites, as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe." To add in the concept art images, Perception looked "through a massive archive of concept art and "The Art Of..." books, to select the most iconic images for each beloved character. Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves, the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch. The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them." Finally, over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had been released at that time were included, with Perception arranging them in a way they called the "vault" "where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the "Marvel" logotype."[195]
A modified version of Perception's logo was introduced at the 2017D23Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU.[196]The logo debuted withAvengers: Infinity Waron April 26, 2018, and was used again inAnt-Man and the Wasp(2018). With the release ofCaptain Marvel, the current Perception logo was altered at Marvel Studios' behest in honor ofStan Lee; Lee died on November 12, 2018, just a few months before the release of the film.[197]The logo was altered, replacing the characters with Stan Lee's MCU cameos and other public appearances related to the MCU, accompanied by a black screen reading "Thank You Stan".[198]Similarly, the logo was retroactively modified for theDisney+version ofBlack Panther(2018) in honor ofChadwick Boseman, who died on August 28, 2020. The logo was altered, replacing the characters with images and footage ofT'Challaand Boseman. The logo premiered on November 29, 2020, which would have been Boseman's 44th birthday.[199][200]Additional modifications include having the characters who disappeared in the Blip removed forAvengers: Endgame; an additional Boseman tribute one forBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever(2022); and an all-Guardians of the Galaxy opening forGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3(2023). A shortened sequence opening was used for the Disney+ seriesSecret Invasion(2023).[201]"What If... Strange Supreme Intervened?" (2023), theWhat If...?season twofinale, replaced the live-action footage of the logo with animated images fromWhat If...?.[202]Captain America: Brave New World(2025) was the first Marvel Studios film to not feature the studio's logo animation sequence.[203]
Television specialsfrom Marvel Studios, which are marketed as "Marvel Studios Special Presentation", feature a special multicolored intro with bongo drum music, reminiscent of theCBS Special Presentationtheme featured before animated holiday specials of the 1980s and 1990s.[204][205]The intro was also designed by Perception,[206]with Giacchino (who directed and composed for the specialWerewolf by Night) once again creating the music.[205]Jamie Lovett atComicBook.comcalled the Marvel Studios Special Presentation intro "more colorful" and its fanfare "more playful" than the normal Marvel Studios intro.[207]
Marvel Knights was a production arm of Marvel Studios intended to produce some of Marvel's darker and lesser-known titles. The name originated from the "Marvel Knights" imprint ofMarvel Comics. The first film produced under the Marvel Knights banner wasPunisher: War Zone(2008), which served as arebootof thePunisherfranchise. This was followed byGhost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance(2011), which was the second and final title to be released under the Marvel Knights banner.[210]

Linked page for 'Sam Raimi' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Raimi):
Samuel M. Raimi[1](/ˈreɪmi/RAY-mee; born October 23, 1959)[2][3]is an American filmmaker. He is best known for directing the first three films in theEvil Deadfranchise(1981–present) and theSpider-Mantrilogy(2002–2007). He also directed the superhero movieDarkman(1990), the revisionist westernThe Quick and the Dead(1995), the neo-noir crime thrillerA Simple Plan(1998), the supernatural thrillerThe Gift(2000), the supernatural horrorDrag Me to Hell(2009), theDisneyfantasyOz the Great and Powerful(2013), and theMarvel StudiosfilmDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness(2022).
His films are known for their highly dynamic visual style, inspired by comic books and slapstick comedy.[4][5]He founded the production companies Renaissance Pictures in 1979 andGhost House Picturesin 2002. Raimi has also produced several successful television series, includingHercules: The Legendary Journeys, its spin-offXena: Warrior Princess, andAsh vs Evil Deadstarring long time friend and collaboratorBruce Campbellreprising his role in theEvil Deadfranchise.
Raimi was born inRoyal Oak, Michigan,[2]to aConservative Jewishfamily.[6]He is a son of merchants Celia Barbara (née Abrams) and Leonard Ronald Raimi.[3]His ancestors were Jewish immigrants from Russia and Hungary.[7]His younger brotherTedis an actor,[8]and his older brotherIvanis a screenwriter and physician.[7]His older sister, Andrea Raimi Rubin, is a court reporter.[9]Another older brother, Sander, died at 15 in an accidental drowning inIsrael; Raimi has said that the trauma knitted the remaining family closer together and "colored everything he's done for the rest of his life".[10]Raimi also mentioned that Sander first introduced him toSpider-Man, igniting his love for comics.[11]
Raimi graduated fromGroves High School[12]and later went on to attendMichigan State Universityand laterUniversità BocconiinMilan, Italy,[13][14]where he studied English but left after three semesters to filmThe Evil Dead.
Raimi became fascinated with making films when his father brought a movie camera home one day. He began to makeSuper 8movies with his friendBruce Campbell, whom he met in 1975. In college, he teamed up with his brother's roommateRobert Tapertand Campbell to shootWithin the Woods(1978), a 32-minute horror film which raised $375,000, as well as his debut feature filmIt's Murder!. During that time, he also shot the seven-minute short filmClockwork(1978), starringScott Spiegel(who had appeared inWithin the Woods) and Cheryl Guttridge.[15][16]Through family, friends, and a network of investors, Raimi was able to finance production of the highly successfulhorror filmThe Evil Dead(1981), which became a cult hit and effectively launched Raimi's career.[17]
He began work on his third filmCrimewave(1985), which he co-wrote with the then-unknownCoen brothers, shortly after.[18]Intended as a live-action comic book, the film was unsuccessful, partly due to unwanted studio intervention. Raimi then returned to the horror genre with the seminalEvil Dead II(which addedslapstickhumor to the over the top horror, showcasing his love of theThree Stooges). With his brotherIvan Raimi(and crediting himself as Celia Abrams), Sam Raimi also wroteEasy Wheels(1989), which parodied theOutlaw biker filmgenre. A long-time comic book buff, he then attempted to adapt "The Shadow" into a movie, but was unable to secure the rights, so he created his own super-hero,Darkman(1990). The film was his firstmajor studio picture, and was commercially successful, spawning two sequels. Through it he was still able to secure funding forEvil Dead III, which was retitledArmy of Darknessand largely steered away from horror towardsfantasyandcomedyelements.Army of Darkness, the final movie in theEvil Deadtrilogy, commercially underperformed, yet on video became a cult classic.
In the 1990s, Raimi moved into other genres, directing such films as the westernThe Quick and the Dead(starringSharon StoneandGene Hackman), the critically acclaimed crime thrillerA Simple Plan(1998) (starringBill PaxtonandBilly Bob Thornton), and the romantic dramaFor Love of the Game(1999) (starringKevin Costner).
Raimi achieved great critical and commercial success with theblockbusterSpider-Man(2002), which was adapted from the comic book seriesof the same name. The movie grossed over US$800 million worldwide, spawning two sequels:Spider-Man 2andSpider-Man 3, both directed by Raimi and each grossing approximately $800 million. After the completion of the thirdSpider-Manfilm, he planned on producing two more sequels (althoughSony Picturesplanned three sequels) but could not find a satisfactory script.[19]In 2022, reflecting onSpider-Man 3, Raimi toldRolling Stone: "It was a very painful experience for me. I wanted to make a Spider-Man movie to redeem myself for that. [The aborted]Spider-Man 4— that was really what that was about. I wanted to go out on a high note. I didn't want to just make another one that pretty much worked. I had a really high standard in my mind. And I didn't think I could get that script to the level that I was hoping for by that start date."[11]He, along withMarc Webb, were both brought on as creative consultants forMarvel Studios'Spider-Man: No Way Home, directed byJon Watts.[20]
Raimi frequently collaborates withJoel and Ethan Coen, beginning when Joel was one of the editors ofEvil Dead.[21]The Coens co-wroteCrimewaveandThe Hudsucker Proxywith Raimi in the mid-1980s (thoughHudsuckerwas not produced for almost a decade). Raimi made cameo appearances inMiller's Crossing,The Hudsucker Proxy, and with Joel Coen inSpies Like Us. The Coen brothers gave Raimi advice on shooting in snow forA Simple Plan, based on their experiences withFargo.[22]
He worked in front of the camera inThe Standas a dimwitted hitman,John Carpenter'sBody Bagsas a murdered gas station attendant, andIndian Summerin what is perhaps his biggest role as a bumbling assistant toAlan Arkin. The film was written by his childhood friend, writer-directorMike Binder, and shot at the camp that they both attended when they were younger. Raimi also produced the entire English-languageThe Grudgefranchise, based on the original Japanese films.
According toEntertainment Weekly, Raimi had expressed an interest in directing a film version ofThe Hobbit, the prequel to theLord of the Ringstrilogy.[23]In 2008,Guillermo del Torowas selected as the director, withPeter Jacksonas the executive producer. Raimi may directBy Any Means Necessary, the next film based on the "Jack Ryan" CIA character created byTom ClancyforParamount Pictures. Disney also approached him to directW.I.T.C.H.: The Movie, based on the popular comic.
Blizzard Entertainment announced on July 22, 2009, that Raimi would be directing a film adaptation of theWarcraftvideo game series,[24]but at the 2012San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that he would not be the director.[25]
On September 23, 2009, he became the producer for the BritishsupernaturalthrillerRefuge, which is directed by Corin Hardy and published byMandate Pictures.[26]He will produce the remake of the Danish thrillerThe Substitute, which will be directed by Scott Derrickson under his new label Spooky Pictures.[27]Raimi produced with his companyGhost House Picturesthe British thriller flickBurst 3D, directed byNeil Marshall.[28]
Raimi directedOz the Great and Powerful, which was released on March 8, 2013, byWalt Disney Picturesand grossed $493 million worldwide.[29][30]He said he would not be directing the planned sequel.[31][32]
On December 11, 2006, the website SuperHero Hype reported that director Sam Raimi and Michael Uslan would co-produce a new film version ofThe ShadowforColumbia Pictures.[33]On October 16, 2007, Raimi stated that: "I don't have any news onThe Shadowat this time, except that the company that I have with Josh Donen, my producing partner, we've got the rights toThe Shadow. I love the character very much and we're trying to work on a story that'll do justice to the character."[34][35]
Raimi, along with Bruce Campbell andRob Tapert, produced the remake of Raimi'sThe Evil Dead.

On casting, directorSteve McQueensaid:
Chiwetel Ejiofor was always going to be Solomon Northup for me. I was looking for someone that had that genteelness, that kind of humanity. Knowing that humanity was going to be tested under certain duress and circumstances, I needed a person who could actually keep hold of that, even through periods of extraordinary trying and extraordinary situations where it would be tested to its absolute limit. He was the only person.[22]
At the Toronto International Film Festival, Ejiofor said he briefly hesitated about playing Northup. "You wait all your life for a great script to come through the door. You're hassling your agent and all that, and then it comes and you read it and your first reaction surprises you. Your first reaction being, 'Can I do this?'"[23]He accepted the role about 24 hours later.[24]As part of his preparation for the role, Ejiofor learned to play the violin, collected slave stories, maintained a slave's edge up hairstyle, and engaged in some of the physical labour that Northup was subject to, including cotton picking.[25]Since he had not worked with McQueen before, Ejiofor also observed the working dynamic between the director and co-starMichael Fassbender, who worked with McQueen onHunger(2008) andShame(2011).[26]On playing Northup, Ejiofor did feel a responsibility, not being American, to get the story of Solomon Northup as current he could, adding "I've been very grateful to show the film to his descendants and see them be so proud of it."[27]
12 Years a Slaveopened to wide acclaim, with many critics citing Ejiofor's performance and declaring him an almost-certain Academy Award nominee for Best Actor.[23][25][27][28]FromOwen GleibermanatEntertainment Weekly: "It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence."[29]FromChristopher OrratThe Atlantic: "Ejiofor has given notable performances in the past (Dirty Pretty Things,Serenity,Talk to Me), but this is by far his most essential role to date. Stoic, watchful, compromising himself just enough to stay alive, he is the point of stillness and decency around which spin the madnesses of the film."[30]In hisThe Hollywood Reporterreview,Todd McCarthywrote, "Ejiofor is terrific in a demanding character who's put through the wringer physically, mentally and emotionally."[31]On 16 January 2014, Ejiofor was officially nominated for Best Actor for the 86th Academy Awards on 2 March.

He's possessed with this disease of his own ego and his own want."[39][40]Favreau said of casting Ejiofor, "[He] is just a fantastic actor, who brings us a bit of the mid-Atlantic cadence and a new take on the character. He brings that feeling of a Shakespearean villain to bear because of his background as an actor. It's wonderful when you have somebody as experienced and seasoned as Chiwetel; he just breathes such wonderful life into this character."[41]Ejiofor narrated the 2019 documentary filmThe Elephant Queen.[42]In 2019, Ejiofor made his feature directorial debut withThe Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, adapted from the memoir of the same name fromWilliam Kamkwamba, about a boy who built a wind-powered water pump inMalawi.[43]In 2022, Ejiofor returned to the role ofMordofor the sequel filmDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
