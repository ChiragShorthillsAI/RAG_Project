The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talentis a 2022 Americanaction comedyfilm directed by Tom Gormican, who co-wrote the screenplay withKevin Etten. It starsNicolas Cageas a fictionalized version of himself, along with a supporting cast includingPedro Pascal,Sharon Horgan,Ike Barinholtz,Alessandra Mastronardi,Jacob Scipio,Neil Patrick Harris,Tiffany Haddishand Caroline Boulton.
The film premiered atSouth by Southweston March 12, 2022, and was released in theUnited Stateson April 22, 2022, byLionsgate. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances and chemistry of Cage and Pascal, and grossed $29 million against its $30 million budget.
Hollywood actorNicolas "Nick" Cageis struggling with his career after being passed over for several major film roles and is constantly pestered and tormented by "Nicky", who appears to him as his younger (and more successful) self. His relationship with his ex-wife Olivia and daughter Addy is also marred by years of emotional neglect.
Losing a key film role and following an embarrassing event at Addy's birthday party, Nick announces plans to retire from acting. He decides to accept a vague offer of $1 million from his agent Richard Fink involving going toMajorcato meet billionaireplayboyJavi Gutiérrez, to be the guest of honor at his birthday.
Upon meeting Javi, Nick is initially annoyed by his neediness and insistence that they create an improvisational movie based on a script he wrote, but is soon inspired by Javi's determination. The two quickly bond over their surprisingly shared love of films such asThe Cabinet of Dr. CaligariandPaddington 2(the latter of which Nick watches for the first time with Javi).
Soon after, Nick is confronted byCIAagents Vivian and Martin. They suspect that Javi, who they claim made his fortune through arms dealing, is behind the kidnapping of María Delgado. She is the daughter of aCatalananti-crime politician, who he hopes to pressure to drop out of an upcoming election. Nick insists that his acting instincts would've detected if Javi was a criminal, but he eventually decides to help the CIA with the mission.
After successfully rigging the cameras in Javi's compound, Nick attends Javi's birthday party, where he announces his collaboration with Javi on a new movie as an excuse to stay on the compound long enough to find María. After a misadventure involvingLSD, Nick and Javi decide that their movie should be about their relationship.
Nick later discovers that Javi keeps a shrine room dedicated to all of his movies, including a wax figure of his character Castor Troy from the filmFace/Off, complete with identical golden pistols. Vivian suggests that Nick includes a kidnapping in their script, to get Javi's reaction to it.
Nick explains this new idea to Javi, who believes that he must be distracted by his family issues. Vivian tells Nick to flee, or possibly kill Javi, as he has discovered their plot. But Javi reveals he's brought Nick's family to his villa. Nick tries to make amends with them, but they reject his appeal and accuse him of prioritizing his film career over his family.
Javi privately goes to meet with his cousin Lucas, who is revealed to be the true arms dealer and the one who kidnapped María. Lucas warns him that Nick is working with the CIA and pressures him to kill him, or else Lucas will kill Javi.
Nick and Javi face off, but neither can bring himself to kill the other. Lucas sends his men after both of them, and they race back to the house to discover that Addy has also been kidnapped. Nick takes Javi, Olivia and Javi's assistant Gabriela to the CIA safe house, only for the house to have been compromised; Martin has been killed, while Vivian sacrifices herself to kill Lucas's men before they can ambush the group. With Javi's help, Nick and Olivia pose as a reclusive criminal couple to get close to Lucas. He figures out their plan, but they still manage to escape with Addy and María.
Nick, Addy, Olivia and María race to the American embassy while Javi and Gabriela stay behind to delay Lucas's pursuit. Upon arrival, Lucas holds Nick at gunpoint, but Addy tosses him a knife which he uses to kill him—transitioning into the movie that Nick and Javi completed, presumably based on their adventure. Nick is applauded for his new film and congratulates Javi before going home with his family to watchPaddington 2, now with a better relationship.
Cage plays a fictionalised version of himself who he said bore little resemblance to his real offscreen personality. He originally turned down the role "three or four times" but changed his mind after writer-director Tom Gormican wrote him a personal letter.[5]On November 15, 2019,Lionsgateacquired the production rights.[6]In August 2020,Pedro Pascalentered negotiations to star.[7]In September 2020,Sharon HorganandTiffany Haddishjoined the cast,[8][9]and Lily Sheen was added in October.[10]In November 2020,Neil Patrick Harrisjoined the cast.[11]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
