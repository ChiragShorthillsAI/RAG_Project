The Lost Cityis a 2022 Americanaction-adventurecomedy filmdirected byAaron and Adam Nee, who co-wrote the screenplay withOren UzielandDana Fox, based on a story bySeth Gordon.[5]StarringSandra Bullock,Channing Tatum,Daniel Radcliffe,Da'Vine Joy RandolphandBrad Pitt, the film follows a romance novelist and her cover model, who must escape a billionaire who wants her to find a lost ancient burial chamber described in one of her books.
The project was announced in October 2020 with Bullock joining as producer and star and Tatum joining that December; the rest of the cast was announced the following year. Filming took place in theDominican Republicfrom May to August 2021. The film premiered atSouth by Southweston March 12, 2022, and was theatrically released byParamount Picturesin the United States on March 25, 2022. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $190 million worldwide against a $68 million budget.
Loretta Sage, a former archaeology researcher, writes romance-adventure novels centered on the fictional Dr. Angela Lovemore and her romantic interest Dash McMahon. To promote the latest book, her publisher Beth Hatten puts her on a book tour with Alan Caprison, the cover model for Dash, despite her reclusiveness after her husband's death five years ago.
After a disastrous start, mostly due to the fans' obsession with Alan's Dash persona, Loretta is kidnapped by billionaire Abigail Fairfax. He has discovered a lost city on a remote volcanicAtlanticisland and is convinced that the Crown of Fire, a priceless treasure belonging to the ancient King Kalaman and Queen Taha, is located there. Knowing the books were partially based on Loretta's research, Fairfax wants her to decipher an ancient clue to the treasure. When she declines, he sedates her and flies her to the island.
Alan, who is secretly enamored with Loretta, witnesses her kidnapping. He contacts formerNavy SEALturnedCIAoperative Jack Trainer. Following her smart watch's location, they begin a rescue.
Jack breaches Fairfax's compound and frees Loretta. However, as the trio attempts to flee, Jack is shot in the head by Fairfax's mercenaries. Loretta and Alan escape into the jungle.
The pair spend a day running from Fairfax's henchmen, then spend a night in a hammock in the jungle, before reaching a nearby village. Upon hearing a local singing afolk song, Loretta deduces that the crown is hidden in acenotein the jungle. However, Fairfax's group captures her, and then Alan when he chases them on a motorcycle. Fairfax forces them to reveal the treasure's location.
After traveling to the tombsite by boat, they discover it is not a treasure-filled monument of Taha and Kalaman's power, but a secret place for the queen to grieve her husband's death. Her Crown of Fire was made of red seashells the king gathered to show his love for her. The actual treasure of the legend was the inseparable love between the king and queen.
Enraged, Fairfax seals Loretta and Alan inside the tomb as the volcano erupts. Rafi, one of Fairfax's henchmen, has a change of heart and leaves acrowbarinside the tomb, so they can free themselves. Rafi then takes the boat and abandons Fairfax on the island. Loretta and Alan escape by swimming through an underwater tunnel with the current.
Beth arrives with the local coast guard,  who rescue Loretta and Alan and arrest Fairfax. Sometime later, Loretta's next book, based on her adventure with Alan, is a success, and they share a kiss on the beach at the end of the book tour.
In a mid-credits scene, Loretta and Alan attend a meditation class where they unexpectedly meet Jack, who survived being shot in the head.

Manohla DargisofThe New York Timessaid "It's too bad thatThe Lost Cityisn't more ambitious, because a woman writing her dreams into reality is a potentially rich riff on the Pygmalion and Galatea myth... WhileRaiders [of the Lost Ark]transcends its inspirations with wit andSteven Spielberg's filmmaking andRomancing [the Stone]tries hard to do the same,The Lost Cityremains a copy of a copy."[37]Siddhant Adlakha ofIGNgiving film a 6 out of 10, calling it "a decent action-comedy that coasts on the presence of its stars".[38]
Peter Debruge ofVarietysaid, "The result can feel a little rickety in places, but the Nee brothers — who share screenplay credit with Oren Uziel and Dana Fox — have punched it up with off-color jokes, looped over moments when the characters' mouths are off-camera. In this and myriad other ways,The Lost Cityproves they do in fact make 'em like they used to."[39]Writing forRolling Stone, David Fear said "The movie itself is trying to excavate a long-lost genre: the big-budget action-adventure movie-star rom-com. It wants to be a modernRomancing the Stoneso badly you can almost see the flop-sweat dripping down the screen."[40]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
