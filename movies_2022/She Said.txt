She Saidis a 2022 Americandrama filmdirected byMaria Schraderand written byRebecca Lenkiewicz, based on the2019 bookby reportersJodi KantorandMegan Twohey. The film starsCarey MulliganandZoe Kazanas Twohey and Kantor, respectively, and follows theirNew York Timesinvestigation that exposedHarvey Weinstein's history ofabuse and sexual misconduct against women. The film also starsPatricia Clarkson,Jennifer Ehle,Samantha Morton, andAndre Braugher, in his final film role before his death in 2023.Ashley Juddappears as herself.
The book was optioned in 2018, and the film was announced in 2021 as a co-production betweenAnnapurna PicturesandPlan B Entertainment. Filming took place in New York with cinematographerNatasha Braier. During post-production, editing was completed byHansjörg Weißbrichandthe scorewas composed byNicholas Britell.
She Saidhad its world premiere at the60th New York Film Festivalon October 13, 2022, and was released in the United States on November 18, 2022, byUniversal Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the screenplay and the performances of Kazan and Mulligan. It was also named one of the best films of 2022 by theAmerican Film Institute. However, it was abox-office bomb, grossing $13 million against a production budget of $32 million.[5][6]The film was nominated forBest Actress in a Supporting Rolefor Mulligan andBest Adapted Screenplayfor Lenkiewicz at the76th British Academy Film Awards. It also earned Mulligan aGolden Globe Awardnomination and Lenkiewicz aCritics' Choice Awardnomination.
In 2017,New York TimesreporterJodi Kantorreceives a tip that actressRose McGowanwas sexually assaulted byIndiewoodproducerHarvey Weinstein. McGowan initially declines to comment, but later calls her back and describes an encounter in which Weinstein raped her when she was 23.
Kantor also speaks with actressesAshley JuddandGwyneth Paltrow, who describe their own experiences with Weinstein, but both ask not to be named in the article for fear of career blowback. Frustrated by a lack of progress in her ensuing investigation, she recruitsMegan Twoheyto help with the piece.
Twohey tracks down a woman who worked as an assistant to Weinstein atMiramaxdecades ago and disappeared; the woman fearfully declines to speak on the matter due to having signed anNDA. Kantor confronts the former CFO of Miramax about pastsettlementpayouts by Weinstein against his accusers, but he is hesitant to divulge any information about it.
Twohey is similarly rejected by theEEOCafter requesting more information about the settlements. She speaks toLinda Fairstein, a former member of thedistrict attorney's office about why criminal complaints against Weinstein were dropped so quickly; she learns that Weinstein had social connections with Fairstein and the DA's office.
Kantor receives a tip about three former Weinstein assistants who may have been abused: Rowena Chiu, Zelda Perkins, and Laura Madden. She flies out to confront each of them individually. Unable to meet with Chiu, Perkins recounts an incident to Kantor in which Chiu had a breakdown after an encounter with Weinstein. Madden initially declines to speak with her, but changes her mind after a Weinstein representative reaches out to discourage her from speaking to reporters about her experience.
Weinstein learns of the investigation and sends a lawyer to attempt to appease reporters, but declines to go on the record and denies all wrongdoing. The lawyer acknowledges a number of past financial settlements, but declines to say how many. Kantor receives an anonymous tip to speak with Irwin Reiter, one of Weinstein's former accountants; he shows her an internal memo that circulated at Miramax in 2015 detailing abuse allegations from a former employee.
TheTimesnotifies the Weinstein Company board of the impending article and asks for a statement. Weinstein denies the allegations and pressures the reporters to name their sources, threatening to talk to other publications to discredit the story. He eventually releases a statement acknowledging that he has caused pain to others in the past and that he is taking a leave of absence fromThe Weinstein Company. Kantor and Twohey attempt to convince their sources to go on the record; all initially decline, but Judd and Madden later agree to be named in the article, believing it is the right thing to do.
TheTimespublishes the story on October 5, 2017. After the article's publication,82 women come forward with their own allegations against Weinstein, leading to workplace and legal reforms. Weinstein is currently serving a 23-year sentence for rape and sexual assault in New York.
On October 5, 2017,Jodi KantorandMegan TwoheyfromThe New York Timesrevealedsubstantial allegations of sexual misconductby Hollywood producerHarvey Weinstein, accusing him of three decades of sexually harassing actresses, female production assistants, temps and other employees atMiramaxandThe Weinstein Company.[12]The allegations served as a catalyst for the burgeoning#MeToo movementand eventually resulted in Weinstein being sentenced to 23 years of imprisonment.[13]
In 2019, Kantor and Twohey publishedShe Said, a book detailing the different processes they employed to investigate and uncover Weinstein's sexual misconduct. The rights to the book were optioned in 2018 byAnnapurna PicturesandPlan B Entertainment. In June 2021,Universal Picturesannounced they were developing an adaptation withZoe KazanandCarey Mulliganin negotiations to star as Kantor and Twohey.[14]It was also reportedMaria Schraderwas attached to direct from a screenplay byRebecca Lenkiewicz, withBrad Pitt,Dede GardnerandJeremy Kleinerset to produce.[15]
Schrader and Lenkiewicz said they wanted the film to be less focused on reenactments of Weinstein's abuse and harassment and more about the women who were silenced.[16]Said Lenkeiwicz, "Although there is such darkness in the story...there is a lot of beauty and light in women finding each other."[16]
In July 2021, filming began in New York City with cinematographerNatasha Braier.[17][18]Filming took place at theTimes'New York headquarters.[19]By August,Patricia Clarkson,[20]Andre Braugher,[21]Samantha Morton,[22]andTom Pelphreywere announced as part of the cast.[23]Adam Shapiro was confirmed to star in October 2021.[24]
Pitt's involvement with the film has received scrutiny as he was made aware of Weinstein's behavior in 1996 by his then-girlfriendGwyneth Paltrowand later by his then-partnerAngelina Joliebut continued to work with Weinstein after the fact, and because he was accused of abusing Jolie and their children in 2016.[25][26][27]
In August 2022, Weinstein and his attorneys tried to delay his trial from its October 10, 2022 start date by claiming that the film's marketing and publicity would prejudice anyLos Angelesjury against him;Los Angeles Superior CourtJudge Lisa Lench denied the request.[28]
The film was theatrically released in the United States on November 18, 2022, coinciding with the then on-going Weinstein trial in Los Angeles.[29]It premiered at the60th New York Film Festivalon October 13, 2022,[1]and at the66th BFI London Film Festivalon October 14, 2022.[30]It also screened at theTCL Chinese Theatreduring the 2022AFI Feston November 4, 2022.[31]
The film was made available forVODon December 6, 2022, followed by aBlu-rayandDVDrelease on January 10, 2023.[32][33]
She Saidgrossed $5.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $8.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $13.9 million.[4][5]In the United States and Canada,She Saidwas released alongsideThe Menu, and was projected to gross $3–5 million from 2,022 theaters in its opening weekend.[34][3]The film made $830,000 on its first day, including $160,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $2.2 million, finishing sixth.[35]
Deadline Hollywoodcalled the opening total "aflop" and cited the "emotional exhaustion" of audiences, the perception of the film's "anticlimactic existence" since the Weinstein trials were still ongoing, and journalists "[not being] as interesting as they think they are" to the average person. They also noted that the trending lack of interest inawards seasonandauteur projectsby the general public and the competition and overlapping demographics from holdoversBlack Panther: Wakanda ForeverandThe Menumay have also played a role in the underperformance.[36]
The Hollywood Reporter, which listed the film's debut among the worst-ever for a film playing in over 2,000 theaters and also noting audiences may not want to "re-litigate recent and ongoing scandals", said that films about Hollywood don't tend to play well outside Los Angeles and New York City, citing that the film's top 10 grossing theaters were on the coasts.[37]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 88% of 274 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "AlthoughShe Saidstruggles to add cinematic flair to its fact-based story, it remains a worthy, well-acted tribute to journalistic integrity."[39]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 74 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[40]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, and those atPostTrakgave the film an 89% overall.[35]
Writing forAP News, Jocelyn Noveck described the film as not only "a worthy entry to a film genre that includesSpotlightand of courseAll the President's Men", but also a testament to "the power of journalism... [and] courage, from the women who suffered sexual harassment or assault at Weinstein's hands and came forward at personal risk — to their careers, reputations or well-being."[41]
Critics praised the film for its sensitivity to sexual assault survivors and its non-sensationalist approach, withAnn HornadayofThe Washington Post, commenting: "Schrader filmsShe Saidwith a bracing combination of straightforwardness and sensitivity, staging the most prurient details of Weinstein's cases with somber restraint rather than salacious literalism."[16][42][43]Kristy Puchko ofMashablewrote: "Sexual assault and harassment are not made a spectacle inShe Said, as it was in theFox News-centered docudramaBombshell. Instead, the details of the allegations are shared, not shown... Schrader trusts we don't need to see what happened to believe these women's stories."[44]
Rolling Stone's David Fear wrote there is "a genuine sense of how deep and how wide all of [Weinstein's] cover-ups went. It's a story about survivors, but also about systematic sexism, systematic abuse, systematic intimidation, systematic despair over anything changing. Only the last part gets partially redressed."[45]Fear also noted the film "doesn't pretend that wrongs have been righted once and for all. It just wants to pay tribute to two people who stood up to a Goliath and took him down not with one good shot but a million tiny cuts and a lot of hard work."[45]
Praise was given to Mulligan and Kazan, in addition to the ensemble cast.[46][47]Kate Erbland ofIndieWirewrote: "Megan may be the more outwardly cool, calm, and collected one, but Mulligan — always so good at playing women on the edge — brings obvious conflict to the role",[11]whileJustin ChangofNPRwrote: "Kazan emphasizes Kantor's empathy, her skill at building trust and coaxing information out of even the most reluctant sources."[46]Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt wrote: "The ever-reliable Samantha Morton and Jennifer Ehle bring a tensile fury and vulnerability to two of the film's most memorable accusers, and Patricia Clarkson and Andre Braugher have the built-in gravitas to play Kantor and Twohey's suffer-no-fools editors as they methodically track down the tramautized, the complicit, and the less-than-innocent bystanders who will eventually allow them to publish their bombshell report."[48]
Reviews also noted that the film marks a departure from previous journalism films by centering on the two women who broke the story.[16][46][47][49]Stephanie ZacharekofTimewrote: "Instead of hardworking men in their shirtsleeves running around a newsroom, possibly making the occasional call home to check in on their wives and kids, inShe Saidwe see Twohey... at home on maternity leave, struggling withpostpartum depression, and Kantor thanking her preteen daughter for helping to pacify her younger, needier sister. As reporters, they're tireless. As moms, they're tired... That's what givesShe Saidits believable texture. That and the fact that, regardless of this story's ultimately explosive impact,She Saidis simply a story of journalists at work."[50]Peter BradshawofThe Guardiancommented: "I admire the way it takes the macho cliched nonsense out of journalism in movies: these are not boozy guys being adorable and chaotic, but smart, persistent people doggedly doing their job."[51]Others were more mixed about the film's depiction of the journalists' home lives, with Noveck saying "there just isn't time for enough backstory, so [the scenes] feel cursory."[41]Bloomberg News'Esther Zuckerman felt the scenes' inclusion made for a narratively disjointed film.[52]
More critical reviews opined the film struggles to bring suspense or a sense of urgency to its story, since the events on which it is based on are public knowledge.[27][52]Scout Tafoya ofRogerEbert.comdescribed it as an "artlessWikipediaentry of anOscar competitor."[27]Though her review was generally positive, Greenblatt commented: "What the movie does to humanize both these women — and their skittish, often terrified witnesses — feels more fully realized than the procedural bits, which often tend to come off like a broad discourse on How Journalism Works."[48]Puchko wrote: "WhereShe Saidtrips up is in its ardent need to play like aprestigebiopic, wallowing in the heroes' noble intentions and important contributions to the world but forgetting that these characters should also be exciting to watch." Puchko added "Megan and Jodi [as characters] feel too polished to feel real", and concluded: "In short,She Saidis good. But grubbiness could have made it great."[44]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
