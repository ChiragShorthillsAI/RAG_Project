Scrooge: A Christmas Carolis a 2022 animatedmusicalfantasycomedy drama filmdirected by Stephen Donnelly. It is an adaptation of the 1970 filmScrooge, written byLeslie Bricusse, which itself is based on the 1843 novelA Christmas CarolbyCharles Dickens.
The film was produced by Timeless Films, and features the voices ofLuke Evans,Olivia Colman,Jessie Buckley,Jonathan Pryce,Johnny Flynn,James Cosmoand Trevor Dion Nicholas. It was released in select theaters on November 18, 2022, and onNetflixon December 2, 2022. The film is dedicated to Leslie Bricusse, who died a year before its release. The film received mixed reviews from critics.
On Christmas Eve in 1843, a jolly man named Harry encounters his elderly uncle Ebenezer Scrooge and his dog Prudence, but Scrooge evades him long enough to decline giving money to a charity and add in a debt owed to him by local toy shop owner Tom Jenkins, who can barely afford medical treatment for his frail mother. After returning to his counting house, he rudely declines an invitation to a Christmas dinner party from Harry and reluctantly lets his clerk, Bob Cratchit, take the next day off for Christmas. Bob is underpaid by Scrooge and lives in poverty with his wife Ethel and their many children, including Tiny Tim, who is seriously ill and cannot receive medical treatment due to lack of money. Scrooge closes for the night, and he and Prudence go home as Scrooge sings about his exasperation with Christmas ("Tell Me").
Once he gets home, he is haunted by the spirit of his former business partner and friend, Jacob Marley, who is forced to pull long, heavy chains around his soul as a penalty for the bad actions he made in life. He warns Scrooge that he will suffer a similar fate unless he changes for the better. Marley has arranged for three visitors to teach him how to be a better man.
Scrooge encounters the first visitor, a wax-like shape-shifting being called Past, who takes him through his life before present. Scrooge was forced to work in a factory on Christmas Day as a child due to his father being in a debtors' prison and was visited by his younger sister Jen (who died giving birth to Harry). When he was a young man, he worked for a kind-hearted businessman named Mr. Fezziwig and was engaged to his daughter Isabel ("Happiness") before Jacob Marley partnered with him for a better-paying job. Isabel witnesses Scrooge and Marley shut down a baker family's shop (the baker is revealed to be Bob Cratchit's father) and leaves Scrooge for focusing more on his business than her ("Later Never Comes"). Scrooge insists it was because he and Isabel needed to be financially secure before they could be married but expresses regret for pushing her away.
Scrooge then meets a joyful giant called Present, surrounded by tiny flying creatures called Cheerlings, who wants to show Scrooge how to live life ("I Like Life"). He shows Scrooge how Fred will spend Christmas. Fred loves his uncle due to being told of the kindness of Scrooge's sister Jen. He is then shown how the Cratchit family will spend Christmas in their small home with poor health but will go forth with happiness by being thankful for what they have, especially Tiny Tim ("The Beautiful Day").
Soon, Present's body turns into Yet to Come's (and the three Cheerlings who went with them turn into Fearlings), who shows Scrooge a future where Tom Jenkins leads a celebration of expressing gratitude to Scrooge ("Thank You Very Much"). At first, Scrooge thinks he's being praised, but Prudence soon finds out they are celebrating his death. Scrooge learns the truth after finding out that Tiny Tim has died and the Cratchit family is devastated.
Upon seeing that only a few people have attended his funeral including an elderly Prudence  and a few men (including Tom, who, alongside another man, came to mock Scrooge's death), Scrooge is given an example of what his afterlife will be like with heavy chains if he does not change his greedy ways. Devastated, Scrooge makes a vow that he will change for the better if it means that Tim will live.
Finding out it is Christmas, Scrooge spreads joy to his associates. With his place decorated for a Christmas party and everyone in attendance, he gives Harry a doll that Jen once made him, makes Cratchit his business partner, gives a donation to the charity workers, and erases Tom's debt. He also promises Tiny Tim that he will be able to seek medical help with his father's pay rise. Scrooge then celebrates Christmas with his new assortment of companions. ("I'll Begin Again").

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
