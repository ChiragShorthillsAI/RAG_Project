Sitting in Bars with Cakewas released on September 8, 2023, byAmazon Prime Video. The film received generally positive reviews from critics.
Jane and Corinne, best friends since they were seven, live together inLos Angeles. Corinne is the ultimate extrovert, while Jane is introverted.
Corinne works with powerhouse talent agent Benita as her assistant, where Jane works in the mailroom. Jane has a crush on lawyer Owen who is interning in the company, but hides from him because of her timidity.
On March 7, Corinne's birthday, Jane brings her homemade birthday cake out with them. Corinne insists they share it around the bar. This inspires Corinne's idea to get Jane, to commit to a year of baking cakes and bringing them to bars with the goal of meeting people.
Corinne and Jane map out a plan to hit one bar a week for a year. They try to hit many different demographics, and she makes each cake to reflect each clientele. Corinne also chooses Jane's outfits to improve her chances.
Jane's parents Tasha and Isaac take her and Corinne out for Chinese, as they are in LA for a lawyers conference. Well-respected human rights lawyers, they expect her to follow in their footsteps, although she actually wants to become a professional baker.
During their cake experiment, they tally Jane's success in interacting with men. The first sends her a dick pic, she line dances with another, and gets numbers and kisses.
Meanwhile, Benita promotes Corinne to junior agent. Jane and friends celebrate that night for drinks, but later on Corinne has a seizure following an extreme headache. An MRI and biopsy confirm a brain tumor, a life-altering diagnosis.
Corinne's parents Ruth and Fred Thompson try to take her back toPhoenix, Arizona, for treatment, but she chooses to stay in Los Angeles. Jane insists she can handle it, but they stay until they are sure. In the meantime her dad constantly finds handyman projects around to do.
During her treatment, Corinne still goes with Jane and cakes to bars, calling it cakebarring. Their boss  organises a 5K run fundraising event for Corinne and also acupucture and an emotional support dog.
Meanwhile Jane is finally brave enough to meet with Owen, under the guise of learning more about international property law. Corinne is thrilled, especially as it's a way to distract away from her cancer.
In November Corinne breaks up with Dave and tells Tasha and Isaac about Jane’s disinterest in law. The cancer fundraiser takes place. She also unfortunately receives bad news from her doctor that her cancer now is more aggressive than originally believed and essentiallyterminal, especially as attempts to join a clinical trial are unsuccessful.
By Thanksgiving Corinne had to return to the hospital for a time. With 17 cakes left to deliver via cakebarring, Jane gets a second wind. Christmas comes and she finally starts to have a clearer idea of what she wants. Jane realises that Owen may not be 'the one', and she finally tells her parents that the idea of law school doesn't inspire her.
They go to a bar with everyone to do karaoke, a favorite activity of Corinne's. When she's too weak to finish a song, Jane pushes aside her stage fright to support her.
Quitting her mailroom job to become Corinne's fulltime caregiver for her remaining months, Jane both says goodbye to her job and Owen, who she's decided to stop dating. The girls are together right up to the end.
They have her celebration of life in Arizona.
Although heartbroken, Jane delivers the 50th cake, Corinne's birthday cake. Then as promised, she opens her specialty cake shop Silverlake Cake Bar in LA.

Film critic Natasha Alvar fromCultured VulturescomparedSitting in Bars with Cakewith 1980s comedy-dramas likeBeachesandSteel Magnolias.[8]Adrian Horton fromThe Guardianwrote in her review: "Shahidi is capable if a tad recessive as the film’s emotional center, one whose can-do attitude is both grating and absolutely necessary. But it’s A’Zion’s performance that sparkles; her Corinne – vivacious and deadpan, her rapid-fire wit papering over a visceral denial – adds some much needed tartness to a recipe that could easily become too maudlin. “Most of the time, I don’t feel like a sick person,” she bitterly admits after a workplace-sponsored fundraiser for her illness, and it's true; even as Corinne's condition deteriorates, A’Zion's performance maintains a distinct, bristly vitality."[9]Sheila O'Malley fromRogerEbert.comalso give the film positive review and praised A'zion's performance: "Because Corinne's diagnosis is so central, the film thankfully avoids the trap of "illness as plot point", and A'zion's performance is so strong it's impossible not to feel Corinne's sense of loss, her sense of how unfair it all is, even when (or especially when) she tries to cover it up with cracking a joke."[10]Meanwhile, Amy Nicholson fromVarietygave it a negative review for having too much of a melodramatic tone.[11]

Midler told Carson in an interview that she always wanted to move like the sisters, and Patty Andrews remembered: "When I first heard the introduction on the radio, I thought it was our old record. When Bette opened at the Amphitheater in Los Angeles, Maxene and I went backstage to see her. Her first words were, 'What else did you record?'"[25]During another Midler concert, Maxene went on stage and presented her with an honorary bugle. Bette recorded other Andrews Sisters hits, including "In the Mood" and "Lullaby of Broadway".[25]

Midler starred in her own sitcom in 2000,Bette, which featured Midler playing a version of herself, a divine celebrity who is adored by her fans. Airing onCBS, initial ratings were high, marking the best sitcom debut for the network in more than five years, but viewers percentage soon declined, resulting in the show's cancellation in early 2001.[48]Midler openly griped about the show's demanding shooting schedule, while the show itself was also reportedly rocked by backstage turmoil, involving the replacement of co-starKevin Dunnwhose departure was attributed by the media to his behind-the scenes bickering with Midler.[48]However, Midler, critically praised, was awarded aPeople's Choice Awardfor her performance in the show and received aGolden Globe Awardnomination the following year.[49]Also in 2000, Midler made an uncreditedcameo appearanceinNancy Meyers' fantasy rom–comWhat Women Want, starringMel GibsonandHelen Hunt.[50]In the film, she portrayed a therapist who realizes that central character Nick, played by Gibson, is able to understand women'sthoughts.[50]Released to generally mixed reviews, it became the then-most successful film ever directed by a woman, taking in $183 million in the United States, and grossing upward of $370 million worldwide.[51][52]

Another critical fiasco, reviewers noted that the film "drowns itself in humor that never rises above sitcom level."[55]
After nearly three decades of erratic record sales, Midler was dropped from theWarner Music Groupin 2001. Following a reported long-standing feud with Barry Manilow, the two joined forces after many years in 2003 to recordBette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook.

Oz later blamed Midler—who was amid recording her next album and rehearsing for her tour—for being under a lot of stress by other projects and making "the mistake of bringing her stress on the set."[57]While the original book and film had tremendous cultural impact, the remake was marked by poor reviews by many critics, and a financial loss of approximately $40 million at the box office.[58][59]
Midler joined forces again with Manilow for another tribute album,Bette Midler Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook. Released in October 2005, the album sold 55,000 copies the first week of release, returned Midler to the top ten ofUSBillboard200,[60]and was nominated for a Grammy Award.[61]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
