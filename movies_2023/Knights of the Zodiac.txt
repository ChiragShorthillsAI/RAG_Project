The film starsMackenyu,Famke Janssen,Madison Iseman,Diego Tinoco,Mark Dacascos,Nick Stahl, andSean Bean.
Knights of the Zodiacwas released in Japan on April 28, 2023, and in the United States on May 12. The film has received mostly negative reviews from critics and grossed $7 million, becoming abox-office bomb.[3]
Seiyais a street orphan searching for his sister Patricia, who has been kidnapped. During a fight with Cassios in a fighting ring, Seiya unleashes a strange blue light. After the fight, he meets with Docrates and Alman Kido. Kido warns Seiya that his ex-wife Vander Guraad is looking for him.
Guraad's warriors capture Docrates and pursue Seiya and Kido, who meet up with Mylock, Kido's assistant. Following a brief chase, Seiya, Mylock and Kido escape from the warriors. Seiya demands to know what is happening, but is knocked out by Mylock. Seiya recalls his sister's kidnapping while unconscious, and is later taken to Kido's hideout.
Kido informs Seiya that his adopted daughter Sienna Kido is the reincarnation of the goddessAthena, and Seiya is destined to become the Pegasus Knight, a warrior for Athena. Patricia knew about Seiya's destiny and gave herself up to protect him. Kido tells Seiya that he should train under Marin the  Eagle Knight, so that he can use his Cosmo to protect himself and Sienna, and to find Patricia.
While having breakfast with Seiya, Sienna briefly loses control of her Cosmo, but Kido is able to calm her down. Meanwhile, Cassios beats up several of Guraad's powerful prototype soldiers, and accepts an offer from Guraad to become one as well in exchange for exacting revenge on Seiya.
Seiya and Sienna get to know each other, and she convinces him to go to Marin for training. Seiya goes with Mylock to the mountain where Marin resides, and climbs up the mountain alone to meet with her. Seiya's training initially goes poorly, as he is unable to channel his Cosmo properly, but he keeps training with Marin's help. That night, Sienna experiences a vision of herself as Athena destroying Seiya's armor and causing widespread destruction, which causes her to emit another Cosmo burst.
Seiya eventually gains control of his Cosmo. His pendant glows and unlocks his Pegasus Knight Armor, but he experiences a vision while bonding with the armor, revealing that Kido was present when Guraad took Patricia. Seiya returns to Kido's hideout to confront him, but Sienna takes him away from the mansion. She reveals that she destroyed Guraad's arms when she was young, forcing Guraad to drain Cosmo from children with it to stay alive, and that Guraad let Patricia go when she learned that Patricia did not have any Cosmo.
Guraad arrives at Kido's hideout after her subordinate Nero tortures its location out of Docrates. Seiya and Sienna return to the mansion. Seiya fights off Guraad's soldiers, but he fails to activate his Pegasus Knight Armor while fighting Cassios, resulting in him being beaten unconscious. Kido sets his estate to self-destruct in an effort to stop Guraad, and he dies in the explosion. Sienna is knocked unconscious and captured by Guraad's soldiers, and Seiya is unable to stop them.
Guraad admits to Sienna that she has given up on fixing herself, and proceeds to start depleting Sienna's Cosmo to prevent her becoming a threat to the world. Mylock rescues Seiya, who forgives himself for being unable to rescue Patricia when she was taken. Mylock and Seiya travel to Guraad's base, where Seiya unlocks his Pegasus Knight Armor and defeats Guraad's soldiers and Cassios.
Guraad becomes unable to watch Sienna be drained of her energy and tries to stop the procedure, but Nero turns against her and assumes his Phoenix Knight Armor. Nero and Seiya proceed to fight, but are interrupted by Sienna, who has almost completed her transformation into Athena, causing widespread destruction. With Seiya's help, Sienna manages to regain control, but falls unconscious afterwards.
When she wakes up, Sienna's hair has turned long and purple. Sienna and Guraad reconcile, and Sienna restores Guraad's arms. Sienna and Seiya leave the area with Mylock; Nero watches them leave. Sienna reveals that the old gods are returning, and the Knights of the Zodiac will be needed to stop them. She decides that they will need to find Patricia.
Saint SeiyaauthorMasami Kurumadawanted to adapt it to alive-action filmalmost as long as he worked on the manga,[4]and in 2016,Toei Animationfirst revealed that such an adaptation was in development atCCXP.[5]Toei later gave the film an officialgreen-lightin May 2017 withTomasz Bagińskidirecting. It was originally to be a co-production withSony Picturesand Chinese company A Really Good Film Company,[6]who would later drop out.[4]The original screenplay was adapted by Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken,[6]with later additions by Kiel Murray.[7]The main cast was announced in September 2021, includingMackenyu,Madison Iseman,Sean Bean,Diego Tinoco,Famke Janssen,Nick Stahl, andMark Dacascos.[8]The theme song is "Courage" byPink, originally from her albumHurts 2B Human.[9]
Filming took place between July and September 2021 in Hungary and Croatia.[8]Andy Chengprovided the fight and stunt coordination.[10]
Knights of the Zodiacwas released theatrically in Latin America on April 27, 2023,[11]in Japan on April 28,[12]and in the United States on May 12.[13]
The film was released digitally on June 27, 2023, followed by aBlu-rayandDVDrelease on July 11.[14][better source needed]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 21% of 24 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "The animation's well done, but impressive visuals aren't enough to cover forKnights of the Zodiac's threadbare plot."[15]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 35 out of 100, based on eight critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[16]
Carlos Aguilar of theLos Angeles Timeswrote, "That Bagiński'sKnights of the Zodiacamounts to a well-intended disappointment doesn't mean it has zero merit as a work of entertainment, but it will neither satisfy the fandom's demands for a true-to-the-bone homage to their childhood favorite, nor will it transmit to outsiders why this tale of blind courage in the face of insurmountable odds has inspired such decades-long devotion."[17]Courtney Lanning of theArkansas Democrat-Gazettesaid, "The narrative and characters are swallowed by a storm of ill-conceivedCGIand unfortunate writing, another title in the long list of live-action anime adaptations that should deter similar future attempts."[18]
IGN's Matt Donato gave the film a score of 4/10, calling it "asmorgasbordof unimpressive digital effects as Baginski struggles to recreate the feel of anime in live action (thinkNetflix'sCowboy Bebopshow), boiling down Kurumada's vivid source material into a bland, loud, voiceless gruel with no substance."[19]
Eric Francisco ofInversepraised the film, saying that it was "secretly brilliant in itsholisticunderstanding of what makes anime appealing as a medium." He added, "Melodramatic characters, impenetrable worldbuilding, and acrobatic choreography are all hallmarks to some of the best anime.Zodiacis faithful to these eccentricities, which most 'real' Hollywood movies overlook in favor ofverisimilitude."[20]Common Sense Media's Tara McNamara gave the film 3/5 stars, likening it to a mashup ofClash of the TitansandFlash Gordonand saying, "Like those two movies,Knights of the Zodiacis likely to get groans from jaded adults, but it has that same potential to strike a chord with young viewers taken in by the spectacle and the possibility."[21]

The studio was founded by animators Kenzō Masaoka and Sanae Yamamoto in 1948 as Japan Animated Films(日本動画映画,Nihon Dōga Eiga)often shortened toNichidō Eiga(日動映画). In 1956, Toei purchased the studio and it was renamed Toei Doga Co., Ltd.(東映動画株式会社,Tōei Dōga Kabushiki-gaisha, "dōga" is Japanese for "video", and in some extent "animation"), doing business as Toei Animation Co., Ltd. outside Japan. In 1998, the Japanese name was renamed to Toei Animation. It has created a number of TV series and movies and adapted Japanese comics as animated series, many popular worldwide.Hayao Miyazaki,Isao Takahata,Yasuji Mori,Leiji MatsumotoandYōichi Kotabehave worked with the company.[5]Toei was a shareholder in the Japanese animesatellite televisionnetworkAnimaxwith other anime studios and production companies, such asSunrise,TMS EntertainmentandNihon Ad Systems Inc.[6][7][8]The company is headquartered in the Ohizumi Studio inNerima, Tokyo.[1]
Their mascot is the cat Pero, from the company's1969 film adaptationofPuss in Boots.

Although the Toei Company usually contracts Toei Animation to handle its animation internally, they occasionally hire other companies to provide animation; although the Toei Company produced theRobot Romance Trilogy,Sunrise(then known as Nippon Sunrise) provided the animation. Toei Company would also enlist the help of other studios such as hiring Academy Productions to produce the animation forSpace Emperor God Sigma, rather than use their own studio.

In addition to producing anime for release in Japan, Toei Animation began providing animation for American films and television series during the 1960s and particularly during the 1980s.

He then goes on to announce that he would not be supporting new Toei releases until the issue had been resolved, and also called for a boycott on the upcomingDragon Ball Super: Super Herofilm.[56]The dispute sparked discussion on YouTube on the vulnerability of creators against the copyright system and lack of fair use laws in Japan, with YouTubers such asPewDiePieandThe Anime Manspeaking out on the issue.[57][58]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
