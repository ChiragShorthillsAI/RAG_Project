Raúl Castillo Jr. was born to Raúl H. Castillo Sr. and Adela "Adelita" Rodríguez de Castillo.[3][4]He has an older brother, Tony, and a younger sister.[2][5]His parents areMexicanemigrants fromReynosa,Tamaulipas, Mexico,[2][6][7]who later moved toMcAllen, Texas, where he and his siblings were raised.[4]His hometown of McAllen was 90 percent Mexican-American.[8]Living so close to the Mexico–United States border, Castillo's family would often visit family members who still lived in Reynosa, affording him an upbringing that he describes as "very much bicultural."[6]Castillo states that growing up in a border town made him feel American when he visited Mexico, but Mexican when he traveled around the United States.[8]He explains he was "too American for Mexico, but too Mexican for the U.S."[9]He was raised Catholic.[10]His childhood nickname was "Gordo" ("fat", in Spanish), due to his weight.[11]
Castillo first became interested in acting in the third grade, after seeing his older brother in a school production ofThe Wizard of Ozas theTin Woodman. His brother also was a musician who played guitar,[12]his dedication having been seen by Castillo as he would sit and play scales for hours, which inspired Castillo to use the same technique later for his own performances.[12]He auditioned the next year for a school play, reportedly "about a mouse and a clock", but could not stop giggling during his audition and was cast instead in a non-speaking role as a guard.[5]While in sixth grade at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic School, Castillo met and befriended futureMutemathbassguitaristRoy Mitchell-Cárdenas.[7][13]Later, in high school, they started anundergroundpunk-rock band called IPM (short for "Influential Phecal Material") together with their friends Nick Trevino and Robert Vleck.[7][13][14][15]Mitchell-Cárdenas played drums while Castillo played bass guitar.[7][14][15]Before he began acting, Castillo considered pursuing a serious career as arock musician.[16]
Castillo states that he started acting when he was 14.[15]Seeking an elective class option when enteringMcAllen High School, and a way to make friends, he turned to theater, which was popular at his high school.[16]He became deeply involved in the high school drama department, which he says looked "fun".[3][15]His background playing music since age 11 made performing on stage feel natural for him.[3][15]His first acting role was in a high school production ofPaul Zindel's playThe Secret Affairs of Mildred Wild.[17]Castillo also performed in his school’s production ofI Remember Mama.[18]It was then, at age 14, that he met and became friends with future staff writer forDevious Maids,GirlsandLooking, Tanya Saracho, who also attended McAllen High School.[7][15]Saracho influenced Castillo greatly, introducing him to playwrights and encouraging to develop his own tastes in drama.[16]Castillo cites the 1993 filmCarlito's Wayas the film that "changed everything" for him.[16]He was inspired by the performances ofJohn Leguizamo,John Ortiz,Viggo Mortensen, andLuis Guzmánin particular.[16]He even memorized some of Leguizamo's phrases and dialogue, such as "Spic-O-Rama", "Mambo Mouth", and "Freak".[12]Castillo also found inspiration from several Hispanic artists in the media, includingMiguel Piñero, and an anthology of works from theNuyorican Poets Cafe.[9]He looked up to several actors, such asAl PacinoandAnthony Quinn, as icons, and spent much of his time watching the filmThe Outsiders.[12]
After graduating high school, Castillo went on to studyplaywritingas an undergraduate atBoston University College of Fine Arts,[3][17]though he continued to act, and majored in theater.[7][17]During his studies, Castillo felt that the most important skill he developed there was learning how to produce his own work.[5]He would regularly put on plays during the school's student-run playwright's festival.[5]This university offered festival gave Castillo a platform for his original work. Most of his early plays were heavy and serious, dealing with the sociopolitical and racial tensions on the border of Mexico and the United States,[12]including a trio of one-act plays calledBorder Stories, about life on the Mexico–United States border in Reynosa.[19]He graduated from Boston University in 1999.[19][20]
Castillo viewed himself as more of a writer, despite his performing abilities. It was not until after college, while performing the lead role in a 2000 production ofSantos & Santosat the Nushank Theater Collective inAustin, Texas,[21]that he felt encouraged in identifying as an actor as well.[7]He eventually moved toNew York Cityin 2002, which he describes as the smartest decision he made for his career.[5][22]
Castillo has an extensive off-Broadway theater career.[15]Right after college, Castillo performed in Austin, Texas in a 2000 production of "Santos & Santos", loosely based onJamiel Chagraand his brothers.[21]It was during that production that Castillo solidified his confidence in being a professional actor.[21]Castillo joined theLAByrinth Theater Companyas a writer shortly after moving to New York.[15]His on-stage acting debut was with the LAByrinth Theater Company's production ofJosé Rivera's playSchool of the Americasat New York'sPublic Theaterin 2006.[15][23]There he met actress and later co-starSandra Ohwhile she was performing in the Public Theater's production ofSatellites.[15]His performance as Beto in theEnsemble Studio Theatre's 2008 production of José Rivera'sFlowerswas described as "flawlessly nuanced" by Laura Collins-Hughes ofThe New York Sun.[24]In 2009, he performed in the Off-Broadway premier ofCusi Cram'sA Lifetime BurningatPremiere Stages.[25]In 2012, he was cast inGoodman Theater's production of the Cándido Tirado's playFish Men, about theGuatemalan genocide, in the lead role of Rey Reyes.[15][26]Castillo also appeared in the 2012 BareBones production ofJesus Hopped the 'A' Trainin Pittsburgh, the inaugural performance of which was directed byPhilip Seymour Hoffmanfor the LAByrinth Theater Company.[27]He later was cast in the BareBones reading ofThe Way Westat theLark Theater.[28]Castillo worked withINTAR Theater, cast in the role of Ismael in the theater's 2014 production ofAdoration of the Old Womanto positive reviews.[29][30]He starred alongside Sandra Oh in the role of Gerardo in the 2014Victory Gardens Theaterproduction ofDeath and the Maiden,[15]which was well received by critics.[31]Death and the Maidendeals with the lives of a couple, a woman who has dealt with some of the atrocities that have occurred under a dictatorship.[32]Castillo describes his heavy role as a "character dealing with the bureaucracy of government, trying to look into the crimes that were committed, specifically the deaths that were committed during the dictatorship".[32]Death and the Maidenwas originally produced on Broadway withGlenn Close,Richard Dreyfuss, andGene Hackman, but Latino actors such as Castillo felt undervalued when ethnic characters were not cast in a play by a Chilean playwright.[32]
Castillo first appeared in the 2005 short filmImmaculate Perception. He acted in several other short films until his feature film debut role as Ignacio in the 2007 independent film,Amexicano. The film was screened at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival and won the Jury Award for producer/director Matthew Bonifacio in the category ofNarrative Filmat the 2007Sonoma Valley Film Festival.[33]The film was released theatrically in 2008. He continued to appear in short films and independent films, such asMy Best Day, andBless Me, Ultima. His role in the 2011 independent filmCold Weathergarnered favorable reviews and praise from criticRoger Ebert.[34]His performance as Hector in the 2012Student Academy Award-winning short filmNarcocorridoearned him an Honorable Mention for Performance atAFI Fest 2012. His performance was praised as a "penetrating lead performance that conveys a sense of loss that leaves a lasting mark on the audience.”[35]In 2019, Castillo starred in the independent filmEl Chicano, drawing praise fromThe Hollywood Reporter, which noted that his "charismatic performance in the lead role carries much of the film's weight".[36]

Castillo describes his role inLookingas important to the LGBTQ and Latino community. In an interview withBackstage, Castillo states "Especially being a straight guy, I wanted to honor this character. And even though it wasn't representing the entire community—this was one story—I knew there would be a lot of expectations. I know, having done projects around the Latino community, that there were going to be a lot of people paying attention."[12]He toldOutmagazinethat he hopes that his character on the show will both enlighten and educate straight audiences, as well as shed light on some of the experiences of the gay Latino community.[8]Castillo and his character Richie gained a large social media following, using the hashtag #TeamRichie.[41]In the show's second season, Castillo was added as a regular cast member alongside co-stars Groff, Frankie J. Álvarez,Murray Bartlett, Lauren Weedman, andRussell Tovey.[6][42]Due to poor ratings, however, HBO decided to cancelLookingafter its second season.[12]HBO decided in lieu of a third season,Lookingwould end with a final full-length movie.[12]
In 2015, Castillo appeared asEduardo Flamingo, the emotionless, unfeeling villain onFox Broadcasting Company's drama seriesGotham.[43]
Castillo has long been interested inplaywriting, studying it in college and initially viewing himself as more of a playwright than an actor.[7][17]During college, Castillo regularly wrote plays for student-run playwright's festivals.[5]One of his college plays to be produced at the student festival was a trio of one-act plays calledBorder Stories, about life on the U.S.-Mexican border in Reynosa.[19]After moving to New York, he initially joined the LAByrinth Theater Company as a writer before also becoming an actor, and he remains a resident writer for LAByrinth.[39]Castillo's play,Knives and Other Sharp Objects, about class, race, and assimilation in South Texas, debuted at thePublic Theateras part of LAByrinth's works in development in 2009.[39]The play received moderate reviews.[44][45][46][47]His playBetween You, Me, and the Lampshadewas developed at theAtlantic Theater Companyand is set to premiere in 2015 with the Chicago-based Teatro Vista, the largest Latino Equity theater company in Illinois, at the Richard Christiansen Theater at the Victory Gardens Biograph Theatre.[5][42][48]Raul Castillo's dark comedyBetween You, Me and the Lampshadeexplores a family's life on the U.S.-Mexico border.[12]

When I would go to Mexico, my brother and sister and I would be thegringos. Then I went out to school in Boston and felt so un-American. Everyone always asked, "Where are you from?" I said, "Texas." And then they said, "No, where are youfromfrom?" Then I understood that this is what most of America is like, and that I grew up sheltered.
Despite having a bicultural upbringing, Castillo stated that he always felt American growing up, and that he and his siblings were considered "gringos" when they visited Mexico.[2]He identifies as Mexican-American.[39]Castillo describes his childhood as sheltered from racism and racial dynamics in the US due to McAllen's highHispanicandLatinopopulation. When Castillo moved to Boston to study acting, it was his first time experiencing life as an ethnic minority.[2][17]
Castillo is very close with his family.[7]Though he was raised Catholic, he describes himself currently as "not as religiously involved."[10]He describes his parents as "old school and traditional, [but] very open-minded."[2]Before shooting the pilot forLooking, Castillo wrote a letter to his family to explain the part and make them aware of the more explicit aspects of the show.

Jorge Ernesto Guzmán Rodríguez(born August 2, 1963), best known under hisring name,El Hijo del Santo(English: "The Son of the Saint"), is a Mexicanluchadorenmascarado(or maskedprofessional wrestler) and politicalactivist. He is the youngest child, out of eleven, ofEl Santo. Guzmán has also followed in his father's footsteps, as he has starred in severalluchador films.
He made his wrestling debut in February 1982 under the nameEl Korak, but officially adopted his most famous ring name and silver mask in October 1982. During his career, Guzmán has worked for every major Mexican wrestling promotion includingConsejo Mundial de Lucha Libre,Asistencia Asesoría y Administración,Universal Wrestling AssociationandWorld Wrestling Associationas well as stints with the World Wrestling Federation (nowWWE) in the United States as well as working in Japan forNew Japan Pro-Wrestling,All Japan Pro-Wrestlingand various other promotions. Early in his career, he formed a successfultag teamwithEddie GuerrerocalledLa Pareja Atomica, inspired by their fathers (El Santo andGory Guerrero) teaming up from the 1940s to the 1960s. From 1998 through 2006, he also formed a very successful team withNegro Casas.
Over the span of his career, Guzmán has held various championships, most significantly theAAA World Tag Team Championship,Mexican National Middleweight Championship,Mexican National Trios Championship,Mexican National Welterweight Championship,CMLL World Tag Team Championship,UWA World Lightweight Championship,UWA World Welterweight Championship,WWA Tag Team ChampionshipandWWA World Welterweight Championshipas well as an honorary championship awarded by theWorld Boxing Council. He has also won theLeyenda de Platatournament (held in honor of his father), the 1995 version of theCMLL International Gran Prixtournament and the 2004Gran Alternativatournament. In 1997, he was voted into theWrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame.
His son wrestles under the ring name Santo Jr., becoming the third-generation Guzmán to use the name "Santo". Guzmán's uncles,Black Guzmán, Pantera Negra and Jimmy Guzmán were also wrestlers. His nephew Axxel originally wrestled as "El Nieto del Santo" ("The Grandson of El Santo"), but Guzmán owned the rights to the "Santo" name and objected.
"Santito", as he is often called, was the only one of his father's 10 children to become a professional wrestler. He began wrestling without his father's consent in February 1982 as "El Korak" but he made his official debut as "El Hijo del Santo" in October of that year after he earned his college degree at theUniversidad Iberoamericanain Communication Science per his father's request. He shared his father's look, the silver mask, tights and cape, and moves but he is shorter than his father was and, although he would never become the same cultural icon, he has been said to be a better in-ring performer than his father.[3][4]
Early in his career, he wrestled mainly forWorld Wrestling Association(WWA) (TheTijuanacircuit) andUniversal Wrestling Association(UWA) (a promotion that worked in the Mexico City area) but he did make his debut for Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), the promotion that later becameConsejo Mundial de Lucha Libre(CMLL) inArena Mexico, in the summer of 1983. He also was voted "Rookie of the Year" in Mexico.[3]
He won his first title, theUWA World Lightweight Championship, in October 1985 and traded the title with Aristóteles.[5]He next feuded with Espanto Jr. (whose father feuded with the original El Santo) and Hijo del Santo took his mask. Espanto Jr. took Hijo del Santo's title but he regained it in 1988 and took Espanto Jr.'s hair as well after winning aLuchas de Apuestas(Spanish for "Bet match").[5]During this time, he also feuded withNegro Casas, who would become his most important opponent, and took his hair in a 1987 match in the Los Angeles Olympic Auditorium.[6]
In 1990, he debuted in Japan for Gran Hamada'sUniversal Lucha Librepromotion and moved up a weight class by winning theUWA World Welterweight Championshipas well as theWWA Welterweight Championship.[7][8]In late 1991, he left WWA and vacated the Welterweight title but continued to wrestle for UWA until the formation ofAsistencia Asesoría y Administración(AAA).[8]El Hijo del Santo regained the WWA Welterweight title and brought it with him to AAA. One of the first feuds he was put in was against Negro Casas' youngest brother,Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal took Hijo del Santo's WWA Welterweight title and won theMexican National Welterweight Championshipbut Hijo del Santo would come out on top of the feud and took both titles from Heavy Metal before he lost them again to another young star,Psicosis.[7][9]
His most memorable feud during his time with AAA was against the American team,Los Gringos Locos.Eddy Guerrero's stifferJapanesestyle offense, combined with "Love Machine"Art Barr's cocky mannerisms made Los Gringos Locos a very exciting yet hated tag team.[10]During the feud, they played up the oldPareja Atómicatag team which consisted of El Santo and Eddie's father,Gory Guerrero. Eddie turned on Santo, leading to a hair vs. mask challenge for theWhen Worlds Collidepay-per-view.[10]The match was changed at the last minute when Barr pleaded with AAA officials to be included on the show which would be broadcast in the United States. The new match was a double hair versus double mask match with Santo teaming with Octagón against Los Gringos Locos.[10]El Hijo del Santo andOctagónwere victorious in the critically acclaimed match that would receive a 5-star rating fromDave Meltzerbut it was the last stand for Los Gringos Locos as Barr died three weeks later. AAA ownerAntonio Peñatried to run an angle with an evil version of El Santo called "El Santo Negro" who supposedly came from South America. When the other members of Santo's family objected, the feud was scrapped and Hijo del Santo jumped to CMLL in 1995.[11]
The object of the jump was to revitalize his feud with Negro Casas. El Hijo del Santo lost a match to Casas at the CMLL 63rd Anniversary show on September 20, 1996, and took a brief hiatus.[12]While gone, Negro Casasturnedtécnico (face)and his former allies,Scorpio Jr.andBestia Salvajesaid they had a surprise for Casas. The set-up was a trios match with Negro Casas,El DandyandHéctor Garzaon thetécnicoside with Scorpio Jr. and Bestia Salvaje on therudo(or heel) side. El Hijo del Santo came down to the ring with Scorpio and Salvaje but was wearing a disguise and pretending to beEl Felino, the brother of Negro Casas. During the match, Scorpio and Salvaje began attacking Casas and the fans, unaware of the ruse, expected El Felino to save his brother from the beating. Once he entered the ring, Hijo del Santo removed the disguise and revealed himself as Scorpio and Salvaje's partner, thus turningrudofor the first time in his career.[11]
The fans were irate and fistfights broke out in the crowd as Hijo del Santo attacked Casas. The feud helped ease sagging business caused by the split with AAA and thedownturn of the Mexican economy. The following week, the two trios had a rematch and both El Dandy and Negro Casas challenged Santo to a hair vs. mask match. The match was made a triangle match on December 6, 1996. Santo took El Dandy's hair in a bloody match in front of a sold-out crowd in Arena Mexico. The feud would continue until the 64th anniversary show on September 19, 1997, where Negro Casas and Hijo del Santo faced off in a dramatic hair vs. mask match.[13]El Hijo del Santo won the match and began a slow face turn.
Although the angle was very successful and drew a lot of money for CMLL, Hijo del Santo continued to wrestle as a babyface throughout the country, even teaming withRey Mysterioin Tijuana. Hijo del Santo began to be at odds with his heel allies, namely Scorpio Jr. and Bestia Salvaje. Finally, in September 1998, the face turn was made official when Hijo del Santo's partners,Villano IIIandFuerza Guerreraturned on Santo. Scorpio Jr. and Salvaje joined in on the beat down, leading Santo's next big feud.
Santo worked in theWorld Wrestling Federationfrom 1998 to 1999 for Super Astros; Spanish-language television program.
Negro Casas and Hijo del Santo began teaming together and chased Scorpio and Salvaje's recently wonCMLL World Tag Team Championship.[14]They defeated Scorpio and Salvaje for the titles on February 5, 1999, by disqualification but Hijo del Santo and Casas refused to accept the titles. The big match in the feud was a mask/hair versus mask/hair tag match between the two teams at CMLL's 1999Homenaje a Dos Leyendasshow. Santo and Casas were victorious and took the tag titles as well.[14]El Hijo del Santo had a brief falling out with CMLL management and the tag titles were vacated.[14]He returned and won the tag titles again with Casas fromLos Guerreros del Infierno(Último GuerreroandRey Bucanero) but later lost them back to Los Guerreros in 2002.[14]El Hijo del Santo took another sabbatical from CMLL withPerro Aguayo Jr.filling in his spot on the roster. He returned to CMLL in the summer of 2004, initially to work withMísticoto help him become a main eventer and to feud with Aguayo and hisLa Furia del Nortegroup. After the feud ended, he had a program with young Guerreros recruitAvernoand they had a WWA Welterweight title match on October 22 where  Hijo del Santo retained and ended his tour with the company.[15]
El Hijo del Santo has continued wrestling as an independent worker doing shows all over Mexico. He even started his own promotion calledTodo x el Todo. The promotion's main show so far was a "25 Year Anniversary Show" shown byTelevisa, a testament to Hijo del Santo's appeal as Televisa rarely show independent promotions. The show featured aRelevos suicidastournament where the losing teams advance until the finals, where the final team would fight each other over who would unmask. El Hijo del Santo ended up unmasking Pentagón Black in the finals, which meant that he booked himself to lose three times during the tournament.[16]Around the time of Hijo del Santo's 25th Anniversary, theWorld Boxing Council(WBC) named him their "WBC World Wrestling Champion" complete with title belt due to his "significant accomplishments in wrestling".[17]While the title is technically an honorary championship Hijo del Santo defended it several times in 2008. In 2008, Hijo del Santo began running shows inLondon, England featuring independent talent from Mexico.
On May 11, 2013, Hijo del Santo and his rival, Blue Demon Jr., joined forces to win the Pro Wrestling Revolution Tag Team Championship fromBrian Cageand Derek Sanders.[18]
On November 25, 2013, Santo announced a break to repair damage in his spinal area.[19]After successful rehabilitation returned to the ring, teaming with his son El Santo Jr. at a Lucha Ilimitado card in Yakima, Washington on October 12, 2016, and closing out 2016 with two matches alongside his son in Tijuana on December 16 and in Ciudad Juarez on December 18.
Like his father, Hijo del Santo has also crossed over into other media. He is the subject of acomic bookpublished and appeared on the Mexican reality showDía de Perros. He was also the star of a 5 episode animated series on the Mexican version ofCartoon NetworktitledSanto vs The Clones. In 2007, he became a spokesperson forWildcoast, an environmental non-profit organization, and campaigned to save sea turtles on the Gulf of Mexico from extinction. He has also been involved ingray whalecampaigns and Tijuana clean-ups on behalf of Wildcoast.[20]
Hijo del Santo has appeared in several films, first with his father and then on his own or with other famous luchadores. In 2001 he starred in the filmInfraterrestre, which received positive reviews from critics such as the respected Mexican film critic, David Wilt.[21]In 2007 he appeared in the filmMil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy(also known asMil Mascaras: Resurrection),[22]which also received positive reviews.[23]
In March 2013, it was announced that one of Hijo del Santo's sons was going to travel to Japan to train inPro Wrestling Noahwrestling school to prepare him for his wrestling debut under the ring name "El Nieto del Santo" ("The Grandson of El Santo"). The training started in May 2013 and he was set to return to Mexico three months later for his official in-ring debut.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
