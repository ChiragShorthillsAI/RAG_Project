At Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a once-successful abandonedpizzeria, a terrified night security guard attempts to flee from the building but is captured and strapped to a torture device, which kills him.
Sometime later, mall security guard Mike Schmidt is fired for assaulting a negligent father whom he mistook for a kidnapper. Mike's career counselor, Steve Raglan, offers him a job as a night guard at the pizzeria. Though initially reluctant, Mike accepts aftersocial servicesthreaten to take custody of his younger sister, Abby, and pass her to their estranged aunt, Jane, who desires the monthly custody payments.
During his first night, Mike falls asleep and dreams about the kidnapping of his little brother, Garrett. He meets five children who also witnessed the crime, but they flee when he approaches them. The following day, Jane hires a gang of vandals, which includes Abby's babysitter, Max, to vandalize the pizzeria to get Mike fired and hasten Jane's custody of Abby. At Mike's shift that night, he meetspolice officerVanessa Shelly, who explains that the building closed during the 1980s after five children went missing there. Once Mike's shift ends and he leaves, the vandals break in, but the pizzeria'sanimatronic mascots— Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Mr. Cupcake — kill the entire group. Max's disappearance forces Mike to bring Abby along on his next shift, in which the animatronics befriend Abby and Mike discovers that they are possessed by the ghosts of the missing children, who consistently mention a "yellow rabbit".
On the fourth night, Abby is accidentally injured when she, Mike, and Vanessa are bonding with the animatronics. The next morning, Mike reluctantly gets Jane to babysit a frustrated Abby as he goes back to the pizzeria and takes some sleeping pills. The children appear in his dream again and tell him that he can stay with Garrett forever in exchange for Abby. Mike initially accepts, but when he changes his mind, he is attacked. After being strapped to the torture device that killed the previous guard and narrowly escaping, Mike is cornered and injured by Foxy. Meanwhile, a damaged yellow Freddy animatronic,[a]possessed by the leader of the children, kills Jane and takes Abby back to the pizzeria.
Vanessa treats Mike's injuries and reveals that she is the daughter of William Afton, the serial killer who kidnapped and murdered Garrett and the other children. He hid their bodies in the animatronics, and now, their souls are under his control. Realizing the animatronics plan to kill Abby and have her join them in theafterlife, Mike rushes to the pizzeria. He defeats the animatronics, but Steve arrives wearing the "yellow rabbit" suit,[b]reactivates them, and reveals himself to be Afton. Mike tries to incapacitate Afton, but is easily overpowered. Vanessa also attempts to stop Afton, but he stabs her with a knife. An injured Mike reminds Abby that the animatronics like drawings and tells her to show them what really happened. Abby draws a picture of Afton murdering the children to free them from his influence and make them realize the truth. With Mike's help, Abby shows the drawing to the animatronics, who turn on Afton. Mr. Cupcake bites off part of Afton's suit, triggering its internal springlock mechanisms, which trap and fatally wound him. As the animatronics drag Afton away, Mike and Abby carry Vanessa out of the collapsing pizzeria.
Some time later, Vanessa has fallen into acomaand is hospitalized, while Mike and Abby have reconciled and resume their normal lives. Back at the pizzeria, the leader of the children watches a dying Afton in the suit before leaving him to his fate.

Five Nights at Freddy'sreceived generally negative reviews from critics.[56]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 32% of 214 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "Loaded with Easter eggs,Five Nights at Freddy'smay be fun to watch for fans of the game, but most viewers of any other persuasion will find this adaptation muddled and decidedly unscary."[57]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 33 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[58]Audiences surveyed byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled atPostTrakgave it a 77% overall positive score.[49]
Murtada Elfadl ofVarietyfelt the animatronic characters were underutilized, with the film instead focusing on "a baffling plot and backstory for their protagonist". He also criticized a perceived lack of effective jump scares and concluded, "In trying to adapt the game for the screen, they forgot what makes the original special, wringing unintentional laughter from its bizarre story instead of entertaining audiences".[59]Dylan Roth ofThe New York Observergave the film a score of one out of five and wrote, "There are jump scares, but no real thrills. There are jokes, but no genuine laughs".[60]
The Guardian'sBenjamin Lee gave a two out of five rating, arguing "The low-stakes, late-night thrill we expect from the material never arrives, held back by a mixture of indecisive restraint and misplaced self-importance.Five Nights at Freddy'sis somehow a slog to get through and will be promptly forgotten by morning".[61]The New York Times'sNatalia Winkelmann expressed similar criticisms: "...[Although]Five Nights at Freddy's, based on a popular video game franchise, reaches for horror-comedy flair, this dreary, mild adaptation never achieves the hybrid pleasures of a movie likeM3GAN. You may chuckle, but it's hard to tell if the movie is laughing with you".[62]RogerEbert.com's Simon Abrams, giving a two out of four rating, was also negative: "Five Nights at Freddy’shas most of the right elements for a good post-Amblin kiddy fright-fest, except maybe good dialogue and distinct characters. Watching the movie, one gets the sense that the games' morbid personality has been sanded down to its most generic jump-scares and banal revelations."[63]Kevin MaherofThe Timesgave the film a rating of one out of five and said, "LikeTeletubbieswith chainsaws, or knife-wielding Fimbles, it's absurd. But not in a good way."[64]
Meagan Navarro ofBloody Disgustinggave a score of three out of five and wrote, "It's the type of handsomely made, charming creature feature that'll play well at slumber parties or rowdy theaters full of obsessed fans, which is precisely its target audience.Five Nights at Freddy'swon't scare the pants off of seasoned horror fans; the animatronic denizens of Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria will likely make you want to hug them instead".[65]Total Film'sNeil Smith scored the film a two out of five and ended his review, "With robot heads containing flesh-mangling chainsaws, faces resembling that of battle-scarredTerminators, and the lumbering gait ofRomerozombies, Freddy Fazbear and his pals would seem precision-tooled for terror. Sadly, though, they are about as scary asBarneythe purple dinosaur in what is ultimately a ploddingly predictable, gore-lite yawner".[42]
Mark Kennedy of theAssociated Pressstated: "Caught between PG and R, as well as lost at the crossroads of inadvertent comedy and horror, the PG-13Five Nights at Freddy'shas to go down as one of the poorest films in any genre this year".[66]Similarly, theChicago Tribune'sMichael Phillips condemned "the film's attempt to be a cuddly version ofSaw, with faces getting sliced open by a robo-critter's whirring saw blades", going on to say "To keep the PG-13 rating intact, the camera and editor cut away just before the splurch, nearly every time... The premise, meantime, ofFive Nights at Freddy's... very likely would've made more sense as a straight-up R-rated splatterfest."[67]
In August 2018, Cawthon said that if the first film were to be successful, there could be a second film that follows the events ofthe second game.[18]In January 2023, in an interview on thepodcastWeeklyMTG, Lillard revealed that he signed a three-picture deal with the studios.[41]In January 2024, despite Blumhouse's vice president of feature film development Ryan Turek claiming a sequel was not yet green-lit,[73]Hutcherson revealed the sequel was in development.[74]In April 2024, Blumhouse officially confirmed the sequel,[75]and thatJim Henson's Creature Shopwould return to design animatronics for the film.[76]Filming for the sequel began in the fall of 2024 in Louisiana.[77]In October 2024, a teaser poster for the film was revealed, showing the character Toy Freddy with the number 2 and the film's release date.[78]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
