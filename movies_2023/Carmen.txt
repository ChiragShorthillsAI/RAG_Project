After the disbandment of Fila Fresh Crew in 1988, Curry promptly began recording solo work.No One Can Do It Betterpeaked at number 20 on theBillboard200and spawned two number one songs on theHot Rap Songschart: "It's Funky Enough" and "The D.O.C. & The Doctor". Shortly after the album's release, Curry suffered a severe car crash that permanently changed his voice. Since his accident, he has released two more albums,Helter Skelterin 1996 andDeucein 2003. In 2015, his voice fully recovered.
At the66th Annual Grammy Awards, Curry won aGrammy Lifetime Achievement Awardalong with N.W.A., alongsideIce Cube,MC Ren, andDJ Yella.
The D.O.C. was a natural, by far the most gifted rapper I have ever heard.  You can talk all you want aboutSlick RickorRakim.  The D.O.C.'s machine-gun mouth takes the title.  No one could do it better.
Tracy Lynn Curry was born on June 10, 1968, in Dallas, Texas. As a teenager, Curry began his career as a member ofFila Fresh Crew, a hip hop trio that originated in Dallas, Texas. While in the group, Curry was known asDoc-T.
In 1987, Fila Fresh Crew had four songs featured on the compilation albumN.W.A and the Possewhich featured various other artists; the same four tracks would later appear on the group's albumTuffest Man Alive, which was released in 1988. Though the album would produce three singles, the group disbanded not long after its release. By this point, Curry had moved toLos Angelesand become acquainted with members ofN.W.AandRuthless Records.
Curry would begin using the name the D.O.C. after he was signed toEazy-E'sRuthless Records. The D.O.C. contributed lyrics toN.W.A's debut studio album,Straight Outta Compton,[2]and performed the opening verse on "Parental Discretion Iz Advised". Curry also wrote for Eazy-E's debut studio album,Eazy-Duz-Itand co-wrote "Keep Watchin'" fromMichel'le'sself-titled debut album.
In 1989, the D.O.C. released his solo debut, theDr. Dre-producedNo One Can Do It Better. The album was very well received by critics, and sold well, peaking at no. 20 on theBillboard200for two consecutive weeks; by 1994, the album reached Platinum status.[3]Allmusicgives the album a five-star rating and describes it as "an early landmark of West Coast Rap" as well as "an undeniable masterpiece".No One Can Do It Betterproduced five singles and five music videos.
In November 1989, five months after the release ofNo One Can Do It Better, Curry was involved in a near-fatal car crash. Driving home from a party, hefell asleep at the wheeland his car veered off the freeway. Curry, who was not wearing aseat belt, was thrown out the rear window, slamming face-first into a tree. His injuries required 21 hours of plastic surgery, and he spent 2½ weeks in the hospital. He could not speak for about a month, and he was left with a different, raspier voice.[4]In a 2015 interview withDJ Vlad, Curry stated that he was under the influence of alcohol and cannabis and was actually pulled over before the accident but the police let him go.[5]
The D.O.C. continued to write for N.W.A and contributed lyrics and minor vocals to their 1990 EP100 Miles and Runnin', where he co-wrote all the songs except for "Just Don't Bite It" and "Kamurshol", and their final albumNiggaz4Life.
The D.O.C. was the guy that came up with those great stories. He was probably the single most influential person ingangsta rap.
In 1991, the D.O.C. left Ruthless Records along with Dr. Dre and Michel'le to sign with newly foundedDeath Row Records. The D.O.C. also used his talents as one of the writers for Dr. Dre's debut solo albumThe Chronic, contributing to the tracks "Nuthin' but a G Thang", "Lil' Ghetto Boy", "A Nigga Witta Gun", "Lyrical Gangbang" and "Bitches Ain't Shit".  He also appeared on the skit track "The $20 Sack Pyramid".  He is referenced by name in "Nuthin' but a G Thang", and appears in the song's video as well.  The liner notes toThe Chronicsay, "I want to give a special shout out to The D.O.C. for talking me into doin' this album."  His name is mentioned bySnoop Doggin theintroof the album. ("Peace to da D.O.C., still makin' it funky enough").
In addition toThe Chronic, the D.O.C. worked on Snoop Dogg's debut albumDoggystyle, and added some vocals on the song "Serial Killa". The D.O.C. continued to be aghostwriterfor various songs on Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg albums. "Real Muthaphuckkin G's", fromEazy-E's 1993 extended playIt's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa, includes lyrics sampled from "It's Funky Enough" in the song's hook.
In 1996, the D.O.C. attempted a comeback following the car crash which severely damaged his vocal cords. The album, titledHelter Skelter, produced two singles with music videos.Helter Skelterwas widely ignored and even somewhat discredited by the D.O.C. himself.[7]The name of the album is a reference toCharles Manson's idea ofThe Beatles' "Helter Skelter" prophesying the end of the world.
The title and concept behind this album were originally developed by Dr. Dre as a collaborative effort between him andIce Cube, titledHeltah Skeltah. At that time, however, the D.O.C. had become disillusioned withDeath Row Recordsand Dre, having received no payment for his workghostwritingat Death Row.[citation needed]So in late 1994, D.O.C. decided to leave Death Row and headed toAtlanta. Taking lyrics he had already written forHeltah Skeltah, he recordedHelter Skelter, keeping the name to spite Dre.[7]His lyrics were inspired by the writings ofMilton William Cooper, which is especially noticeable in songsSecret PlanandWelcome to the New World.
In 1997, the D.O.C. founded his own Dallas-based record label,Silverback Records.[8]The D.O.C. introduced Dallas rapper 6Two to Dre, who featured him on his 1999 comeback album2001; Curry also provided lyrics for the album.[9]On July 20, 2000, the D.O.C. appeared on stage with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg atThe CentruminWorcester, Massachusettsduring theUp in Smoke Tour.[10]
In 2003, the D.O.C. released his third album entitledDeuceon Silverback Records. The album was originally meant to be a 6Two album, completely produced by Dr. Dre and released throughAftermath Entertainment. However, D.O.C. and Dre argued over whether D.O.C. should be rapping on the album.[11]The D.O.C.'s presence on this album is minimal however, making an appearance to introduce tracks or perform in skits such as "My Prayer" and "Souliloquy". The only single released fromDeucewas "The Shit", which features former-N.W.AmembersMC RenandIce Cube, along with Snoop Dogg and 6Two.Deucefocuses primarily on showcasing other artists on D.O.C.'s Silverback Records label, including U.P.-T.I.G.H.T., El Dorado, and in particular, 6Two.
The D.O.C. wrote lyrics for Snoop Dogg's albumTha Blue Carpet Treatment.[12]In December 2006, the D.O.C. revealed that he was working on his fourth album, entitledVoices Through Hot Vessels, and stated that it would be released after Dr. Dre's upcoming third albumDetox, which was scrapped in favor of 2015'sCompton.[13]In a May 2008 interview, the D.O.C. stated that he and Dre were working on the album, explaining "There is an album, and you got the title, but that's also because that's the title Dre likes. Dre and I decided to do another D.O.C. album after thisDetoxrecord. We decided to do one more together and end our story the right way."[14][15]
After the release of the biopicStraight Outta Compton, the D.O.C. revealed that his natural voice had returned if he had concentrated, and that he recorded new music, although he was not ready to release anything yet. Although he is not mentioned in the songwriting credits, the D.O.C. claimed that he helped write Dr. Dre's third albumCompton.[16]
In 2022, he collaborated with Codefendants, a newPunk Rapgroup formed byCeschi, Sam King (Get Dead), andFat Mike(NOFX) on a track called "The Fast Ones", which was featured on their debut album, “This is Crime Wave”. This marked the first new recording featuring D.O.C. in 19 years.[17]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
