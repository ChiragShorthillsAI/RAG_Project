In the film, John Wick sets out for revenge on the High Table and those who left him for dead.
Development of the fourthJohn Wickfilm, formally announced byLionsgatein May 2019, was confirmed before the release of its predecessor. It is the first film in the franchise that was not written by franchise creatorDerek Kolstad; Hatten was hired in May 2020, then Finch in March 2021.Principal photographytook place from June to October 2021 in France, Germany, New York City, and Japan.
The planned release on May 21, 2021, was delayed by theCOVID-19 pandemic.[5]John Wick: Chapter 4premiered at theOdeon Luxe Leicester SquareinLondonon March 6, 2023, and was released in the United States on March 24. The film received acclaim from critics, with praise for its action sequences, Stahelski's direction, cinematography, choreography, visual style, writing, score, and performances, and has grossed $440.1 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film in the franchise, as well as theninth-highest-grossing film of the year domesticallyin the United States.
The film will be released in China theatrically on 14 March 2025, making it the first movie in the franchise to be screened in China. This is widely believed to be possible due to the participation ofDonnie Yenas one of the leads in the film, with local marketing highlighting Yen's arrival to the franchise and performance.
A spin-off/prequel, titledFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina, is set for release on June 6, 2025, with another spin-off film focusing on the character of Caine in development.
InNew York City,John Wickrecovers and prepares to exact vengeance against the High Table while hiding underground with the Bowery King.[a]He travels toMoroccoand kills the Elder, the "one who sits above the Table". In response, High Table memberMarquisVincent Bisset de Gramont summons New York Continental Hotel manager Winston and hisconciergeCharon, where he explains that the High Table has given him unlimited resources to kill John and chastises Winston for previously failing to do so. As punishment, the Marquis strips Winston of his managerial duties, declares him "excommunicado", destroys the New York Continental, and executes Charon. The Marquis then enlists John's old friend, Caine – a blind, retired High Table assassin – to kill him, threatening to murder Caine's daughter.
John takes refuge at theOsakaContinental, run by his friend Shimazu Koji. The Marquis' second-in-command, Chidi, backed by High Table assassins and Caine, arrives to investigate the hotel. Koji's daughter Akira, the hotel's concierge, evacuates the hotel just before the High Table "deconsecrates" it, igniting amelee. John fights through waves of armored assassins, leading to a showdown against Caine. Abounty hunternamed Mr. Nobody interrupts their fight and allows John to escape after determining the currentbountyfor killing John to be insufficient. A wounded Koji repeatedly attacks Caine on John's behalf until Caine reluctantly kills Koji but spares Akira.
John returns to New York and meets with a vengeful Winston at Charon's gravesite. Winston suggests that John invoke an old High Table tradition to challenge the Marquis to aduel. Winning would free John of all obligations to the High Table, but he can only request a duel on behalf of a crime family. John travels to theBerlinheadquarters of theRuska Romacrime syndicate, with whom he had severed ties, to request readmission. His adoptive sister Katia stipulates that for readmission, John must kill Killa Harkan, a High Table member who was paid by the Marquis to murder her father. Killa sets up an ambush at his nightclub, but with the aid of Caine and Mr. Nobody, John manages to kill him and regain his status. Winston relays John's challenge to the Marquis, acting as John's "second" and requests that, should John win, his excommunicado be revoked and he be reinstated as manager of the rebuilt New York Continental, fully funded by the High Table; should John lose, however, Winston would also die.
InParis, John and the Marquis decide on the duel's parameters –dueling pistolsat sunrise the following day atSacré-Cœur– in a meeting moderated by the Harbinger, the Table's emissary. The Marquis nominates a reluctant Caine to take his place, while the Harbinger warns that both John and Winston will be executed should either fail to appear on time. The Bowery King arrives in Paris to give John a pistol and a newballistic suit. The Marquis intends to prevent John from arriving at the duel in time by placing a $26 million bounty on him. John fights off hordes of assassins on his way to Sacré-Cœur, including Mr. Nobody, who negotiates a bounty increase to $40 million. During their confrontation, John prevents Chidi from killing Mr. Nobody's dog, causing Mr. Nobody to abandon his pursuit of John.
After Caine and Mr. Nobody assist John in fighting off several assassins – including Chidi, whom Mr. Nobody kills – on theRue Foyatier, they reach the summit just in time for the duel. John and Caine wound each other through two rounds of dueling, and the third round comes to a halt when Caine severely wounds John. Demanding the right to administer thecoup de grâce, the Marquis eagerly swaps places with Caine. Winston chides the Marquis for his arrogance, revealing that John had not fired his third bullet. John then promptly executes the Marquis with a headshot, ending the duel. The Harbinger grants John and Caine (as well as his daughter) their freedom from the High Table and reinstates Winston as Hotel Manager of the New York Continental, which will be rebuilt with the High Table's funds. John reflects upon his life and marriage before collapsing from his injuries. Some time later, back in New York, Winston and the Bowery King bid farewell to John at a gravestone with his name, located next to one for his wife Helen.[b]During his farewell to John, Winston calls him "мой сын" (Russiantransl."my son").
In apost-credits scene, Caine returns to Paris to reunite with his daughter, but is approached by a vengeful, knife-wielding Akira.

You will be of service.John Wick: Chapter 4is coming – May 21, 2021".[30]In early August 2020, Lionsgate CEOJon Feltheimerstated during an earnings call, "We're also busy preparing scripts for the next two installments of ourJohn Wickaction franchise, withJohn Wick 4slated to hit theatres Memorial Day weekend 2022. We hope to shoot bothJohn Wick 4and5back to back when Keanu becomes available early next year."[31][32]
Before the third film's release, directorChad Stahelskiconfirmed on aReddit"AMA" thread that there had been discussion for another film, and that he would be involved with the project should the third film be successful.[33][34]Despite this announcement back then, it was not confirmed if starKeanu Reeveswould return for a new installment. However, he toldGQthat he would carry on the role as long as the audience wanted it, saying, "As far as my legs can take me, as far as the audience wants to go."[30]
Stahelski later teased the fourth film in an interview withIndieWireby saying Wick would not end the fourth film with "a happy ending", saying, "John may survive all this shit but at the end of it, there's no happy ending. He's got nowhere to go. Honestly, I challenge you right now, here's a question for you: How do you fucking want me to end it? Do you think he's going to ride off into the fucking sunset? He's killed 300 fucking people and he's just going to [walk away], everything's okay? He's just going to fall in love with a love interest? If you're this fucking guy, if this guy exist[ed], how is this guy's day going to end? He's fucked for the rest of his life. It's just a matter of time."[30][35]Additionally, Stahelski teased Winston's fate in the fourth film, saying, "He meant to shoot him. Did he mean to kill him? That's open for interpretation, you can take it one of two ways, and that's kind of where we pick up some of the unanswered questions inJohn Wick 4."[36]The studio opted to move on from series creatorDerek Kolstadand instead hiredShay Hattento write the script in May 2020.[37][38]In February, Stahelski brought Ricky Staub and Dan Walser on board to write the film after being impressed with their filmConcrete Cowboy.[39]In March 2021, screenwriting duties were passed ontoPredatorsscreenwriter Michael Finch.[40]
The writing of the film was placed in the hands of Shay Hatten and Michael Finch. In an interview with Finch byLoopermagazine, Finch stated that there were several previous films which influenced his writing stating: "A lot of this begins with Chad being inspired by other films, other genres of film, be itOnce Upon a Time in the West,The Good, the Bad and the Uglyor be itBullittorDirty Harryor aZatoichifilm."[41]The role played by the blind assassin portrayed by Donnie Yen references the blind swordsman in the Japanese film series centred on the character of Zatoichi.[41]The name of the character Killa Harkan is a reference to Berlin-based Turkish rapperKilla Hakan.[42][43]
When the fourth film was announced, Reeves reported having begun his training course forJohn Wick 4andThe Matrix Resurrections.[44]In May 2021, it was announced thatRina Sawayamawould make her feature film debut inJohn Wick Chapter 4.[16]She was selected due to the role requiring someone who can do choreography, and Stahelski had seen her music[45]videos for "XS" and "Bad Friend" that feature dance and fighting, respectively.[46]The following month,Laurence Fishburne,[47]Hiroyuki Sanada,[48]Donnie Yen,[49]Bill Skarsgård,[50]Shamier Anderson,[51]andScott Adkinswere cast in the film.[52]Sanada was initially courted to portray Zero inChapter 3, but dropped out due to a torn Achilles tendon injury.[53][54]In July 2021,Lance Reddickwas confirmed to be reprising his role as Charon,[55]andIan McShanewas confirmed to be reprising his role as Winston.[20]Clancy Brownjoined the cast that August.[56]
Most of the weapons used in the film were chosen from stock and custom weapon design firms and were already in existence before filming.[57]De Gramont nominates a reluctant Caine to fight in his place in a duel using enhanced 20th-centuryThompson/Center Contendersin the sunrise scene atSacré-Cœur.[58]The Bowery King when he arrives in Paris hands John a custom 21-round Pit Viper pistol manufactured by TTI.[57][59]
Near the start of the film, the character of Caine is shown handling an opulent gold watch from the jewelerCarl F. Buchererwith an image portrait of his daughter inside of the gold case closure lid.[60]
Principal photographybegan on June 28, 2021, on a $100million budget, and took place in France, Germany, New York City, and Japan.[2][61]Several French crew, including thelocation manager, described filming in Paris as "hell"; due to a two-week delay filming in Germany, Stahelski had less time to scout Paris and would improvise and change locations last minute.[62]Filming took place atLuxembourg Gardensand theChurch of St. Eustache. The introductory scene was filmed in a Parisian "sunken cathedral", "La Défense Cathedral". The chase-shootout around theArc de Triomphewas finished at a disused airport nearBerlin. The efforts of the location team were recognized by theLocation Managers Guild Internationalwith their 2023LMGI Award.[63]The top-downlong takeaction sequence was inspired by the video gameThe Hong Kong Massacreand was filmed on a purpose-built set.[64]An alternate ending in which John visits his grave was filmed but abandoned after receiving a "violent reaction" fromtest audiences.[65]
Filming concluded on October 27.[66]
Stahelski described an early cut ofJohn Wick: Chapter 4as "screwed" because the expandedworldbuildingof its title character and the introduction of new characters took 225 minutes of screen time. Nathan Orloff edited the film substantially to reduce the runtime to 169 minutes.[1][67]The film was originally subtitledHagakure, to matchParabellum.[68]
Tyler Batesand Joel J. Richard return to compose the score for the film, after doing so for the previous three films.The soundtrack albumwas released byLakeshore Recordson March 24, 2023.[69]
The movie features EDM tracks from widely-known artists in the genre, likeGesaffelsteinandJustice,[70][71]as well asLe Castle Vania, whose work largely consisted of remixes of his work from the first two films. Most of the artists featured in the soundtrack are French, and therefore fit with the majority of the third act of the movie taking place in Paris.[72][73]
John Wick: Chapter 4was released on March 24, 2023.[74]
Lionsgate officially announced the film in May 2019 duringParabellum's opening week, with a scheduled release date of May 21, 2021.[35][75][76]On May 1, 2020,IndieWirereported that the fourth film's release had been delayed to May 2022 by the COVID-19 pandemic and Reeves' commitments toThe Matrix Resurrections, which had been slated for release on the same day asWick 4. "The Matrix 4was only four weeks in when this all happened"—that is, production was halted, Stahelski said, "So, Keanu's gotta go finish his commitment up onThe Matrix, which is a big deal and which I think will probably take him until the end of the year. Then we have to go into our prep mode and then we'll start. So release dates...who knows right now."[77]
The film's release was further delayed to March 24, 2023, in part to avoid opening againstTop Gun: Maverick.[5][78]The film had itspremiereat theOdeon Luxe Leicester Squarein London on March 6, 2023.[79]It also had a special screening at theSouth by Southweston March 13, 2023.[80]It was released in South Korea on April 12, 2023.[81]The film was released in Japan asJohn Wick: Consequences.[82][83]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 94% of 374 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's consensus reads: "John Wick: Chapter 4piles on more of everything—and suggests that when it comes to a well-dressed Keanu Reeves dispatching his enemies in lethally balletic style, there can never be too much."[99]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100, based on 58 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[100]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, the best of the series, while those polled byPostTrakgave it a 93% positive score, with 82% saying they would definitely recommend it.[92]
Frank ScheckofThe Hollywood Reportergave the film a positive review, calling it "bigger, badder, bolder, longer, and featuring nearly more spectacular set pieces than one movie can comfortably handle, this epic action film practically redefines the stakes."[101]Tom Jorgensen ofIGNgave the film a 10/10 score, describing it as a "modern epic" and "bursting at the seams with creative, thrillingly staged action choreography and cinematography" while giving particular praise to the performances of Reeves, Yen and Skarsgård.[102]In a five-star review forIndieWire, Rafael Motamayor praised the film as the "best American action blockbuster sinceGeorge Miller'sMad Max: Fury Road". He praised the additions to the franchise's "ludicrously complex" mythology, citing the film's grounded character relationships and cinematographer Dan Lausten's use ofneoncolors and his technique of shooting a single-shot fight scene.[103]
Chicago Sun-Times'sRichard Roepergave the film three out of four stars, writing "Somewhere inside the utterly unnecessary, bloated running time forJohn Wick IV, there's a brilliant, stripped-down, 100-minute classic of a drive-in action film, where the admittedly breathtaking action sequences don't grind on for so long that they become borderline tedious."[104]Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkerwas ambivalent on much of the film, but found that the "giddily intense, swoony, swashbuckling, and sensational" ending makes the rest of the film "worth sitting through".[105]The Daily Nebraskan's Evan Dondlinger highly praised the film, calling it "what all action movies should be", and hailed it as a "masterclass of stunt coordination, color in cinema and grand storytelling".[106]
Charles Bramesco ofThe Guardiangave the film two out of five stars, writing: "Those who appreciated the original for its brutal, sinewy agility have another thing coming: a lumbering, stultifying gargantuan of a film willing to kill everything except its darlings."[107]Reviewing the film forConsequence, Liz Miller gave the film a C+ and said: "WatchingJohn Wick: Chapter 4sometimes felt like watching an above-average assembly cut. At an unwieldy two hours and 49 minutes, your eye will immediately be drawn to what cuts through the noise – and there are plenty of these moments. But 'moments' does not a well-told 'movie' make."[108]Conversely,Nerdist's Michael Walsh hailed the film as one of the best action films ever made, remarking "By the time the credits rolled, I was ready to run through a brick wall. I had so much adrenaline pumping through me I wanted to bench-press a bus. [...] The only other time I walked out of a theater feeling that way wasMad Max: Fury Road.John Wick: Chapter 4isn’t just the best installment in the series. It's on the very short list of greatest action movies ever made".[109]
In 2023,Esquirenamed the film Reeves's seventh-best,[143]andComic Book ResourcesandTheWrapnamed it that year's best action film.[144][145]In 2024,Collidernamed it the 13th-best action film of all time,[146]The Guardiannamed it Reeves's fourth-best,[147]andGamesRadar+named it his second-best.[148]
A fifth film was originally intended to be shot back-to-back withChapter 4.[32]However, by March 2021, after theCOVID-19 pandemicaffected production on the fourth film, these plans were no longer moving forward, with theChapter 4'sending being reworked to conclude the series with Wick's fate. Stahelski said that the reason he and Reeves abandoned plans for a sequel was his skepticism over his ability to "deliver two uniquely special experiences". Lionsgate initially demurred at the duo's plan to retire Reeves's character, but eventually acquiesced.[6]Although Stahelski and Reeves insisted that Wick was dead, Lionsgate presidentJoe Drakelater hinted at the possibility of a fifth film due toChapter 4's"astonishing" box office,[149]while Stahelski stated he was open to a sequel.[150][151]In May 2023, Lionsgate president Joe Drake confirmed to investors that a fifth film was in development.[152]In December 2024, Reeves expressed interest in a fifth film, but was unsure of the physical challenges the role required.[153]In March 2025, Reeves insisted the character was dead, implying his disinterest in reprising the role again.[154]
