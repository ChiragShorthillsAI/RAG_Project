She currently plays the recurring role of Pelia inStar Trek: Strange New Worlds(2023–present).
Kane was born on June 18, 1952, in Cleveland, the daughter of Joy, ajazzsinger, teacher, dancer, and pianist, and architect Michael Kane.[2]Her family is Jewish, and her grandparents emigrated from Russia, Austria, and Poland.[3][4]Due to her father's occupation, Kane moved frequently as a child; she briefly lived in Paris at age eight, where she began learning to speak French.[2][5]Additionally, she resided inHaitiat age 10.[2]Her parents divorced when she was 12 years old.[6]
She attended the Cherry Lawn School, a boarding school in Darien, Connecticut, until 1965.[7][8]She studied theater atHB Studio[9]and also went to theProfessional Children's Schoolin New York City. She became a member of both theScreen Actors Guildand theActors' Equity Associationat age 14.[10]Kane made her professional theater debut in a 1966 production ofThe Prime of Miss Jean BrodiestarringTammy Grimes, her first job as a member of Actors' Equity.[11][12]
Kane's on-screen career began while she was still a teenager, when she appeared in minor roles in films such asDesperate CharactersandMike Nichols'sCarnal Knowledgein 1971, the latter of which led her to befriend lead actorJack Nicholson. In 1972, she was cast in her first leading role in the Canadian productionWedding in White, where she played a teenage rape victim who is forced into marriage by her father.

This also marked her first on-screen collaboration withAl Pacino, whom she had known prior to the film thanks to their shared background in theater.[4][14]
Despite this recognition, however, Kane has recounted waiting for approximately a year before being cast in her next role, which she has attributed to the trend of actors being typecast after receiving awards attention.[15]Her return to the screen would come withGene Wilder's 1977 comedyThe World's Greatest Lover,which she has credited for identifying the comedic talents that would become her staple in later years.[14]During the same year, she was cast inWoody Allen's romantic comedyAnnie Hall, where she played Allison Portchnik, the first wife of Allen's character Alvy Singer.[2]She also appeared inKen Russell's filmValentino, which, likeThe World's Greatest Lover, takes inspiration from thesilent filmera, as it is a biographical drama loosely inspired by the life ofRudolph Valentino.

From 1980 to 1983, Kane portrayed Simka Dahblitz-Gravas, the wife ofAndy Kaufman's characterLatka Gravas, on the American television seriesTaxi. She has theorized that she was cast inTaxiin part due to her work inHester Street, where a significant portion of her dialogue was spoken inYiddish, since Simka speaks a fictional language with a vaguelyEastern Europeanaccent.[18]
Kane has attributed the on-screen rapport she shared with Kaufman to their different work ethics: where she was trained in the theater and enjoyed rehearsal time, Kaufman was rooted more instand-up comedyand did not care for rehearsals, a contrast that she believes enhanced their believability as a married couple.[19][12]However, she maintains that she and Kaufman had a loving relationship on set, and she has spoken fondly of him in retrospective interviews.[5][12]Kane received twoEmmy Awardsfor her work onTaxi.[13]Her role on the series has largely been credited as the beginning of her pivot towards more comedic roles, as she began to regularly appear insitcomsand comedy films after the series ended.[16][20]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
