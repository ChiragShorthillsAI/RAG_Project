Operetta composerSteven Lauddem is creatively blocked and unable to finish the score for his big comeback opera. At the behest of his wife Patricia, apsychiatrist, he sets out in search of inspiration.
Taking their dog for a walk, Steven stops at a bar. There, he meets Katrina, who convinces him to go with her to see hertugboat, where she lives and works. She confesses that she's addicted to romance, and seduces Steven. Realising he may be in danger, he hurries away.
The experience inspires Steven to write the work based on what happened, making her character a serial killer. On opening night, not only does Patricia and their son come, but so does Katrina. She approaches him, happily letting him know that she's now staying in Brooklyn, and he hurries home, terrified.
Meanwhile, Patricia's son, Julian, and Tereza, whose mother Magdalena turns out to be his family's new cleaner, are dating. Neither set of parents knew about the relationship, so they make formal introductions. Tereza's dad, Trey, does not approve of his daughter's choice of a dark-skinned boyfriend. He threatens to prosecute Julian on statutory rape charges as Tereza is still underage and Julian has turned 18. As their lawyer comes for a consultation, Steven points out that Julian couldn't be prosecuted if they were married.
When Katrina approaches Steven in the street, he brushes her off, insisting she needs psychological help. She books a session with Patricia and the truth comes out. Not able to handle the news, Patricia has a psychotic break. Afterwards, Magdalena pauses her cleaning to join Julian, Steven, and a nun at Patricia's bedside. Julian requests she sign in person to authorize his marriage to Tereza inDelaware, where 16-year-olds can marry with a parent's signature.
Once it is decided, mother and daughter work together on how to get around Trey. In the meantime, knowing of Katrina's addiction to romance, Steven enlists her help to transport everyone to Delaware. Trey makes his wife and daughter participate in one of hisCivil Warreenactment battles. They feign they are collecting wood but instead run to Steven and the tug boat.
Trey has an APB sent out for them, to no avail. As Steven, Magdalena, and their kids settle in on their journey, it is suggested that Katrina become ordained online to officiate the ceremony. In the morning, Steven brings Captain Katrina her coffee in the cockpit. He apologizes for judging her previously, admiring her strength and perseverance. Katrina in turn laments her role in pushing Pat off the deep end. Declaring he finally feels he has found true love, Steven passionately kisses her.
A year later, we see Steven's latest opera, set in space, but obviously inspired by the Delaware wedding. The young married couple, Magdalena, Steven and Katrina, and Pat, now a nun, watch the premiere. In between parts of the work, we see snippets of the wedding.

Marisa Tomei was born on December 4, 1964, inBrooklyn, New York City, to Adelaide "Addie" (néeBianchi), an English teacher, and Gary A. Tomei, a trial lawyer.[7]She has a younger brother, actor Adam Tomei,[8]and was partly raised by her paternal grandparents.[9]Tomei's parents are both ofItaliandescent; her father's ancestors came fromTuscany,Calabria, andCampania, while her mother's ancestors are from Tuscany andSicily.[10][11]She graduated fromEdward R. Murrow High Schoolin 1982.[12][13]
Tomei grew up in theMidwoodneighborhood of Brooklyn.[14]While there, she became captivated by theBroadwayshows to which her theater-loving parents took her and was drawn to acting as a career.

In 1986 she had a small role in theBobandHarvey Weinsteindirected comedy filmPlaying for Keepswhich was a financial and critical failure.
During this phase, she made her stage debut in 1987 at the age of 22 in the off-Broadway playDaughters, playing Cetta. The role earned her rave reviews and theTheatre World Awardfor outstanding debut on stage. She continued to take roles off-Broadway in the playsBeirutin 1987,Sharon and Billyin 1988, andWhat the Butler Sawin 1989.

Following several small films, includingOscar,[15]Tomei came to international prominence with her comedic performance in the 1992 filmMy Cousin Vinnystarring oppositeJoe Pescifor which she received critical praise.[16]CriticVincent Canbywrote, "Ms. Tomei gives every indication of being a fine comedian, whether towering overMr. Pesciand trying to look small, or arguing about a leaky faucet in terms that demonstrate her knowledge of plumbing. Mona Lisa is also a first-rate auto mechanic, which comes in handy in the untying of the knotted story."[17]For her performance, Tomei was namedBest Supporting Actressat the1993 Academy Awards, prevailing overMiranda Richardson,Joan Plowright,Vanessa RedgraveandJudy Davis.
American film criticRex Reedcreated controversy (and a minor Hollywood myth)[18][19][20]when he suggested thatJack Palancehad announced the wrong name after opening the envelope.[21][22]While this allegation was repeatedly disproved[23][24]—even theAcademyofficially denied it[22]—Tomei called the story "extremely hurtful". APrice Waterhouseaccountant explained that if such an event had occurred, "we have an agreement with the Academy that one of us would step on stage, introduce ourselves, and say the presenter misspoke."[25]In 2015, whenThe Hollywood Reporterpolled hundreds of academy members, asking them to re-vote on some past decisions, Academy members indicated that, given a second chance, they would still award the 1992 Best Supporting Actress award to Tomei.[26]

She then appeared inNick Cassavetes'Unhook the Stars. Of Tomei's performance,Stephen HoldenofThe New York Timescompared her favorably to the film's star,Gena Rowlands, writing, "Ms. Tomei is equally fine as Mildred's [Rowlands' character's] younger, hot-tempered neighbor, whose raw working-class feistiness and bluntly profane vocabulary initially repel the genteel older woman."[27]She received her firstScreen Actors Guildaward nomination for OutstandingFemale Supporting Actorfor her performance.
In 1998, she was nominated for theAmerican Comedy Awardfor Funniest Supporting Actress forTamara Jenkins'cult filmSlums of Beverly Hills. The independent feature was well received by critics and the public,[28]withJanet MaslinofThe New York Timeswriting, "Jenkins makes the most of an especially ingratiating cast, with Ms. Tomei very charming and funny as Rita,"[29]andEmanuel LevyofVarietydescribing Tomei as "spunky and sexy... more subdued than she usually is."[30]Tomei spent several years away from high-profile roles[why?]and major motion pictures in the late 1990s before rising again to prominence in the early 2000s.[31]

Simpson murder trial.[33]
In 1998 she made herBroadwaydebut playing Susy Hendrix	in the revival of theFrederick KnottplayWait Until Darkacting oppositeQuentin Tarantinoat theBrooks Atkinson Theatre.[34]Ben BrantleyofThe New York Timescompared her performance unfavorably toAudrey Hepburnwho played the role in the1967 film. Brantley wrote, "[Tomei]'s a fine, vibrant actress, and heaven knows she works hard here, but she isn't well cast. The appeal of [Hepburn] in the part was of seeing her fragile, ladylike persona turn tough and muscular, and Ms. Tomei's performance allows for no similar transition".[3]Matt Wolf ofVarietywrote "Tomei gives a likable, if not wildly interesting performance".[35]
Tomei appeared in theNancy Meyersdirected comedyWhat Women WantstarringMel GibsonandHelen Hunt. The film was a commercial success. She also had a supporting role in the romantic comedySomeone Like YoustarringAshley Judd,Hugh Jackman, andGreg Kinnear.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
