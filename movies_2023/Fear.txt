The film was released in the United States on January 27, 2023. It received generally negative reviews and grossed $2.1 million.
Plot Summary
The film follows a group of friends who retreat to a remote and historic hotel for a relaxing weekend getaway. The trip is led by Rom, a bestselling author and motivational speaker, who brings his fiancée Bianca and their close friends to celebrate her birthday.
The group consists of:
Rom (Joseph Sikora) – the protagonist and author
Bianca (Annie Ilonzeh) – Rom’s fiancée
Lou (Tip "T.I." Harris) – a skeptic of supernatural beliefs
Michael (Terrence Jenkins) – a member of the friend group
Kim (Ruby Modine) – Michael’s girlfriend
Benny (Andrew Bachelor) – a comic relief character
Serena (Jessica Allain) – another friend
Meg (Ida Redmond) – part of the group
As they settle into the hotel, Rom introduces a discussion about fear, stating that everyone has a personal fear that controls them. He suggests that facing fears head-on is the key to overcoming them. To test this theory, each friend shares their deepest fear. However, strange and terrifying events soon unfold, making their worst nightmares come to life.
One by one, each friend starts experiencing hallucinations and supernatural attacks related to their personal fears. Bianca, who has a fear of drowning, starts seeing disturbing water-related visions. Lou, a skeptic, is confronted by an entity that makes him question reality. Michael and Kim, who have their own anxieties, are tormented by eerie manifestations.
As paranoia and terror grow, the group realizes that the hotel itself is haunted by a malevolent force that feeds on fear. Their bond begins to fracture as trust dissolves, and they turn against each other, unsure of what’s real or imagined.
The night escalates into chaos as each member faces their ultimate nightmare, and many of them succumb to the entity’s psychological torment. Rom, being a motivational speaker, tries to maintain control, but even he is pushed to his limits.
The climax reveals that the entity manipulating their fears is inescapable, and the hotel was a trap from the start. In a twisted finale, Rom discovers that the entire experience was orchestrated to break them mentally and spiritually, leaving few survivors—if any at all.
The film ends on a bleak note, reinforcing the idea that fear, once it takes hold, can be inescapable and deadly.
Fear, originally titledDon't Fear, was shot in 17 days inKyburz, California,[1]during theCOVID-19 pandemicin August 2020.[7]
The film's score was composed byGeoff Zanelli, who scored several of Taylor's previous films.[8]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 21% of 19 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.9/10.[11]
Matthew Monagle ofThe Austin Chroniclewrote, "It is frustrating to watchFearcarelessly oscillate between creature feature, haunted house movie, and folk horror... In the end, the scariest thing aboutFearis its stock video opening montage – not a compliment any director wants to hear."[12]Katie Walsh of theTribune News Servicepraised the cinematography, score and sound design, but criticized the script as "prov[ing] that it is possible to have too many ideas for just one film." She added, "Deadliest of all,Fearis just not scary. The jump scares don't land, the fears themselves are all a bit silly and it feels like Taylor is holding back for the majority of the run time."[13]Common Sense Media's Jeffrey M. Anderson gave the film 2/5 stars, writing, "Despite a diverse cast and a nifty location, this soggy, inert horror movie unfolds with a most unimaginative collection of worn-out genre staples, starting with its bland title."[14]
Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film 3/4 stars, writing, "There's nothing subtle or deeply original aboutFear, though it does feature some impressive albeit low-budget special effects, first-rate production design and strong performances from the cast; it knows we've seen a dozen other movies about a group of friends who meet up in the country for what they hope will be an idyllic weekend, only to see things quickly go from mildly disturbing to truly weird to deeply concerning to horrifying bloody."[15]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
