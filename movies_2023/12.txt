It starsTom CruiseasEthan Hunt, alongside anensemble castincludingHayley Atwell,Ving Rhames,Simon Pegg,Rebecca Ferguson,Vanessa Kirby,Esai Morales,Pom Klementieff,Mariela GarrigaandHenry Czerny. In the film, Hunt and hisIMFteam face off against the Entity, a powerful rogueAI.
In January 2019, Cruise announced the next twoMission: Impossiblefilms would be shotback-to-back, with McQuarrie writing and directing both. Returning and new cast members were announced soon after, andLorne Balfe, who composed the score forFallout, returned to score. Filming began in Italy in February 2020 but was halted by theCOVID-19 pandemic. It resumed later that year and wrapped in September 2021, with other filming locations including Norway, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. With an estimated budget of $291 million, it isone of the most expensive films ever made.
Dead Reckoning Part Onepremiered in Rome on June 19, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 12, byParamount Pictures. The film received critical acclaim and grossed $571.1 million worldwide. Despite beingthe tenth-highest-grossing film of 2023, its overall budget and competition from the "Barbenheimer" phenomenon resulted in the film becoming abox-office disappointment.Dead Reckoning Part Onewas nominated in two categories at the96th Academy Awardsand the77th British Academy Film Awards. A sequel,Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, is scheduled for release in May 2025.
TheSevastopol, a next-generation Russian stealth submarine, activates an advancedAIusing a two-piececruciformkey. The AI, designated "the Entity", becomessentientand goes rogue after deceiving the submarine crew into attacking themselves with a torpedo, killing all aboard and sinking theSevastopolin theArctic Ocean.
World powerscompete to obtain the cruciform key in hopes of controlling the Entity.IMFagentEthan Hunttravels to theEmpty Quarterof theArabian Desertand retrieves one piece of the key from disavowedMI6agent Ilsa Faust, faking her death to shield her from a bounty.
In Washington, D.C., Ethan infiltrates aU.S. Intelligence Communitybriefing forDirector of National IntelligenceDenlinger, whereCIA DirectorEugene Kittridge explains that the Entity can manipulatecyberspaceto control global defense intelligence and financial networks. Ethan reveals himself and forces him to admit to placing the bounty on Ilsa, then escapes, determined to destroy the Entity.
Ethan and his IMF teammates Benji Dunn andLuther Stickelltravel toAbu Dhabi International Airportto intercept the second piece of the key. It is revealed to be a fake, although Ethan encounters Grace, a skilled thief who steals the first piece of the key from him, while Luther and Benji disarm a hoax nuclear device.
Ethan is pursued by US agents but spots his mortal enemy Gabriel, an Entityliaisonwith ties to his pre-IMF past, and aborts the mission, scattering the team. Grace escapes toRomeand is apprehended, but Ethan rescues her from local authorities, the US agents, and Entity operative Paris. Grace escapes again, while Ethan rejoins Luther, Benji, and Ilsa.
Ethan and Ilsa follow Grace toVeniceand infiltrate a party held byarms dealerAlanna Mitsopolis. In possession of the second piece of the key, Alanna hired Grace to steal the first, and will sell the completed key to her buyer the next day on theOrient Express.
Gabriel proclaims that he will possess the completed key the next day and that either Ilsa or Grace will die. Ethan attempts to dissuade Alanna from the sale, allowing Gabriel and Grace to escape. He pursues Grace, but the Entity hacks into their communications and impersonates Benji, leading Ethan into a fight with Paris, whom he spares. Gabriel incapacitates Grace and kills Ilsa, devastating Ethan.
While preparing for the sale, Luther leaves for an off-grid location to prevent interference from the Entity, advising Ethan to spare Gabriel for questioning about the Entity. On the train with Paris, Gabriel kills the engine crew and destroys the throttle and brake. He meets with Denlinger, who attempts to form an alliance with the Entity, which he reveals was originally an advancedcyber weapondeveloped by the US.
The completed key unlocks a chamber inside theSevastopolcontaining the Entity'ssource code, allowing it to be destroyed or controlled. As this secret is known only to Denlinger, Gabriel kills him, and tries to kill Paris as the Entity has predicted she will betray them after Ethan spared her life.
Disguised as Alanna, Grace brings the key to Kittridge, revealed to be the buyer, and negotiates a $100 million sale alongside protection for herself, but pickpockets the key from Kittridge after cancelling the transfer. Ethan parachutes into the train to save Grace, but Gabriel acquires the key. Fighting Ethan atop the train, Gabriel escapes and detonates a bridge ahead.
Detaching the runaway locomotive and saving the passengers, Grace and Ethan climb through the falling train cars until they are rescued by Paris, who tells Ethan about the key's connection to theSevastopolbefore collapsing. Grace informs Kittridge of her desire to join the IMF. Ethan flees the wreckage by paraglider with the completed key, which he pickpocketed from Gabriel during the fight, and rendezvous with Benji to continue the mission to find theSevastopoland destroy the Entity.
Additionally,Charles Parnell,Rob Delaney,Indira VarmaandMark Gatissappear as heads of US Intelligence agencies, representingNRO,JSOC,DIAandNSA, respectively.[16][10]Marcin Dorocińskiand Ivan Ivashkin appear as the captain and the second-in-command of theSevastopolsubmarine, respectively.[17]
On January 14, 2019,Tom Cruiseannounced that the seventh and eighthMission: Impossiblefilms would be shotback-to-backwithChristopher McQuarriewriting and directing both films for July 23, 2021, and August 5, 2022, releases.[18][19]In February 2021,Paramount Picturesscuttled that plan.[20]
In February 2019,Rebecca Fergusonconfirmed her return for the seventh installment.[21][22]In September, McQuarrie announced thatHayley Atwellhad joined the cast.[23]In September 2019,Pom Klementieffjoined the cast of both the seventh and eighth films.[11]In December 2019,Simon Peggconfirmed his return for the film, withShea Whighamcast in both films.[24][25]Nicholas Houltwas cast in a role in January 2020, along with the addition ofHenry Czerny, reprising his role as Eugene Kittridge for the first time since the1996 film.[26][27]Hoult was cast because Cruise liked his audition forTop Gun: Maverick(2022) to play Bradley "Rooster" Bradshaw, recognizing him as a supremely talented actor who just wasn't suited to play that role for that movie even though there wasn't a concrete story set for the seventhMission: Impossiblefilm.[28]
Vanessa Kirbyalso announced she was returning for both films.[29]In May 2020, it was reported thatEsai Moraleswould replace Hoult as the villain in both films because of scheduling conflicts.[30]Morales was cast as Gabriel because of McQuarrie seeing his role of Camino Del Rio onOzark; Hoult's recasting thanks to theCOVID-19 pandemicwith Morales led to drastic story changes since it was after Morales was cast that McQuarrie realized that Cruise and Morales being about the same age opened several story possibilities to tie in their characters toEthan Hunt's backstory. Similarly, it was after Hoult's departure that the filmmakers came up with the concept of "The Entity".[28]
Angela Bassettannounced she would return as Erika Sloane in December 2020, but she was later removed because of COVID-19 travel restrictions.[31][32]Sloane appears in the film in a photo on the wall of DNI Denlinger's office during an intelligence briefing. In March 2021, McQuarrie revealed thatRob Delaney,Charles Parnell,Indira Varma,Mark GatissandCary Elweshad joined the cast.[16]That same day,Greg Tarzan Daviswas also confirmed to have joined the cast.[14]
McQuarrie revealed that for the flashback segments, he considered making them reflective of the 1989 setting akin to "Tony Scott’sMission: Impossible", down tode-agingall the actors and featuringJulia Robertsas the girlfriend murdered by Gabriel. However, he stepped back once discovering how pricey the effects would become, while also feeling a younger Cruise would be distracting to audiences.[33]McQuarrie had also chosen to have Ilsa Faust die in the film while working onTop Gun: Maverick(2022) with Cruise, which he had co-written. He felt the decision would show the "stakes have to be real" and described Ilsa and Ethan's relationship as being "doomed to be together and yet doomed never to be together".[34]
Under the working titleLibra,[35]filming was scheduled to begin on February 20, 2020, inVenice, set up to last for three weeks before moving toRomein mid-March for 40 days,[36][37]but theCOVID-19 pandemic in Italyhalted production in the country.[38]Three weeks later, stunt rehearsals began inSurrey, England, just before a hiatus.[39]On July 6, 2020, after another hiatus, crew arriving in the UK were permitted to begin filming without going through the mandatory 14-day quarantine. The set was located atWarner Bros Studios, Leavesdenin Hertfordshire.[40]
The following month, permission was granted for filming inMøre og Romsdal, Norway.[41]That same month, a large fire broke out on a motorcycle stunt rig in Oxfordshire. The scene had taken six weeks to prepare and was "among one of the most expensive ever filmed in the U.K." No one was hurt in the incident.[42]
Filming began on September 6, 2020,[43]when McQuarrie started to publish pictures from the sets on Instagram.[44]The film was shot with Sony CineAlta Venice cameras, making it the first film in theMission: Impossiblefranchise to be shot digitally. In September 2020, filming took place in Norway, including the municipalities ofStrandaandRauma, with Cruise seen filming an action scene with Esai Morales atop a train.[45]On October 26, 2020, production was suspended in Italy after 12 people tested positive forCOVID-19on set. Filming resumed a week later.
In December 2020, during filming in London, an audio recording of Cruise shouting at two crew members for not following COVID-19 protocols on set was released online.[46]Cruise was likened to his character Les Grossman fromTropic Thunder(2008) as a result.[47][48]The response from the general public and that of many celebrities was supportive, suggesting that his tone and seriousness were warranted given the extreme circumstances and burden of ensuring production not be halted again.[49][50]On December 28, 2020,Varietyreported that the film would concludeprincipal photographyatLongcross Film Studiosin the United Kingdom, with production shifting fromWarner Bros. Studios, Leavesden. In Longcross, which is in Surrey in southeast England, production was allowed to continue under strict COVID-19 protocols.[51]In February 2021, filming concluded in the Middle East and the crew returned to London for "finishing touches".
On April 20, 2021, filming commenced in the small village ofLevisham, North Yorkshire, atNorth Yorkshire Moors Railway,[52]for asequenceset in theAlpsin Austria with a train going 60 miles (97 km) an hour toward a bridge being blown up,[53][54]as a reference to the climactictrain wreckscene in the silent filmThe General(1926).[55]In August 2021, filming commenced inBirminghamat the city'sGrand Centralshopping centre, with Cruise and Atwell spotted by onlookers.[56]In September 2021, the film's gaffer Martin Smith confirmed on Instagram that principal photography had officially wrapped.[57]
Other locations for the movie included a terminal still under construction at theAbu Dhabiairport[58]and various sites in the Italian cities of Rome (including the 20-minute-long car chase)[59]and Venice.[60]
Filming for the parachute andspeed flyingsequence took place in theLake Districtover theButtermereValley in the summer of 2021 and 2022. The fells ofHigh CragandRobinsonwere used as launching points for shooting the speed flying scene, with landings taking place near the shore of the nearby lake.[61]The train scene with the motorcycle jump was shot in Norway, with the fight scenes agreed on with the Norwegian government.[62]
During thepre-productionin late 2019, the Swiss government refused to authorize anyexplosionsfor the train sequence in the Alps;[63]as a result, theSkydance Mediaproduction team embarked onlocation scoutingsin different countries to find an unwanted railway bridge.[54][55]Among those asked to help with staging a "full-scale train crash" was Polish-American film producer Andrew Eksner.[55]In November 2019, thePolish State Railwaysproposed Eksner use a 151-meter-long (495 ft), 1908German-erarivetedtruss bridgeon Lake Pilchowickie, in theJelenia Góra Valley, inLower Silesia.[64][65]In December 2019, Paramount Pictures producers including McQuarrie landed in southern Poland,[66]accompanied in deep secrecy by officers of thePolishengineering troops.[53]McQuarrie documented the visit onInstagram.[67]
Officially opened in 1912 byWilhelm II, the proposed bridge survivedWorld War IImostly intact,[68]and was used by trains until 2016.[69]Despite publicly praising the bridge as "extremely valuable,"[70]an expertmisrepresented conclusionsof a commissioned report,[71]that instead of renovating, it would be best to demolish the bridge and build a new one.[72][73]In March 2020, after the rejected Eksner spread the information,[55]local authorities and museum officials were appalled by the producers' intention to physically destroy the bridge, instead of usingCGI effects.[64][74]The filmmakers and government officials said the bridge was intended for demolition.[69]
By July 2020, history and railway enthusiasts, scientists and filmmakers protested, along with the regional Monuments Heritage Office, members of Polish parliament,[69][75]andthe International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage.[76]Activists and NGOs launched a petition against the destruction.[77]As it was long registered provincially, and being added into Poland's nationalRegistry of Cultural Property,[74][78]theMinistry of Culture and National Heritageconfirmed it was pushing the bridge to play in the movie, with a "small section" to be demolished onset, before revitalizing the related localheritage railwayline altogether.[79]Following the backlash,[75][80]the General Conservator of Monuments assured "there was no question" of destroying the bridge.[81]
In August 2020, as the story turned international,[82][83]McQuarrie said there was never a plan to blow up the bridge, and that only unsafe and partially damaged portions could have been destroyed, which allegedly needed to be rebuilt, concluding: "To open up the area to tourism, the bridge needed to go."[84]He later added that "there was no disrespect intended".[85]The production company did not pledge to cover construction costs of a potential new bridge, nor the renovation of the historic one.[69]Eventually,cultural property registration proceduresfor the Lake Pilchowickie bridge were finalized, effectively preventing it from any damage.[86]In May 2021, Eksner sued the Paramount production crew including McQuarrie and Cruise for breach of contract.[87]
Filming of the train wreck scene was expected to take place between April and June 2021 on a constructed set in a disusedquarryin thePeak DistrictNational Park inStoney Middleton, with a railway line and part of a bridge over the cliff edge.[88]After two weeks of suspended filming,[89]the scene was filmed on August 20, when a mockupBritannia Classlocomotive was propelled off the cliff into the quarry.[90][91]
Industrial Light & Magicreturned to provide the visual effects for the film, having done so for the firstMission: Impossiblefilm (1996),Mission: Impossible III(2006) andGhost Protocol(2011), with BeloFX, Blind LTD, Clear Angle Studios and Halon Entertainment being the additional vendors for the film.[92][93][94]In one of the later test screenings for the film held by McQuarrie,Edgar Wrightasked him about a specific audio cue that McQuarrie felt obvious but upon Wright's question, realized that the audience hadn't noticed it, which led him and Cruise to change the "entire" movie.[95]
In early May 2020,Lorne Balfewas confirmed to be returning to compose the score for the seventh and eighthMission: Impossiblefilms, after previously doing so forMission: Impossible – Fallout(2018).[96]Balfe's music from the teaser trailer was digitally released as asingleon June 23, 2022, throughParamount Music.[97]

Clubgave the trailer a positive review and highlighted the many action scenes in it.[102]JoBlo.comalso gave the trailer a positive review, saying that the "action on display is truly amazing" and praising Cruise's dedication to entertaining.[103]A behind-the-scenes look at the film debuted ahead of IMAX screenings ofAvatar: The Way of Water(2022).[104][105]The full preview was released online four days later, on December 19, 2022.[106]In Japan, the movie collaborated with the anime and manga seriesSpy × Familyvia theSpy x Familyanime filmCode: White.

In the United States and Canada,Dead Reckoning Part Onewas initially projected to gross around $90 million from 4,327 theaters over its first five days, as well as another $160 million from 70 international territories, for a five-day worldwide debut of around $250 million.[2]The film made $15.5 million on its first day (including $7 million from Tuesday-night preview screenings) and $8.3 million on its second.[128]After making $16.7 million on Friday, weekend and five-day estimates were lowered to $54 million and $78 million, respectively.[129]The film went on to debut to $54.7 million in its opening weekend and a total of $78.5 million over its first five days, just behindMission: Impossible 2's $78.8 million in 2000.[130]While the film fell short of expectations after it "turned out a much lower opening weekend than expected",[131][132][133]Deadline Hollywoodnoted that unlikeIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny(2023), another near-three-hour film that cost around $300 million and opened to $84 million over its first five days,Dead Reckoning Part Onebenefitted from better critic and audience scores.[134]Despite that, the film dropped 65% to $19.4 million in its second weekend, finishing fourth behind newcomersBarbieandOppenheimerand holdoverSound of Freedom.[135][136]At the time, it had the biggest second weekend decline of anyMission: Impossiblefilm, breaking the previous record held byMission: Impossible 2.[137]
Some outlets noted that the film's unexpected box office drop could be attributed to ceding IMAX screens toOppenheimer, as well as business going to theBarbenheimerdoubleheader phenomenon (which Cruise and McQuarrie also promoted) despiteSound of Freedomalso outperforming it domestically.[138]It made $10.6 million in its third weekend and $6.7 million in its fourth, finishing in fifth and seventh place, respectively.[139][140]After finishing its box office run, it became the second-lowest-grossing installment of the franchise domestically, only behind the $134 million gross fromMission: Impossible III(2006).[141]

Just don't think too hard about it, though you'll probably still give serious side-eye to your laptop."[155]
In a mixed review forLittle White Lies, Adam Woodward remarked of the film's "diminishing returns amid all the ambitious action".[156]In contrast to the very positive review byVariety's Peter Debruge,[157]Owen Gleibermanwrote a column about the film for the magazine, stating that he thinks Cruise and McQuarrie should "go back" to what audiences loved about the franchise if they want to "end it on a high note."[158]

Klementieff used her boxing skills again in the film, and due to the movie's low budget, she had to do her own make-up and choose her own wardrobe.[14]It was her idea to dye her hair purple for the role, to which the directors first objected but later acquiesced.[11]In 2017, she appeared in the romance dramaNewnessand the black comedy-dramaIngrid Goes West.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
