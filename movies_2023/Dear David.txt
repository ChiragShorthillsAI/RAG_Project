Dear David[a]is a 2023 Americansupernatural horror filmdirected byJohn McPhail, based on Adam Ellis'Twitterthread of the same name. It starsAugustus Prew, withAndrea Bang, René Escobar Jr., Cameron Nicoll, andJustin Longin supporting roles.
A co-production betweenBuzzFeed StudiosandLionsgate Films, the film followsBuzzFeedemployee Ellis (Prew), as his attempt to retaliate against onlinetrollsresults in a haunting from ademon-possessedspirit.
Dear Davidwas released in theaters and tostreaminganddigitalformats on October 13, 2023, by Lionsgate,[2]to negative reviews from critics, who found it generic and lacking in scares.
In 1996, David gets bullied over a crude drawing oninstant messaging, and retaliates against them.
In 2017, two teenagers enter the late David's chat room,trollinghim. After asking a third question about their future cause of death, the teenager gets killed later that night.
AtBuzzFeed, Adam heeds his boss Bryce's request to create "authentic original content". Adam retaliates against trolls—prompting a response from David calling him "mean", which Adam ignores. In the next morning, Adam's rocking chair moves on its own, later seeing David on it in a hallucination, continuing with a vision of David and his past life.
Evelyn encourages Adam to get sleep—he instead researches "Dear David" and paranormal activity. Adam encounters David in a dream and asks who he is, with David answering he's "just a follower". In the next night, Adam moves to a unit upstairs in the same apartment complex, however his hallucinations persist.
In the next day, everyone at BuzzFeed celebrate the success of theDear Davidthread. Bryce tells Adam to add multimedia. After hesitating, Adam makes theDear Davidstory interactive by adding a vote on what to do if David appears again—anexorcismwas chosen. Trolls continue to berate Adam; he claps back. On an early morning, Adam asks what David wants with him, later waking up with a nosebleed after David slams a typewriter at his face last night. While hunting for David, he encounters Kyle, who comforts him.
Adam recounts his situation to Kyle, who resents him for his unresponsiveness, eventually leaving him in disappointment. Adam later posts that David may want him dead. After initially ignoring the unknown caller, Adam answers—the caller has his voice. At night, he gets dragged to where David is shown disturbing photos. His father scolds him for this, after which David chokes him. Linda kills David.
A representation of David is drawn the next day with half a head. Bryce proposes a worldwide expansion ofDear David, which Adam reluctantly agrees to. He calls Kyle to help track the owner of David's handle; he agrees despiteprivacy concerns.
A woman visits Adam recalling his experience with David, concluding that David may be connected to Adam. He visits Phyllis, who cites another connected case: that of "Loopy Linda". Adam watches her video, realizing her actions match what happened to David, who may be possessed.
Adam goes to the hospital where David was admitted, finding he is already dead. He secretly searches for David's file, discovering his body went missing. Adam goes inside Dr. Landers' home to find her, but finds Linda hanging by the stairs.
Adam dozes off, calling Kyle in a dream whilecutting himself. Evelyn chides Adam for his responses (which he didn't send) and deserts him. Kyle tells Adam that David's handle doesn't exist, and to move on. A list sent by Norris angers Adam, not realizing it said "beyourself" instead of "killyourself". Bryce recommends a break for Adam, whose reputation and credibility decline.
Adam accidentally asks a third question to David, losing control, instigating a fire; he sees a vision of people criticizing him.
As the complex burns, Evelyn and Kyle visit him in worry after Adam fails to answer their calls. After their reassuring remarks, Adam successfully kills David while escaping the complex with them. They apologize for dismissing Adam's claims of being haunted—Adam promises to be more open.
Meanwhile, Chloe, one of the trolls, gets possessed and continuously smashes her head on the table.
Dear Davidwas based on aTwitterthread created by formerBuzzFeedwriter Adam Ellis in which he describes his encounter with a ghost.[3]The story was updated between August 7 and December 12, 2017, and went viral online, gaining Ellis over 1 million followers on Twitter. In February 2018, Ellis left BuzzFeed for independent ventures, leaving the story on hiatus. On June 6, 2018, BuzzFeed Studios announced its plan to adapt the story into a feature film, with Mike Van Waes writing the screenplay.[4]In an interview, Ellis said his story was based on actual events and that he had "never been interested in convincing anyone that ghosts are real – I just wanted to tell my story."[5]In November 2018,New Line Cinemaacquired the rights to the story.[6]
In July 2020, BuzzFeed Studios andLionsgate Filmsannounced a partnership to produce and distribute a number of feature films.[7]In November 2021, BuzzFeed and Lionsgate acquired the rights to the story fromNew Line Cinemaand hiredJohn McPhailto direct.[8]
In January 2022,Justin Long,Augustus Prew, andAndrea Bangwere confirmed to star.[9]
Production took place inToronto, Canada, and wrapped in December 2021.[10][11]
McPhail, in an interview withScreen Rant, stated thatpractical effectswere extensively used to "make everything feel just that little bit more real". One such example is the blood rig on the knife, so it's cutting across and blood would appear.[12]
Originally, the film was set for a 2022 release,[9]however Lionsgate pushed back the release date to October 13, 2023.[2]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 10% of 29 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.9/10.[13]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 26 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[14]
Meagan Navarro ofBloody Disgustingalso gave a rating of two-and-a-half stars out of five, who disliked the pacing (calling it "a rather sleepy affair"), lack of scares in favor ofinternal character conflict, later telling readers to revisit the original Twitter thread "for genuine frights".[15]Kristy Puchko, in her review forMashable, stated that the film "plays like a bad nightmare", further criticizing the lack of coherence and shock value.[16]
In more negative reviews, Tomris Laffly ofTheWrapcalledDear David"a dull horror film that's anything but scary."[17]A one out of four star review published onRogerEbert.comwritten by Monica Castillo stated that "Something is lost in movingDear Davidfrom its native digital platform."[18]David Ehrlich, on a review published byIndieWiregave a grade of D+ and wrote "Alas, this low-rent, no-energy, seen-it-all-before genre wank left me absolutely terrified of returning to an era when micro-blogged cries for help could last for half a year and run the length of a novella."[19]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
