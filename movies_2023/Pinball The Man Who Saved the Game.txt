He was enticed by dancing after seeingGene KellyandFred Astairein oldMGMfilms, especially Kelly inSingin' in the Rain. "Just the way he performed and moved, he was able to tell a story through movement," Faist said. At the age of 5, he pressured his parents to enroll him in dance classes and began auditioning for community theater and children's theater.[6][3]In a Columbus Children's Theatre production ofThe Wizard of Oz, he played one of the Lollipop Guild, later joining the cast ofOliver!andAlice in Wonderland.[3]
Faist fell in love with acting while attending The Academy of Performing Arts (TAPA) company inColumbus, Ohio, and while atGahanna Lincoln High Schoolhe acted in several productions, such as Danny Zuko inGreaseand Simon inJesus Christ Superstar.[3]At the age of 17, Faist met his birth mother and her family, who are mostly pilots by profession.

When the musical transferred toBroadway, he understudied the lead role of Jack Kelly, a newsboy who leads his colleagues in a strike against the publisher, in addition to his other roles. Faist had to alternately play the roles in quick succession during the opening number. "You have to really make sure you're warmed up vocally and physically and you're mentally prepared," Faist said of the demands of his dual role, but added, "It's not hard to have fun in Newsies, about the uprising of children, a new generation coming in to take over the old."[3]Newsiesopened to critical acclaim and was nominated forBest Musicalat the66th Tony Awards.[10][11][12]In 2012, he made his feature film debut in the coming-of-age dramaThe Unspeakable Act.

I realized that there seems to be a general lack of self-love and empathy in our society. I hope that when people see the show, they'll say, 'Oh, I am loved. I'm exactly who I am, and I am enough'."[8][20]Along with cast membersBen Levi RossandMallory Bechtel, Faist lent his voice for the audiobook version ofVal Emmich'sDear Evan Hansen: The Novel, a book adaptation of the musical released in October 2018.[21]

But his sensitivity is closer to that of leading men as atypical asAdam Driver, and he modernizes a potentially versatile piece."[28]Despite receiving positive reviews from critics, the series was canceled after one season.[29][30]Faist received a nomination for his work by theCritics Choice Associationin the categoryBest Actor in an Action Seriesat the2nd Critics' Choice Super Awards.[31]
Later that year, he had his first major movie role inSteven Spielberg's film adaptation ofWest Side Storyas Riff, Tony's best friend and leader of the Jets gang.[32]The film was a critical success and some critics deemed it superior to the 1961 film.[33]His performance earned universal praise from critics.[34]The Washington Postregards his magnetic performance asWest Side Story's "stand-out" as its chief film criticAnn Hornadaywrote "The revelation in this production, however, is Mike Faist, who is not only a gifted singer and dancer, but plays Jets gang leader Riff with just the right mix of spiky resentment, hair-trigger anger and loose-limbed grace.".[35]On his collaboration with Faist, screenwriterTony Kushnersays, "He really wants to think about economics, politics, psychology, and psychotechnology, and he feeds himself with a kind of acuity and precision that I think is the mark of a great actor."[36]To craft a new version of his character, Faist took inspiration from a 1959Bruce Davidsonphotography book entitledBrooklyn Gang."You look at those photos and you see these people, the nihilism that exists, their inability to see past tomorrow, or even today for that matter. There's something depressing about it, also carnal, wild, and primal," Faist explained.[37]For his performance, Faist received a nomination forBest Actor in a Supporting Roleat the75th British Academy Film Awards.[38]
Faist made hisWest Enddebut in the stage adaptation ofBrokeback MountainasJack Twist, oppositeLucas HedgesasEnnis Del Mar, in May 2023.[39]The production received mixed reviews but Faist earned acclaim with Arifa Akbar ofThe Guardianwriting, "[the two leads] chemistry comes alive as boyish romance, with play fighting and suddenly grabbing ardour...both actors are compelling, Faist especially so as the ebullient Jack".[40]Faist portrayed photographerDanny LyoninJeff Nichols'The BikeridersoppositeAustin Butler,Jodie ComerandTom Hardy.[41]Faist practiced photography and spent a weekend with Lyon, in addition to studying Lyon's personal audio recordings and other material.[42]The film premiered at the 2023Telluride Film Festivalto positive reviews.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
