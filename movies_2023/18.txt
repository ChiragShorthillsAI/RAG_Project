Blue Beetleis a 2023 Americansuperhero filmbased on theDC ComicscharacterJaime Reyes / Blue Beetle. Directed byÁngel Manuel Sotoand written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, it is the 14th film in theDC Extended Universe(DCEU) produced byDC Films.Xolo Maridueñastars as Reyes, a recent college graduate who is bestowed with an armor that grants him superpowers after being accidentally chosen by an ancient alien relic known as theScarab.Adriana Barraza,Damián Alcázar,Raoul Max Trujillo,Susan Sarandon, andGeorge Lopezalso star in the film.
Development of a film featuring Reyes began by the end of November 2018 with Dunnet-Alcocer attached as screenwriter. Soto was hired to direct the film in February 2021 for the streaming serviceHBO Max. Maridueña was cast that August, and the film was changed to have a theatrical release in December. Further casting took place in early 2022, and filming lasted from late May to mid-July at Wilder Studios inDecatur, Georgia, as well as inEl Paso, Texas, andPuerto Rico. It is the first live-action superhero film with a Latino lead.
Blue Beetlepremiered in El Paso on August 14, 2023, and was released in the United States on August 18. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and became the most streamed film onWarner Bros.' serviceMaxin the United States. It underperformed at the box office, grossing $131 million worldwide against a production budget of $104–125 million, which made it the lowest-grossing film in the DCEU. Its box office performance was attributed to factors such as the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, the franchise's imminent reboot with theDC Universe(DCU), andHurricane Hilary. An animated follow-up series set in the DCU is in development.
InAntarctica, members ofKord Industries, led by its co-founder and CEOVictoria Kord, locate an ancient alien artifact known as theScarab. Meanwhile,Jaime Reyesreturns to his hometown ofPalmera Cityafter graduating fromGotham Law University, only to learn that his family is facing eviction from their home due to financial difficulties. Jaime's sisterMilagromanages to get him a job at Victoria's mansion. However, both are fired after Jaime stops a confrontation between Victoria and her niece Jenny. Jenny later tells Jaime to meet her at Kord Tower the next day to discuss a "job opportunity".
The next day, Jenny finds that Victoria is using the Scarab for herOne Man Army Corps(OMAC) projects. She steals the Scarab and avoids security by giving it to Jaime, hidden inside aBig Belly Burgerto-go box. At home, Jaime's family convinces him to open the box, and when Jaime ends up holding the Scarab, it activates and fuses with him, encasing him in an armored exoskeleton that launches him from thestratosphereto all over the city. Jaime tracks down Jenny for answers, rescuing her from Victoria's armed forces. She tells Jaime the Scarab is a sentient weapon and it has chosen Jaime to be its host. With the help of Jaime's uncle Rudy, Jaime and Jenny break into Kord Tower to retrieve a smartwatch that once belonged to Jenny's fatherTed, but are attacked by Victoria's bodyguardIgnacio Carapax, who has an OMAC prototype infused in his body. The Scarab, revealed to be named Khaji-Da, temporarily takes over Jaime's body and battles Carapax, but Jaime refuses to let it kill Carapax. Rudy and Jenny help incapacitate Carapax, then escape with Jaime to Jenny's childhood home.
Jenny uses Ted's watch to activate his secret laboratory and reveals that Ted was originally a vigilante namedBlue Beetlewho spent his life studying Khaji-Da before mysteriously disappearing, leaving his company in Victoria's hands. When they notice Victoria's helicopter flying toward Jaime's home, Jaime summons Khaji-Da and returns to protect his family, but Jaime's father Alberto collapses and dies from aheart attack, distracting Jaime and allowing Carapax to capture him. Jaime is taken to an island fortress nearCuba, where he is strapped to a machine that downloads information from Khaji-Da into the OMACs. While unconscious, Jaime experiences a vision from Alberto in theafterlife, who encourages him to embrace his destiny as the new Blue Beetle.
While Jenny and the Reyes family use Ted's Bugship and its weapons arsenal to storm the island, Jaime awakens and escapes as Carapax's OMAC suit evolves into a more powerful form. Jaime reunites with his family, then encounters Carapax and battles him. Jaime nearly kills Carapax but is stopped by Khaji-Da, who shows him Carapax's memories it obtained through the information download, from which Jaime learns of Carapax's tragic past, including his enslavement by Victoria for the OMAC experiments and the death of his mother at her hands. Moved by this revelation, Jaime spares Carapax, who is prompted to turn on Victoria and sets his OMAC suit to explode and destroy the island, himself, and Victoria, as vengeance for his mother. As the Reyes family escapes the island, they take time to mourn Alberto.
In the aftermath, Jenny becomes the new CEO of Kord Industries and promises to repair the damage caused to the Reyes family by helping them rebuild their home. As the neighbors gather around the remains of the Reyes family's home and provide support, Jaime kisses Jenny and then offers to fly her to the Kord Estate. In amid-credits scene, a distorted recording is broadcast in Ted's laboratory, attempting to inform Jenny he is alive.
Additionally,Becky Gprovides the voice of Khaji-Da, a sentient entity that imbues and controls the Scarab,[15]while Bobby McGruther has a voice-onlycameoasTed Kord, a previousBlue Beetle, in the mid-credits scene.[16]
Warner Bros. PicturesandDC Filmswere developing a film based onJaime Reyes / Blue Beetleby the end of November 2018, with Mexican-born Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer writing the screenplay.Zev Foremanwas executive producing the project for Warner Bros., which was set to be the firstDC Extended Universe(DCEU) film as well as the first live-action superhero film starring a Latino lead.[17]By December 2020, DC Films was planning to release several mid-budget films a year exclusively on the streaming serviceHBO Max, rather than in theaters, as part of new DC Films presidentWalter Hamada's plan for the DCEU,[18]withBlue Beetlelisted as one such project in 2021.[19]Puerto Rican directorÁngel Manuel Sotowas hired to direct the film in February 2021.[20]During a call received from Warner Bros., Soto hadpitchedvarious ideas, including a film aboutBane'sorigin story, but Warner Bros. had intended for him to direct a film based on Reyes' Blue Beetle.[21]In April,Blue Beetlewas included on DC's slate of films that were expected to be released in 2022 or 2023.[22]Soto noted that while the decision to make it a streaming film was influenced by thepandemic, the creative team aimed to make a film suited for the big screen, utilizing IMAX cameras and large-scale world-building.[23]Regarding Blue Beetle's place in DC Studios' plans, Soto expressed appreciation that the film was confirmed to be the first entry in James Gunn and Peter Safran’s rebooted DC Universe, with Jaime Reyes positioned as its first hero.[23]
John Rickard, the president of production at the Safran Company, was producing the film for HBO Max by that August,[24][25]when filming was expected to begin in early 2022.[7]In December 2021, Warner Bros. revealed that the film would be receiving a theatrical release in August 2023 instead of being produced directly for HBO Max; Though the film was originally intended to be released as an HBO Max exclusive, the studio decided to release it theatrically after they enjoyed Soto's creative vision.[26][27]In mid-April 2022, Soto and cinematographerPawel PogorzelskivisitedEl Paso, Texas, to meet with local artists, muralists, musicians, and historians to understand the feel of the city.[28]Peter Safranwas revealed as a producer that October,[25]having worked on the film before he was hired as the co-chairman and co-CEO ofDC StudiosalongsideJames Gunnthat month;[29][30]Rickard and Foreman were ultimately credited as the producers.[9]
In October 2021, Soto said Dunnet-Alcocer's script featured "the Latino family at its core",[31]while starXolo Maridueñasaid in August 2022 that the family aspect of the film and character were "inherent to the comics" and felt had not been explored as much with other superhero films.[32]Soto did not want the film to be "another story where 15 minutes in, something happens, and 50 minutes later, he's dominating the experience, and by the end, he's saving the world" and instead wanted to explore his growth, saying that "He's [Reyes] not going to save the world yet; he doesn't deserve to yet". Soto and Dunnet-Alcocer had decided to do so by taking a grounded approach toward his character while exploring his relationship with his family and Khaji-Da, the symbiotic alien that provides Reyes's powers. Soto also took inspiration from DC'sThe New 52comics, and theMission: ImpossibleandIndiana Jonesfranchises.[33][26]
The film also features Reyes's family witnessing his first transformation into Blue Beetle. The intention was twofold, as Soto had amusingly felt Latino families were "very nosy" while also showing that "family is our superpower to some extent". He also described Reyes' transformation as being similar to the works ofDavid Cronenbergbut for kids and wanted the film to be fun.[33][21]He also focused on the pronunciation of names in the film, and included a scene in whichVictoria Kordcalled an employee Sanchez despite it not being his name. The decision to include the scene was to show that "Latinos are not a monolith", with Soto further adding that the audience would feel the warmth of Reyes' family and become familiarized with them after the first act.[33]Co-starSusan Sarandonrevealed the following month that the film would have several scenes spoken in Spanish, with subtitles being provided.[34]Soto affirmed this, saying the film would feature "Spanglish", saying Spanish will be used for scenes that feature elder characters and also when characters "speak from the heart".[26]Soto had also stated that the film would explore Victoria Kord's relationship with her brotherTed Kord. He also stated that the presence of Ted's daughter, his gadgets, and the idea of Ted andDan Garrettwould also impact the film's story, although it would be contextualized through Reyes's perspective.[21]WriterGary Daubermanprovided off-screen additional literary material for the film.[35]
The film is set in the fictionalPalmera City, which was an original creation for the film, rather thanEl Paso, Texasas is featured in the comics.[36]Soto said this was to create a world specific to Jaime Reyes on a similar level toMetropolisforSupermanandGotham CityforBatman, and to help position the character as "a potential leader" in the new DC-based franchise theDC Universe(DCU),[37]while stating that Gunn and Safran felt that the film could be included anywhere in the DCU timeline.[38]Soto had explained that the creative team had created the city as a "metropolitan of Latinos", and that the city was divided into two parts: Reyes's neighborhood and the affluent financial district. He had also identified Reyes's upbringing as being more humble, as his family had come from the working class, had been struggling, and was also a part of "marginalized communities under the threat of gentrification".[21]Inspiration for the film came from the video gameInjustice 2(2017) and the comic book storyline "Infinite Crisis" (2005–06), in which Jaime Reyes debuted, along with the comics inThe New 52for the design of the suit, while the comic book miniseriesBlue Beetle: Graduation Day(2022–23) incorporated elements from the film, such as Palmera City andVictoria Kord.[37]
Xolo Maridueña was Soto's first choice to portray Reyes, with Soto explaining that he "couldn't stop seeing [Maridueña] as the character" since he was hired to direct the film, enjoying his performance inCobra Kai. He also noted that his experience with martial arts while filmingCobra Kaiwould help with his role as Blue Beetle.[7][21]Soto and Warner Bros. offered the role to Maridueña on August 1, 2021,[39]he was publicly revealed to be in talks for the film the next day,[6]and his casting was officially confirmed later that day at the premiere for the DCEU filmThe Suicide Squad(2021).[7][39]When learning of the role, Maridueña was most excited that Reyes is a Latino character and he could bring Latino representation to a superhero project.[7]
In early March 2022,Bruna Marquezinewas cast as Reyes's love interest, Jenny Kord,[10][9]withBelissa Escobedoplaying Reyes's sister Milagros,[10]andHarvey Guilléncast as Dr. Delacruz.[10][9]Later that month, the rest of Reyes's family was cast:George Lopezas uncle Rudy,Adriana Barrazaas Nana,Elpidia Carrilloas Rocio, andDamián Alcázaras Alberto. Soto said he wanted to create an authentic Mexican family with real accents and experiences, and also wanted the elder members of the family to be portrayed by "beloved" Mexican actors fromLatin American cinemawho had also crossed over toUnited States cinemaand paved the way for members of the younger generation, such as Maridueña and Escobedo.[8]By the end of the same month,Sharon Stonewas in talks to play the villain Victoria Kord, an original creation for the film which was believed to be the wife ofTed Kord, the secondBlue Beetlein the comics.[40]Raoul Trujilloalso joined the cast then asCarapaxthe Indestructible Man.[12]In mid-April 2022, Susan Sarandon was cast as Victoria Kord after negotiations with Stone ended.[13]In June 2023,Becky Gannounced that she would be providing the voice of Khaji-Da for the film.[15]
Blue Beetle's suit was designed byMayes C. Rubeoand the team from Nine B Collective. The design team was inspired by artistCully Hamner's original design of the comic book character and from his appearance inInfinite Crisis#3, theInjusticegames,Young Justice, andBatman: The Brave and the Bold. They had difficulty in creating the mask to fit Maridueña's full face while also allowing him to be emotive, particularly in the mouth area. As such, the team had decided to merge the designs of organic alien technology and insectoid features within his suit. Visual inspiration for Palmera City came fromAkira(1988),Neo Tokyo(1987), and Miami.[21]Soto decided to insert a NintendoPower Glovefor Blue Beetle following the inclusion of a shield in the script.[41]
Principal photographybegan by May 25, 2022,[42][43]taking place in theAtlanta metropolitan area, primarily at Wilder Studios inDecatur, Georgia,[44]using theworking titleMofongo.[45]Pawel Pogorzelskiserved as the cinematographer.[28]Christopher T.J. McGuire served as a camera and Steadicam operator, bringing experience fromThe Suicide SquadandGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Given Blue Beetle's focus on family and culture, McGuire emphasized naturalistic handheld camerawork to enhance intimate moments, while still employing superhero film staples like crane shots for large-scale action.[46]Scenes for the film's third act took place at theCastillo San Felipe del Morro, a 500-year-old Spanish fortress located in theOld San Juan,Puerto Rico.[47]Filming also occurred in El Paso.[48]Sarandon completed filming her scenes by the end of June,[49]and Trujillo said in early July that filming was almost complete.[48]
Filming in the tight interiors of the bug-shaped spaceship required innovative camera work. Due to limited space, the crew relied heavily on slider-mounted cameras to allow for subtle motion without forcing actors to hit rigid marks. Additionally, they used a Chapman Leonard M7 crane with a low-profile head to achieve dynamic tracking shots.[46]For the sequence where Jaime first bonds with the Scarab in his family's home, the crew primarily usedhandheld camerasto heighten the chaotic energy, particularly when Lopez's character is flung across the room. McGuire noted that actors like Maridueña and Barraza adjusted their performances to play-off the spontaneity of handheld shots.[46]One of the film's standout action sequences, where Jaime's energy shields inadvertently slice a bus in half, was achieved using two physically separated halves of a real bus.[46]
Filming at Castillo San Felipe del Morro in Puerto Rico proved logistically difficult, as all equipment had to be transported via a pulley system down steep stone steps. A particularly intricate shot inside the castle required a Jimmy Jib to descend into a narrow chamber as George Lopez and Belissa Escobedo's characters searched for Jaime.[46]For one shot, the crew needed to get the camera as low as possible for a dramatic angle on Victoria Kord dropping a control device. Without a prism lens, they resorted to digging a small divot in the grass—only to later discover they had inadvertently damaged anational heritage site, resulting in a $10,000 fine.[46]Filmingwrappedon July 18 in Puerto Rico.[50]Two days ofadditional photographytook place in February 2023.[30]The film was primarily shoton locationwith a heavy use of practical effects, such as for the Blue Beetle suit. Soto felt that the use of real-life locations allowed for the practical effects to be better integrated into the film. He said he wanted to prevent the film from relying too heavily on visual effects, which he described as "a tool, not a dependency", to avoid overworking the visual effects artists.[47]
Craig Alpertedited the film while Kelvin McIlwain served as the visual effects supervisor, after previously working on the DCEU filmsAquaman(2018) andThe Suicide Squad(2021).[9]Visual effects were provided byDigital Domain,Rise FX,Rodeo FX, andIndustrial Light & Magic.[51]The film features a stop-motion sequence featuring the eponymous character from the Mexican television seriesEl Chapulin Colorado(1973–1979), recreating the 1979 intro of the series; the sequence was animated at Achó Studios, with Quique Rivera serving as animation director on the sequence.[52]The sequence was conceived by Soto and Dunnet-Alcocer, both of whom grew up watching the series and wanted to include an homage to it.[53][54]McGuire emphasized the challenge of framing for both the standard 2.39:1 aspect ratio and the tallerIMAXratio, particularly in key action sequences like the bus scene. The team protected for IMAX in VFX-heavy scenes to allow flexibility in post-production. They usedPanavisionH Series lenses, chosen for their clarity and ability to fully use the frame.[46]
One ongoing challenge was framing for the Scarab's back claws, which would be digitally inserted later. McGuire noted that they constantly had to account for the extra space theappendageswould take up in the frame.[46]The film features twolong take('oner') sequences. The first, aSteadicamoner at the swimming pool, follows Raoul Max Trujillo's character, Carapax, as he enters a military compound. The shot moves from him to Susan Sarandon's Victoria Kord, capturing generals walking away before spinning back to her for a key dialogue moment. The second oner, shot by Geoff Haley, was a handheld sequence inside the Reyes home, tracking multiple characters through a moment of exposition.[46]
While much of the final battle used VFX for backgrounds, many sequences—including large-scale burns—were shot practically on location. McGuire noted the importance of keeping camera movements smooth for VFX-heavy shots, opting for remote heads instead of handheld work to give digital artists more stability in post-production. The Reyes' barrio scenes, in contrast, leaned on Steadicam and crane work for a mix of fluidity and controlled action.[46]
Bobby Krlicwas confirmed to score the film by the trailer's release in April 2023.[55]A soundtrack album featuring his score was released byWaterTower Musicon August 18, 2023;[56]a track from the soundtrack album, "Blue BeetleSuite", was released as a single on August 11.[57]
Soto, Dunnet-Alcocer, and Maridueña promoted the film at the virtualDC FanDomeevent in October 2021, where they discussed their preparation for filming and revealed concept art for the film.[58]The first trailer for the film was released on April 3, 2023, revealing that the film takes place in Palmera City, an original location created for the film. It also showed a first look at the costumes ofDan GarrettandTed Kord, the previous Blue Beetles before Jaime.[36]The Verge'sAsh Parrish thought that the trailer looked "fun" and stated: "I didn't immediately roll my eyes at yet another superhero flick, so that might be a good sign DC has something decent on its hands."[59]Devan Coggan fromEntertainment Weeklythought Lopez comparing Jaime's situation to Batman was an amusing moment, while noting the trailer had posited Jaime's character as being "an aimless college grad, who's close with his family but a bit directionless".[60]
A second trailer was released on July 11, 2023, throughEntertainment Tonight. Andy Behbakht, writing forScreen Rant, felt the trailer contained more action scenes than the first and focused on Jaime's relationship with theScarab.[61]ForEmpire, James White opined that the trailer's tone was a "blend" of other films such asIron Man(2008),Spider-Man(2002), andSpy Kids(2001) and remarked that the trailer "promises action over angst".[62]Griff Griffin fromMen's Journalfelt the CGI in the trailer was better, and described the suit as being an "insectoid version ofIron Man'snanotech" fromAvengers: Infinity War(2018).[63]However, Kat Bailey fromIGNfelt that while the trailer offered a "more straightforward look at Reyes' powers" and fan reception was positive, fans were also worried about the film's success due to the critical and commercial failure of DC's previous 2023 films.[64]Warner Bros. partnered withToyotato promote the film and the 2024Toyota Tacomapickup truck, which is featured in the film.[65]
Blue Beetlepremiered inEl Paso, Texason August 14, 2023, in partnership with theEl Paso Times,[66]and had itsred carpet premiereat theTCL Chinese Theatreon August 15. Due to the then-ongoing2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, the cast of the film did not attend the premiere, with Soto praising them as "heroes".[67]Blue Beetlewas theatrically released in the United States on August 18.[27]In discussing the film's reception, McGuire pointed out the difficulties of releasingBlue Beetlein the wake ofOppenheimerandBarbie, two cultural juggernauts that dominated box office discussions.[46]He acknowledged the impact of lingeringCOVID-19concerns and high ticket prices, making audiences more selective about what they see in theaters. The shift away from second-run and discount theaters also meant fewer opportunities for discovery, a change he found unfortunate given the film's unique cultural resonance within the Latino community.[46]
Blue Beetlewas released ondigital downloadon September 26, 2023, and onUltra HD Blu-ray,Blu-ray, andDVDon October 31, byWarner Bros. Home Entertainment.[68]The film became available for streaming onMax, the successor to HBO Max, on November 17, 2023,[69]where it debuted as the most streamed film on the platform in the United States.[70]
Blue Beetlegrossed $72.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $58.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $130.8 million.[5]It is the lowest-grossing film in the DCEU, behindShazam! Fury of the Gods(2023), and underperformed at the box office.[2][71][65]
In the United States and Canada,Blue Beetlewas released alongsideStrays, and was projected to gross $25–32 million from 3,871 theaters in its opening weekend.[72][3]The film earned $10 million on its first day, including $3.3 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $25 million, topping the box office and becoming the first film to dethroneBarbie; 39% of the opening weekend audience was Hispanic, while 66% was male.[2]The film's $43 million global opening was described byVarietyas "one of the softest starts in the history of the DC Cinematic Universe",[73]which was attributed totwo concurrent strikes in Hollywood, and a tepid audience awaiting the arrival of Gunn and Safran's DCU slate.[2]Warner Bros. cited the effects ofHurricane Hilaryas a reason behind the poor domestic opening, given it affected Los Angeles which was one of the film's top markets.[74]The film earned $12.2 million in its second weekend (a drop of 51%), finishing third behind newcomerGran TurismoandBarbie.[75]National Cinema Day, a day where movie theaters offer discounted tickets for moviegoers, was credited for boosting the film's Sunday numbers in its second weekend.[76]It earned $7.1 million in its third weekend (and a total of $9.4 million during the four-day Labor Day weekend), remaining in third place.[77]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 77% of 277 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "Led by Xolo Maridueña's magnetic performance in the title role,Blue Beetleis a refreshingly family-focused superhero movie with plenty of humor and heart."[78]OnMetacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 from 52 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[79]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakreported that moviegoers gave the film an 82% positive score, with 65% saying they would definitely recommend it.[2]
Mark KermodeofThe Guardiangave the film 4/5 stars, writing, "Blue Beetlemay be frontloaded with visual fireworks that neatly meld the practical and the virtual, but it is the likable interplay between its down-to-earth characters that gives the film oomph, making it more than just aShazam-style romp."[80]Odie Henderson ofThe Boston Globegave the film 3/4 stars, calling it "a watchable time-waster made better by the actors and the cinematography by Pawel Pogorzelski."[81]The A.V. Club'sJustin Lowe gave it a B− grade, writing, "the filmmakers and the SFX team have created a memorable visual style for the film, supported by a wide array of Latino talent that underpins the authenticity of the narrative and the visuals."[82]The Independent'sClarisse Loughrey gave it 3/5 stars, calling it "a likeable, if predictable, take on the superhero origin story that at no point invokes time travel, the multiverse, or a ginormous portal in the sky. And thank god for that."[83]
Jake Wilson ofThe Agewas more critical, writing, "Director Angel Manuel Soto and writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer do their best to weave a few additional progressive elements into this basically routine production, evidently aimed at younger viewers." He gave the film 2.5/5 stars.[84]Ed Potton ofThe Timesgave it 2/5 stars and wrote, "Blue Beetleis the latest product off the superhero production line and it's as tediously familiar as rail strikes and rainy Augusts. The only thing that differentiates this DC Comics adaptation from its scores of predecessors is the fact that its characters are mostly Latino-American."[85]CNN Entertainment's Brian Lowry praised the casting and action sequences, but criticized the villain as "lousy". He concluded, "Blue Beetlemight be able to soar into the stratosphere, but that feels like a hurdle the movie just doesn't clear."[86]
At the51st Saturn Awards,Blue Beetlewas nominated forBest Superhero Filmand won forBest Younger Performer in a Film(Maridueña).[87]Blue Beetlewas nominated for the Emerging Technology Award at the22nd Visual Effects Society Awardsfor the development of "Machine Learning Cloth".[88]
Soto emphasized the film's focus on Latino representation, highlighting its central theme of family and cultural identity. He credited filmmakers such as Alfonso Cuarón and Guillermo del Toro for paving the way for Latino storytellers in Hollywood and sought to integrate aspects of Latin American culture throughout the film.[23]Soto and screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, who is from Mexico, incorporated references likeMaría la del BarrioandEl Chapulín Coloradoto reflect shared cultural touchstones. The film also includes historical references, such as the School of the Americas and U.S. intervention in Latin America, as part of the backstory for the antagonist, Conrad Carapax.[23]
In January 2023, Gunn said the film was "disconnected" from previous DCEU entries and could connect to the DCU.[89]By April, the Blue Beetle character was reportedly part of Gunn and Safran's plans for the DCU.[9]In June, Gunn said Blue Beetle would be the first DCU character while notingSuperman(2025) is the first DCU film,[90]while Safran soon clarified that Maridueña's Reyes would continue in the DCU but the film itself would stand on its own.[91]Later that month, Soto saidBlue Beetlewas a part of the DCU and future plans for the franchise, but was not connected to all prior DCEU films, explaining the film "lives in the world where superheroes exist. But that doesn't mean that a certain event, or certain alliance, or certain things from the past dictate where our film is going". He also expressed interest in the film being the first part of a trilogy.[92]In September, Gunn reiterated that Maridueña would continue to play Reyes in the DCU, but clarified that any DC media released before the first projects for the DCU in 2024 would not be canon to that franchise.[93]
In June 2024, DC Studios andWarner Bros. Animationwere revealed to be developing an animated television series focused on Blue Beetle for the DCU. It was expected to build off the film but tell its own story, and had the potential to lead to Maridueña starring in a DCU film if successful. Miguel Puga had been working on the series since early 2024 and was expected to serve asshowrunnerand director. Cristian Martinez was set as writer, with Soto, Dunnet-Alcocer, and Rickard all serving as executive producers.Galen Vaisman, an executive producer on the film, was overseeing the series for DC Studios. Contracts with the main cast were said to be "in flux" but DC Studios had received positive responses when asking the film's cast about returning to reprise their roles.[94]Maridueña confirmed in July that he would reprise his role as Blue Beetle in the series,[95]and said in February 2025 that the series was intended to debut in 2026.[96]

The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]

DC Studiosis an American film and television production company that is a division ofWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD). It is responsible for the production of live-action and animated films and television series, as well as video games, based on characters from theAmerican comic bookpublisherDC Comics, primarily as part of its flagshipmedia franchiseandshared universe, theDC Universe(DCU). The studio has been led by writer/directorJames Gunnand producerPeter Safranas its co-chairmen and co-CEOs since it was formed in November 2022.
The studio's predecessor,DC Films, was formed in May 2016 as a division ofWarner Bros. Picturesto oversee DC-based film productions, primarily those from its shared universe franchise theDC Extended Universe(DCEU). It was led by DC comic book and television writerGeoff Johnsand Warner Bros. producer Jon Berg as co-chairmen. After several DCEU films received poor reception and underperformed financially, the duo stepped down by the end of 2017, and the division was reorganized, withWalter Hamadahired as the studio's president. Following the merger of DC and Warner Bros. ownerWarnerMediawithDiscovery, Inc.in April 2022, WBD overhauled operations, resulting in Hamada stepping down in October 2022. DC Films was then dissolved in favor of DC Studios, a new division with greater oversight of DC media. Gunn and Safran, who had worked on some DCEU projects, were hired to lead the studio, and the duo began work on the DCU as a new franchise to serve as asoft rebootof the DCEU.
From 2016 to 2023, DC Films produced 13 films within the DCEU, fromSuicide Squad(2016) toAquaman and the Lost Kingdom(2023), alongside two standalone films,Joker(2019) andThe Batman(2022).Jokerand the studio's filmAquaman(2018) are among the50 highest-grossing filmsof all time, withJokerbecoming the firstR-rated filmto gross over $1 billion. The first DC Studios production is the television seriesThe Penguin(2024), a spin-off fromThe Batman. DC Studios plans to release films and television series within the DCU, starting with the animated seriesCreature Commandosin 2024, and the filmSupermanin 2025. Productions that are not part of the DCU are set to be part of the "DC Elseworlds" label. The studio's first animated film will beDynamic Duo(2028).
After the divisive reception toBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016),Warner Bros. Picturessought to stabilize the direction of its media franchise andshared universe, theDC Extended Universe(DCEU). In May 2016, the studio reorganized to have genre-responsible film executives, thusDC Entertainmentfilms under Warner Bros. Pictures were placed under a new division, DC Films, to be led by Warner Bros.executive vice president, Jon Berg, and thechief creative officerofDC Comics,Geoff Johns. This was done in hopes of competing more directly withMarvel Studios' franchise, theMarvel Cinematic Universe. Johns kept his role at DC Comics, and reported to DC Entertainment's president,Diane Nelson, while Berg reported to Warner Bros. Pictures' president, Greg Silverman.[3]The division's formation was not designed to override the "director-driven" mandate.[8]
Justice League(2017) had one of the biggest film budgets (nearly $300 million) but grossed about $96 million in its opening weekend. An analysis inThe Washington Postexpected that there would be a course correction again, with a possible change in leadership.[9]Forbescontributors felt that the course correction would be for DC Films to give up on the shared universe, while continuing with theWonder Womanfilms and occasionally other films, as Warner Bros. had other franchises they could work with.[10]Despite this, in December, the studio reiterated their planned film slate for the DCEU.[11]That same month, Warner Bros. announced that a new strategy and organization of DC Films would occur, with Berg leaving his position as the studio's co-president of production to form a Warner Bros.–based production company withRoy Lee.[12][13]Johns was expected to remain involved in future DC films moving forward in an advisory role while continuing as the president and chief creative officer of DC Entertainment, with Warner Bros. expected to hire a new studio head.[12]In January 2018, Warner Bros. executiveWalter Hamadawas appointed as the new president of DC Films, to oversee the films in the DCEU. Hamada was closely associated withNew Line Cinema, and helped develop horror films, such asIt(2017) andThe Conjuringfilm franchise.[14]Johns subsequently left his role at DC Entertainment that June and he was no longer involved with the DCEU.[7]
In April 2022, after the merger between Warner Bros.' parent companyWarnerMediaandDiscovery, Inc.to formWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the new CEODavid Zaslavwas exploring a restructuring of DC Entertainment, including having a creative leader akin to Marvel Studios presidentKevin Feigeto lead its film and television projects.[15]Later in July,Toby Emmerichstepped down as the head of the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group. The group was restructured to give DC Films, Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, andWarner Animation Grouprespective leadership. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De LucaandPamela Abdybecame the co-executives of Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. They were also temporarily signed to oversee the remaining units of the group until the new positions were filled.[16][17]
When the release of the filmBatgirlwas canceled by WBD in August, Hamada was not consulted regarding the decision and only learned about it when De Luca and Abdy informed him at a test screening forBlack Adam(2022). Hamada was upset and considered resigning, but agreed to stay untilBlack Adam'srelease.[18]Later that month,Dan Linentered talks to oversee DC's film and television divisions. From this position, Lin was expected to report directly to Zaslav, while Hamada would depart the studio.[19][20]In September, Lin and WBD ended negotiations and agreed to part ways.[21]DuringBlack Adam'sTimes Square premiere in October, star and producerDwayne Johnsonsaid he could be a consultant at DC Films, helping the studio find its next creative leader.[22]Later that month, it was reported that De Luca had been effectively running DC Films in place of Hamada.[23]On October 19, Hamada departed the company, two days before the release ofBlack Adam.[24]
Less than a week after Hamada's departure, writer/directorJames Gunnand producerPeter Safran, who had previously worked together on the DCEU projectsThe Suicide Squad(2021) and its spin-off seriesPeacemaker(2022), were announced as the co-CEOs and co-chairmen of DC Studios, a newly-created production entity under WBD. DC Films was dissolved, and DC Studios helped oversee the remaining films from the studio that were pending release in 2023. The duo was tasked with leading the production of films, television, animation, and video games under the DC label, reporting directly to Zaslav, while also working alongside but independently of the heads of WBD's other divisions. Gunn oversees the creative development of DC projects, while Safran supervises the production side. Their roles officially began on November 1, 2022.[1][25][2][26]
In November, Gunn said that the studio would focus on multiple DCU live-action and animated projects, but also stated that they would acknowledge fan responses and complaints,[27]and confirmed all subsequent DC projects would be released under the DC Studios banner, including those that were filmed before the formation of the studio.[28]In December, Gunn announced that he was writing a new Superman film that would feature a younger actor in the role.Henry Cavillwas not set to return asSuperman, whileBen Affleck, who portrayedBruce Wayne / Batmanin the DCEU, was reported to be in talks to direct a new DC Studios project, before Affleck stated that he was not interested in directing a DC film.[29][30]Gunn later revealed that new DC films would have an equal focus on popular and obscure characters, drawing inspiration from the DC animated seriesJustice League Unlimited(2004–2006) andYoung Justice(2010–2022).[31][32]
On January 31, 2023, Gunn and Safran announced the first slate of DCU content, titled "Chapter One: Gods and Monsters". They also assembled awriters' roomthat includedDrew Goddard,Jeremy Slater,Christina Hodson, Christal Henry, andTom King.[31]Projects that are not a part of the shared universe will be branded as "DC Elseworlds".[33]The following month, Gunn confirmed development for animated films within both the DCU and DC Elseworlds.[34]Gunn said in March that they were working on potentially incorporating characters from DC'sVertigo Comicsimprint beyond theSwamp Thingfilm,[35]and said the following month that there were plans to incorporate characters from the DC-ownedMilestone Media, such asStatic.[36]In September, WBD announced that it would expand its production facility atWarner Bros. Studios Leavesden, England, which would serve as the primary production hub for DC Studios. Gunn and Safran were consulting on the expansion, with work starting in the second quarter of 2024 and was expected to be finished in 2027.[37]
In February 2024, Gunn and Safran worked with WBD corporate siblings to acquire theChristopher ReevedocumentarySuper/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story(2024).[38][39]This is the first film to be released under the DC Studios banner,[40]whileThe Penguin(2024) is the first DC Studios production and the first series to be released under that banner.[41]AtSan Diego Comic-Conin July 2024, Gunn unveiled the official logo for DC Studios as an updated version of the 1977 "DC Bullet" logo designed byMilton Glaser, alongside an animated introduction sequence featuring Superman,[42][43][44]in a recreation of the back cover ofSuperman#1(1939) designed byWarner Bros. Animation.[45]The updated logo was also being used for DC Comics and its affiliated units,[42][43][44]but was not used for some earlier projects that DC Studios had inherited, namelyThe Penguinand the animated seriesHarley Quinn(2019–present), because they were not as involved in those. A slightly different DC Studios logo animation is used for the end credits onThe Penguin, while a separate logo and opening animation are set to be used for future projects released under the "DC Elseworlds" banner.[45]
That October, DC Studios andWarner Bros. Pictures Animationgreenlit the theatrical animated filmDynamic Duo(2028), which is DC Studios's first animated film and the first new project to move forward at the studio following its DCU announcements.[46][47][48]The filmJoker: Folie à Deux(2024) is part of the "DC Elseworlds" label and was overseen by Warner Bros. Pictures co-chiefs De Luca and Abdy, without the involvement of Gunn, Safran, or DC Studios, although the DC logo used before that studio's formation is included in the credits. At the time of the film's release later that month, Gunn said that "[a]ll future films with DC characters [would] be DC Studios" productions moving forward,[49]and he later clarified that the studio would release every subsequent film and television adaptation from DC.[45][50]Ahead of the premiere of the DCU seriesCreature Commandosin December 2024, DC Studios announced the unscripted biweekly video podcast seriesDC Studios Showcase: The Official Podcast, produced byOBB Soundfor the streaming serviceMax.[51]Later that month, they also announced the launch of its DC Studios Fan First newsletter via DC's website, to provide updates on the company's projects, with an introduction message written by Gunn.[52]In February 2025, DC Studios announced that it had greenlit three "younger-skewed" animated series—Starfire!,My Adventures with Green Lantern, andDC Super Powers—which were being co-produced with Warner Bros. Animation.[53]
All of the live-action and animated films by DC Films and DC Studios are distributed byWarner Bros. Pictures.
In addition to the following films, DC Studios has also reserved release dates for unspecified films on May 29, 2026, and March 5, 2027.[60]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
