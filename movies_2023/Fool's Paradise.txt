The film tells the story of a down-on-his-luckpublicist, who gets his lucky break when he discovers a mute man, recently released from a mental health facility, who looks just like amethod actorthat refuses to leave his trailer.[2]
A muteJohn Doewith the mental capacity of a five-year-old is ejected from a mental hospital when the state cannot afford his treatment. He begins living on the streets and taking direction from whomever he comes across. While making a biopic aboutBilly the Kid, a producer is incensed that method actor Sir Tom Bingsley refuses to leave his trailer. Since this costs the film time and money, the producer resorts to using a stand-in. He sees the John Doe selling oranges on the street and hires him due to the striking resemblance to Bingsley.
Meanwhile, Lenny is a struggling publicist who has not been able to maintain one client since moving to L.A. and bribes his way onto studio lots to look for talent. Lenny sees John Doe filming the biopic and misunderstands his name to be "Latte Pronto." After Bingsley dies after hanging himself as a form of a method acting, the movie is forced to continue filming with Pronto as the star. Although hindered by Pronto's lack of acting talent and his continued looks to camera, co-stars Christiana Dior and Chad Luxt are inspired by the supposed avant-garde performance and emulate his acting style.
Lenny plans to propel Pronto into stardom by getting him an agent and representation. Pronto is befriended by Chad taking him to parties and showing him the Hollywood lifestyle. Eventually infatuated with Pronto, Christiana convinces him to marry her, and she decides they should adopt three children to increase their profiles in the media. "Billy the Kid" is a success, with critics praising Pronto's unusual performance.
At the after party, Lenny asks Pronto to confirm they will never end their business relationship. When Pronto cannot respond to Lenny's request, a security guard tries to escort Lenny out for disrupting the party. A fight breaks out with Pronto being blamed and sued by the guard. Pronto's agent asks him to lay low from the media, while informing him of an offer to star in "Mosquito Boy."
While filming "Mosquito Boy," Pronto is taken out by Chad for a night on the town. Chad, who collects gold, eventually gifts Pronto a piece of gold. Paparazzo interrupts their conversation and a fight ensues, which ends with the two in jail. Despite Chad being the aggressor, Pronto is blamed in the media. His arrest further strains his relationship with his representation. While filming a stunt for "Mosquito Boy," Pronto is seriously injured, and a young stand-in is used to replace him for most of the movie. Lenny promises to publicize the film into a hit regardless. Instead, the movie fails at the box office, and Pronto's representation leaves him. Frustrated with Pronto's failing stardom and controversies, Christiana divorces him, takes the children, and begins dating Chad.
Pronto is forced to move in with Lenny, and the two bond over their mutual hardships, although Pronto remains silent. After a bad decision to book Pronto as a cuckold in a pornographic film, Lenny has a heart attack due to his excessive consumption of energy drinks. Pronto stays by his hospital bedside but is forced to leave the room when a doctor asks him for a selfie. Due to a mix-up with a nurse and a deceased patient, Pronto believes Lenny died while Lenny believes Pronto abandoned him. Lenny resolves to become a better person and successful publicist. Meanwhile, Pronto returns to living on the street. Pronto befriends Dagger, a homeless man who was formerly a famous actor, and saves his life, gaining media acclaim and the Key to the City by theMayor.
The L.A. Mayor encourages Pronto to run for office on an anti-corporate platform since his acting career is over. However, Pronto is kidnapped by the rich Cote brothers, both oil businessmen, as they want to discourage his political career. Ed Cote threatens Pronto's life should he oppose any of the Cotes' business interests. In return for abandoning politics, Ed arranges for Pronto to get his representation back, although without Lenny, and another chance at a movie career. Disillusioned with filmmaking, Pronto abandons his new agent and wanders the streets. Much to his surprise, Lenny spots Pronto in the streets and chases after him. As they reunite, Lenny apologizes for using his friend as a meal ticket and tells Pronto he loves him. Finally managing to speak for the first time, Pronto responds, "I love you too" and gives Lenny his piece of gold that Chad had given him earlier. Shrugging off its importance, Lenny assumes the gold is fake and throws the rock in a fountain. The two depart together to enjoy dinner.

Bateman, along withArrested Developmentco-starsDavid CrossandTony Hale, was criticized for seemingly defendingJeffrey Tambor's volatile behavior on the set ofArrested Development. During a May 2018 cast interview forThe New York TimesBateman attempted to defuse the controversy:
"Again, not to belittle it or excuse it or anything, but in the entertainment industry it is incredibly common to have people who are, in quotes, 'difficult'. And when you're in a privileged position to hire people... you learn about character and you learn about work habits, work ethics, and you start to understand. Because it's a very amorphous process, this sort of [expletive] that we do, you know, making up fake life. It's a weird thing, and it is a breeding ground for atypical behavior and certain people have certain processes."
During the interview,Jessica Walterheld back tears while speaking of Tambor (who was present), insisting that the two had made amends after the incident.
"Verbally, yes, he [Tambor] harassed me, but he did apologize," she said, adding "Jason says this happens all the time. But, in like almost sixty years of working, I've never had anybody yell at me like that on a set. And it's hard to deal with, but I'm over it now. I just let it go right here... forThe New York Times."[45]
Within days after the interview, all three men issued apologies to Walter.[46][47]Bateman retrospectively stated he had overreached in his attempt to analyze the cause of Tambor's behavior.[48]In an interview withTime, Bateman was quoted saying, "I always thought it's important for people to treat one another with respect at work, no matter what industry you're in. The whole experience has allowed me to do a lot of listening, and I continue that to this day."[49]
In 1987, Bateman won thecelebrity portionof theLong Beach Grand Prix.[50]

Common was born on March 13, 1972, at the Chicago Osteopathic Hospital in Chicago'sHyde Parkneighborhood. He is the son of educator and former principal ofJohn Hope College PreparatoryHigh School, Mahalia Ann Hines, and formerABAbasketball player turned youth counselorLonnie Lynn.[15]Lynn shares the same first name as his father, grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather.[16]He is known by his middle name, Rashid, to his family and friends.[17]Lynn's godfather is basketball playerSpencer Haywoodwho was a teammate of his father on theDenver Rockets.[16]
Lynn was raised in theCalumet Heightsneighborhood.[18][19][20][21]His father left the family because of his drug and alcohol addictions while Lynn was young.[16]When he was aged two, Lynn's father attempted to take him and his mother to Seattle where he had arranged a tryout with theSeattle SuperSonics.[16]His father was arrested when the family stopped at a motel in Wisconsin and charged with false imprisonment.[22]
Lynn's parents divorced when he was six years old, resulting in his father moving toDenver, Colorado. This left Lynn to be raised by his mother; however, his father remained active in his life, and was able to get him a job with theChicago Bullsas a teenager. Lynn attendedFlorida A&M Universityfor two years under a scholarship and majored inbusiness administration.[23]
Lynn began rapping in the late 1980s, while a student atLuther High School Southin Chicago, when he, along with two of his friends, formed C.D.R., a rap trio that opened for acts such asN.W.AandBig Daddy Kane.[24]When C.D.R dissolved by 1991, Lynn began a solo career under the stage name ofCommon Sense. After being featured in theUnsigned Hypecolumn ofThe Sourcemagazine, he debuted as a solo artist in 1992 with the single "Take It EZ", followed by the albumCan I Borrow a Dollar?.
With the 1994 release ofResurrection, Common Sense achieved a much larger degree of critical acclaim which extended beyond the Chicago music scene. The album sold relatively well and received a strong positive reaction amongalternativeandunderground hip hopfans at the time.Resurrectionwas Common Sense's last album produced almost entirely by his long-time production partner,No I.D., who would later become a mentor to a youngKanye West.
In 1996, Common Sense appeared on theRed Hot Organization's compilation CD,America Is Dying Slowly(A.I.D.S.), alongsideBiz Markie,Wu-Tang Clan, andFat Joe, among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as "a masterpiece" byThe Sourcemagazine. He would later also contribute to theRed Hot Organization'sFela Kutitribute album,Red Hot and Riotin 2002. He collaborated withDjelimady Tounkaraon a remake of Kuti's track, "Years of Tears and Sorrow".
The song "I Used to Love H.E.R." fromResurrectionignited afeudwithWest Coast rap groupWestside Connection. The lyrics of the song criticized the path hip hop music was taking, utilizing a metaphor of a woman to convey hip hop[25]and were interpreted by some as directing blame towards the popularity of West Coastgangsta rap. Westside Connection first responded with the 1995 song "Westside Slaughterhouse," with the lyrics "Used to love H.E.R., mad cause I f*cked her". "Westside Slaughterhouse" also mentioned Common Sense by name, prompting the rapper to respond with the scathingPete Rock-produced attack song "The Bitch in Yoo". Common Sense and Westside Connection continued to insult each other back and forth before finally meeting withLouis Farrakhanand setting aside their dispute. Following the popularity ofResurrection, Common Sense was sued by anOrange County-basedreggaeband with thesame name, and was forced to shorten his moniker to simply Common.[26]
Initially scheduled for an October 1996 release, Common released his third album,One Day It'll All Make Sense, in September 1997. The album took a total of two years to complete and included collaborations with artists such asLauryn Hill,De La Soul,Q-Tip,Canibus,Black Thought,Chantay Savage, andQuestlove– a future fellow member of theSoulquariansoutfit. The album, which made a point of eschewing any gangsterism (in response to questions about his musical integrity), was critically acclaimed and led to amajor labelcontract withMCA Records. In addition to releasingOne Day, Common's first child, daughter Omoye Assata Lynn, was born shortly after the release of the album.
As documented by hip-hop journalist Raquel Cepeda, in the liner notes for the album, this event had a profound spiritual and mental effect on Common and enabled him to grow musically while becoming more responsible as an artist. She writes:
Common addresses family ethics several times onOne Day..., and the album sleeve is decorated with old family photos, illustrating the rapper's childhood, as well a quote from1 Corinthians 13:11, which summarizes the path to manhood:
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.
FollowingOne Day..., Common signed a major label record deal withMCA Recordsand relocated from Chicago to New York City in 1999. He began recording almost exclusively with a loose collective of musicians and artists (dubbed the "Soulquarians" by central figureQuestlove) throughout 1999, and made a few sporadic guest appearances onThe Roots'Things Fall Apart, and theRawkus Recordscompilation,Soundbombing 2.
In 2000, his fourth album,Like Water for Chocolate, was released to mass critical acclaim.Executive producedby Questlove and featuring significant contributions byJ Dilla, (who helmed every track except – "Cold Blooded", "Geto Heaven Part II", "A Song For Assata", "Pop's Rap Part 3...All My Children" & theDJ Premier-produced track "The 6th Sense"),Like Water for Chocolatetranspired to be a considerable commercial breakthrough for Common, earning the rapper his firstgoldrecord, and greatly expanding his fanbase among critics and listeners alike.
With both artists hailing from theGreat Lakes regionof the United States (Chicago and Detroit, respectively), Common andJ Dillaestablished their chemistry early on. Both became members of theSoulquarianscollective, and collaborated on numerous projects together, even placing one song, "Thelonius", on both theSlum VillagealbumFantastic, Vol. 2, and Common'sLike Water for Chocolate. As Dilla's health began to decline from the effects ofLupus Nephritis, he relocated to Los Angeles, and asked Common to make the move with him as a roommate (Dilla would later lose his battle with the rare disease).[27]
This album saw Common exploring themes (musically and lyrically), which were uncommon for a hip-hop record, as he does on the song "Time Travelin' (A Tribute To Fela)"; a homage toNigerianmusic legend, and political activistFela Kuti. The most popular single from the album "The Light" was nominated for aGrammy Award.
In 2002, Common released his fifth album,Electric Circus. The album was highly anticipated and praised by many critics for its ambitious vision. However, it was not as commercially successful as his previous album,Like Water for Chocolate, selling under 300,000 copies. An eclectic album,Electric Circusfeatured fusions of several genres such as hip hop, pop, rock, electronic, and neo-soul. The album's style tended to divide critics; some praised its ambitious vision while others criticized it for the same reason. Most of the criticism tended to revolve around the album's experimental nature; some felt Common had strayed too far from his previous sound. This was Common's second and last album for MCA, and the label's final release prior to its absorption into Geffen Records.
Around this time, Common appeared as a guest performer on singer and fellow SoulquarianBilal'sLove for Salealbum, recording a remake of the 1977Fela Kutisong "Sorrow, Tears & Blood".[28]Bilal also featured onElectric Circus, the first of many future collaborations with Common.[29]
In early 2004, Common made an appearance on fellow Chicagoan Kanye West's multi-platinum debut album,The College Dropout(on the song "Get Em High"), and announced his signing to West's then-newfound labelGOOD Music. West had been a longtime fan of Common and the two even participated in a friendly on-air MC battle, where West took jabs at his lyrical idol for "going soft" and wearing crochet pants (as he does for his appearance in the video for theMary J. Bligesong "Dance for Me"). The pair worked together on Common's next album,Be, almost entirely produced by Kanye West, with some help from Common's longtime collaboratorJames Yancey(J Dilla) – also a favorite of West. The album was released in May 2005, and performed very well, boosted by Kanye's involvement and the singles "The Corner", and "Go".Beearned Common the second gold record of his career, with sales topping out at around 800,000 copies.The Sourcemagazine gave it a near-perfect 4.5 mic rating,XXLmagazine gave it their highest rating of "XXL", and AllHipHop gave the album 4 stars. The album was also nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2006.
Following the release ofBein 2005, several mixed-race artists from the UK hip-hop scene took exception to Common's comments about interracial relationships on the song "Real People."Yungun,Doc Brownand Rising Son recorded a track over an instrumental version of "The Corner" named "Dear Common (The Corner Dub)." Common states that he has heard of the track but never actually taken the time to listen to it, and has not retaliated in song.[30]
Common's seventh LP titledFinding Foreverwas released on July 31, 2007. For this album, he continued his work withKanye West, as well as other producers such asWill.i.am,Devo Springsteen,Derrick Hodge, andKarriem Riggins, as well as the onlyJ Dilla-produced track, "So Far To Go". The album features guest spots from artists such asDwele,Bilal,D'Angelo, and UK pop starletLily Allen. The first single from the album was "The People" b/w "The Game". West predicted thatFinding Foreverwould win the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.[31]The album was nominated for Best Rap Album, but did not win, losing to West'sGraduation; however, Common did win his second Grammy for "Southside," which won the 2008 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by Duo or Group.
On July 31, 2007, Common performed a free concert in Santa Monica, California, on the 3rd Street Promenade to promote the release ofFinding Forever. Common explained to the audience that the title "Finding Forever" represented his quest to find an eternal place in hip-hop and also his wishes to be an artist for the rest of his life. The album debuted at #1 on the nationalBillboard200charts.
In an August 2007 interview withXXL, rapperQ-Tipof the groupA Tribe Called Queststated that he and Common were forming a group called 'The Standard', and were planning to record an album to be produced by Q-Tip; however, this never came to fruition.[32]
Common was instrumental in bridging the trans-Atlantic gap by signing UK's Mr. Wong and J2K to Kanye West's Getting Out Our Dreams recording outfit. Common met the pair during his tour in the UK earlier on in the year. It is speculated that the deal is not only to bring the UK and US hip hop genres together but that to rival Syco Music's cross-Atlantic success with Leona Lewis. He also has a deal with Zune mp3 players. In 2008 Common made an estimated 12 million dollars, making him equal in earnings toEminemandAkon, tied for the 13th highest grossing Hip-Hop artist.[citation needed]
The eighth album from Chicago hip-hop artist Common was originally scheduled to be released on June 24, 2008, under the nameInvincible Summer, but he announced at aTemple Universityconcert that he would change it toUniversal Mind Control.[33]The release date was pushed back to September 30, 2008, due to Common filmingWanted. The release date was set for November 11, 2008, however, it was once again pushed back to December 9, 2008.
The album'seponymouslead single"Universal Mind Control", was officially released on July 1, 2008, via the US iTunes Store as part ofThe Announcement EP(sold asUniversal Mind Control EPin the UK). The song features Pharrell, who also produced the track.The Announcement EPincluded an additional track titled "Announcement", also featuring Pharrell. The video for the lead single was filmed in September by director Hype Williams. In 2009, Common was prominently featured throughout his GOOD Music label-mateKid Cudi's debut albumMan on the Moon: The End of Day, as a narrator and featured artist. In late 2009, it was revealed Common was nominated for twoGrammysat the52nd Annual Grammy Awards, includingBest Rap Performance by a Duo or Groupfor "Make Her Say", alongside Kid Cudi and Kanye West, as well asBest Rap AlbumforUniversal Mind Control.
American producerNo I.D., stated that he andKanye Westwould be producing Common's albumThe Dreamer/The Believer.[34]In July 2011, it was announced that No I.D. would be the album's sole producer.[35]Common made an appearance onThe Jonas Brothers' most recent album,Lines, Vines and Trying Timesas a guest rapper for the group's 2009 song, "Don't Charge Me for the Crime."[36]
On July 6, 2011, Common released his first single, titled "Ghetto Dreams", from his next album. A second single, "Blue Sky", was released on October 4, 2011. On December 20, 2011, Common released his ninth solo album, titledThe Dreamer, The Believer. Although he left GOOD Music in 2011, Common was featured on the label's first compilation album, 2012'sCruel Summer.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
