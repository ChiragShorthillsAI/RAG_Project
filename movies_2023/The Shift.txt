The Shiftis a 2023 AmericanChristianscience fictionthrillerfilm written and directed by Brock Heasley and starringKristoffer Polaha,Neal McDonough, Elizabeth Tabish,Rose Reid,John Billingsley, Paras Patel,Jordan AlexandraandSean Astin. It is a loose adaptation of theBook of Job.[4]
The film was released in theaters on December 1, 2023, to mixed reviews from critics.
In 2008,hedge fundmanager and recovering alcoholic Kevin Garner loses his job following the collapse ofBear Stearns. Devastated and planning to fall off the wagon, Kevin goes to a bar, where he is interrupted right before the first drink by a woman named Molly, who approaches him on a dare from her friends. The two hit it off, Kevin decides to continue his sobriety, asks Molly out on a formal date, and they ultimately get married. Years later, Kevin and Molly are estranged following the disappearance of their son, Daniel. Molly has become an embittered alcoholic and Kevin is unhappy in his job, as his younger boss hates people like him because his parents lost their home in thesubprime mortgage crisis. After learning he will be fired, Kevin leaves work and during a drive home ends up in a car accident, apparently pulled from the wreck by a mysterious stranger who identifies himself only as "The Benefactor". The Benefactor tells Kevin that he has actually "shifted" him to another reality following the accident, and that they're now in a parallel universe.
The Benefactor and Kevin go to a café, and Kevin sees that all the staff and patrons inside are terrified of the Benefactor. After a tense conversation at the table, Kevin realizes that the Benefactor is actuallySatan. The Benefactor offers Kevin anything he wants so long as he works as one of his "shifters", people who have sold their souls and use "shifting" for transferring other people to alternate universes, thus making the transferees swap places with theirdoppelgangersin those other universes - all versions of Kevin from other realities already work as his "shifters"; what's more, Kevin's wife has already been "shifted" twice, without anything being noticed. Kevin is skeptical and asks the Benefactor to prove it, suggesting that Tina, a waitress in the café, be "shifted" for demonstration. The Benefactor does just that, then informing Kevin that he's intentionally "shifted" Tina to a universe in which she's never existed, and that such "shifts" are cruel because of deranging effects on the "shifted" person's psyche. Realizing that this action will drive Tina insane, Kevin begins to say under his breath a prayer to God for help. Enraged, the Benefactor snarls that he'll never leave Kevin alone and that he's better than God and certainly better than Kevin, before vanishing abruptly and leaving Kevin trapped in thatdystopianuniverse. Horrified at what he's just done, Kevin apologizes to Tina's family and leaves.
Five years later, Kevin is still in thetotalitarianreality, living under an assumed name to hide his identity as the "Kevin who refused" who said an "illicit prayer" at the café. In that universe,most of the planet was destroyedby constant war. At first the "shifters" operated in secret, moving between alternate universes and exiling anybody regarded as "problematic" by the regime, with the help of small wrist-worn shifting devices called "deviators"; with millions of people vanished without trace, order could be restored in remaining areas of human habitation. After the Benefactor arrived and the surviving world leaders ceded control to him, he made the world over in his image, with most living in squalid, poverty-stricken cities ruled with an iron fist by the Benefactor'ssecret police. Kevin attempts to write down from memory as many passages from theBibleand as closely to original text as he can remember and distributes the typed pages through his friend Gabriel, despite Scripture being illegal. Kevin also shares the story ofJobwith his neighbor, Rajit, and his family. Kevin's only solace is going to a movie theater owned by Russo, which plays a live feed from the viewer's direct doppelgangers in alternate realities.
In the theater, Kevin sees several versions of Molly, one of which is a single mother working as a nurse and still wearing a necklace that Kevin bought for her before their estrangement and which only the "original" Molly wore until she was replaced by the Benefactor with her doppelganger. Kevin plans to obtain a deviator from one of the "shifters", but their identities are secret. Kevin hears an announcement on TV that the Benefactor is returning to that reality for the first time in five years, and acquires an illegal firearm from Gabriel, intending to force the Benefactor to take him back to his previous life in the old reality. However, the plan fails and the police open fire during a raid on Rajit's adjacent apartment, wounding Rajit and knocking Gabriel unconscious. Kevin sees a deviator on Gabriel's wrist and realizes that Gabriel has been one of the Benefactor's secret "shifters" all along.  Kevin then shifts himself to another reality with Gabriel's deviator.
Kevin shifts through several universes, eventually encountering an unhinged Tina in a psychiatric ward. The next shift brings him back to his bullet-riddled apartment in the dystopian reality. He runs to Russo's cinema and together they are able to identify the other universe from which the view of Molly with the necklace originates; after feeding the coordinates into the deviator, Kevin is shifted to that universe. Molly in that universe is upset by conversation with Kevin, suggesting that they both should move on and reminding him that break-up of their marriage was initiated by him - but Kevin also feels that their relationship could be still revived. Suddenly the Benefactor returns Kevin to the totalitarian universe, shifts Tina to Russo's cinema and tells Kevin that he should choose between restoring Tina to her family (never to see Molly again) and staying with Molly forever after accepting the Benefactor's offer to become his shifter. Kevin decides to give Tina her life back, and immediately after that he's suddenly shifted to another reality. In that reality, Molly is the nurse and single mother he saw previously and doesn't recognise him. He strikes up a conversation similar to their first meeting, and the two get married once again. Kevin states that although this is not his universe, it is his home. He's seen playing with his newborn son and his adopted daughter, proving that he was given double what he lost.
In apost-credits scene,Kristoffer Polaha(who portrays Kevin in the film) thanks all viewers for watching the film and briefly mentions the inspirations for its screenplay and behind its production.
Principal photographybegan on January 30, 2023 in Birmingham, Alabama, and shot for six weeks.[6][7]The original plan was to shoot the film in Atlanta, Georgia.[8]
The Shifthad an early screening at the168 Film FestivalinFayetteville, Georgiaon November 3, 2023.[9]The film was originally scheduled to be released in theatres in January 2024,[5]but was moved up to December 1, 2023.[10]
The film made $4.4 million from 2,450 theatres in its opening weekend, finishing in eighth place, behindAnimal.[11]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 37% of 35 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus reads: "The Shift's solid cast and intriguing premise are steadily squandered by its jumbled story's unsuccessful attempt to put a sci-fi spin on the Book of Job."[12]Audiences surveyed byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled byPostTrakgave it an 85% overall positive score, with 69% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[11]
Frank Scheck, writing fromThe Hollywood Reporter, arguedThe Shift"traffics in the same annoying multiverse complications that have made the Marvel films so laborious." He went on to say "As the storyline endlessly and confusingly shifts from one reality to another, it's all too easy to tune out until we encounter one that's interesting. Alas, that never happens."[13]TheChicago Reader's Noah Berlatsky was similarly negative, writing "Brock Heasley'sThe Shiftis a remarkably incoherent farrago of sci-fi tropes and Christian proselytizing... [The] film slogs ahead in a manner that is both nonsensically erratic and completely predictable, with a heavy-handed voiceover inadequately trying to pull the narrative together and create some vague dramatic tension."[14]Variety's Peter Debruge wrote "For believers looking to spend their bucks on films that reflect their values, "The Shift" does a serviceable job of offering them another genre to explore... Heasley first made "The Shift" as a 21-minute short, and there's just enough here to support a feature." However, he concluded "It all would have worked better if audiences bought the relationship between Kevin and Molly, but the two leads lack chemistry or a compelling meet-cute (the one Heasley provides is almost painful)."[4]
Reviews from faith-based publications were more positive.Christianity Today'sRebecca Cusey calledThe Shift"an entertaining, thoughtful, and cinematically competent retelling of Job", but criticized that "like many faith-based films... [it has] a bit too much telling and too little showing."[15]

Angel Studios, Inc.is an American independent media company andfilm distribution studiobased inProvo, Utah.[1]It operates theover-the-topvideo on-demandserviceAngel Studios.[2]Thestreaming serviceis available worldwide and can be accessed viaweb browsersor viaapplication softwareinstalled onsmartphones,tablet computers, andsmart TVs.[3]
Angel Studios emerged as the result of a bankruptcy reorganization fromVidAngel,[4]usingequity crowdfundingthrough Angel Funding[5]to finance its original productions by offering individual investors the opportunity to purchase shares in the company and its titles.[6]Content produced by Angel Studios is distributed for free on their own streaming service.[2]Some titles are also available in other third-party streaming services asdistribution deals.[7]
The studio has become known for itsChristian-themed films. Notable titles that Angel Studios has produced include the filmSound of Freedom,[8][9]and the television seriesThe Chosen.[10][11][12]
Angel Studios was originally founded as VidAngel in 2014 by Neal Harmon, Jeffrey Harmon, Daniel Harmon, Jordan Harmon, and Benton Crane. According to Neal Harmon, the brothers wanted to be able to show any movie to their children without worrying about explicit material.[13]VidAngel provided a filtering service that allowed viewers to skip or mute scenes they did not want to watch from streamed movies and TV shows, by allowing viewers to set customized filters on graphic violence, nudity, and profanity.[14]
In 2016, VidAngel was sued by several major Hollywood studios for copyright violations, accusing the service of streaming unlicensed content that was not created by VidAngel.[15]VidAngel fought the lawsuit for several years, asserting its method was legal under the Family Movie Act of 2005, and then eventually reached a settlement in 2020.[16]
As a result of the lawsuit, the Harmon brothers decided to sell the filtering service business and instead focus on producing original content through equity crowdfunding.[17]The previous VidAngel service was sold to VidAngel Entertainment, and the company was rebranded as Angel Studios in 2021.[18]
In December 2016, VidAngel was undergoing a lawsuit. To raise money for operations and lawsuit costs, the company conducted a Regulation A+ securities offering with a goal of $5 million in investment. It met its goal after 28 hours and had crowdfunded over $10 million after five days.[19]
In 2017, the company conducted another Regulation A+ securities offering to crowdfund Season 1 ofThe Chosen.[20]Neal Harmon and Jeff Harmon worked together with Dallas Jenkins and Derral Eves to produce and stream a multi-season television series about the life of Jesus and his disciples. After a pilot episode was developed, the company raised $13 million in equity crowdfunding to finance the first season, the largest amount ever crowdfunded for a TV show.[21]
Also in 2017, a third foray into equity crowdfunding came from the launch ofDry Bar Comedy, a series of 52 originalstand-up comedysets filmed in Utah that are generallycleanand performed by lesser-known comedians. Much of its content went viral, withDry Bar Comedyvideos receiving over two billion views as of 2021.[22]
The success ofDry Bar ComedyandThe Chosengave way to a new business model that would allow the company to produce and distribute original content. The founders decided to focus on developing original content using its equity crowdfunding model and rebrand as Angel Studios.[23]
Angel Studios was named after the "angel investors" that participate in the new model that uses equity crowdfunding to finance original productions. These productions are distributed via the Angel Studios streaming platform for free. The company relies on apay what you wantrevenue model, coined "Pay It Forward", in which viewers can optionally pay for the content if they choose to support it.[24]
In early 2021, Angel Studios purchased the domain angel.com for $2 million.[25]Soon after, Angel Studios launched an investment portal called Angel Funding that offered investment opportunities through Regulation Crowdfunding securities offerings.[26]
Several productions were successfully funded through the investment portal after its launch in March 2021.Tuttle Twins, a show for children with educational themes on economic freedom raised $4.6 million in equity crowdfunding for its production.[27]The Wingfeather Saga, an animated series based on the award-winning book collection of the same name raised $1 million in the first 48 hours and $5 million in 20 days.[28]
In April 2021,The Chosen, which was originally distributed through the VidAngel platform, was made available on Angel Studios for the launch of Season 2. The show became a viral hit with renowned success worldwide.[29]
In 2022, Angel Studios raised $47 million in an investment round led by a Gigafund, a venture capital company.[30]In May 2022, the studio reported that it had $123 million in revenue, and that 50,000 people have invested over $100 million for production of new original content on its platform.[31]
As of 2022, Angel Studios had 50,000 individual investors and had over $100 million worth of original content, including 12 titles, in production.[32]
The Angel Guild, launched in 2023, is a  group of approximately 1 million members who review and vote on completed episodes and movies to help Angel Studios decide if they should take on a project. If a film or show's voting results meet the Guild's minimum eligibility requirements, the project enters into a due diligence process to determine its potential for distribution.
Angel Guild members pay a monthly or annual membership fee to receive exclusive benefits such as access to Angel Studios’ entire library, new monthly releases, merchandise discounts, two complimentary movie tickets to every release, and more. The Angel Guild supports Angel Studios’ mission to share stories that amplify light.
Notable films greenlit by the Angel Guild includeHis Only Son, which earned $13 million at the worldwide box office, andSound of Freedom, which grossed $250 million after Angel Guild members voted for its distribution.
On February 7, 2025, Angel Studios signed a deal with U.K.'s only faith-based distributor Kova Releasing as well as previous partnerships with A Contracorriente (Spain), Blitz (Croatia and ex-Yugoslavia), Filmone (Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria), Neema Media (Benelux), Nos (Portugal), Paris Films (Brazil) and Santa Barbara Films (Colombia). On February 10th, 2025, Angel Studios partnered with more studios include Saje Distribution (France), Kinostar (Germany), Rialto (Australia, New Zealand), Role (multiple Latin American countries), Crystalsky (Philippines), Empire (multiple African countries), Shaw (Singapore) and Skyline Entertainment (Sri Lanka).
The Chosen, a streaming multi-season television series created byDallas Jenkinsand about the life of Jesus, was first produced under the VidAngel umbrella and later distributed by Angel Studios.[55]The series was supported byequity crowdfundingand raised over $13 million, the largest amount ever crowdfunded for a TV show.[55]Following the Season 3 finale in February 2023,The Chosenand Jenkins broke away from Angel Studios.  The show is now handled by the Come and See Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation formed specifically to produce, license, and distributeThe Chosen.[56]
Following months of legal arbitration between Angel Studios and The Chosen LLC, a decision by the arbitrator in favor of The Chosen was given in late May 2024.  One day after Jenkins announced the ruling, Angel Studios' CEO Neal Harmon announced his company planned to appeal.[57][58]
Dry Bar Comedywas one of the preceding company's first forays into original content, launched in 2017.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
