Chevalieris a 2022 Americanbiographicaldrama filmbased on the life of the titular French-Caribbean musicianJoseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, played byKelvin Harrison Jr.Directed byStephen Williamsand written byStefani Robinson, it starsSamara Weaving,Lucy Boynton,Marton Csokas, Alex Fitzalan,Minnie DriverandRonkẹ Adékoluẹjo.
Chevalierhad its world premiere at the47th Toronto International Film Festivalon September 11, 2022, and was released in the United States bySearchlight Pictureson April 21, 2023. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics.
In the late 1770sMozart visits Paris.[3][a]He is performing on stage when a man who introduces himself asJoseph Bolognerequests to accompany his performance ofViolin Concerto No. 5. Initially, both Mozart and the audience underestimate Joseph, but once he impresses them with his performance, the two musicians perform battlingcadenzapieces, ending in a triumph for Joseph.
Joseph is born inGuadeloupetoGeorges de Bologne[fr], a white French slaveowner, and Nanon, a young enslaved woman of African descent, on Bologne's plantation. As a child, Joseph is taken to a boarding school in Paris after his father notices his skills in music, dancing, andfencing. Joseph is harassed, bullied, and mistreated by many of his white peers and white teachers but excels at his studies inviolinplaying andcomposition. At the royal court,Marie Antoinetteis impressed after seeing him win a fencing contest, and shegrants him the title"Chevalier" (French for "knight") de Saint-Georges. Saint-Georges becomes a favored companion of the Queen and is a popular member of the court. Saint-Georges also attracts the attention of many female suitors, particularlyMarie-Madeleine Guimard, but he falls in love withMarie-Joséphine[fr].
Saint-Georges seeks to become the director of theParis Opera, but the committee in charge favors a rival,Christoph Willibald Gluck. He goes to Marie-Joséphine's cousin,Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis, who agrees to produce an opera he has written to demonstrate his talent. Marie-Joséphine agrees to be the lead singer of his opera, even though her husband,Marc-René de Montalembert, refuses to allow her to perform. She leads the opera anyway and begins an affair with Saint-Georges.
After his father's death, Saint-Georges' mother isfreedfrom enslavement, and he pays for her to join him in Paris. However, he slowly grows to resent his mother as she sees him as rejecting his true self in order to appease the white-dominated society around him. He is also ambivalent to thegrowing social discontent, intellectual discourse, and the large black population that surrounds him in Paris.
Marie Antoinette informs Saint-Georges that the committee will never choose him because no performer will work under a black man. She refuses to defend him and compromise her own standing among the nobility. Saint-Georges attends Gluck's debut and drinks heavily. After he publicly insults Gluck, Guimard, and the Queen, Marc-René has him restrained and beaten for dishonoring his wife. Months later, Marie-Joséphine gives birth to a mixed-race child; the infant is killed on her husband's orders. Now ostracized from high society, Saint-Georges becomes close with his mother and embraces his true heritage.
As theFrench Revolutionbegins, Saint-Georges organizes a concert to raise funds for the anti-royalist faction. Marie-Joséphine and Marie Antoinette both visit him separately, but he rejects their attempts to win back his friendship. The Queen threatens to revoke his status as Chevalier and have him arrested if he puts on his concert. Saint-Georges plays the concert anyway, with his natural hair no longer hidden by apowdered wig, and is nearly arrested by Marc-René. The audience members, however, rise against the officers, and Marc-René is forced to let him go. Saint-Georges walks out, passing the Queen and protestors.
A textual epilogue reveals that, in 1802,Napoleonprohibited Chevalier's music productions and re-instatedslavery in French colonies.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
