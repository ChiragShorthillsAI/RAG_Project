It is the fourth installment of thePet Semataryfilm series and starsJackson White,Forrest Goodluck,Jack Mulhern,Henry Thomas,Natalie Alyn Lind,Isabella Star LaBlanc,Samantha Mathis,Pam GrierandDavid Duchovny. Set in 1969, 50 years before the events of the previous film, the plot follows a young Jud Crandall as he discovers a local Native American cemetery where the dead can live again, without realizing the horror that will affect his life.
After the commercial success ofPet Semataryin 2019, producerLorenzo di Bonaventurahad plans for a prequel explaining the mythology and universe of the film. In February 2021, the film wasgreen-lit, with Buhler and di Bonaventura returning in their roles as screenwriter and producer, respectively. Beer signed on as director in May 2021 andprincipal photographybegan in August of the same year.
Pet Sematary: Bloodlinespremiered atFantastic Feston September 23, 2023, and was followed by its streaming launch onParamount+on October 6 and received generally negative reviews from critics.
In 1969 Ludlow, Maine, a farmer named Bill Baterman drags the body of his son Timmy, who was killed in the Vietnam War, down into the pet cemetery, and buries him. Moments later, their dog Hendrix senses something and digs near Timmy’s grave, where a hand bursts out and grabs the dog.
Jud Crandall lives with his parents Dan and Kathy, and is dating a young woman named Norma. He is set to leave Ludlow to join the Peace Corps in Michigan. While going into town with Norma, Jud runs into Bill and finds a photo of himself as a kid with Timmy and another local young man, Manny Rivers, who lives nearby with his sister Donna and also has aspirations for leaving Ludlow. Bill makes it seem like Timmy has been honorably discharged and has returned home.
The next day, Jud and Norma head off for their trip. They find Hendrix in front of the car, looking filthy and growling at them. They walk the dog back to the Baterman house, where they see Timmy. Hendrix bites Norma's arm, and Jud takes her to the hospital. Manny appears to hear noises from deep in the crops and sees blood dripping off a sunflower before he trips and impales his hand on a large thorn. Jud runs into Manny outside the hospital and tries to talk to him about Timmy. Manny suggests that Timmy may be suffering from PTSD from the war. When Jud returns to the Baterman home, he finds Timmy standing above a hog that has been gored to death, before seeing Bill and telling him about Hendrix. Meanwhile, Timmy is in the basement, writing down the names of several people in Ludlow with blood. He whispers to himself about killing them before they kill him.
Later that night, Officer Marjorie Washburn goes home and sees Hendrix there, with Timmy mocking her father's suicide. She calls Ludlow's mayor Hannibal Benson before the dog attacks her, though she survives after killing Hendrix. Donna is stalked and attacked by Timmy at home, where he chases her into the crops before grabbing her. Jud and Manny go to a priest, who tells them about the history of Ludlow and the pet cemetery. In 1674, the Mi'kmaq tribe lived on the land. Ludlow, for whom the town was named, was a settler who disappeared. His men found him after he was buried in the pet cemetery, feasting on human flesh before he is killed again for good. Jud confronts his dad with this knowledge, and he learns that the ancestors of the town's inhabitants have always guarded the town's secret in the hopes to keep others out of there.
Timmy buries Donna in the cemetery, leading her to rise up as an undead monstrosity. She goes to Norma's hospital room and reveals her decaying skin to her. Donna runs after Norma and kills a doctor before cornering her in the main office, where she starts to choke her. Jud later finds out Norma is in trouble while Dan tries to round up Mayor Benson, Marjorie, and Sheriff Anderson to find and kill Timmy, as Manny joins the group to find Donna. They enter the Baterman home after Bill agrees to help. Timmy kills Mayor Benson, Marjorie, and Anderson, while Donna fatally impales Dan with his own rifle. Manny shoots his undead sister, killing her.
Jud and Manny join Bill as he guides them through a tunnel that Timmy built, which is also where Norma has been left tied up while the hole she is in is filling up with mud. Timmy finds the three, and when Bill attempts to put his son down, Timmy disembowels him. Jud and Manny resurface into the swamp, where Timmy goes after Jud and tries to drown him. Manny fires a flare at Timmy's head, killing him for good. Norma breaks herself out of her pit and runs back to Jud.
In the aftermath, Jud and Norma stay with Kathy to continue his father's work of keeping the evil out of town, while Manny leaves Ludlow.
Additionally,Vincent Leclercplays a priest andTed Whittallplays a hospital visitor.
In March 2019, producerLorenzo di Bonaventurastated that a prequel toPet Sematary(2019) was possible if the film was a success financially.[2]The following month, directors Kevin Kölsch and Denis Widmyer ruled themselves out of returning, saying, "If you were going to do more, you'd probably do backstory stuff. [...] I'd be really interested to see how somebody would do a sequel to this movie. It probably won't be us".[3]
In May, screenwriter Jeff Buhler stated that there had been preliminary discussions on a continuation, saying, "So a lot of the ideas that we've been batting around currently, recently, have all been about, more about digging into the mythology of the town, these rituals that children present, the mythology of theMicmac, theWendigo, the cemetery, the origins, Jud's life. So it looks like, I don't want to promise anything, because we don't know, we're not even down the road on an idea yet."[4]
The film was officially announced in February 2021, with Buhler and di Bonaventura returning as screenwriter and producer, respectively.[5][6]Lindsey Beer was hired to direct in May.[7]In June,Jackson Whitewas cast as a young Jud Crandall.[8]The following month,Pam Grierjoined the cast.[9]Principal photographytook place inMontrealin August, with some scenes being shot atJohn Abbott College.[8][10]
Pet Sematary: Bloodlinespremiered atFantastic Feston September 23, 2023.[11][12]It was released byParamount+on October 6, 2023, in the United States, Canada, and Latin America, and the following day in other territories.[13]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 24% of 59 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Pet Sematary: Bloodlinestakes half-hearted stabs at expanding the world of Stephen King's original story, but they're largely lost in a substandard story that mistakes bland gore for effective horror."[14]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 31 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[15]
Michael Nordine  writing forVarietysaid, "Among the film's many flaws — its flat aesthetics, the forgettable characters who inhabit it (including David Duchovny and Pam Grier, both underused) — perhaps the most egregious is its utter lack of atmosphere. There's no sense of foreboding despite its attempts to unsettle, no feeling that the early warning signs are leading to anything especially frightening. Audiences already know what the eponymous burial ground does to anyone (or anything) unlucky enough to be interred there, andBloodlinesdoes little to live up to or expand the mythos".[16]Bob Strauss of theSan Francisco Chroniclewrote, "It's a better horror movie than the 2019 remake, but like Mary Lambert's 1989 production, it still feels unnecessary. Cool as the concept of a magic graveyard that brings beloved pets and, later, not so lovely people back from the dead may be, this remains second-rate King movie material".[17]
In September 2023, Beer stated that she would like to develop additionalPet Semataryinstallments to expand the franchise, which could further explore the origins of the evil in the franchise,[18]while the filmmaker expressed interest in being involved in the potential future.[19]By October of the same year, producer di Bonaventura stated that all creatives involved are considering developing a sequel, while producer Vahradian stated that future installments may further explore thedemonic entitywhich causes the horrific events of the franchise.[20]Later that same month, Beer confirmed that there are ongoing discussions to create additionalPet Semataryfilms, which may further detail the history of the ancient evil in Ludlow Town.[21]

She has one sister and one brother.[5]Grier said she is of Black, Hispanic, Chinese, Filipino, and Cheyenne heritage.[6]She was raised Catholic and later baptized as a Methodist.[7]
Because of her father's military career, the family moved frequently during Grier's childhood. In 1956, they moved toSwindonwhere her father worked on an air force base.[8]By Grier's account, hers was one of the only Black families in town, though she recalled that they faced no racism or segregation compared to that in the United States: "They didn't care that I was Black since they hadn't been raised to hate Blacks. Instead, they'd been raised to hate Germans... In the U.S., especially in the South, we were never able to get buses to stop for us, we couldn't eat in certain restaurants, couldn't use certain bathrooms. Up until 1969, there were department stores in which my father and I weren't even allowed to try on clothing."[8][9]
The family returned to the United States in 1958, when Grier's father was transferred to California'sTravis Air Force Base, eventually settling inDenver, nearLowry Air Force Base.[10]Grier spent part of her upbringing on her maternal grandparents'sugar beetfarm in ruralWyoming, where their ancestors had homesteaded after fleeing west via theUnderground Railroadto escape slavery.[11]Grier attendedEast High Schoolin Denver, and appeared in a number of stage productions, as well as participating inbeauty conteststo raise money for collegetuitionatMetropolitan State College.

While under contract at AIP, she became a staple of early 1970sblaxploitationfilms, playing bold, assertive women, beginning with Hill'sCoffy(1973), in which she plays a nurse who seeks revenge ondrug dealers. Her character was advertised in the trailer as the "baddest one-chick hit-squad that ever hit town!". The film, which was filled with sexual and violent elements typical of the genre, was a box-office hit. Grier is considered to be the first African-American woman to headline an action film, as protagonists of previousblaxploitationfilms were men. In his review ofCoffy, criticRoger Ebertpraised the film for its believable female lead. He noted that Grier was an actress of "beautiful face and astonishing form" and that she possessed a kind of "physical life" missing from many other attractiveactresses.[14]

... my father being a Russian Jew ....
My relatives are Scottish, so I think my Scottish audience is important. Some are in Glasgow, but my mum's from Aberdeen. I hear it's grey there—like my mum. The name's Russian, but New York is my home. That's where I'm from.
I like that I look like my father and mother put together—that's aRussian Jewand aScottishLutheran, and I like that it all looks mixed up. ... I'm sure my nose wasn't an asset until I was David Duchovny. Before that, it was, like, "Yeah, that kind of Jewish-looking guy with the kind of big nose."

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
