Distributed byA24,Beau Is Afraidpremiered at theAlamo Drafthouse Cinemaon April 1, 2023, and began alimited theatrical releasein the United States on April 14, 2023, before a wide release the following week. The film received generally positive reviews from critics but was abox-office bomb, grossing only $11 million.[7]Phoenix received aGolden Globenomination for his performance.[8]
Beau Wassermann, the son of Mona, a wealthy businesswoman, grows up without a father, who his mother claims died the night Beau was conceived due to a hereditaryheart murmurduring orgasm. Beau struggles with a recurring dream in which he watches as an identical version of himself demands to know what really happened; in response, his mother locks him in the attic. While on a cruise trip, a teenage Beau falls in love with a girl named Elaine Bray. The two kiss and promise to remain virgins until they meet again.
Now middle-aged, Beau suffers from extreme anxiety and lives alone in a crime-ridden city. He prepares to visit his mother for the anniversary of his father's death, but misses his flight after his belongings are stolen by a stranger. Beau calls his mother to explain the situation, but she dismisses him. After having been locked out of his house by deranged homeless people, he attempts to call his mother again, only to have it answered by aUPSdriver. The driver has discovered an unidentified body at the residence, leading Beau to believe his mother is dead. After confrontations with a home intruder and a police officer, Beau is hit by a food truck and stabbed to near-death by aserial killer.
Two days later, Beau awakens in the house of a married couple, Grace and Roger, who live with their angsty daughter Toni and an unstable veteran named Jeeves. He calls Mona's attorney, Dr. Cohen, who informs him that despitethe Jewish custom to lay the body to rest as soon as possible, her last wish was not to be buried until Beau was present. Roger promises to take Beau to his mother's estate as soon as possible but insists he rest until he is healed. On the day of Beau's release, Toni, who has grown to resent Beau for seemingly replacing her deceased brother, attempts to force him to drink a can of paint, before doing it herself, committing suicide. Grace discovers Beau standing over Toni's body and violently blames him for her death. As Beau flees into the woods, Grace sends Jeeves after him.
Lost in the wilderness, Beau comes upon a group of traveling actors named "The Orphans of the Forest". He is invited to their rehearsal and becomes entranced by the play, imagining himself as the protagonist who searches for his family after being separated by a flood. A man approaches him, claiming he knows his father, who is still alive. Jeeves ambushes the troupe, slaughtering several actors. Beau flees deeper into the woods but is knocked unconscious when Jeeves triggers ataser devicewithin Beau's ankle monitor, placed on him by Roger.
Beau hitchhikes to his mother's estate, only to find that he has just missed her funeral. A woman arrives late for the service; Beau realizes it is Elaine. They reconnect before having sex. Beau, terrified that he is going to die upon climaxing, is relieved when he survives. Elaine, however, dies mid-orgasm. Mona then appears and reveals that she has been alive and spying on him throughout his journey. She guilt-trips Beau for supposedly not loving her enough with audio recordings of his therapy sessions. Upon Beau's demand to know the truth about his father, Mona takes him to the locked attic. Imprisoned inside is his previously-unknown twin brother and his father, who is actually a giant penis-shaped monster. At that moment, Jeeves breaks into the house and is killed by Beau's father. Beau begs his mother for forgiveness, but Mona berates him, declaring her hatred. An enraged Beau briefly attempts to strangle her before she collapses.
In shock, Beau leaves the estate by motorboat. After entering a cave, the boat's motor begins to stall, and he suddenly finds himself in a crowded arena. He is put on trial for perceived slights against his mother, with Mona and Dr. Cohen acting as prosecutors; a cheap lawyer attempts to defend Beau from the absurd accusations, but is ultimately thrown to his death by Mona's employees. His feet glued to the boat, Beau tries to defend himself and appeal to his mother, but she is unresponsive. Realizing the futility of his situation, he decides to accept his fate. The motor explodes, capsizing the boat and drowning Beau. The credits roll as the crowd silently leaves the arena; Mona exits, sobbing uncontrollably.
Alicia Rosario appears as Toni's friend Liz.Patrick Kwok-Choon, Maev Beaty, andArthur Holdenappear as members of the forest theater troupe.David Mamethas a vocal cameo as a rabbi.
The cast announcement was in June 2021 with the filming of the film beginning in November 2021 and ending in the end of December 2021, lasting 12 weeks
The film had been in development byAri Asterfor some time, with a 2011 short film entitledBeau, that would later serve as the basis for a sequence in the feature film, and a 2014 draft of the script that circulated on the internet.[10]Aster has described the film in many ways, including initially as a "nightmare comedy,"[11]"aJewishLord of the Rings, but [Beau's] just going to his mom's house," and as "if you pumped a 10-year-old full ofZoloft, and [had] him get your groceries."[12]
For anIndieWireFilmmaker Toolkitpodcast, Aster and his regular cinematographerPawel Pogorzelskidiscussed three key films that influenced their approach forBeau Is Afraid:Jacques Tati's playful, dense comedyPlaytime(1967);Alfred Hitchcock's voyeuristic thrillerRear Window(1954); andAlbert Brooks' allegorical comedy-fantasyDefending Your Life(1991).[13]
Mark KermodereviewingBeau Is AfraidforThe Guardiansaid the film had "narrative echoes ofTristram Shandy(bothSterne'snovelandMichael Winterbottom'sfilm) and an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink aesthetic reminiscent of the chaoticCineramacomedyIt's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" (1963). Kermode comparedBeau Is Afraidto "Todd Solondz-style urban sickness", the "body horrorofDavid Cronenberg'sShivers" (1975), "Voltairegoes to hell viaDarren Aronofsky'sMother!" (2017), the "exuberantly manic energy ofPaul Thomas Anderson'sPunch-Drunk Love" (2002), the "nightmare logic ofDavid Lynch'sEraserhead(1977), "Charlie Kaufman's painfully contrivedSynecdoche, New York" (2008), and "slipping on aBuñuelianbanana skin".[14]
Sight and Soundalso found Charlie Kaufman influences, and said various moments inBeau Is AfraidrecalledFranz Kafka,Mark Twain, and theBook of Job.[15]
In February 2021,A24announced the film, then titledDisappointment Blvd.,[a]withJoaquin Phoenixon board to star in the leading role.[17]The film'sensemble castwas announced in June and July.[18][19]
Co-starStephen McKinley Hendersondescribed Aster and Phoenix as "so simpatico ... their way of working together was like they were really old friends. They could get upset and make up in the span of seconds, it seemed. But the work was always the better for it."[20]During a Q&A session on April 1, 2023 with actressEmma Stone, Aster recounted an incident in which, during the shooting of a "very intense" scene involving Phoenix's co-starPatti LuPone, Phoenix suddenly collapsed and lost consciousness as a result of the physical intensity of his stunts, which included breaking through glass. Initially annoyed because "it was a really good take", Aster realized it was serious as "[Phoenix] was letting people touch him and people were tending to him and he was allowing it".[21]
Principal photographybegan on June 28, 2021, and concluded that October.[22][23]The film was shot inDowntown Montreal, andSaint-Bruno-de-Montarville, an off-island suburb ofMontrealinQuebec, with cinematographer Pogorzelski and production designerFiona Crombie.[24][23]Animation for the film was done byCristobal León & Joaquín Cociña, who were personally chosen by Aster for their work on the 2018 stop-motion filmThe Wolf House.[25]With a budget of $35 million,Beau Is Afraidwas A24's most expensive film until it was surpassed byCivil War.[2]
The film's score was produced by Katherine Miller and composed by British electronic musician Bobby Krlic, who performs under the namethe Haxan Cloak. With the score, Krlic stated that "every step of the way [in the film, in relation to the score], you're with Joaquin, you're with Beau", adding that the score is meant to be a representation of Beau's mental state throughout the events of the film.[26]
The score was released on April 14, 2023, a week before the film's wide theatrical release, through A24's music division, and is separated into five parts, corresponding with the five acts of the film in which the songs appear.[27]
Beau Is Afraidofficially premiered in Los Angeles on April 10, 2023, at theDirectors Guild of America, with Aster and the cast in attendance.[28]The film initially had a sneak premiere with a Q&A moderated by Emma Stone at theAlamo Drafthouse CinemainBrooklyn, New York as part of anApril Fools' Dayevent with livestream screenings provided at Alamo theaters in select cities, as the audience attending was originally scheduled to watch thedirector's cutof Aster'sMidsommar(2019).[29]Further exclusive Q&A screenings were conducted, with moderators such asMartin Scorsese,Nathan FielderandRachel Sennott.[30]The film was released theatrically in the United States by A24 on April 21, 2023,[31]following a delay from its original 2022 schedule.[32]
The film was shown a week early in selectIMAXtheaters in Los Angeles and New York on April 14, before being released in select North American IMAX theaters on April 21.[33]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 67% of 272 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's consensus reads: "Beau Is Afraidis overstuffed to the point of erasing the line between self-flagellation and self-indulgence, but Ari Aster's bravura and Joaquin Phoenix's sheer commitment give this neurotic odyssey undeniable power."[39]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 63 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[40]
Writing forRogerEbert.com, Nick Allen gave the film three and a half out of four stars, calling it "gobsmacking, sometimes exhausting, always beguiling," and wrote that it was Aster's "funniest movie yet." He praised Phoenix's performance as "fascinating," and concluded that "the ambition is the point."[41]Mark Kermode's review forThe Guardianfound the film was "sprawlingly picaresque" and "a rambling, labyrinthine, navel-gazing romp." He gave it three out of five stars.[14]However,Peter Bradshaw'sGuardianreview found the film was an "epically pointless odyssey ofhipsternon-horror" and a "colossal recovered memory of mockOedipalagony which is scary, boring and sad." He gave the film two out of five stars.[42]
Manohla Dargisof theNew York Timeswrote that the film was "a supersized, fitfully amusing, self-important tale of fear and loathing," and chastised the run-time by saying, "It's a journey; midway, it becomes a slog."[43]Anthony LaneofThe New Yorkeralso found the film's "nervous wreckage" and excesses were "wearisome", noting that the "movie is laid out in ontological order, as it were, from being to nonbeing. If there is a plot, it's more like a plot of earth than a narrative; back and forth Aster goes through the years." But Lane found the middle animated sequence had an "oddly antiquated beauty" that owed a nod toThe Wizard of Oz(1939).[44]David Sims ofThe Atlanticalso praised the film's "impressionistic animated visuals".[45]
FilmmakerJohn WatersselectedBeau Is Afraidas the best movie of 2023. Writing forVulturehe said, "A superlong, super-crazy, super-funny movie about one man's mental breakdown with a cast better thanAround the World in 80 Days: Joaquin Phoenix, Patti LuPone, Parker Posey, Nathan Lane, and Amy Ryan. It's a laugh riot from hell you'll never forget, even if you want to."[46]Martin Scorsese was similarly enthusiastic about the film, citing Aster as "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema" and praising Aster for subverting the traditional three-act structure.[30]Other filmmakers have voiced their appreciation for the film, includingRobert Eggers,Ciro Guerra,Bill Hader,Don Hertzfeldt,Zoe Lister-Jones,James Ponsoldt,Jeff RoweandAdam Wingard.[47]The film ranked number 26 onSight and Sound's annual poll for the "best 50 films of the year," in a five-way tie withThe Beast,The Fabelmans,The DelinquentsandRotting in the Sun.[48]

In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

Soon after their second child was born, they joined the religious cultChildren of Godand travelled throughout theCaribbeanandSouth Americaas missionaries, where the next two children were born. They eventually became disillusioned with the group and left in 1977, being opposed to the cult's increasingly distorted rules, particularly the practice offlirty fishing.[13]The fifth child was born in Florida where the family settled; around this time they legally adopted the surname Phoenix, inspired by themythical birdthat rises from its own ashes, symbolizing a new beginning.[1]When Joaquin was three, he and his older siblings witnessed fish being stunned as "they were throwing them against the side of the boat", prompting the whole family to convert to aveganlifestyle.[14]At this time, Phoenix first referred to himself as "Leaf", having been inspired by spending time outdoors raking leaves and wanting a nature-related name like his siblings'.[2]He reverted to his birth name, Joaquin, at age 15.[1]

Instantaneous joy. The most enjoyable thing. For some kids, it's the first time they crack a ball or score a goal. For me, it was this. I was eight years old, and I remember the first scene on the TV set so vividly. And I knew that I loved it – the physical sensation; how powerful it was. That's the feeling I've been chasing ever since.[17]
In 1984, Phoenix starred opposite his brother River in theABC Afterschool SpecialentitledBackwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia, for which they shared a nomination for Best Young Actor in a Family Film Made for Television at the6th Youth in Film Awards.[18]He also made guest appearances in theMurder, She Wroteepisode "We're Off to Kill the Wizard", and individual episodes ofThe Fall GuyandHill Street Blues.[19][20]A year later, he appeared in the television filmKids Don't Tell.

The film premiered at the1995 Cannes Film Festivaland became a financial and critical success, withNew York TimescriticJanet Maslinpraising Phoenix's performance, writing "So pity poor Jimmy. Rivetingly played by Mr Phoenix with a raw, anguished expressiveness that makes him an actor to watch for, Jimmy is both tempted and terrified by Suzanne's slick amorality. In that, he speaks for us all."[30][31]
In 1997, Phoenix played a small-town troublemaker inOliver Stone'sU Turn, and a poor man in love with a rich woman inInventing the Abbotts.

Winslet and Phoenix generate real fire, notably when Abbe dreams of ravishing Madeleine on the altar."[43]For his combined roles of that year, Phoenix was awarded theBroadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actorand theNational Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor.[44]
The following year, Phoenix starred in the satirical filmBuffalo Soldiersas aU.S. Armysoldier. The world premiere was held at the 2001Toronto International Film Festivalin early September.

The science fictionthrillerSigns(2002) marked Phoenix's first collaboration with directorM. Night Shyamalan.

The film received mixed reviews from critics, but Phoenix's performance was praised, with critic Peter Travers writing that Phoenix "registers impressively, finding the humor and the pain in this lost boy [...] never making a false move as a helpless Merrill watches his rock of a brother crumble into a despairing crisis of faith."[48]The film was a commercial success, grossing$408.2 millionworldwide.[49]
In 2003, Phoenix played the irresolute husband of a superstar-skater (Claire Danes) inThomas Vinterberg's romance-dramaIt's All About Love,[50]and voiced Kenai in theDisneyanimated filmBrother Bear.

He admitted that he was afraid of heights before he started making this film, recalling "I got to the pole and I looked down and I couldn't do it. But you go through the training and it exposes your fears and helps you to overcome them. We ended up rappelling off a six-story tower and that really helped."[59]The film earned$102.3 millionat the box office[60]despite receiving generally mixed reviews.[61]Roger Ebertgave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the performances in the film.[62]Phoenix's final film of 2004 wasTerry George'sHotel Rwanda, playing cameraman Jack Daglish.

The closing credits make it clear it's Joaquin Phoenix doing the singing, and I was gob-smacked".[69]For his portrayal of Johnny Cash, he won theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedyand theGrammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Mediafor the film's soundtrack.[70]Phoenix also received a second Academy Award nomination, his first in theBest Actorcategory as well as a second BAFTA nomination.[71]Earlier that year, he narratedEarthlings(2005), a documentary about the investigation of animal abuse infactory farms, and pet mills, and for scientific research.

Phoenix's first producing task was the action thrillerWe Own the Night(2007), in which he played nightclub manager Bobby Green/Grusinsky who tries to save his brother (Mark Wahlberg) and father (Robert Duvall) fromRussian mafiahitmen. The James Gray-directed film premiered at the2007 Cannes Film Festivalto mixed reviews;[74]Roger Ebert praised Gray's direction and the acting, but criticized its screenplay for lack of originality.[75]David EdelsteinofNew Yorkmagazine commended Phoenix for elevating the film's conflict, writing that it "might be heavy-handed without Phoenix's face—his irresolution somehow more powerful than other actors' resolve. There is no artifice. He's not an actor disappearing into a role but a man disappearing into himself [...] Phoenix homes in on the truth of this person. It's the paradox of the greatest acting".[76]
Later that year, he played a father obsessed with finding out who killed his son in ahit-and-run accidentin his second feature with Terry George, the crime drama filmReservation Road. The film received mixed reviews from critics;[77]Peter Travers praised Phoenix's acting stating "Even the best actors—and I'd rank Joaquin Phoenix andMark Ruffaloamong their generation's finest—can't save a movie that aims for tragedy but stalls at soap opera."[78]Phoenix also executive produced the television show4Real, a half-hour program which began airing in 2007. The series showcased celebrity guests on global adventures "in order to connect with young leaders who are creating social and economic change".[79]
In 2008, Phoenix starred as a suicidal bachelor torn between the family friend his parents wish he would marry and his beautiful but volatile new neighbor in Gray'sTwo Lovers.

By claiming to retire from acting, he and Affleck planned to make a film that "explored celebrity, and explored the relationship between the media and the consumers and the celebrities themselves" through their film.[86][87]
In 2011, it was announced that Phoenix would star inPaul Thomas Anderson's drama filmThe Master, which traces the relationship between Freddie Quell (Phoenix), aWorld War IInavy veteran struggling to adjust to a post-war society and Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a leader of a religious movement known as "The Cause". To create the character, Phoenix lost a significant amount of weight and went to a dentist to help force his jaw shut on one side; a trait his own father had.[88]The film premiered at the2012 Venice Film Festivalwhere he won theVolpi Cup for Best Actor.[89]Theart house filmonly grossed$28 million[90]but was received with critical acclaim, with Phoenix's performance receiving high praise.[91]Peter Travers called it the performance of his career writing "Acting doesn't get better or go deeper[...]Phoenix wears the role like a second skin. You can't take your eyes off him." His performance as Freddie was described as "career-defining" byTodd McCarthyofThe Hollywood Reporter, who was impressed that Anderson and Phoenix collaboratively were able to build such complex work around such a derelict figure.[92][93]Fellow actorDaniel Day-Lewispublicly lauded the "remarkable" Phoenix while accepting the Screen Actors Guild Award, apologizing for the fact that Phoenix hadn't been nominated for the same award.[94]Despite this, Phoenix received his third Academy, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for his leading role.[95]
Phoenix and Gray's fourth collaboration came withThe Immigrant(2013), a drama film in which he played the supporting role of apimpwho prostitutesPolishimmigrant Ewa (Marion Cotillard) and ends up falling for her.The Immigrantand his performance premiered to highly positive reviews at the2013 Cannes Film Festival.[96]In his review,Ignatiy VishnevetskyofThe A.V. Clubthought the film featured one of his best performances and commended Phoenix's and Gray's developing work, writing of that "the two are so perfectly in sync, that it's hard to tell where Phoenix's performance ends and Gray's visual style[...]—begins", further lauding their development of Bruno into "a fully fledged tragic character, even though he is neither the protagonist ofThe Immigrantnor the main driving force behind its plot".[97]
His next feature film of that year was theSpike Jonze-directed romantic science-fiction dramaHer. He played Theodore Twombly, a man who develops a relationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), an intelligent computer operating system personified through a female voice. Released to critical acclaim, critic A.A. Dowd ofThe A.V. Clublabeled Phoenix as "one of the most emotionally honest actors in Hollywood", impressed at how he effortlessly unleashes waves of vulnerability in the film's many tight, invasive close-up images, calling it a "tremendous performance, one that rescues this character—a mess of insecurities, regrets, and desires—from the walking pity party he could have been".[98]Herearned more than double of its production budget,[99]and Phoenix received his fourth nomination at the Golden Globes.[100]Several journalists expressed disappointment over his failure to receive an Oscar nomination for it,[101]withPeter KnegtofIndieWirenaming it of one of ten worst Oscar actingsnubsof the last decade in 2015.[102]
In 2014, Phoenix took on the role of Doc Sportello, aprivate investigatorandhippie/dope headtrying to help his ex-girlfriend solve a crime in the crime comedy-dramaInherent Vice, based onThomas Pynchon's detectivenovel of the same name. Reviews toward the film were positive; critics praised Phoenix's performance and Paul Thomas Anderson's direction, while some were frustrated by its complicated plot.[103]Robbie CollinofThe Daily Telegraphtermed Phoenix as Anderson's "perfect leading man" and his work as "the kind of quietly dazzling performance that rarely wins awards but will be adoringly dissected and quoted for decades".[104]Phoenix earned his fifth Golden Globe nomination for the film.[105]
After narrating the sequel toEarthlings, the 2015animal rights' documentaryUnity,[106]Phoenix teamed with directorWoody AllenandEmma Stonein the crime mystery filmIrrational Man. He played Abe Lucas, a philosophy professor experiencing anexistential crisis. The film was released to mixed reviews at the2015 Cannes Film Festival;The Hollywood Reporterfelt that the film was too similar to Allen's previous films, but praised Phoenix's chemistry with Stone and Phoenix for playing the character "with a wonderful baggy, lived-in quality that makes us want to climb inside the character's whiskey-sozzled head".[107]
The thrillerYou Were Never Really Here, written and directed byLynne Ramsayand based on the novella of the same name byJonathan Ames, ranks among the most acclaimed films of Phoenix's career.[108]The film is about Joe (played by Phoenix), a traumatized formerFBI agentandGulf Warveteran who tracks down missing girls for a living. To prepare for the film, Phoenix was advised by a former bodyguard who goes on international missions to rescue children suffering sexual exploitation and abuse by human traffickers; he gained a significant amount of weight and muscle for the part.[109]Phoenix was Ramsay's first and only choice to play the veteran, with Ramsay calling him "my soulmate in making movies".[110]The film premiered at the2017 Cannes Film Festival, where earned Phoenix theCannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor.[111]Justin Changof theLos Angeles Timesdescribed Phoenix's performance as "the most rivetingly contained" work of his career[112]and Dominick Suzanne-Mayer ofConsequencenoted that his evocative manners in the film, led to him giving career-high work and "the kind of haunting turn that only comes around a few times every decade or so".[113]
In 2018, Phoenix portrayed Jesus in the biblical dramaMary Magdalene, written byHelen Edmundsonand directed byGarth Davis. The film, and his performance, received mixed reviews; a reviewer forEntertainment Weeklythought that Phoenix lacked the quiet compassion and grace that was required for the role, while Nick Allen of Roger Ebert's website described his performance as "a human being who is visibly tormented by the power and wisdom that works through him", deeming it one of the best portrayals of Jesus ever.[114][115]His next two features — the biopicDon't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Footand the crime dramaThe Sisters Brothers— were much better received. In the former, Phoenix reunited with hisTo Die Fordirector Gus Van Sant to portrayquadriplegiccartoonistJohn Callahan. Barry Hertz ofThe Globe and Mailwrote that there's no better leading actor producing better work than Phoenix, stating "The actor—never a simple chameleon, but someone who disappears into a role entirely with a frightening conviction—continues to display new and tremendous range here" and David Hughes ofEmpirethought that in a more conventional film, Phoenix would be the favorite to win an Academy Award.[116][117]
The third film of 2018 wasThe Sisters Brothers,Jacques Audiard's adaptation of thenovel of the same namebyPatrick deWitt. The film starredJohn C. Reillyand Phoenix as the notorious assassin brothers Eli and Charlie Sisters respectively and chronicles their chase after two men who have banded together to search for gold. Writing for Roger Ebert's website, Tomris Laffly commented on Phoenix's and Reilly's "tremendous chemistry" and Lindsey Behr of theAssociated Pressopined that the duo "excellently manage all the various tones in the film" they also shared credit withJake GyllenhaalandRiz Ahmed.[118][119]Also in 2018, he collaborated with Rooney Mara andSiato narrate Chris Delforce's documentaryDominion.[120]Animal rights activists have called it one of the most powerful documentaries ever made.[121]For his contribution to the documentary, Phoenix was granted the 2018 Award of Excellence for Narration by Hollywood International Independent Documentary Awards.[122]
In 2019, Phoenix starred as theDC ComicscharacterJokerinTodd Phillips's psychological thrillerJoker; an alternativeorigin storyfor the character. Set in 1981, the film follows Arthur Fleck, a failed clown and stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent counter-cultural revolution against the wealthy in a decayingGotham City. Phoenix lost 52 pounds (24 kg) in preparation,[123]and based his laugh on "videos of people suffering frompathological laughter" they also shared credit withRobert De Niro.[124]Released to critical acclaim at the76th Venice International Film Festival,[125]the film experienced a polarized critical reception after its theatrical release. While Phoenix's performance received rave reviews, the dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided opinions and generated concerns of inspiring real-life violence; the movie theater where the2012 Aurora, Colorado, mass shootingoccurred during a screening ofThe Dark Knight Risesrefused to show it.[126]Despite this,Jokerbecame a box office success grossing over$1 billion(against its$55 millionproduction budget), the firstR-rated filmto do so, becoming Phoenix's highest-grossing film.[127]Pete Hammond ofDeadlinewrote of Phoenix's "extraordinary" performance, describing it as "dazzling risky and original"[128]andThe Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called his performance the "must-see factor" of the film, writing "he inhabits [the character] with an insanity by turns pitiful and fearsome in an out-there performance that's no laughing matter[...]Phoenix is the prime force that makes Joker such a distinctively edgy entry in the Hollywood comics industrial complex."[129]The film earned him numerous awards, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, aSAGand aCritic's Choice Awardfor Best Actor.[130]
In 2020, Phoenix served as an executive producer onGunda, directed byViktor Kossakovsky. The acclaimed documentary follows the daily life of a pig, two cows, and a one-legged chicken.[131]That same year, Phoenix was named on the list of the 25 Greatest Actors of the 21st Century byThe New York Times. The list was compiled by famed criticsManohla DargisandA.O. Scottand Phoenix's paragraph was written by his frequent collaborator, director James Gray.[132]
In 2021, he starred inMike Mills' dramaC'mon C'mon, as Johnny, a radio journalist who embarks on a cross-country trip with his young nephew. TheA24film premiered at the48th Telluride Film Festivalwhere it scored the best per-venue average for a limited release since the start of theCOVID-19 pandemicupon its release.[133][134]Angelica Jade Bastién ofVulturepraised Phoenix, writing "a tremendous showing from Joaquin Phoenix, operating at a register he's rarely found before. It's a career best for him—lovely, empathetic, humane[...]He possesses a warmth that glows from beginning to end. As Johnny, Phoenix listens to people and the world around him with full-bodied curiosity. This is where the bravura lies in the performance: his ability to seemingly just be."[135]
Phoenix starred as Beau Wassermann, thetitle characterinAri Aster'ssurrealistblacktragicomedyBeau Is Afraid(2023), which was released on April 14, 2023, before a wide release the following week. In it, he portrays a mild-mannered butparanoia-ridden man who embarks on a surreal odyssey to get home to his mother, confronting his greatest fears along the way.[136]The actor shared the cast withAmy Ryan,Nathan LaneandPatti LuPone. The film received generally favourable reviews, with critics crediting Aster's direction and Phoenix and his "sheer commitment" to the role, for giving the film its "undeniable power".[137]Tomris Laffly ofTheWrapcalled his performance as Beau "one of his best performances", praising his ability to act with "a startling level of vulnerability[...]both enigmatic and translucently bare".[138]Phoenix received his seventh Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the film.[139]
Phoenix portrayedNapoleon BonaparteinNapoleon, his second collaboration with director Ridley Scott, released in November 2023, withVanessa KirbyasJoséphine de Beauharnais. The film grossed over$200 millionand received mixed reviews (though mostly negative reviews in France), mostly criticized for its pacing and historical inaccuracies. For example, the French GQ magazine called the film "deeply clumsy, unnatural, and unintentionally awkward."[140]In 2024, Phoenix reprised his role as Joker in Phillips' sequelJoker: Folie à DeuxwithLady GagaasHarley Quinn.[141]Unlike the first film, it emerged as a critical and commercial failure.[142]
Phoenix will next reunite with Lynne Ramsay inPolaris, co-starring Rooney Mara, and with Ari Aster in the contemporary Western filmEddington.[143][144]He was originally set to star alongsideDanny Ramirezin a film byTodd Haynes, a sexually explicit "love story between two men" set in 1930s Los Angeles.[145]Phoenix had co-written it with Haynes, advising him to "go further" with the explicit material, which Haynes said would have likely made it anNC-17rated film.[146]The project was cancelled when Phoenix abruptly exited five days before filming began.[147][148]
"When I was 15 or 16 my brother River [Phoenix] came home from work and he had a VHS copy of a movie calledRaging Bulland he sat me down and made me watch it. And the next day he woke me up, and he made me watch it again. And he said, "You're going to start acting again, this is what you're going to do." He didn't ask me, he just told me. And I am indebted to him for that because acting has given me such an incredible life".
At the beginning of his career, Phoenix was often referred to as "the second most famous Phoenix", his name associated most closely with the death of his brotherRiver Phoenix.[8]The media would often compare the two, withThe New York Timesdescribing Joaquin as "sweetly unsettling and endlessly vulnerable" compared to his brother's "pure all-American blond boyishness".[150]After his brother died, Phoenix gained a reputation for his distrust of the media, with many speculating that it is derived from how River's death was covered by the press. He was often asked about the day River died, and still is to this date. Phoenix has described these interviews as "insincere" and has felt that they impeded on the mourning process.[8][151]
Caroline Frost ofThe Huffington Posthas said that Phoenix is "engaging, engaged, mischievous, honest" in person andAnderson Cooperof60 Minutesthought that he was "wry, shy and couldn't be any more friendlier" adding that Phoenix "just doesn't like to talk about himself".[152]Although known for his intensity and darkness on-screen, directorJames Graywho worked with Phoenix in four feature films, says that Phoenix is very different off-screen saying "He's actually very tender and sweet and sensitive. It's almost as if he channels his intensity into the characters. Like the work is an outlet for his darker side."[110][153]
Phoenix has been described as one of the finest actors of his generation.[150][154][155][156]As he achieved stardom afterGladiator(2000), he was conveniently ruled out ofteen-idolroles because of his hard gaze and scarred lip.[154]Justin Chang, analyzing his career inLos Angeles Timesin 2020, remarked that filmmakers immediately seemed to recognize that Phoenix was more than a heartthrob, and that there was "something more tortured, more vulnerable and infinitely more interesting at play beneath the surface". He noted that through his work, Phoenix is challenging and redefining cinematic manhood and that this quality sets him apart from most of his contemporaries.[155]Film criticandfilm historianLeonard Maltinhas called Phoenix "a true chameleon", writing 
"[Phoenix] commands the screen and breaks your heart; he makes us feel it all vicariously."[157]
Phoenix is particularly known for his ability to heavily commit to each role he plays and his intense preparations, deeply immersing himself in the characters, often blurring the lines between fiction and reality.[158][8]That immersion was particularly evident during the filming of themockumentaryI'm Still Here(2010), when Phoenix announced to the world that he was retiring from acting to become a rapper. Throughout the filming period, Phoenix remained in character for public appearances, giving many the impression that he was genuinely pursuing a new career. Media outlets worldwide believed that Phoenix was having amental breakdownafter his infamous appearance onThe Late Show with David Letterman.[159]Confusion from the media turned to concern as the seemingly drug-addled Phoenix continued his attempts to convince crowds he was serious about a rap career. Many worried his erratic behavior was a sign he was stuck in a downward spiral, and headed down the same self-destructive path that took the life of his older brother. Although widely suspected to be a mockumentary, the fact that the events of the film had been deliberately staged was not disclosed until after the film had been released.[85]To this day, some people believe he went through a personal meltdown during the filming period.[8][160]Phoenix has credited the making ofI'm Still Herefor allowing him to make bolder choices in acting.[150]
Phoenix contends there's no real methodology to the roles he chooses, but has said that he is drawn to complex characters.[161]He speculates that his affinity for dark roles derives from something more ineffable, possiblyprenatalsaying that "I think there is a combination of nature and nurture[...]—and some of it is my upbringing." Even so, Phoenix remains reluctant to draw a line between his unusual childhood, his private tragedy and his talent for "inhabiting the morose, damaged, violent, and otherwise anxiety-riddled characters".[8]James Gray has described Phoenix as "one of the most incorruptible people I've ever known, and the least superficial", and has spoken of his acting, saying that he admires Phoenix's "limitless ability to surprise you in the best ways and inspire you to move in a direction that you haven't thought of originally, better than what you have in mind".[132][110]
Garth Davis, who directed Phoenix inMary Magdalene(2018), has remarked that he does not applymethod acting, but said that working with Phoenix is like "working with this beautiful wild animal, where you have to give him the space to be free, so his performance can roam freely: raw, uncontrived and truly natural. If he smells the design of the scene, you lose his free spirit; if the script is weak, he will expose its flaws. He is fiercely intelligent and almost completely instinctual. And he has this immense sensitivity that can be both his curse and his gift, but for me, that is what it means to be human".[110]In an interview withThe Guardianin 2015, Phoenix said that he prefersindependent filmovermajor studio film, citing that "the quality of acting suffers".[162]
In 2019, Phoenix stated that in choosing films, he solely relies on the director, "I don't really care about genre or budget size, anything like that. It's just whether there is a filmmaker that has a unique vision, has a voice, and the ability to make the film."[163]For Phoenix, a great performance is in the director's hands — it's ultimately the director's world he's entering. He maintains that the director creates the character's arc and that the best directors adjust to what is happening with the actor in the moment.[150]
Phoenix has citedRobert De Niroas one of his favorite actors and strongest acting influences. Phoenix recalled watchingRaging Bullfor the first time in an interview, "I think it just… awakened something in me. And I could suddenly see it through his eyes. There's a part inRaging Bullwhere De Niro meets a girl in between a chain-link fence. And he, you know, shakes her pinky and it's like this just beautiful little detail, it's this wonderful moment. And I think that in some ways is what I'm always looking for."[164]
Phoenix has directed music videos forRingside,[165]She Wants Revenge,[166]People in Planes,[167]Arckid,[168]Albert Hammond Jr.,[169]andSilversun Pickups.[170]He was said to have produced the opening track forPusha T'sMy Name Is My Namealbum alongsideKanye West. The track is called "King Push". Phoenix then denied in a statement toXXLhaving produced the record, saying, "While it was widely reported that Pusha T used my beat and that I produced his song, I can't take any credit. A friend's son played me his music, and all I did was make an introduction to Kanye [West]'s camp."[171]
Phoenix is identified as one of the most active celebrities in theanimal rights movement.[172]A vegan since age three, he does not wear any clothes made out of animal skin; he requests that all of his leather costumes in films are made from synthetic materials.[173]Phoenix has said that animal rights are one of the most important pillars in his life, and maintains that "climate change is imminent if we do not adopt a plant-based lifestyle".[174]He has helped raise awareness of the correlation between animal rights, climate change and health issues.[175]
Phoenix has received praise and accolades from animal rights groups, withPETAnaming him "Person of the Year" in 2019. PETA's president,Ingrid Newkirksaid in a statement: "Joaquin Phoenix never misses an opportunity to turn the spotlight away from himself and onto animals' plight and to set a great example of walking the vegan walk".[176]He has been an active supporter of numerous animal rights organizations, including PETA.[177]
"We go into the natural world, and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. Then we take her milk that's intended for her calf, and we put it in our coffee and our cereal. And I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something, to give something up, but human beings, at our best, are so inventive and creative and ingenious. And I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles, we can create, develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment."
Throughout the years, Phoenix has headlined numerous campaigns for different organizations to help promote veganism and end animal slaughter.[179]In 2019, Phoenix and his partnerRooney Maraled the National Animal Rights Day demonstration to help spread awareness for animal rights.[180]On January 10, 2020, Phoenix was arrested with actressJane Fondaat a climate change protest outside theUnited States Capitolin Washington, D.C. At the protest, Phoenix spoke about the link betweenanimal agriculture and climate change.[181]
Phoenix has also been vocal in drawing attention to the suffering of fish, which he sees as a neglected cause in the sphere of animal rights. Fish, says Phoenix, are the "last thing besides insects that people don’t really consider".[182]Phoenix's views were shaped by a childhood incident in which he saw fish brutally flung against the side of the boat.[183][184]In 2013, he simulated drowning in a 41-secondPETAspot, designed to dramatise how fish suffer in the final moments of their lives. The video was shot by photographer Michael Muller.[185]
During the 2019–20awards season, amid protesting for animal rights, Phoenix had been driving a behind-the-scenes movement that transformed five events to meat-free menus, beginning with theGolden Globe Awards. He acknowledged theHollywood Foreign Press Associationduring his acceptance speech, for its "very bold move making tonight plant-based. It really sends a powerful message." Soon after,Critics' ChoiceandSAGfollowed suit. Phoenix contacted the presidents of the award ceremonies, accompanied by signatures from the likes of fellow nomineesLeonardo DiCaprioandPhoebe Waller-Bridge. Phoenix's pitch was that meat agriculture is a leading cause of climate change and that the televised spectacles should use their platforms to address pressing societal issues. TheAcademy Awardslater announced that all food served at theDolby Theatrebefore the Oscars was going to be vegan. Lisa Lange, Senior Vice President of Communications at PETA, spoke of Phoenix's power saying "He knows what can be done. He knows he's in a good position to push. He enlists friends. And it works. He can have influence in Hollywood and it influences the rest of the world."[186]
A day after winning theAcademy Award for Best Actor, and subsequently delivering a headlining acceptance speech in which he spoke to the plight of mother cows and their babies used in animal agriculture, Phoenix helped to rescue a cow and her newborn calf from a Los Angeles slaughterhouse. They were taken toFarm Sanctuary, an animal sanctuary and advocacy organization, where they will live out the rest of their lives.[187]The same month, he starred inGuardians of Life, the first of twelve short films by the environmental organizationMobilize Earththat highlighted the most pressing issues facing humanity and the natural world. Funds raised by the project went toAmazon WatchandExtinction Rebellion.[188]Dávid Szőke and Sándor Kiss inFilm Internationalwere highly critical of this move, arguing that "what is rather mind-boggling is that the discourse centers less on the issue of the calf and its mother or the exploitation of our natural world, and more on Phoenix in the leading role as the savior of our planet, raising questions about the narrative’s alignment with his environmental activism."[189]
Two animal species have been named after him. In 2011, atrilobitespecies was namedGladiatoria phoenixfor his iconic role in the 2000 filmGladiator, and in 2020, a spider species endemic to Iran was namedLoureedia phoenixi(also known as the Joker spider) due to its color pattern matching the DC Comics characterJoker, for his role in the 2019 filmJoker.[190][191][192]
In 2020, Phoenix collaborated withJusticeLAto create a public service announcement #SuingToSaveLives about the health of people in L.A. County jails amid theCOVID-19 pandemic.[193][194]
In October 2023, Phoenix signed an open letter by artists to PresidentJoe Bidencalling for a ceasefire during theIsraeli bombardment of Gaza.[195]The letter reads: "We believe all life is sacred, no matter faith or ethnicity and we condemn the killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians."[196]
After reestablishing himself as an actor in the mid-1990s, Phoenix moved back toLos Angeles.[150]He is known for his disdain ofcelebrity culture, rarely granting interviews, and being reticent about discussing his private life.[110][151]In 2018, he described himself as asecular Jewwho did not affiliate with any organized religion; one of his "core values" is the idea of forgiveness.[197]He has also claimed that his mother believes in Jesus, though his parents were not religious. While portraying Jesus in the 2018 movieMary Magdalene, he expressed that the role changed his perspective on the nature of forgiveness.[198]
In early April 2005, Phoenix checked himself into rehab to be treated for alcoholism.[199]Twelve years later, he revealed that he did not need anintervention: "I really just thought of myself as ahedonist. I was an actor in L.A. I wanted to have a good time. But I wasn't engaging with the world or myself in the way I wanted to". On January 26, 2006, while driving down a winding canyon road in Hollywood, Phoenix veered off the road and flipped his car.[200]The crash was reportedly caused by brake failure. Shaken and confused, he heard someone tapping on his window and telling him to "just relax". Unable to see the man, Phoenix replied, "I'm fine. I am relaxed." The man replied, "No, you're not." The man then stopped Phoenix from lighting a cigarette while gasoline was leaking into the car cabin. Phoenix realized that the man was German filmmakerWerner Herzog. While Herzog helped Phoenix out of the wreckage by breaking the back window of the car, bystanders called an ambulance. Phoenix later approached Herzog to express his gratitude.[201][202]
In 2012, Phoenix labeled theAcademy Awards"bullshit". He later gave an interview apologizing for his comments, and acknowledged that the awards provided an important platform for many deserving filmmakers.[203]He elaborated on the topic while onJimmy Kimmel Live!in 2015, explaining that he was uncomfortable receiving accolades for his work, considering the filmmaking process a collaborative one.[204]
A longtime vegan, Phoenix findsanimal agriculture"absurd and barbaric". He explained his reasoning behind hisveganism: "To me, it just seems obvious—I don't want to cause pain to another living empathetic creature. I don't want to take its babies away from it, I don't want to force it to be indoors and fattened up just to be slaughtered. Certainly, also, the effect that it has on our environment is devastating. So, for me, it's my life and has always been my life, and it's really one of the most important things to me."[205]
Phoenix is on the board of directors forThe Lunchbox Fund, a non-profit organization which provides daily meals to students of township schools inSoweto, South Africa, founded by Page-Green.[206]
From 1995 to 1998, Phoenix dated hisInventing the Abbottsco-starLiv Tyler. The two remain close friends, with Tyler considering Phoenix and his sisters as her family.[207]He was romantically involved with South African modelTopaz Page-Greenfrom 2001 to 2005.[208]From 2013 to 2015 he was in a relationship with artistAllie Teilz.[209]
In 2012, Phoenix metHerco-starRooney Mara. The two remained friends and began a romantic relationship four years later, during the making ofMary Magdalene.[8][210]They were engaged to be married in 2019, but the ceremony never took place.[211]In August 2020, the couple had a son.[212]In June 2024, they welcomed their second child.[213]They reside in theHollywood Hills. Phoenix has described his family life as simple. He enjoys meditating, watching documentaries, reading scripts, and taking karate classes. He has ablack beltin karate.[150][214]In September 2024, Joaquin Phoenix formalized his marriage with Rooney during Talk Easy podcast.[215]

As Jolly, a part inspired by Mr. Mamet's real-life sister and his realized female character, Ms. LuPone finds conflicting layers of past and present selves in practically every line. She emerges as both loving matriarch and wounded adolescent, sentimental and devastatingly clear-eyed."[26]In 1978, she appeared in the Broadway musical adaptation ofStuds Terkel'sWorking, which ran for only 24 performances.[27]

And I had no support from the producers, who wanted a star performance onstage but treated me as an unknown backstage. It was like Beirut, and I fought like a banshee."[30]Despite the trouble, LuPone won her firstTony Awardfor Best Actress in a Musical.[31]"Don't Cry For Me, Argentina", a song she performed for the show, became one of her signature songs throughout her career.[32]It was not until she had reprised the role in a production inSydneywhen she had finally enjoyed the part and felt comfortable singing the score.[33][34]LuPone and her co-star,Mandy Patinkin, remained close friends both on and off the stage.

Nowadays Ms. LuPone generates more raw excitement than any other performer on the Broadway and cabaret axis, with the possible exception ofLiza Minnelli.... And her brilliant show, conceived and directed by her long-time collaborator, Scott Wittman, deserves many lives, perhaps even a Broadway run in an expanded edition. It certifies Ms. LuPone's place in the lineage of quirky internationalchanteuseslikeLotte Lenya,Marlene DietrichandEdith Piaf, who, like Ms. LuPone, conquered show business with forceful, outsize personalities while playing by their own musical rules.[122]
She also appeared as the inaugural act at the Sharon L. Morse Entertainment Center inThe Villages, Florida, on April 30, 2015, to a sold-out audience of residents mainly 55 years-of-age and older.[123]
LuPone is widely regarded as one of the greatest Broadway performers of her generation,[29][124][125][126]and one of the most influential actors in musical theater.[127]The London Timesonce nicknamed her the "first lady of the theater",[29]and American-British journalistHadley Freemandeclared her "the queen of Broadway" and "the goddess of the modern musical".[128]In 2010, theatre criticCharles McNultywrote that her stage presence demonstrates a ferocity that, when paired with the right material, resembles "a return to agolden agewhen powerhouses ruled Broadway".[124]AllMusicbiographer William Ruhlmann noted that, unlike her predecessorsMary MartinandEthel Merman, LuPone was never afforded the luxury to seamlessly transition between musical productions, instead using lulls in her Broadway career to diversify her endeavors by appearing in plays, films, television, nightclubs, concert tours, and recording solo studio albums.[125]According to Susan Vaughn of theLos Angeles Times, LuPone is mostly known for playing "larger-than-life characters" on stage,[29]whereas Adam Sandel ofThe Advocateobserved "she's often played women who've fought like hell to overcome obstacles through the sheer force of indomitable will".[129]She has also played many Jewish women, both on stage and screen, despite not identifying as Jewish herself.[13][130][131]LuPone believes she is often cast in ethnic parts because of her Italian heritage andprominent facial features, which allow her to play more interesting female roles.[130]At the same time, she has expressed frustration at frequently being overlooked for roles she believes she is best suited for, often in favor of less qualified actors,[126]and insists she has been bullied by Broadway professionals for much of her career.[132]
Music and theatre critics have described LuPone as amezzo-soprano,[133][134][135]whichThe Seattle Timessaid can equally "blast a big showtune out of the park, or sweetly murmur a lullaby".[136]Vocally, she is known for her powerful, emotive style of belting,[128]and according to Nerelle Harper ofQNewsset a new standard "for a modern generation of high-belt thrill trillers".[137]To cope with some vocally demanding roles such asEvita, during which she lost her voice several times, she remained silent when not performing and limited social activities.[138]After undergoing surgery to treatvocal nodulesduring the 1990s,[139]she learned how to sing in a moreoperaticmanner to preserve her voice, prior to which she admitted to relying on "sheer guts and willpower" to belt.[29]She credits vocal coachJoan Laderwith saving her career and teaching her "a technique to allow me to continue to sing with the strength and the clarity".[139]LuPone has performed some operatic roles, despite having no formal operatic training.[140]She has performed in severalSondheim musicals, and credits the composer with making her a better singer due to the difficulty of his material.[141]In return, Sondheim has praised her singing, acting, and attention to detail, and thanked her for "enhancing my shows — and everyone else's for that matter".[55]According to Andrew Gans ofPlaybill, LuPone belongs to a handful of singing actors who "are masters of stillness, bringing songs to full life with an inner well of emotions that seep out in unexpected and heartbreaking moments".[142]However, her trademarkdictionhas been criticized for sounding unclear,[143][144][145][146]including by collaboratorsAndrew Lloyd WebberandJohn Houseman, the latter of whom reportedly strangled her over her enunciation.[132]LuPone admitted that her emotional acting choices can compromise her diction.[132]In addition to Sondheim, LuPone has identified performersEdith Piaf,Bette Davis, andDavid Mametas influences,[147]and expressed admiration for stage actressesAngela Lansbury,Zoe Caldwell, andElaine Stritch, all of whose signature roles she would eventually play herself.[13]
The media has described LuPone as a polarizing entertainer,[124]equally praised and criticized for her talent and unfiltered opinions.[147][148]McNulty observed that critics have alternated betweenpigeonholingher into specific genres or underappreciating her vibrancy.[124]She has been labeled adivafor much of her career,[128][149]which journalists attribute to both her talent and high standards,[128][137]and perceived demanding temperament on and off-stage.[138][132]Ruhlmann said her reported "cold, dark" persona allowed her to excel playing "the kinds ofanti-heroineswho peopled the musicals of the later decades of the 20th century".[125]LuPone has been described by some as difficult to work with,[124][138]a reputation she attributes to sexism and the way assertive women are often perceived in the industry.[55]Theatre criticBen Brantleyreported that the fallout fromSunset Boulevarddamaged LuPone's public image and relegated her Broadway appearances to one-woman and non-musical shows, until she returned to musical theater in the early 2000s.[150]Meanwhile, herEvitaco-starMandy Patinkindefended her as a sensitive performer who "can't let certain feelings go, which is a burden and a blessing. She fights through it all and gives everything, until there's nothing left in her".[55]Herfanbasehas been nicknamed "LuPonistas",[29][151][152]and she has often been hired to play exaggerated versions of herself in television and film, representing "the symbol of Broadway musical theater", according toTime Out's Adam Feldman.[126]
LuPone is known for her candid and outspoken nature,[129]a trait she attributes to her upbringing.[13]She has stated that her forthrightness has occasionally led to professional setbacks, beginning with her time promotingEvita.[13]Her unfiltered remarks and actions have often made headlines, including instances ofgoing off-scriptduring performances.[127]A vocal critic of the commercialization of Broadway, LuPone has likened its current state to Las Vegas,[13][132][126][153]arguing that shows should have limited runs to allow space for fresh, innovative productions.[13]She has also expressed a disdain for red carpet events, noting that her tendency to "speak [her] truth" can be at odds with the expected decorum of such occasions.[128]Additionally, LuPone has been outspoken about theater etiquette, frequently voicing concerns over disruptive behavior by some audience members.[154]She is widely regarded as agay icon,[155]which LuPone attributes to fans recognizing that she has "had to fight, like the LGBTQ community has had to fight for identity. For a simple way to live. For acceptance".[156]
LuPone is married to Matthew Johnston. The couple's wedding ceremony was on the stage of theVivian Beaumont Theaterat Lincoln Center on December 12, 1988, after filming the TV movieLBJ; Johnston was a cameraman.[157]They have one child.[50]They reside inEdisto Beach, South Carolina,[158]andKent, Connecticut.[159]In the 1970s, LuPone dated actorKevin Klinefor seven years, after the two met as students atJuilliard.[160]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
