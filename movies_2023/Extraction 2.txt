After barely surviving a previous mission inDhaka, Tyler Rake retires frommercenarywork to a cabin inAustriato recuperate. Tyler is later approached by a stranger and asked to rescue Tyler's ex-wife Mia's sister Ketevan and her two children Sandro and Nina. Ketevan married Davit Radiani, one of the co-leaders of the largestcrime syndicate of Georgiacalled Nagazi, which Davit founded with his brother Zurab. After having killed aDEAagent, Davit was imprisoned and unable to bribe his way out due to the pressure from the Americans. Davit forces Ketevan and her children to move into the prison to keep them from leaving him, but the poor living conditions and Davit's abuse causes Ketevan to call Mia for help. Tyler recruits Nik and her brother Yaz to join him in the mission.
They infiltrate the prison with the help of a bribed guard, but the prisoners are alerted and a riot ensues. During the extraction, Davit attacks Tyler and Ketevan, resulting in Tyler killing Davit. Tyler and Ketevan fight through the riot and board anarmored train. After fighting off Nagazi forces and corrupt soldiers, they escape to Vienna through a plane, but Sandro, who idolizes his father and was influenced by the Nagazi'scult-like loyalty, secretly contacts Zurab and reveals their location. Zurab and his men find and attack Tyler and his team in theirDC Towerssafehouse in Vienna. Ketevan scolds Sandro for endangering his own family. In the chaos, Sandro abandons his mother and joins Zurab.
After killing most of Zurab's men, the team flees in one of his helicopters, but Zurab mortally wounds Yaz. The team retreats to Tyler's cabin, where he and Ketevan are reunited with Mia. Tyler apologizes to Mia for leaving on a mission before their son died from cancer, regretful that the last memory he had was Tyler leaving him. Zurab's right-hand man and uncle Avtandil discourages Zurab from seeking revenge to prevent more losses and to set a better example for Sandro. Refusing to accept defeat, Zurab kills Avtandil and contacts Tyler, telling him to meet at a nearby airfield next to a church. Tyler heads to the airfield, but leaves Nik behind in order to prevent risking her life. Tyler kills the remaining Nagazi and finds Zurab and Sandro in the church, with Sandro wearing anexplosive vest. Zurab forces Sandro to take Tyler's pistol, but Sandro refuses to shoot Tyler after realizing the kind of men Davit and Zurab really are.
Nik arrives and disarms the vest, while Tyler kills Zurab. Nik and Tyler are captured by the police and imprisoned. Mia visits Tyler and informs him that Ketevan and her children have been moved toprotective custody, but their assets have been frozen. Tyler tells her to give them $1 million cash, which is hidden under the floorboards in his cabin. Mia assures Tyler that their son died confident that his father was a hero.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
