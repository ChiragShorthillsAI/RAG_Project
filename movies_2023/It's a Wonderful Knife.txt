It's a Wonderful Knifeis a 2023 AmericanChristmasslashercomedy filmdirected by Tyler MacIntyre and written byMichael Kennedy. It starsJane Widdop,Jess McLeod,Joel McHale,Katharine Isabelle,William B. Davis, andJustin Long. It is a spin on the 1946 Christmas filmIt's a Wonderful Life; however, instead of the lead character recognizing his previous good deeds, the character Winnie discovers how many deaths she has prevented in her town.
The film was released byRLJE Filmson November 10, 2023, followed by its streaming release onShudderon December 1, 2023. It received mixed reviews from critics.
In the town of Angel Falls, while teenager Winnie Carruthers is celebrating the Christmas season with her family, her father David is called away by his business partner, Henry Waters, the CEO of Waters Industry. With David in tow, Henry attempts to persuade longtime local resident Roger Evans to sign off his house to be demolished to make room for a massive shopping mall, but Roger refuses, as he intends to pass the house on to his granddaughter, Cara, who is Winnie's best friend. Later, a masked assailant known as "The Angel" kills Roger in his home. At a party that night, The Angel murders Cara and nearly kills Winnie's brother Jimmy, but Winnie electrocutes the killer. She then unmasks The Angel, who turns out to be Henry.
One year later, David is now the CEO of Waters Industry. Winnie is still grieving Cara's death, while her family has moved on from the events of the previous year. She attends a Christmas party at her boyfriend Robbie's house, where she befriends a social outcast named Bernie, before discovering that Robbie has been cheating on her with her friend Darla for a year. Distraught, Winnie goes alone to a bridge and, looking up at theauroralights in the sky, wishes that she had never been born.
Suddenly, the aurora disappears, and the town's power briefly goes out before returning. After The Angel briefly chases Winnie, she learns that the town's sheriff is now Henry's younger brother Buck, who claims he does not recognize her. She is then greeted by Henry, who is now the town mayor. Winnie goes to see her family, who also do not recognize her, and she realizes she has been transported to an alternate reality in which she never existed, meaning that The Angel is still alive and has already killed several more people since the previous year, including Jimmy.
Upset, Winnie goes to Robbie's Christmas party and encounters Bernie, explaining her plight to her, despite her mild disbelief. After narrowly escaping The Angel, Bernie and Winnie deduce that The Angel has been targeting the teenage children of homeowners whose properties Henry wanted to acquire. Winnie decides she needs her father's help to stop Henry and kill him again, and successfully convinces her aunt Gale of her situation.
Winnie tries to convince her father that Henry killed Jimmy, but David refuses to listen to her and demands that she leave. On her way out, Winnie witnesses the killer murdering her mother. The Angel then tries to attack Winnie, Bernie, and Gale, but is knocked out. Winnie unmasks the killer, shocked to find David behind the mask. David regains consciousness and the trio flees. Winnie, Bernie, and Gale kill David after luring him to the movie theater where Bernie works.
As Winnie and Bernie return to the bridge under the aurora lights, Bernie reveals that she was contemplating suicide and that Winnie saved her. Winnie wishes that she was born after all, but nothing happens. She realizes that Henry still poses a danger to the town as mayor, and that he needs to die again before Winnie can return to her original timeline. Winnie and Bernie come across a rally being hosted by Henry where all the attendees appear to be in a trance. The two confront him and accuse him of the deaths of the past year. Henry confirms that he killed Jimmy, and in doing so broke David's spirit and placed him under his control, making him his accomplice. When Henry attacks Winnie, Bernie stabs him to death, breaking his control over the townspeople. As the aurora reappears, Winnie and Bernie kiss.
Winnie wakes up in her bedroom on Christmas morning. She cheerfully greets her family, and her parents apologize for not allowing her to process her trauma. Winnie then rushes over to Bernie's house, but Bernie reveals she still has her memories of their time together in the alternate reality, and they hug before agreeing to celebrate Christmas together.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 55% of 80 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "It's a Wonderful Knifetakes an enthusiastic stab at holiday-themed horror-comedy, even if it doesn't cut quite as deep as it should."[9]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 52 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[10]
Chicago Sun-Times'sRichard Roepergave the film a score of two and half out of four, writing "As you'd expect,It's a Wonderful Knifeis filled with blood-spattered twists on holiday movie tropes. Unfortunately, there are few surprises and only a handful of genuine scares, and the film suffers from subpar lighting and occasionally clunky editing. It's aKnifein need of some sharpening".[11]J. Kim Murphy ofVarietywrote "MacIntyre's direction is unfussy enough forIt's a Wonderful Knifeto recover from such awkward moments. But the frequent stabs at horror are just as easily forgotten. The genre slant promised by the title seems to be less of a tonal responsibility than an excuse to abruptly break out into the occasional suspense set piece". He ended his review with "The film is defined by an overruling superfluousness — it's the sort of thing people might be satisfied with watching from the corner of their eyes while wrapping presents".[12]
Meagan Navarro ofBloody Disgustingscored the film three out of five and said "MacIntyre's latest may not quite seamlessly nail its high concept genre mashup, but with some outstanding performances and a sweet gooey emotional center, it effectively tugs at your heartstrings and captures the spirit of Christmas".[13]Robert Daniels writing forRogerEbert.comgave a score of three and half out of four, "It's A Wonderful Knifehas plenty of attributes—charm, blood, and angst—that should fit right in at any family holiday gathering".[14]

She first found fame with the role ofGinger Fitzgeraldin the filmGinger Snaps, directed byJohn Fawcett; actressEmily Perkinsbecame her co-star in the film asBrigitte Fitzgerald. Casting took place in Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Isabelle auditioned on the same day as Perkins at their agency in Vancouver, reading to one another off-camera. Screenwriter Karen Walton said that they were exactly as she had pictured the characters when their taped auditions had arrived.[10]The film tells how during the filming of an amateur horror film, the two sisters find themselves being hunted by a monster.  One of the sisters is bitten, but her wounds heal incredibly fast leaving the sisters suspicious of what it is that's hunting them.[11][12]
What Culturesaid:
Obsessed with death and morbidity, and afraid of adulthood, Ginger Fitzgerald, portrayed by Katharine Isabelle of American Mary fame, only gets worse when she's bitten by alycanthropeand the transformation into a wolf begins. She gradually becomes aggressive and over-sexualised, loses her relationship with her sister, grows pointy teeth and sprouts hair in really weird places. She even grows a tail that she actually attempts to cut off. It takes a big set of cojones to try to cut off any body part. Ultimately though, the film is interesting because it examines the dichotomy between Ginger's humanity and her animalistic side.[13]
Jessica Roakes ofThe Toastalso mentions the metaphorical nature of the character saying "Ginger’s body has betrayed her bymenstruating. This is a key tenet of the body-horror genre — the monstrous comes not just from the outside, but from within the human body, from infection or perversion or unwanted biological functions. In Ginger’s case, it is her metamorphosis from girl to woman that renders her monstrous."[14]
The actress also portrayed the character in the sequelGinger Snaps 2: Unleashed(2004) and the prequelGinger Snaps Back: The Beginning.[15]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
