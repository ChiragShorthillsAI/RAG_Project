Ferrariis a 2023 Americanbiographicalsports dramafilm directed byMichael Mannand written byTroy Kennedy Martin. Based on the 1991 biographyEnzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races, the Machineby motorsport journalistBrock Yates, the film follows the personal and professional struggles ofEnzo Ferrari, the Italian founder of the car manufacturerFerrari, during the summer of 1957 asScuderia Ferrariprepares to compete in the1957 Mille Miglia.Adam Driverportrays the titular subject, andPenélope Cruz,Shailene Woodley,Sarah Gadon,Gabriel Leone,Jack O'Connell, andPatrick Dempseyco-star.
Ferrariwas selected to compete for theGolden Lionat the80th Venice International Film Festival, premiering on August 31, 2023. The film was originally set to premiere on the streaming serviceShowtime,[8]but it was eventually released in the United States theatrically on December 25, 2023, byNeon.  The film received generally positive reviews from critics and was named one of the top 10 films of 2023 by theNational Board of Review.[9]The film enjoyed moderate box office success in the United States but did not perform well in other countries,[10]grossing only $43 million worldwide against a $95 million budget.
In the summer of 1957, Italian entrepreneurEnzo Ferrariprepares hisracing teamfor theMille Miglia, an open-road, endurance-based race lasting 1,000 miles. Grappling with both domestic and professional crises, Enzo and his estranged wife, Laura, grieve for their only son,Dino, who died a year prior. While he has kept Laura from learning of his infidelities, Enzo's mistress, Lina Lardi, pressures him to grant their illegitimate son,Piero, the Ferrari name as hisconfirmationnears.
Meanwhile, Ferrari's manufacturing company is in terrible financial shape after the groundbreaking development of the team'sFormula Onecar. It needs to make a deal quickly with one of its competitors to survive. However, Laura owns half of the company's shares, and Enzo needs full control to seal a deal. In exchange forpower of attorneyover her shares, a resentful Laura demands a check forUS$500,000, which will bankrupt the company if she cashes it. Laura confirms her suspicions that Enzo has been having an affair after discovering that Lina and Piero live in the countryside outsideModena. Enzo agrees to write the check and trusts Laura to wait to cash it.
As the Mille Miglia commences inBrescia, Enzo encourages his drivers to remain ahead of the competing drivers. During a pit stop inRome, Enzo's newest addition to the team,Alfonso de Portago, refuses to change tires to stay in the lead.  AtGuidizzolo, his car's worn left front tire is sliced open by a damagedcat's eye. The ensuing blowout causes de Portago's car to flip over and fly out of control, killing de Portago, his navigator, and nine onlookers, including children.
Another of Ferrari's drivers, the veteranPiero Taruffi, completes the round trip to Brescia and wins the race. The news media blames Enzo for de Portago's lethal accident. Laura cashes her check and pushes the company to the brink of insolvency, but gives Enzo the cash to use as bribe money for journalists to salvage his reputation. Laura also gives Enzo her signed power of attorney, thereby giving him the chance to save his company, but requests that in return, Enzo refrain from giving Piero the Ferrari name until after her death. Enzo agrees and later brings Piero to his half-brother's grave.
Michael Mannfirst began exploring making the film around 2000, having discussed the project withSydney Pollack. Mann had been developing the script with writerTroy Kennedy Martin, who died in 2009.[14][a]Mann was offered $40 million to make the film, but he refused because he thought that the budget was not enough.[16]
In August 2015,Christian Baleentered negotiations to star as Ferrari. Filming was planned to begin in summer 2016 in Italy. In October 2015,Paramount Picturesbought the worldwide distribution rights for the film.[17][18]Bale exited the film in January 2016 over concerns of meeting the weight requirements for the role before the start of production.[19]The project stalled until April 2017, whenHugh Jackmanentered negotiations to portray Ferrari, andNoomi Rapaceas his wife with Paramount no longer involved.[20]The project would again go dormant until June 2020. Mann and Jackman were still attached but Rapace was no longer involved, withSTX Entertainmenthandling international distribution.[21]
By February 2022 Jackman had left the film, withAdam Drivernow starring as Ferrari.Penélope CruzandShailene Woodleyalso joined the cast.[8][22]Driver was cast due to his performances inLogan LuckyandMarriage Story.[23]Mann, Driver and Cruz reduced their salaries for the film.[24]
STX Entertainment agreed to finance 70% of the budget and also acquire the North American distribution rights.[22][8]The rest of the financing came from the Italian tax credit and private investors.[24]In July,Gabriel Leone,Sarah Gadon,Jack O'ConnellandPatrick Dempseywere added to the cast.[25][26]Pre-production began in April 2022, with filming originally set to commence in July inModena.[27][28][25][29][30][31]
Principal photographybegan on August 17, 2022, inModena.[32][33][34]Filming occurred also inBresciain early October.[35]Production of the film wrapped in late October 2022.[36][37]
The worn cat's eye which the film depicts as causing de Portago's fatal crash was not added in post-production.  It was an actual physical prop made out of a rubber-like thermoplastic through a3D printingprocess byCRP Technologies.[38]Other props like the archaicracing helmetswere also created through the same process.[38]
The film's score is composed byDaniel Pemberton.Milan Recordsreleased the soundtrack on December 25, 2023.

OnlyNeonagreed to release the film in the United States theatrically, and Neon paid $15 million to acquire the United States distribution rights.[40]Neon spent $17 million on marketing, expecting the film to make $17.5 million in North America.[40]
Sky CinemaandBlack Bear Picturesreleased the film in the United Kingdom theatrically on December 26, 2023.[4][41]STX retained other international rights.[42]
Ferrariwas released on digital platforms in the United States on January 23, 2024, and on Blu-ray and DVD on March 12, 2024.[43]The film was released in France throughAmazon Prime Video.[44]
Ferrarigrossed $18.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $24.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $43.3 million.[6][7]
In the United States and Canada,Ferrariwas released alongsideThe Boys in the BoatandThe Color Purple, and was projected to gross around $1 million from 2,330 theaters on its first day.[45]It ended up slightly exceeding expectations, grossing $2.9 million and finishing in 14th.[8]The following weekend the film made $4.1 million, finishing in ninth at the box office and totaling $10.9 million over its first week of release.[46]In the film's second weekend it made $2.5 million, remaining in ninth.[47]Neon stated the film exceeded their expectations of $17.5 million gross at the domestic box office, and labeled the film a success.[48]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 73% of 258 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "Sleek and well-acted,Ferrariovercomes its occasionally underpowered narrative to deliver a rousing and admirably complex biopic."[49]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[50]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakreported 74% filmgoers gave it a positive score.[8]
Marlow Stern ofRolling Stonepraised Penélope Cruz's performance, writing: "There is an unstoppable force at the center of Michael Mann'sFerrari. It is fast, fierce, and wildly unpredictable. One moment it has you in the throes of ecstasy; the next, fearing for your life. And when you see it coming around the bend, it's curtains. Don't even bother putting up a fight. You'll lose. I'm talking, of course, about Penélope Cruz."[51]
Damon Wise ofDeadline Hollywoodwas more critical of Adam Driver's performance, stating: "Given what's at stake [in the film], a strangely unemotional lead performance from Adam Driver makes it hard to warm to this odd and deeply self-absorbed character. Add in the glacial pace of its narrative, and a film expected to take an early awards-season lead will struggle to hold that pole position."[52]
Italian actorPierfrancesco Favinocriticized the film for casting American actors to portray Italian characters, instead of Italian actors.[53]The Italian newspaperLa Stampafound that it was a beautiful film but regretted that it only covered a limited part of Ferrari's life,[54]whilePiero Ferrariclaimed various elements in the film that did not accurately reflect the facts.[55]
Among mixed reviews, Kevin Nguyen ofThe Verge, wrote that he wanted "to creditFerrarifor being a weirder movie than you might expect for a biopic about a guy who builds iconic sports cars. But every swerve feels imprecise, and each detour just takes the film further in an unclear direction."[56]

NEON Rated, LLC,doing business asNeon(stylized inall caps), is an Americanindependent filmproductionanddistributioncompany founded in 2017 by CEO Tom Quinn andTim League, who also was the co-founder of theAlamo Drafthouse Cinemachain.[1]As of 2019, League is no longer involved with daily operations for the company.[6]
Its first film,Colossal, was released in 2017.[7]The company became known for distributing such notable films asI, Tonya(2017),Parasite(2019),Portrait of a Lady on Fire(2019),Palm Springs(2020),Flee(2021),Spencer(2021),The Worst Person in the World(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023),Anora(2024),Longlegs(2024),The Seed of the Sacred Fig(2024), andThe Monkey(2025).[8][9]
Parasitewent on to become Neon's highest-grossing film at the worldwidebox officewith $262 million and the first non-English-language film to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture.[10]In 2024,Longlegshad a domestic box office gross of $58.6 million, becoming the distributor's highest-grossing film ever in North America.[11]Anorabecame the company's second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[12]Neon has also worked with several high-profile filmmakers, which includesSean Baker,[13]Bong Joon Ho,Julia Ducournau,Craig Gillespie,Pablo Larraín, andCéline Sciamma.[14]
During the 4th Annual Zurich Summit, Tom Quinn commented on Neon's intent to release titles that appeal to audiences who "skew under 45, that have no aversion to violence, no aversion to foreign language and to non-fiction".[15]Explaining the success of the company in 2024, Quinn stated: "We were very much a startup, with everyone functioning as this sophisticated amoeba. We very quickly found ourselves that year inTorontowith a great slate [...] That work enabled us to sit at the table in Toronto that year and buyI, Tonya. Before the ink was even dry on the deal, we were planning itsOscar campaign. It's a testament to how quickly we can make decisions because we're not this big studio. We've always used that to our advantage."[16]
In September 2017, the company partnered withBlumhouse Productionsto manage BH Tilt.[17]In 2018, a majority stake of Neon was sold to30West, the media venture arm of "The Friedkin Group".[4][18]In February 2021,Bleecker Streetpartnered with Neon to launch the joint home entertainment distribution companyDecal, which is a standalone full-service operation that handlesdistribution dealson the home entertainment rights to both Neon and Bleecker Street's features. The first film to be distributed through Decal was the Bleecker Street releaseSupernovain winter 2021.[5]Additionally, Decal acquired North American distribution rights to the South Africanhorror filmGaiafor a summertheatrical release, marking their first ever acquisition.[19]
Andrew Brown (Co-President of Decal) oversaw the launch of Neon's home entertainment division. In 2022, Brown was promoted to "President of Digital Distribution". The exec, who has served as "SVP of Digital Strategy, Marketing, and Distribution" for Neon since 2017, also manages Neon's library, and oversees the annualFYC DVD Box Setanddirect-to-consumerdigital portal "Neon Cinema".[20]Prior to the joint-venture,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, as well asThe Criterion CollectionandWell Go USA Entertainment(for the filmPossessorwhich Neon and Well Go co-distributed), distributed several Neon films onhome video.[21][22][23]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, Neon was approved to continue promotional activities for its films since the company does not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP) nor had encountered any issue in receivingSAG-AFTRAinterim agreements.[24][25][26]
In August 2023, Neon hired formerA24employees Alexandra Altschuler as "VP Media" and Don Wilcox as "VP Marketing".[27]That same month, Neon hired former Sierra/Affinity employee Kristen Figeroid as "President of International Sales and Distribution", Laurel Charnetsky as "VP International Acquisitions & Operations", and Dan Stadnicki as "Manager, International Sales & Distribution".[28]In May 2024, Neon hired Joey Monteiro as "EVP, International Marketing" and Ashley Hirsch as "Manager of International Sales and Marketing".[29]That same month, Neon promoted Elissa Federoff from "President of Distribution" to "Chief Distribution Officer" and Ryan Friscia from "EVP, Finance and Business Development" to "Chief Financial Officer".[30]Furthermore, Jeff Deutchman, who joined Neon when it was launched, serves as "President of Acquisitions and Production".[31]
Additionally, Neon has acquired the distribution rights to fivePalme d'Orwinners at theCannes Film Festival:Parasite(2019),Titane(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023), andAnora(2024); all five won consecutively.[31][32][33]The company's strategy to acquire such titles at Cannes is to eschew "the lazy approach", said Deutchman. "The only real way to do Cannes is to go see as many movies as you can, because you never know where the nextDogtoothorBorderorHungerorForce Majeureis going to come from", he added, citing several modern Cannes standouts championed by arthouse buyers.[31]After acquiringParasitein 2018, Neon financed and distributed the film the following year in U.S. territories.[34]"From the very beginning, Tom Quinn sawParasiteas a universal film and refused to put it in a box as a foreign-language or international film", saidParasitedirectorBong Joon Ho. "He saw the heart of the film and understood that it was about all of us living in our modern class-based society. I was always grateful for that."[16]Neon spent $20 million promoting, distributing, and campaigning for the film's awards.[3]The film subsequently became Neon's highest-grossing film with more than $200 million at the worldwidebox officeand won fourAcademy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Director. Similarly, Neon spent $18 million promotingAnora, three times the film's original budget.[3]Anoraultimately won the two aforementioned Academy Awards whileAnatomy of a FallandTriangle of Sadnesswere nominated for the same two categories, among others. As of March 2025, Neon has garnered 39 Academy Award nominations, winning 11 overall.[10][12][35]
In 2023, Quinn commented on the company's success at Cannes, saying: "We've seen over the years that each of these films, because of their credibility and success, the Palme d'Or has come to mean something quite impactful for a very young group ofcinephiles. And the reason why we know this is we've tested all these movies and dating back toParasite, probably I think, the fifth reason why people came to see the film, in itstest screeninginSherman Oaks, was the fact that it won the Palme d'Or, and each subsequent year that went up. And this year, the number one reason why people came to see the film [Anatomy of a Fall], at a test screening inBurbank, was the fact that it had won the Palme d'Or."[36]In 2024, Quinn stated: "The award means a lot. To audiences here who are looking for the absolute most adventurous, forward-looking cinema available, that award represents it because these films have delivered, and they've been major Oscar contenders."[16]
In July 2024, Neon received its biggest opening weekend at the box office with the horror thriller filmLonglegs, after scoring $22.6 million from 2,510 theaters (a figure that includes $2.5–3 million in Thursday previews) and only behindUniversal/Illumination's second weekend ofDespicable Me 4. Initially projected to gross $7–9 million, the opening marked the biggest total for an original horror film of 2024, one of the top 20 weekends for an independent film and the best opening ever for an independent horror film.[37][38][39]To promote the film, Neon utilizedguerrilla marketingtactics similar to those that led to the box office success ofThe Blair Witch Project(1999).[40]DirectorOz Perkinscredited Neon for the film's marketing, stating the studio "really responded strongly to the movie, the raw materials of the movie really excited them, the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it sounds. They asked me early on, 'Do we have your permission to kind of go nuts?' And I said, 'What else are we doing here? Go for it. Do your thing.'"[41]The film's total marketing budget was under $10 million, focusing ondigital contentand not havingtelevision ads.[37]During its third weekend,Longlegsbecame the company's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office, earning $58.6 million, surpassing whatParasiteearned with $53.3 million in 2020.[11]Furthermore, it became the top grossing R-rated horror film of 2024 and the highest-grossing indie horror film of the last decade, topping A24'sTalk to Me(2022),Insidious: Chapter 3(2015) fromFocus Features, and A24'sHereditary(2018).[11]Afterward, furthering their marketing campaign, from August 1 to 4, Neon (partnering withAtom Tickets) offered free tickets to anyone who has a birthday that falls on the 14th of any given month. To get the tickets, those who registered and purchased tickets through Atom Tickets received a special promo code after verifying their date of birth and were able to get one free ticket per customer, while supplies lasted.[42]

In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014 (the "S" standing for Simonds, the company's founder; the "T" standing forTPG Growth, whose managing partner McGlashan helped launch the company; and the "X" standing for "secret project"),[2]with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[3][4]Investors in the company includedHony Capital,Tencent,PCCW, TPG Growth,RTL GroupandLiberty Global.

He was executive producer on the popular TV seriesMiami Vice(1984–90), which he adapted into a2006 feature film.
Mann was born February 5, 1943,[2]in Chicago, Illinois.[3]He is Jewish and the son of Esther and Jack Mann.[4][5]His grandfather left theRussian Empirein 1912, and brought his wife and Mann's father over in 1922.[6]
Mann graduated fromAmundsen High School, also the alma mater ofBob Fosse.[7][8]He then studiedEnglish literatureat theUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison.[9]While a student, he sawStanley Kubrick'sDr. Strangeloveand fell in love with movies. In anLA Weeklyinterview, he described the film's impact on him:
It said to my whole generation of filmmakers that you could make an individual statement of high integrity and have that film be successfully seen by a mass audience all at the same time. In other words, you didn't have to be makingSeven Brides for Seven Brothersif you wanted to work in the mainstream film industry, or be reduced to niche filmmaking if you wanted to be serious about cinema. So that's what Kubrick meant, aside from the fact thatStrangelovewas a revelation.[10]
Mann graduated from theUniversity of Wisconsinwith a BA in 1965. In 1967 he earned an MA from theLondon Film School.
Mann later moved to London in the mid-1960s to go to graduate school in cinema. He went on to receive agraduate degreeat theLondon Film Schoolin 1967. He spent seven years in the United Kingdom going to film school and then working on commercials along with contemporariesAlan Parker,Ridley ScottandAdrian Lyne. In 1968, footage he shot of theParis student revoltfor a documentary,Insurrection, aired onNBC'sFirst Tuesdaynews program and he developed his '68 experiences into the short filmJaunpuriwhich won the Jury Prize atCannesin1970.
Mann returned to the United States after divorcing his first wife in 1971. He went on to direct a road trip documentary,17 Days Down the Line. Three years later,Hawaii Five-OveteranRobert Lewingave Mann a shot and a crash course on television writing and story structure. Mann wrote four episodes ofStarsky and Hutch(three in the first season and one in the second) and the pilot episode forVega$. Around this time, he worked on a show calledPolice Storywith cop-turned-novelistJoseph Wambaugh.Police Storyconcentrated on the detailed realism of a real cop's life and taught Mann that first-hand research was essential to bring authenticity to his work. Mann also wrote an early draft of the 1978 filmStraight Time.[11]
His first feature movie was a television special calledThe Jericho Mile, which was released theatrically in Europe. It won the Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Limited Series or a Special in 1979 and the DGA Best Director award.
His television work also includes being the executive producer onMiami ViceandCrime Story. Contrary to popular belief, he was not the creator of these shows, but the executive producer andshowrunner, produced by his production company.[12][13][14][15]
Mann's debut feature in cinema as director wasThief(1981) starringJames Caan, a relatively accurate depiction of thieves that operated in New York City and Chicago at that time. Mann used actual former professional burglars to keep the technical scenes as genuine as possible. His next film wasThe Keep(1983), a supernatural thriller set inNazi-occupiedRomania. Though it was a commercial flop, the film has since attained cult status amongst fans.[16]In 1986, Mann was the first to bringThomas Harris' character of serial killerHannibal Lecterto the screen withManhunter, his adaptation of the novelRed Dragon, which starredBrian Coxas Hannibal. In an interview on theManhunterDVD, starWilliam Petersencomments that because Mann is so focused on his creations, it takes several years for him to complete a film; Petersen believes that this is why Mann does not make films very often.[17]

This was followed by crime dramaHeat(1995) starringAl Pacino,Robert De Niro, andVal Kilmer. The film, a remake of his TV movieL.A. Takedown, was a critical success withKenneth Turanof theLos Angeles Timescalling the film a "sleek, accomplished piece of work, meticulously controlled and completely involving. The dark end of the street doesn't get much more inviting than this."[20]Todd McCarthyofVarietywrote, "Stunningly made and incisively acted by a large and terrific cast, Michael Mann's ambitious study of the relativity of good and evil stands apart from other films of its type by virtue of its extraordinarily rich characterizations and its thoughtful, deeply melancholy take on modern life."[21]
In 1999, Mann filmedThe Insiderabout the60 Minutessegment aboutJeffrey Wigand, a whistleblower in thetobacco industry.Russell Croweportrayed Wigand, withAl PacinoplayingLowell Bergman, andChristopher PlummerasMike Wallace.

CriticRoger Ebertof theChicago Sun-Timespraised the film writing, "The Insiderhad a greater impact on me thanAll the President's Men, because you know what? Watergate didn't kill my parents. Cigarettes did."[22]
With his next film,Ali(2001), starringWill Smith, Mann started experimenting with digital cameras. For his action thriller filmCollateral, which castTom Cruiseagainst type by giving him the role of a hitman, Mann shot all of the exterior scenes digitally so that he could achieve more depth and detail during the night scenes while shooting most of the interiors on film stock.Jamie Foxxwas nominated for anAcademy Awardfor his performance inCollateral.

Mann directed the 2002 "Lucky Star" advertisement forMercedes-Benz, which took the form of a film trailer for a purported thriller featuringBenicio del Toro. In the fall of 2007, Mann directed two commercials forNike. The ad campaign "Leave Nothing" features football action scenes with formerNFLplayersShawne MerrimanandSteven Jackson, as well as using the score "Promontory" from the soundtrack ofThe Last of the Mohicans.[23]Mann directed the 2008 promotional video forFerrari'sCaliforniasports car.[24]
Mann was producer withPeter Bergas director forThe KingdomandHancock.HancockstarsWill Smithas a hard-drinking superhero who has fallen out of favor with the public and who begins to have a relationship with the wife (Charlize Theron) of a public relations expert (Jason Bateman), who is helping him to repair his image.

The series was an hour-longHBOproduction, and Mann directed the series' pilot.[27]Although initially renewed for a second season after the airing of the pilot, it was eventually cancelled due to the death of three horses during production.
In February 2013, it was announced that Mann had been developing an untitledthriller filmwith screenwriter Morgan Davis Foehl for over a year, forLegendary Pictures.[28]In May 2013, Mann started filming the action thriller, namedBlackhat, in Los Angeles, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong andJakarta.[29]The film, starringChris Hemsworthas a hacker who gets released from prison to pursue a cyberterrorist across the globe, was released in January 2015 by Universal.[30]It received mixed reviews and was a commercial disaster, although several critics included it in their year-end "best-of" lists.[31]
Mann directed the first episode of the 2022 crime seriesTokyo ViceforHBO Max, his first directing work sinceBlackhat.[32]In August the same year, Mann releasedHeat 2,a novel he had co-written withMeg Gardiner. The book takes place from 1988 to 2000, covering events that happen before and after the 1995 film.[33][34]The same month, Mann began shootingFerraristarringAdam DriverandPenélope CruzinModena.[35][36]The film premiered at the80th Venice International Film Festivaland was released in the US in December 2023.[37][38]Ferrarireceived generally positive reviews from critics and attained moderate box office success in the United States,[39]while under-performing in overseas box office.[40]
Mann's trademarks include powerfully-lit nighttime scenes and unusual scores, such asTangerine DreaminThiefand thenew-agescore toManhunter.
Dante Spinottiis a frequent cinematographer of Mann's films.F. X. Feeneydescribes Mann's body of work inDGA Quarterlyas "abundantly energetic in its precision and variety" and "psychologically layered".[41]
IndieWire's 2014 retrospective of the director's filmography focused on the intensity of Mann's ongoing interest in "stories pitting criminals against those who seek to put them behind bars (Heat,Public Enemies,Thief,Collateral,Miami Vice). His films frequently suggest that in fact, at the top of their respective games, crooks and cops are not so dissimilar as men: they each live and die by their own codes and they each recognize themselves in the other."[42]
Mann's films have been noted for their realism when it comes to capturing the sounds of gunfire, with him preferring to use raw audio captured from the scene, rather than a sound mix. Many of his films feature practical effects to produce the action scenes, with actors attending boot camps for weapons handling and firing 'full load' blanks in scenes to accurately represent the sound of live ammunition.[43]
Mann's daughterAmi Canaan Mannis also a film director and producer.[44]
For his work, he has received nominations from international organizations and juries, including theBritish Academy of Film and Television Arts,Cannes, and theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. As a producer, Mann has twice received nominations for theAcademy Award for Best Picture, first forThe Insiderand thenThe Aviator(2004), which Mann had been hired to direct before the project was transferred toMartin Scorsese.
Total Filmranked Mann No. 28 on its 2007 list of the 100 Greatest Directors Ever,[45]andSight and Soundranked him No. 5 on their list of the 10 Best Directors of the Last 25 Years (for the years 1977–2002).[46]

Troy Kennedy Martin(15 February 1932 – 15 September 2009) was a Scottish-born film and television screenwriter. He created the long-runningBBC TVpolice seriesZ-Cars(1962–1978), and the award-winning 1985 anti-nuclear dramaEdge of Darkness. He also wrote the screenplay for the original version ofThe Italian Job(1969). His last film wasFerrari(2023), which was posthumously released.
He was born inRothesay,Isle of Bute, and educated atFinchley Catholic Grammar SchoolandTrinity College, Dublin. He had a younger brotherIan, who is also a television writer best known for creatingThe Sweeney.[1]
He began writing forBBC Televisionin 1958, beginning with the playIncident at Echo Six, and he wrote four further plays for the BBC over the following three years, before in 1961 creating his first series,Storyboard, a six-part anthology series that consisted both of original scripts and adaptations. The same year, he wrote the police dramaThe Interrogator. He wrote an important manifesto about new television drama in 1964, calling for a more mobile style of camera work and less emphasis on dialogue.[2][3]
In 1962, Martin co-created the drama seriesZ-Cars. Set in "Newtown", based onKirkbynear Liverpool,Z-Carswas revolutionary in that it depicted a hard-edged, grittier and much more realistic vision of the police force than had been seen on British television – as a result, it was initially very unpopular with the real police.[4]Although he left the programme after the first two series, the series ran until 1978, and he returned to write the final episode.[citation needed]
In 1965, Martin scripted a television adaptation ofFrederik Pohl's short storyThe Midas Plague, which was shown as an episode for the first series ofOut of the Unknown, a science-fiction anthology series shown onBBC2. One of the more light-hearted stories of the otherwise dark and dramatic show, it is one of only 20 (and a half) episodes of the original 48 known to have surviveddestruction, and is available on DVD.
Over the following decade he contributed to various television programmes, and made his first foray into feature films when he wroteThe Italian Job,[5]which was released in 1969 and starredNoël CowardandMichael Caine. The following year he wroteKelly's Heroes, and he scripted two more films during the 1970s –The Jerusalem File(1971) andSweeney 2(1978).
Sweeney 2was the second cinematic spin-off from the television seriesThe Sweeney, which had been created by his brotherIan Kennedy Martin, and for which he had written several episodes. He is less well known for writing a little-seen television sitcom based in the British Civil Service,If It Moves, File It(1970), featuring amongst othersJohn Bird, who later co-starred in the satiricalBremner, Bird and Fortune.[citation needed]
In the early 1980s he was no less successful, with two highly popular series on different networks in 1983.The Old Men at the Zoowas an adaptation of the novel byAngus Wilsonand screened onBBC One; the second was the hugely popularReilly, Ace of SpiesonITV, based on the book byRobin Bruce Lockhartand starringSam Neill.
Greatly influenced by the political landscape of the early 1980s, he had drafted a script for apolitical thriller-cum-science fictiondrama serial entitledMagnox, which becameEdge of Darkness.[6][7]He was interviewed about the genesis of the series forMagnox: The Secrets of Edge of Darknessdocumentary, an extra on the show's 2003 DVD release:
We had theCold War. TheFalklands. The Nuclear State. The prospect of a miners' strike.Greenham Common. It was Thatcher's Britain. At the BBC, there was no political dimension in their popular drama whatsoever. And I was really depressed about it, as indeed were other writers that I knew. And so, I said to my closest colleagues: 'The only thing one can do is actually write stuff that one knows is not going to get made, but at least we'll get it out of our system'. And that's how I started to writeEdge Of Darkness. I didn't really think that it stood much of a chance of being produced.
The concept attracted little interest from television executives until incomingBBCHead of Drama Series & SerialsJonathan Powellpicked it up in 1983, assigning experienced producerMichael Wearingto the project.Edge of Darknesswas eventually screened onBBC2in late 1985. Although Kennedy Martin had many creative differences with directorMartin Campbelland starBob Peck(who is reported to have vetoed the scripted ending with the remark "I'm not turning into a fucking tree!"), the drama was a resounding success, picking up several awards and being remembered as one of the best British television drama productions of the 1980s.[8]FollowingEdge of Darknesshe wrote another feature film screenplay,Red Heat(1988, co-written with director Walter Hill), which starredArnold SchwarzeneggerandJames Belushi.
Kennedy Martin did not return to television scriptwriting until the one-offBBC TwodramaHostile Watersin 1997. Other later work includedBravo Two ZeroforBBC Onein 1999, co-written withAndy McNaband starringSean Bean.
He died oflung canceron 15 September 2009 aged 77, inDitchling, East Sussex.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
