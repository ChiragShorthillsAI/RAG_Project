The film starsLiam Neeson,Noma Dumezweni,Lilly Aspell,Jack Champion,Embeth DavidtzandMatthew Modine.[6]It is the third remake of the 2015 Spanish filmEl desconocido, which follows a man (Neeson) who gets trapped in his car after receiving a threat that it will explode if he gets out.
Aninternational co-productionof France, Germany, Spain and the United States,Retributionwas released in France on August 23, 2023 byStudioCanal, and in the United States on August 25 byLionsgateandRoadside Attractions.
Matt Turner works as a financier at Nanite Capital under his friend and CEO Anders Muller and lives with his wife, Heather, and two children, Emily and Zach, inBerlin. While driving his kids to school, Matt receives a call from an unknown number with a distorted voice who says that there is a bomb under his seat, which was already armed when Matt sat on it. The bomb is triggered by both pressure plates placed on all the seats and a radio frequency. He also threatens to detonate the bomb if Matt tries to get help. Matt finds the device and is forced to follow the bomber’s instructions in order to keep them alive.
The bomber forces Matt to watch Sylvain, Matt’s client who is also receiving a bomb threat, being killed in an explosion when Sylvain’s panicked girlfriend attempts to escape. The bomber tells Matt to call Heather to retrieve €50,000 from his safety deposit box at the bank and deliver it to him. After Heather retrieves it, the bomber changes the plan by telling her to give the money to a man in a blue suit. When she does, the police arrive and arrest the man.
After seeing the news implicating Matt for the bombing,Europolagent Angela Brickmann calls him; Matt tries to convince her of his innocence and requests that cellular signals be jammed to prevent the remote trigger. The bomber reveals that Matt and Anders have a €208 millionslush fundfrom the clients deposited in Matt’s “emergency collateral account” in a bank inDubai. He arranges for Matt to meet Anders at a power plant. Arriving there, the bomber forces Matt to order Anders to liquidate his collateral account. Despite Anders reluctantly complying, the bomber orders Matt to kill Anders with a revolver in exchange for his life and his children. When Matt refuses, the bomber blows up Anders’s car; the shrapnel injures Emily’s leg.
After a police chase, Matt is eventually surrounded by them with Angela and Heather arriving at the scene. Once they realize that the pressure plate is only located under Matt's seat, the bomb squad safely removes Zach and Emily, who is treated for her injuries. Interrogating Matt, Angela suspects the bombing might be related to the heist. After talking to Heather for the last time, Matt drives away and evades the police, determined to find the bomber by himself. Matt demands the bomber to meet him in person if he wants the money.
The bomber is revealed to be Anders all along. Anders reveals that he wanted to make Matt the fall guy for the series of bombings to cover up his scheme of embezzling €208 million wired into his crypto account. To end this, Matt deliberately crashes his car, causing it to cling on the side of a bridge. Matt unlocks his seat belt and falls into the river, allowing the bomb to activate and kill Anders. Angela and the police arrive at the scene, with Angela nodding at Matt before allowing him to walk free.
During the credits, the news reports state that the bombings were part of the heist perpetrated by Anders, and Matt cooperates with Europol to resolve the incident.

Retributionhas grossed $6.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $11.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $18.7 million.[4][5]
In the United States and Canada,Retributionwas released alongsideGran Turismo,The Hill, andGolda, and was projected to gross $2–3 million from 1,750 theaters in its opening weekend.[23]The film made $1.3 million on its first day, and went on to debut to $3.3 million, finishing eighth.[3]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 28% of 92 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "Retributionmay prove mildly diverting for hardcore fans of films depicting Liam Neeson as a parent in peril, but in most respects, this thriller is strictly standard stuff."[24]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 43 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[25]Audiences surveyed byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "C" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled atPostTrakgave it a 54% overall positive score.[3]
In a mixed review forVulture,Bilge Ebiristated that "Neeson’s action movies often turn on his characters’ anxieties as a father and/or husband — sublimating his own tragic personal history into the realm of fictional motivation." and that, "Most ofRetributionconsists of three shots: a close-up of Matt, a close-up of his daughter, and a close-up of his son. But out of these simple building blocks and this nothing script, Antal extracts plenty of suspense and even emotion".[26]
Noel Murray, in theLos Angeles Times,found "The script is too flatly functional, weighed down by periodic info dumps where various people try to explain how Matt’s floundering business might connect to his current predicament.", adding that "Liam Neeson has done so many variations on the “angry dad” action hero that we can start dividing those movies into sub-genres." and that "WhileRetributionis far from Neeson’s best, it still mostly works, so long as you tune out the dialogue and focus on the hero’s twitchy face, waiting to see which will blow to smithereens first: his car or his patience".[27]

The subscription channel was co-founded byAndré Rousselet[2]andPierre Lescure.[3][4]This was to reduce Canal+'s dependence on the American major studios by building its own library that the pay-TV channel could use on their own channels and internationally.[2]
By December 1990, Canal+ Productions rebranded to Le Studio Canal+, and released its first film,The Double Life of Veronique, byKrzysztof Kieslowski.[4]By the early 1990s, it became apparent that Canal+ was a major contributor to theFrench film industry, with its obligation to spend 10% of its income on French-made films, as well as being Europe's largest buyer of American film rights.[2]Canal+ also made investments in other companies. In 1991 it bought a five percent stake in the independent American studioCarolco Pictures.[2]However, in 1992, Le Studio Canal+ suffered financial difficulties afterCarolco Picturesentered a corporate restructure.[citation needed]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
