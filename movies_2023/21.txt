During a parent-teacher conference, the pregnant fifth-grade teacher Mrs. Salinas announces her maternity leave. As the parents come to express their displeasure with the substitute teacher whom Principal Spahn[a]has selected to cover for Mrs. Salinas, Leo overhears one of them say that tuataras live to be 75 years old and despairs when he realizes he is 74 and has not accomplished his dreams of going tothe Everglades. The next day, the strict substitute Virginia Malkin[b]arrives and is quickly loathed by the students.
Leo is taken home for the weekend by Summer, an overly talkative girl. While trying to make his escape, Leo accidentally reveals to Summer that he can talk, and suggests to her that she ask more questions to improve her conversations with classmates. As a result, Summer becomes more popular. One by one, her fellow students Eli, Jayda, two boys both named Cole, Skyler, Logan, Mia, Kabir, TJ, Zane, and Anthony take Leo home each weekend, confiding in him with their own issues and concerns, to which he provides wisdom and support, improving each of their lives. However, Leo requests that each student keep his talking ability a secret from the others and doesn't tell any of them that the others know he can talk.
Jealous of the attention Leo is getting, Squirtle decides to expose him. Feeling betrayed, the class disregards Leo. Ms. Malkin takes Leo home when she discovers he talks and has been helping her students. Leo learns that she never accomplished her dream of being a real teacher, which is why she's always mean to the students, and he attempts to give her advice.
The next day, the students win the history fair with their historical figure reenactments, with their prize being a field trip to Magic Land Park. Wanting to take all the credit, Ms. Malkin abandons Leo at the Everglades. When the students want to apologize to Leo, Ms. Malkin reports that Leo left them.

Robert Smigel(born February 7, 1960)[1]is an American actor, comedian, writer, director, producer, andpuppeteer, known for hisSaturday Night Live"TV Funhouse" cartoon shorts and as the puppeteer and voice behindTriumph the Insult Comic Dog. He also co-wrote the first twoHotel Transylvaniafilms,You Don't Mess with the Zohan, andLeo, all starringAdam Sandler.
Robert Smigel was born in New York City, to Lucia andIrwin Smigel, an aesthetic dentist, innovator and philanthropist. He isJewishand frequently went toJewish summer camp.[2][3]He attendedCornell University, studying pre-dental,[4]and graduated fromNew York University'sCollege of Arts and Sciencein 1983 with a degree in political science.[5][6]
Smigel began developing his comedic talent atThe Players Workshopin Chicago, where he studied improvisation withJosephine Forsberg.Bob Odenkirkwas a fellow student there. Smigel was also a member of the Chicago comedy troupe "All You Can Eat" in the early 1980s.
Smigel first established himself as a writer onSaturday Night Liveby joining the writing staff whenLorne Michaelsreturned as executive producer for the1985–1986 season. Smigel was hired after then-SNLproducersAl Frankenand Tom Davis saw Smigel in a Chicago sketch show.[7]Smigel was among the few writers who survived a purge of writers and cast at the conclusion of the "disappointing" 1985–1986 season. This is when Smigel began to write more memorable sketches, including one where hostWilliam Shatnerurged worshipful attendees at aStar Trekconvention to "get a life." Smigel rarely appeared on screen, though he was credited as a featured player in the early 1990s and played a recurring character in theBill Swerski's Superfanssketches.
While on a writers' strike fromSaturday Night Livefollowing the1987–88 season, Smigel wrote for animprovisational comedyrevue in Chicago with fellowSNLwritersBob OdenkirkandConan O'BriencalledHappy Happy Good Show.[8]
Smigel co-wroteLookwellwithConan O'BrienforNBC. The pilot never went to series, but it has become a cult hit and has screened live at "The Other Network", a festival of un-aired TV pilots produced byUn-Cabaret, featuring live and taped intros by Smigel. Smigel later became the first head writer atLate Night with Conan O'Brien, where he created numerous successful comedy bits, including one where Smigel performed only the lips of public figures which were superimposed on photos of the actual people. (This technique was pioneered on theClutch Cargocartoon series as a cost-saving measure, and was known asSyncro-Vox.)
In 1996, Smigel wrote and performed on the short-livedDana Carvey Show, a primetimesketch comedyprogram onABC. Despite its premature end, the show provided Smigel the opportunity to debut his first cartoonThe Ambiguously Gay Duo.[9]Upon the show's cancellation, Smigel continued developing more cartoon ideas the following summer and would begin airing them onSaturday Night Liveunder theTV Funhousebanner. Smigel would later claim "My whole career came out of the impulse to do cartoons onThe Dana Carvey Show."[10]
Smigel's most famous creation, however, would be the foul-mouthed puppetTriumph the Insult Comic Dog, who mercilessly mocks celebrities and others in the style of aBorscht Beltcomedian. This character debuted onLate Night with Conan O'Brienin February 1997 and would continue to make appearances on the show, as well as others, for many years to come.
Smigel continued to establish himself onSaturday Night Liveby producing short animated segments under the titleTV Funhouse, which usuallysatirizespublic figures and popular culture. It spawned a TV show onComedy Centralfeaturing a mix of puppets, animation, and short sketches, although only eight episodes were aired (during the winter of 2000–2001). Smigel occasionally appears in films (usually alongsideSNLveterans such asAdam Sandler). According to interviews, Smigel helped punch up the scripts forLittle NickyandThe Wedding Singer. Smigel acted alongside fellowSNLwriterBob OdenkirkinWayne's World 2as a nerd backstage at anAerosmithconcert. His contributions were uncredited.

Smigel, along with Adam Sandler andJudd Apatow, wrote the script for the filmYou Don't Mess with the Zohanin which Smigel played Yosi, an Israeli electronics salesman. Smigel is also one of the executive producers of the film, which is a first for him despite his frequent collaborations with Sandler.
It was reported in 2006 that Smigel and Adam Sandler were working on an animated sitcom forFoxcalledAnimals. Fox has not made any official statement regarding the show.[11]Additionally, Smigel played a gay mailman in the Adam Sandler filmI Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larryand Yari the Mechanic in the "Mister Softee" episode ofCurb Your Enthusiasm.
He voiced Ray and theStar Warscharacter,Emperor Palpatine, in the first episode ofRobot Chicken: Star Wars, as well as the monster One Hundred in theepisode of the same nameofAqua Teen Hunger Force.
Currently living in New York, he co-wrote and co-executive produced the filmsHotel Transylvania(2012) andHotel Transylvania 2(2015), in which he voiced Marty, a fake version ofDracula, and Harry Three-Eye, respectively. In thefifth seasonof theFXshow,Louie, Smigel received a story credit on the episode "Cop Story", as a similar incident as to what appears in the show actually happened to him, down to the cop crying in his apartment while Smigel went out, found the missing gun and carried it home, terrified that anyone would notice.Michael Rapaport's character Lenny wasn't based on the man Smigel knew, however, since all Smigel ever toldLouis C.K.about was the gun itself.[12]
Smigel created, wrote, executive produced, and starred as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog inThe Jack and Triumph Show, alongsideJack McBrayerin 2015. It was announced in January 2016 that Smigel would be starring as Triumph inTriumph's Election Special 2016onHuluthe following February.[13]
In September 2020, after being brought on to develop the project in 2019, Fox announced that Smigel would executive produceLet's Be Real— a one-off adaptation of the French satirical seriesLes Guignols.[14]
On June 16, 2022, Smigel was arrested for unlawful entry of theLongworth House Office Buildingin Washington, D.C., along with eight other individuals associated withThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.[15]CBSreleased a statement saying that “Their interviews at the Capitol were authorized and pre-arranged throughCongressional aidesof the members interviewed", and that "After leaving the members’ offices on their last interview of the day, the production team stayed to film stand-ups and other final comedy elements in the halls when they were detained by Capitol Police.”Fox NewspunditTucker Carlsonaccused Smigel of "insurrection" and that it was "exactly like what happened" in apparent reference to the2021 United States Capitol attack.[16]Stephen Colbertaddressed the incident in his monologue, stating that Smigel had committed "First-DegreePuppetry" and that "Drawing any equivalence between rioters storming our Capitol to prevent the counting of electoral ballots and a cigar-chomping toy dog is a shameful and grotesque insult to the memory of everyone who died.” TheUnited States Capitol Policereleased a statement saying that “This is an active criminal investigation, and may result in additional criminal charges after consultation with theU.S. Attorney.”[17]On July 19, it was announced no charges would be filed.[18]
Smigel met his wife, Michelle Saks, when she worked as a lighting technician for the theater in Chicago where he performed as part of the comedy troupe "All You Can Eat and the Temple of Dooom".[19][20][21]They have three children together.[citation needed]

His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
