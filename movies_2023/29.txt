Marc brings Sophie and Thomas with him to the city, though he keeps the revelation a secret so the three can have a good time. Sophie, who had recently ended a serious relationship with her boyfriend Terrance, brings them to meet a date, which Marc leaves to spend time with Theo, a French man he had previously met at a London performance art exhibit.
Marc admits that his anger at Oliver's secrets is distracting him from his grief. He also reveals that he gave up painting following the death of his mother, and he worries that he's not properly grieving Oliver just as he didn't properly grieve her. Theo brings Marc to theClaude Monetroom at theMusée de l'Orangerie, explaining that it had been painted after the death of his family, and they kiss.
The next morning, Thomas berates the two for their abandonment, explaining that Sophie had been found sleeping at a bus station and he could not reach Marc. A man enters and introduces himself as Luca, a Berlin native who had won Oliver's art scholarship before growing closer to him, finally leading to Marc telling the truth about the nature of their trip.
At dinner, Sophie apologizes to the others and asks that they are honest about their feelings for once.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 76% of 37 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "A solid first feature for writer-director Dan Levy,Good Griefoffers a generally affecting look at love after death whose refreshing sincerity only occasionally veers into sentimentality."[11]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[12]
Peter Debruge fromVarietygave a positive review writing: "Levy has crafted an emotional story strong enough to withstand the zings of an ironic generation, who’ve been conditioned to snipe at sincerity. It takes guts to put genuine feelings on the line, especially after giving sarcastic-minded viewers so much ammunition".[13]David Rooney writing forThe Hollywood Reportersaid: "The shimmering melancholy of Rob Simonsen's score is often left to suggest a depth of feeling that's missing in the writing and, by extension, the performances. The script is sensitive but never terribly probing, and the movie's intimacy more staged than lived-in".[14]
Brian Tallerico, atRogerEbert.com, gave the film a score of two out of four: "Levy has a strong on-screen presence—he's a remarkably natural, likable performer—but he struggles a bit to find his voice as a writer and director withGood Grief, a modest study of the impact of loss that pushes a few buttons harder than it should and fails to fill out its ensemble equally".[15]Tim Robey fromThe Daily Telegraphrated the film three out of five.[16]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
