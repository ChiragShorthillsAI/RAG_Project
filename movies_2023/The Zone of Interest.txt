The Zone of Interestis a 2023historical dramafilm written and directed byJonathan Glazer, co-produced among theUnited Kingdom, theUnited States, andPoland. Loosely based onthe 2014 novelbyMartin Amis, the film focuses on the life of GermanAuschwitzcommandantRudolf Hössand his wife Hedwig, who live with their family in a home in the "Zone of Interest" next to the German concentration camp.Christian Friedelstars as Rudolf Höss alongsideSandra Hülleras Hedwig Höss.[3]
Development of the film began in 2014 around the publication of the Amis novel, which is itself based partially on real events. Glazer opted to tell the story of the Hösses rather than the characters they inspired and conducted extensive research into the family, as he sought to make a film that demystifies the perpetrators ofthe Holocaustas "mythologically evil". The project was formally announced in 2019, withA24confirmed to distribute the film. Filming took place primarily around theAuschwitz concentration campin summer 2021. Additional filming took place inJelenia Górain January 2022.[8]
The Zone of Interestpremiered at the76th Cannes Film Festivalon 19 May 2023 and was theatrically released in the United States on 15 December 2023. The film received critical acclaim and grossed over $52 million. Among its accolades,The Zone of Interestreceived five nominations (includingBest Picture) at the96th Academy Awards, winning two:Best International Feature(thefirstfor a non-English British film) andBest Sound.[9]The film also won theGrand Prixat Cannes and threeBritish Academy Film Awards, becoming the first film to win bothBest Film Not in the English LanguageandOutstanding British Film;[10]received three nominations at theGolden Globe Awards; and was named one of the top five international films of 2023 by theNational Board of Review.
In 1943,Rudolf Höss,commandantof the GermanAuschwitz concentration camp, lives with his wife Hedwig and their five children in an idyllic homenext to the camp. Höss takes the children out to swim and fish, and Hedwig spends time tending the garden. Non-Jewish inmates handle the chores, and themurdered Jews' belongings are given to the family. Beyond the garden wall, gunshots, screaming, and the sounds of trains and furnaces are often audible.
Höss approves the design of a new crematorium created byTopf and Sons. One day, he notices human remains in the river and gets his children out of the water where they have been playing. He sends a message toSSpersonnel, chastising them for their carelessness in "picking lilacs", causing the plants to "bleed". At night, while Höss reads the German fairytale of "Hansel and Gretel" to his daughters,a Polish girlsneaks out and hides food at the prisoners' work sites.
Hedwig's mother comes to stay, and is impressed and pleased by the material status her daughter has achieved. Höss receives word that he is being promoted to deputy inspector ofconcentration campsand must move toOranienburg, nearBerlin. He objects, and withholds the news from Hedwig for several days. Hedwig asks him to convince his superiors to let her and the children remain in their home; the request is approved. Before Höss leaves, a woman comes to his office and prepares herself for sex. Meanwhile, the Polish girl finds sheet music composed bya prisoner, which she plays on the piano at her home. Hedwig's mother departs unannounced after seeing and smelling the burning crematorium at night. She leaves a note that upsets Hedwig, causing Hedwig to lash out and threaten her servants.
In Berlin, in recognition of his work, Höss is tasked byOswald Pohlwith heading anoperation named after himthat will transport 700,000Hungarian Jewsto work at the camps or to be killed. This will allow him to move back toAuschwitzand reunite with his family. He vacantly attends a party organised by theSS Main Economic and Administrative Office. Afterwards, he tells Hedwig over the phone that he spent his time at the party thinking about the most efficient way to gas the attendees.
As Höss leaves his Berlin office and descends a stairway, he stops, retches repeatedly and stares into the darkness of the building corridors. In the present day, a group of janitors clean theAuschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. Back in 1944, Höss continues downstairs, descending into darkness.
Development ofThe Zone of Interestbegan in 2014.[11]After completingUnder the Skin,Jonathan Glazercame across a newspaper preview of the then-upcomingMartin AmisnovelThe Zone of Interestand became intrigued. He optioned the novel after reading it. Paul and Hannah Doll, the novel's two main characters, were loosely based onRudolf Höss, the longest-serving GermancommandantofAuschwitz concentration camp, and his wife Hedwig. Glazer opted to use the historical figures instead and conducted two years of extensive research into the Hösses.[12]He made several visits toAuschwitzand was profoundly affected by the sight of the Höss residence, which was separated from the camp by a mere garden wall.[13]He collaborated with theAuschwitz Museumand other organisations, and obtained special permission to access the archives, where he examined testimonies provided by survivors and individuals who had been employed in the Höss household. By piecing together these testimonies, Glazer gradually constructed a detailed portrayal of the individuals connected to the events.[14][15]He also consulted historianTimothy Snyder's 2015 bookBlack Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warningduring his research.[12]
Glazer wished to make a film that demystifies the perpetrators ofthe Holocaust, which he noted are often portrayed as "almost mythologically evil". He sought to tell the story of the Holocaust not "as something safely in the past", but "a story of the here and now".[11][16]He compared his approach to the writing of philosopherGillian Rose, who envisioned a film "that could make us feel 'unsafe', by showing how we're emotionally and politically closer to the perpetrator culture than we'd like to think" and a film seen through the "dry eyes of grief" that is unsentimental and "forensic".[17]
Glazer confirmed development of the project in 2019, withA24,Film4,Access Entertainmentand House Productions co-financing and producing.[18][19]Christian Friedelfirst met Glazer and producerJames WilsoninLondonin 2019 for the role of Rudolf Höss. Despite his own unwillingness to playNazifigures, he was intrigued by Glazer's approach, which aimed to "give this monstrous person a human face".[16]
Friedel recommended Hüller for the role of Rudolf's wife Hedwig, having first met her in 2013 while acting together in the historical dramaAmour Fou.[16][20]Hüller was first sent an excerpt of the script, an argument between Rudolf and Hedwig presented out of context, before learning the project's nature as a film about the Holocaust. Although she had resolved never to play a Nazi, Hüller was convinced after reading the full script and meeting with Glazer, believing that he shared and addressed her concerns about how to properly depictNazismon screen. Hüller's own dog, a blackWeimaraner, plays Dilla, the Höss family dog in the film.[21]
The young Polish girl in the film is inspired byAleksandra Bystroń-Kołodziejczyk, whom Glazer met during his research. As a 16-year-old member of the PolishHome Army, she used to cycle to the camp to leave apples for the starving prisoners. As in the film, she discovered a piece of music written by a prisoner. The prisoner,Joseph Wulf, worked atAuschwitz III–Monowitz. He survived the camp and was one of the first people to document the atrocities of the Holocaust, a cause to which he dedicated his life. Bystroń-Kołodziejczyk died shortly after she met Glazer. The bike the film uses and the dress the actress wears both belonged to her.[11][22]Glazer dedicated the film to her while accepting the award forBest International Feature Filmat the96th Academy Awards.[23]
The film's final scene, in which Höss retches repeatedly while walking down a flight of stairs, was inspired by the ending of the 2012 documentaryThe Act of KillingbyJoshua Oppenheimer. In that film,Anwar Congo, a gangster and formerfar-rightparamilitary enforcer, retches repeatedly while visiting the scene of several of his murders.[24][25][26]
The original Höss house has been a private residence since the end of the war.[12]Wear and tear in the subsequent eight decades made it a poor location for the shoot, which required the house to appear brand new. Production designer Chris Oddy ultimately chose a derelict building a few hundred yards away, built after the war but in a similar architectural style.[16]He spent several months converting the home into a replica of the Höss residence, and started planting the garden in April 2021 so that it would be in bloom when filming began.[12]As the camp buildings have aged significantly over the years, they were recreated through the use ofcomputer-generated graphics.[27]Principal photography began around Auschwitz in summer 2021 and lasted approximately 55 days.[12][13]Additional filming took place inJelenia Górain January 2022.[8]
The film was shot onSony Venicedigital cameras equipped withLeicalenses.[28]Glazer and cinematographerŁukasz Żalembedded up to 10 cameras in and around the house and kept them running simultaneously, with no crew on set. Żal and his team were stationed in the basement, while Glazer and the rest of the crew were in a container on the other side of the wall, away from the actors. Each take would last 10 minutes. The approach, which Glazer dubbed "Big Brotherin the Nazi house", allowed the actors to improvise and experiment extensively during filming.[12][13][15][16]Glazer and Żal aimed for a modern look and did not wish to "aesthetize" Auschwitz. As a result, only practical and natural lighting was used.[29]The nighttime sequences involving the Polish girl, where there was no natural light available, were shot using athermal imaging cameraprovided by the Polish military. The low-resolution thermal imagery was thenupscaledusingAIduring post-production.[22][16]
Glazer did not want the atrocities occurring inside the camp to be seen, only heard. He described the film's sound as "the other film" and "arguably,thefilm".[13]To that end, sound designerJohnnie Burncompiled a 600-page document containing relevant events at Auschwitz, testimonies from witnesses, and a large map of the camp so that the distance and echoes of the sounds could be properly determined.[30]He spent a year building a sound library before filming began, which included sounds of manufacturing machinery, crematoria, furnaces, boots, period-accurate gunfire and human sounds of pain. He continued building the library well into the shoot and post-production.[31][32]As many of the new arrivals at Auschwitz at the time were French, Burn sourced their voices from protests and riots inParisin 2022. The sounds of drunken Auschwitz guards were sourced at theReeperbahninHamburg.[33]
English musicianMica Levistarted working on the score as early as 2016, and later spent a year in the studio alongside Glazer and editor Paul Watts. "No stone was left unturned" said Levi in aSight and Soundinterview, as the team explored every possible avenue for how music could work in the film. "It couldn't just work on a subliminal level," Levi said, "it had to be technical rather than emotive."[34]In the end Levi wrote dense and "formally inventive",[35]vocal-based compositions accompanied by a pitch black screen for the prologue and the epilogue, plus soundscapes created for the sequences involving the Polish girl and montages of garden flowers.[36]The compositions combine human voices with asynthesizer, which Levi described as a pairing of "the oldest, most primordial instrument" with "the most modern".[16]
The Zone of Interestwas selected to compete for thePalme d'Orat the2023 Cannes Film Festival,[37]where it had its world premiere on 19 May,[38]and received a six-minute standing ovation.[39]It won theGrand Prix, theCannes Soundtrack Award, and theFIPRESCI Prize.[40][41][42]
The North American premiere was held on 1 September 2023, at the50th Telluride Film Festival.[43][44]The Zone of Interestwas also screened at the2023 Toronto International Film Festival.[45]In the US, after being delayed from its initial release date of 8 December,[46]The Zone of Interesthad alimited theatrical releaseon 15 December.[47]It was released in the UK on 2 February 2024,[48]and released in Poland a week later on 9 February.[49]It was released for digital platforms on 20 February.[50]
The film's release coincided with the ongoingwar between Israel and Hamas. In his Oscar acceptance speech at the96th Academy Awards, Glazer saidThe Zone of Interestshows wheredehumanisationleads at its worst, saying: "Right now, we stand here as men who refute theirJewishnessand the Holocaust being hijacked byan occupationwhich has led to conflict for so many innocent people." He expressed criticism, as a Jewish person, by referring to the dehumanisation of both the "victims ofOctober the 7thin Israel" and "the ongoing attack onGaza".[51][52]
Glazer's speech led to a significant reaction in the news media, especially after a widely circulated quotation truncated his remarks, suggesting that Glazer had simply refuted his Jewish identity, rather than refuting said identity "being hijacked by an occupation".[53]Producer James Wilson said at theBritish Academy Film Awards: "I had a friend that texted me the other day. He said he couldn't stop thinking about the walls we build in our daily lives that we don't choose... There's obviously things going on in the world, in Gaza, that remind us starkly of the sort of selective empathy, that there seems to be groups of innocent people being killed that we care about less than other innocent people."[54]
On March 18, anopen letterdenouncing the speech asblood libelwas signed by more than 1,000 "Jewish creatives, executives, andHollywoodprofessionals", includingAmy Pascal,Jennifer Jason Leigh,Julianna Margulies,Debra Messing,Eli Roth, andMichael Rapaport.[55]On April 5, a second open letter defending Glazer was signed by over 150 Jewish creatives in the film industry. Eventually, over 450 Jewish creatives signed the letter, includingJoel Coen,Todd Haynes,Joaquin Phoenix,Elliott Gould, andWallace Shawn; the film's composer, Mica Levi, was also a signatory.[56]The playwrightsTony KushnerandZoe Kazanwere among the speech's earlier supporters.[57][58][59]That month, Glazer donated seven signedZone of Interestposters to aMedical Aid for Palestiniansfundraiser.[60][61][62]
As of March 25, 2024[update],The Zone of Interesthas grossed $8.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $43.4 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of  $52 million.[6][7]
In its opening weekend in the United States, the film made $124,000 from four theatres.[63]Following its five Oscar nominations, it expanded from 215 theatres to 333 in its seventh week of release and made $1.08 million, an increase of 141% from the previous weekend, and a running total of $3 million.[64]
The Zone of Interestpremiered to critical acclaim.[a]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 93% of 344 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The website's critics consensus states, "Dispassionately examining the ordinary existence of people complicit in horrific crimes,The Zone of Interestforces us to take a cold look at the mundanity behind an unforgivable brutality."[72]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted averagescore of 92 out of 100, based on 58 critic reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".[73]
Kevin MaherofThe Timescalled it a "landmark movie, hugely important, that's unafraid of difficult ideas".[74]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reportercalled it a "devastating Holocaust drama like no other, which demonstrates with startling effectiveness [director Jonathan Glazer]'s unerring control of tonal and visual storytelling".[75]Donald Clarke ofThe Irish Timeswrote, "Glazer may yet get in some trouble for taking such a formal approach to sensitive material. But, if anything, that self-imposed discipline – and utter lack of sentimentality – speaks to the profound respect he has for the subject."[76]Raphael Abraham of theFinancial Timeswrote, "Glazer has achieved something much greater than just making the monstrous mundane — by rendering such extreme inhumanity ordinary he reawakens us to its true horror."[77]Jonathan Romney ofScreen Internationalwrote that the film "eschews false rhetoric, leaving maximum space for the audience's imaginative and emotional response".[78]
David Ehrlich ofIndieWirepraised Glazer's camera process for instilling "a flattening evenness into a film where the lack of drama becomes deeply sickening unto itself".[79]Robbie CollinofThe Daily Telegraphwrote, "Through painstaking framing and sound design, its horrors gnaw at the edge of every shot."[80]In a four-star review,Peter BradshawofThe Guardiancalled it "a film which for all its artistry is perhaps not entirely in control of its (intentional) bad taste", while also praising the "superb score by Mica Levi and sound design byJohnnie Burn".[81]
Writing forWorldcrunch, the German critic Hanns-Georg Rodek wrote that the film “concentrates in one garden the attitude of an entire nation that wanted to know nothing."[82]
Conversely, the Italian film critic Davide Abbatescianni's review published byCineuropawas less positive. He criticised the film for its disturbing atmosphere, which he found to be well-crafted but monotonous, and for the performances, which he felt could not bring any change to the concept presented in a film that he thought lacked variety and remained stagnant for two hours.[83]Among the other rare negative reviews,Cahiers du Cinémafound, "The problem is not only the weakness of (the film's) formal lurches, which are much more derisory than those ofUnder The Skin, and remain here at the stage of mannerisms (why dispense them in such a furtive manner, if not to frustrate needlessly?). It's also that this fantastic idea of off-camera poisoning the frame without ever showing the forbidden image ends up running empty and looking at itself."[84]The Irish Timescommented that German reviews were generally less favorable than English language reviews..[85]Writing for theFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, however, Andreas Klib stated that "Here the camera repeatedly jumps over the axis between the characters -a deadly sin in illusion cinema- to show the back of the event. Because we are not supposed to take part in it, but rather pay attention to details: the clouds of steam from a locomotive on the horizon. The smoke rising from the crematorium into the evening air. The reddish glow of the night sky. The ash that fertilizes the rose beds. At Cannes, whereThe Zone of Interestwon the Grand Jury Prize, some critics criticized the film for its lack of storytelling. But that's exactly the point of Glazer's film: it doesn't paint a story, but a world."[86]
Holocaust film scholarRich Brownstein, wrote that the film should have focused more on Hess’s life and death, calling it “an overhyped, missed opportunity to have made great art about a really bad man."[87]
Sight and Soundput the film at 2 and 14 on their lists of the best 50 movies of 2023 and 2024, respectively.[88][89]
The film was publicly praised by many filmmakers, includingSteven Spielbergwho saidThe Zone of Interestwas the best film about theHolocaustsince his filmSchindler's List(1993), "It's doing a lot of good work in raising awareness, especially about thebanality of evil."[90][91]Alfonso CuaróndescribedThe Zone of Interestas "probably the most important film in this century."[92]Other filmmakers who praised the film includeAllison Anders,Robert Eggers,Reinaldo Marcus Green,Bill Hader,Andrew Haigh,Don Hertzfeldt,Zoe Lister-Jones,Karyn Kusama,Rachel Morrison,James PonsoldtandAdam Wingard.[93]
In aVarietyessay expressing his admiration for the filmTodd Fieldwrote:
"For those familiar with Glazer's films it's no surprise his approach here is unencumbered by tropes, genre conceits, or the cinematic shorthand we often take for granted. Over his twenty-four-year career as one of our finest filmmakers, Glazer has consistently executed high-wire interpretations of genre, and in the process completely reinvented them: crime (Sexy Beast), the paranormal (Birth), science fiction (Under the Skin). His pictures within these frames are mind-blowingly unique, as if he'd never seen anything that had been done before.The Zone of Interestis just as enigmatic and urgent. For we live in a time fraught with all kinds of walls used toghettoizetheother. A paradise from which it feels harder and harder to escape. Glazer's art drives us to a place where we have no choice but to try."[94]
Upon its release in Japan on 24 May 2024, video game designerHideo Kojimahailed the work, "The sounds that plead to the audience through the wall and the torture of deliberately not showing anything at all are used to draw images from the audience's minds. The film tests your 'zone of interest' and paradoxically questions the present's fading memory of the Holocaust."[95]
Since the film's release, it has been referenced in relation to theGaza war.[96][97]Several authors, includingGhassan HageandNaomi Klein, have written about how watching the film made them think of Gaza.[98][99][100]Hage wrote: "this is all of us now in the shadow of themass murders committed in Gaza, living in cultures that have banalized evil".[99]Juliet Jacqueswrote that: "In the age of the internet, we are all the Höss family".[101]Haaretzjournalist David Issacharoff stated that the Israeli "Zone of Interest" includes the mainstream news andsettlersbut not the peace activists who died in theHamasattacks.[102]The phrase "Zone of Interest" has also been referenced in viral social media posts, including a photo ofIsraeli soldierstaking a selfie in Gaza[98]and a photo of sunflowers in Israel with destroyed Gazan buildings in the background.[102]

After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

Film4 Productionsis a British film production company owned byChannel Four Television Corporation. The company has been responsible for backing many films made in the United Kingdom. The company's first production wasWalter, directed byStephen Frears, which was released in 1982. It is especially known for its gritty,kitchen sink-style films andperiod dramas.
In 1981, producerDavid Roseleft theBBCfor Channel 4 where he was appointed the Commissioning Editor for Fiction byJeremy Isaacs, the channel's founding Chief Executive but became mostly identified with theFilm on Fourstrand. With an initial overall budget of £6 million a year,Channel Four Filmswas to invest in twenty films annually for Film on Four.[1]The first film backed wasNeil Jordan's debut filmAngel(1982).[2]The first film shown as part of Film on Four wasStephen Frears'sWalterwhich was screened on 2 November 1982, the launch date of Channel 4.P'tang, Yang, Kipperbangscreened the following day was also an early highlight.[3]Originally, the company's films were intended for television screenings alone; the "holdback" system prevented investment in theatrical films by television companies because of the length of time (then three years) before broadcasters could screen them. An agreement soon concluded with the Cinema Exhibitors Association allowed a brief period of cinema exhibition if the budget of the films was below £1.25 million.[3]Channel Four Films struck several deals with other film production companies including theBFI Production Board,Goldcrest FilmsandMerchant Ivory.[3]By 1984, Channel Four Films were investing in a third of the feature films made in the UK.[4]
Channel Four's Business Development Department was formed in 1983 for TV and film sales[5]and they also invested in foreign films includingWim Wenders'Paris, Texas(1984) andJan Svankmajer'sAlice(1988).[3]In 1985FilmFour Internationalwas created as a separate international film sales arm and to invest in foreign film, includingAndrei Tarkovsky'sThe Sacrifice(1986).[5][2][3]
Channel Four Film's first big hit was Frears' third feature film for the cinema,My Beautiful Laundrette, in 1985.[6]Originally shot in16mmfor Channel 4 it was met with such critical acclaim at theEdinburgh Film Festivalthat it was acquired byOrion Classicsand distributed to cinemas and became an international success.[7][8][2]
In 1987, FilmFour International agreed a licensing deal with Orion Classics to handle US distribution of two more FilmFour features,Rita, Sue and Bob TooandA Month in the Country.[9]By 1987, Channel 4 had an interest in half the films being made in the United Kingdom.[10]
Rose and Channel Four Films are credited by many as being a significant figure in the regeneration of British cinema and particularly remembered for films such asWish You Were Here,Dance With a Stranger,Mona Lisa, andLetter to Brezhnev. Channel Four Films also invested in earlyWorking Title Filmsas well as most of the films of Frears,Ken LoachandMike Leigh.[2]Leigh told writerHannah Rothschildaround 2008 that Film on Four had saved the British film industry: "This is a non-negotiable, historical fact of life and anybody who suggests that this isn't the case is simply either suffering from some kind of ignorance or has got some terrible chip."[1]
Rose remained in his post as Commissioning Editor until March 1990.[6]During his tenure at Channel 4, Rose approved the making of 136 films, half of which received cinema screenings.[11]Of the films Rose backed, 20 were from overseas sources, including work by directorsTheo Angelopoulos,Andrei TarkovskyandWim Wenders.[12]The company also helped British minority filmmakers includingPo-Chih Leong(Ping Pong(1986));Horace Ové(Playing Away(1986)) andHanif Kureishi(My Beautiful Laundrette;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid(1987)). This continued after Rose's departure with films directed byGurinder Chadha(Bhaji on the Beach(1993)) andSteve McQueen(Hunger(2008)).[13]
David Aukinjoined as head of drama in October 1990 and took over responsibility for Film on Four.[6]He changed his title to head of film in 1997 which he remained until 1998.[2]
The company had another big international success with Jordan'sThe Crying Gamein 1992.[2]In addition it was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Pictureas wasHowards Endthe same year.Damagealso received an Academy Award nomination that year.[6]Later in 1993, Leigh'sNakedand Loach'sRaining Stoneswere entered into competition at the1993 Cannes Film Festival.[6]
The following year,Mike Newell'sFour Weddings and a Funeralbecame thehighest-grossing UK film of all timeandDanny Boyle'sTrainspotting(1996) was also very successful.[2]
In the 1990s, Channel Four partnered withThe Samuel Goldwyn Companyto create a distribution company to release Channel Four films and Goldwyn films in the UK but Goldwyn pulled out late on and in August 1995,Film Four Distributorswas formed.[14]Its first release wasBlue Juice(1995) and its first major successes wereSecrets & LiesandBrassed Offin 1996.[15][16][2]
In 1998, the company was re-branded asFilmFourwith an annual budget of £32 million for 8 to 10 films.[6]East Is East(1999) becomes their biggest self-funded film.[6]In 2000, the company signed a three-year deal withWarner Bros.to make seven films with budgets of more than £13 million but their first,Charlotte Gray(2001) was not the success they hoped for.[6]
The company cut its budget and staff significantly in 2002, due to mounting losses, and was reintegrated into the drama department of Channel 4. The name "Film4 Productions" was introduced in 2006 to tie in with the relaunch of the FilmFour broadcast channel asFilm4.[citation needed]
Tessa Rosswas head of both Film4 and Channel 4 drama from 2002 to 2014.[17][18]

"There were all these fantastic characters, who were in and out of my house when I was a little boy. Many of them were East End Jews who had moved to the suburbs for a better quality of life, not super-intellectual people, but incredible entertainers –vaudevillemusicians, writers and the like. As a child, I loved and absorbed the richness of that culture."
Jonathan Glazer was born on 26 March 1965 in London, England,[2]and is ofAshkenazi Jewishdescent.[1][3]His ancestors wereUkrainian JewsandBessarabian Jewswho fled theKishinev pogromand arrived in the United Kingdom in the 1900s.[3][4]He said: "My great-grandparents were born inVilniusandOdesa.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
