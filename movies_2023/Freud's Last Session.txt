Tolkienandthe Inklings, and the nature of Freud's and Lewis's relationships with other people, such as Freud's daughter Anna, who iscodependentupon her father.

Fís Éireann / Screen Ireland, formerly known asBord Scannán na hÉireannorthe Irish Film Board, isIreland's state development agency for the Irish film, television and animation industry. It provides funding for the development, production and distribution of feature films, feature documentaries, short films, TV animation series and TV drama series.
The Irish Film Board (IFB) was established to develop filmmaking in Ireland under the provisions of the Irish Film Board Act 1980. Over the following seven years, it funded or co-funded a total of 10 feature films, includingEat the Peach,Anne DevlinandAngel,before its activities were suspended by Taoiseach Charles Haughey.[1]After its closure, the success of several externally funded Irish films, such asMy Left Foot,The Crying GameandThe Commitments, motivated local lobbyists to push for its re-establishment, which occurred in 1993. The board was reconstituted under the chairmanship ofLelia Doolanin 1993 by theMinister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht,Michael D. Higgins, who said "The whole reasoning behind my decision to develop the industry by means of a two-pronged approach – namely, the reactivation of the Irish Film Board and my proposals in relation to independent television production contained in the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill 1993 – is precisely to exploit the technical facilities available in Ireland at present and the imaginative and creative skills which exist in that industry which have been underemployed".[2]
In 2015,Heather Humphreys, theMinister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, announced a decision to change the name of the agency,[3]saying that the name-change "recognises the body's increasing interests beyond the world of cinema and reminds us how, in this digital age, filmmakers now rarely work in the medium of 'film'."[citation needed]On 10 April 2018, at a press conference for the publication ofInvesting in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018–2027(published as part of Project Ireland 2040),Josepha Madigan, theMinister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, announced that from 18 June 2018, the agency would become known as Fís Éireann/Screen Ireland.[4][5]
From 1993 to 2004, the organisation supported an indigenous industry which produced over 100 feature films. Irish film talent was recognized internationally and industry collaboration of Irish producers, writers and directors was well underway producing such work asAilsa(1993),I Went Down(1997),About Adam(1999),Disco Pigs(2000),Bloody Sunday(2002),Intermission(2003),The Magdalene Sisters(2003),Omagh(2004),Man About Dog(2004),Adam & Paul(2004),Breakfast on Pluto(2005),The Wind that Shakes the Barley(2006)Once(2007),Garage(2007),The Secret of Kells(2009),His & Hers(2009)The Guard(2011),Albert Nobbs(2012),What Richard Did(2012),The Stag(2014),Calvary(2014),Song of the Sea(2014),The Lobster(2015),Brooklyn(2015) andRoom(2015).
Notable Irish box office successes for Irish film includeIntermissionwhich grossed over €2 million at the Irish box office in 2003,Man About Dogwhich in 2004 grossed over €2.5 million at the Irish box office,The Guardwhich grossed over €18 million at the international box office andBrooklynwhich had earned over €2 million at the Irish box office and €11 million at the US box office as of December 2015.[citation needed]
IFB-funded productions featured at major international awards includeSix Shooter(Best Live Action Short Film,Academy Awards2006),The Wind that Shakes the Barley(Palme d’Or,Cannes Film Festival2006),Once(Best Original Song,Academy Awards2008),The Secret of Kells(nominated for Best Animated Feature,Academy Awards2010),Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God(Exceptional Merit in documentary Filmmaking,Emmy Awards2013),Song of the Sea(nominated for Best Animated Feature,Academy Awards2015),The Lobster(Jury Prize,Cannes Film Festival2015),Room(People's Choice Award,Toronto International Film Festival2015),The Killing of a Sacred Deer, andThe Breadwinner(Academy Awards nomination).[citation needed]
From 1994 to 2004 there were high levels of international film productions choosingIrelandas a location for filming as a result of the Irish tax incentive for film and television in section 35 of the Finance Act 1987 (later section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997). This film production tax incentive made Ireland more competitive for film production than its international competitors.[citation needed]As a result of the high levels of incoming production into Ireland, the craft and skills base of Irish crews improved, and those crews were then also available to work on Irish films.[citation needed]Major international films shot in Ireland during this period includeBraveheartandReign of Fire.
In the 21st century Ireland has become the base for a number of high-end international TV dramas includingThe Tudors(2007–2010),Ripper Street(2012–2016),Penny Dreadful(2014–2016),Vikings(2013–present),Into the Badlands(2017–present), andNightflyers(2018–present).[citation needed]
The agency did not initially have a policy of fundinganimation. In 1991, a group of animators and animation students established theAnamú Animation Base, promoting the growth of independent Irish animation. Along with other groups, Anamú successfully lobbied for the film board to support animation projects. From the late 1990s, the film board has provided support to Ireland's animation industry.[6]
As of 2017[update], the board was chaired by Annie Doona,[citation needed]the president ofDún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology, where the National Film School is located. At that time, the board also consisted of producer Katie Holly, the managing director of Blinder Films;Larry Bass, founder and CEO ofShinAwil Productions; Mark Fenton, founder and CEO of Masf Consulting; Rachel Lysaght, founder and lead creative producer of Underground Films; Kate McColgan, producer and managing director of Calico Productions and Marian Quinn, writer, director and founder of Janey Pictures.[citation needed]
In 2021 the Board consisted of Susan Bergin (Chair Designate), Zelie Asava, John McDonnell, Ray Harman, Eoin Holohan, Marian Quinn, and Kate McColgan.[7]In 2024 Susan Bergin resigned and Ray Harman assumed the role of Chairperson of the Board, with Catherine Magee as a new appointee to the board and Désirée Finnegan having a five year contract extension.[8]
In 2025 Screen Ireland hired Kate McColgan as its Head of Television; which includes being responsible for the management of the Screen Ireland slate across television and animation series, from development to production.[9]
Screen Ireland operates under the aegis ofDepartment of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. Its annual budget is decided byDáil Éireannand it has a budget of €39.2m for 2024, €1.5m more than its budget in 2023.[10]Screen Ireland provides funds for the development, production and distribution of feature films, feature documentaries, short films, TV animation series and TV drama series.[11][12]

In the 1980s, while she was in her mid-20s, Brady modelled for an artists' guide publication. She recalled in 2008 that the studio shoot had paid about £50 for her day's work, at a time when she welcomed the income, with her acting career yet to take off.[25]Photographed in a number of dancing poses, the resulting series of figure studies featuring Brady appeared in theIllustrator's Figure Reference Manual.[a]More than 25 years later, it was noted that one of these images of Brady, posing as part of a dancing couple, was the basis of the main figures in a widely-known painting,The Singing Butler, by artistJack Vettriano. As stated by Vettriano in 2013, Brady's image had "later inspired [his] most famous painting,The Singing Butler". The identification of the pose study in theIllustrator's Manualwith Vettriano's painting led to media reporting that he "owed his composition in part" to that publication. Vettriano, his agent, and Brady herself, have all stated that his work makes use of the image in a way that adheres to norms of artistic practice and was in line with the publisher's intent.[27][28][b]
In 2001, Brady moved toLos Angeles, where she met English photographerNick Brandt, whom she married in December 2002 in theChyulu HillsofKenya. She has discussed in interviews that she originally left Ireland as she found it "a repressive place to be a woman" at the time, with little opportunity.[2][5]The2015 marriage equalityand2018 abortionreferendums, as well as the expanding Irish industry, changed her mind, making her realise "Oh, this is a different Ireland and it accepts me now."[4]Brady had a "Catholic upbringing", but as of 2002 considered herself anatheist.[29]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
