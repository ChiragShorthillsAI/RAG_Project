The film received critical acclaim and was released theatrically in the United States on December 8, 2023, and in Ireland and the United Kingdom on January 12, 2024, bySearchlight Pictures. It also became a box office success, grossing over $117 million worldwide on a budget of $35 million, becoming Lanthimos' highest-grossing film.[7]Poor Thingswas named one of the top ten films of 2023 by theNational Board of Reviewand theAmerican Film Institute, and receivedvarious accolades, including four wins at the96th Academy Awards, two at the81st Golden Globe Awards, and five at the77th British Academy Film Awards; Stone won Best Actress at each ceremony.
Inlate-Victorian London,[b]the medical student Max McCandles is recruited by themad scientistGodwin Baxter to record the behaviour of a strange, nearly mute woman living in Godwin's house. Godwin reveals that her body is that of a woman who was pregnant and committed suicide by leaping off a bridge; Godwin replaced the woman's brain with that of thefetus, giving her an infant's mind, and named her Bella Baxter.
As weeks pass, Bella's vocabulary improves and she exhibits childlike wonder at the world. With Godwin's encouragement, Max falls in love with Bella and proposes marriage. Bella accepts, but soon discovers masturbation and sexual pleasure, leading her to run off with Duncan Wedderburn, a debauched lawyer, toLisbon. There, they have near-constant intercourse as Bella lives purely for pleasure. She is mistakenly addressed as "Victoria Blessington" by a fellow hotel guest.
As Bella becomes difficult for Duncan to control, he smuggles her onto a cruise ship, where she befriends two passengers who open her mind to philosophy. Duncan attempts to stunt her growth to no avail, and indulges in drinking and gambling. During a stop atAlexandria, Bella witnesses the suffering of the poor and becomes distraught. Wishing to help them, she entrusts Duncan's winnings to unscrupulous members of the crew, who falsely promise to give it to them. Unable to afford the rest of the trip, Bella and Duncan are dropped off atMarseilleand make their way toParis, penniless. Seeking money and accommodation, Bella begins working at a brothel. Enraged, Duncan breaks down, and Bella abandons him. At the brothel, she comes under the tutelage of Madame Swiney and begins a relationship with fellow prostitute Toinette, who introduces her tosocialism.
Now terminally ill, Godwin asks Max to bring Bella to him. Max finds her after tracking down Duncan, who has been institutionalized. Back in London, Bella reconciles with Godwin and renews her plans to marry Max, but their wedding is interrupted by Duncan and General Alfie Blessington. Alfie, addressing Bella as Victoria, declares that they were married before her disappearance and that he has come to reclaim her. Bella leaves Max to learn of her past life, but discovers Alfie's violent and sadistic nature. Bella realizes that she was Victoria, and that she killed herself to escape Alfie.
Alfie confines Bella to his mansion and tells her that he plans to have herclitoris removedand impregnate her, threatening her with a gun and demanding she drink a sedative. She tosses the sedative in his face.  Alfie accidentally shoots himself in the foot and passes out. Bella returns to Godwin's house and, with Max's help, transplants a goat's brain into Alfie's head. Godwin dies peacefully with Bella and Max at his side. Bella, Max, and Toinette begin a new life in Godwin's house, while Alfie eats grass happily.
Produced byFilm4 Productions,Element Pictures,TSG Entertainment, andSearchlight Pictures, development on the film began as early as 2009, when Lanthimos went to Scotland to discuss the acquisition of the rights toPoor Thingswith the author,Alasdair Gray. "He was a very lovely man", Lanthimos said. "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seenDogtoothand said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don't know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos said Gray took him on a personal tour ofGlasgow, where Gray showed him several places he had incorporated into the story.[9]
While filmingThe Favourite(2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who starred in that film. He began developingPoor Thingsmore actively after the success ofThe Favourite: "After the relative success ofThe Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray's book and said, 'This is what I want to do.' It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind." While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated on the short filmBleat(2022).[10]
Poor Thingswas announced in February 2021.[11]Lanthimos said that working with Stone again gave him an advantage, as they had developed a mutual trust. Stone also discussed how the process of makingPoor Thingswas different from makingThe Favouritebecause she also acted as a producer: "It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started duringthe pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn't go anywhere."[10]
Willem Dafoeentered negotiations to join the cast in March 2021.[12]In April,Ramy Youssefwas in talks to join.[13]Dafoe and Youssef were confirmed to join in May, withMark RuffaloandJerrod Carmichaelalso added to the cast.[14][15]In September,Christopher Abbottwas cast.[16]In November,Margaret QualleyandSuzy Bembawere cast,[17]withKathryn Hunteralso revealing she had a role in the film.[18]
In preparation for her role, Stone took dance lessons and accidentally dyed her hair black. Lanthimos liked the contrast between the dark hair and Stone's fair complexion.[19][20]Stone said she was attracted to the idea of portraying a woman reborn with a liberated mindset free from societal pressures:
It's such a fairy tale, and a metaphor—clearly, this can't actually happen—but the idea that you could start anew as a woman, as this body that's already formed, and see everything for the first time and try to understand the nature of sexuality, or power, or money or choice, the ability to make choices and live by your own rules and not society's—I thought that was a really fascinating world to go into.
Stone especially appreciated Bella's lack of shame:
Even though Bella has obviously been through trauma in her life, it just isn't there for her now. She was the most joyous character in the world to play, because she has no shame about anything. She's new, you know? I've never had to build a character before that didn't have things that had happened to them or had been put on them by society throughout their lives. It was an extremely freeing experience to be her.[10]
Youssef said that to prepare for their roles, he and Dafoe attended mortician school. Reflecting on the "experimental theater games" Lanthimos assigned the cast before filming, Dafoe said, "You're very patient with everyone, and everyone's patient with you. They need to be confident in what they're doing, because what we're doing is quite risky. It's not a normal film."[19]Dafoe spent six hours each day in the hair and makeup department—four hours getting extensive prosthetics applied to his face at the start of the day and two hours to get it all removed at the end.[21]
Discussing the male characterizations, Lanthimos acknowledged that while each male character was different and had his own motivation, they all reflected male attitudes typical of the story's Victorian setting. He said:
There are variations, I guess, but in this film, there's a general tendency to try to control [Bella]—even if it's done in a caring or subtle way, in the way that a parent might or that [Dafoe's character] Baxter does, or just being infatuated in the way that Ramy is. You know, being a nice man deep down, but still having the characteristics of a man of that era.
Stone also said that "the more agency Bella gets, the more she learns and grows, the more it drives these men insane. The more she has an opinion and her own wants and needs and all of that, it makes them crazy; they want her to stay this sort of pure thing."[10]
Principal photographytook place in Hungary, beginning in August 2021 at Origo Studios inBudapest[22]and wrapping that December.[23]It is the first feature film to be partially shot onKodak's 35mmEktachromecolor reversal motion picture film stock since its revival in 2018.[24]
According to cinematographerRobbie Ryan,Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 filmBram Stoker's Draculaserved as the main source of inspiration to everyone making the picture.[25]Other films that served as influences wereMichael PowellandEmeric Pressburger'sBlack Narcissus(1947),Federico Fellini'sAnd The Ship Sails On(1983), and several films byRoy Andersson.[26]
Lanthimos worked closely with costume designerHolly Waddingtonto reflect Bella's growth and development through her wardrobe, from the more puffy silhouettes of her childlike era to the nearly corseted gown she wears at the film's climax.[27][28][29]Stone elaborated on Bella's growth as reflected through her costumes, noting how at the beginning of the story she dresses in more traditional clothing and dresses more bizarrely as she transforms. She said:
I loved that element of, how would Bella put clothing together with the way her mind works at this point? At the end, there are these very military-looking dresses that look like nothing you've seen Bella wear; things are much more form-fitting and constrained, but that's because she's come to a place where she's grown and decided who she is and what she's going to do. She's not assimilating, necessarily, but there's just more structure there.[10]
Poor Thingswas the first film scored by the pop musicianJerskin Fendrix.Milan Recordsreleased the soundtrack album in conjunction with the film's release date, December 8, 2023. Two singles, "Bella" and "Lisbon", were released on November 14.[30]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 93% of 377 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Wildly imaginative and exhilaratingly over the top,Poor Thingsis a bizarre, brilliant tour de force for director Yorgos Lanthimos and star Emma Stone."[55]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[56]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while 68% of those polled byPostTrakcalled the film "excellent", with 75% saying they would definitely recommend it.[50]Glamourwrote that the film "received widespread critical acclaim following its world premiere" and that Stone was "praised for her hilariously bold and fearless sex scenes" in it.[57]
Stephanie ZacharekofTimewrote thatPoor Thingsis "Lanthimos' finest film so far, a strange, gorgeous-looking picture that extends generosity both to its characters and the audience". She called Stone's performance "wonderful—vital, exploratory, almost lunar in its perfect oddness".[58]Peter BradshawofThe Guardiancalled it a "virtuoso comic epic" and added that Stone had given a "hilarious, beyond-next-level performance".[59]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reportertermed it "an insanely enjoyable fairy tale", adding that Stone "gorges on it in a fearless performance that traces an expansive arc most actors could only dream about".[5]Variety'sGuy Lodge also wrote that the film "rests on a single astonishing performance by Stone".[60]
BBC Culture's Nicholas Barber found the film "outrageous and hilarious", comparing it to the work ofWes AndersonandTerry Gilliam. The review also noted that the novel's realistic 19th-century setting had been changed to a fantastical "steam-punkwonderland", and that some of its satirical humor and most of its socialist and feminist themes had been toned down.[61]Reviews byThe Guardian,[59]Variety[60]andEntertainment Weekly[62]also emphasize the setting's steampunk elements.Manohla Dargis, chief critic ofThe New York Times, was not as impressed. She felt the story became more "monotonal, flat and dull" over time, writing that the movie's "design is rich, its ideas thin. … It isn't long intoPoor Thingsthat you start to feel as if you were being bullied into admiring a film that's so deeply self-satisfied there really isn't room for the two of you". But Dargis too lauded Stone's acting.[63]
Filmmakers such asA. V. Rockwell,Joe Dante,Chloe Domont,Robert Eggers,Kitty Green,Bill Hader,Chad Hartigan,Matt Johnson,Zoe Lister-Jones,James PonsoldtandJeff Rowealso praised the film.[64]
Ramin Setoodeh and Zack Sharf inVarietywrote, "Not everyone lovedPoor Things. A stream of [Venice] theatergoers bolted for the exit during some of the racier scenes."[65]Mick LaSalleat theSan Francisco Chroniclecalled the film "a 141-minute mistake", writing, "Worst of all, it's dishonest. It purports to be a feminist document, but it defines a woman's autonomy as the ability to be exploited and not care. ... What version of feminism are these guys—Lanthimos and screenwriter Tony McNamara—trying to sell us here?"[66]Film criticScott Mantzapplauded LaSalle's post, finding the film "a seriously misguided take on female empowerment", though he praised the film's ambition and production values.[67]
Angelica Jade BastiénofVulturewarned readers, "This isn't a sincere treatise on female sexuality, it's a dark comedy for people who carry around an NPR tote bag", and criticized the film for failing to take a "sincere interest in the interior conflicts" of its protagonist. Bastién identified the decision to make Bella Baxter mentally a child as the "primary failure ofPoor Things'sex scenes", citing Bella's depiction as an example of the "born sexy yesterday" trope. "In many ways", she wrote, "the film demonstrates the limits of the modern cis-male auteur's vision for and about women—particularly their sexual selves." Praise was saved for Holly Waddington's costuming, which Bastién called "the greatest triumph of the film".[68]
The film has been subject to scrutiny in Gray's native Scotland due to its seeming disregard for the source material and its Scottish roots,[69]with online documentary channel Ossian presenting a portrayal of the true origins ofPoor Thingsand its Scottish setting.[70]Those closest to Gray have suggested that Lanthimos's interpretation of the source material was something Gray agreed to in the early 2010s, when contractual terms for a screenplay were drawn up.[71]
Poor Thingswon theGolden Lionat the80th Venice International Film Festival.[72]At the96th Academy Awards, it received 11 nominations, includingBest Picture, and won 4 awards, includingBest Actressfor Stone.[73][74]At the81st Golden Globe Awards, it received seven nominations and wonBest Motion Picture – Musical or ComedyandBest Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedyfor Stone.[75][76]At the29th Critics' Choice Awards, it received 13 nominations, winning forBest Actress.[77][78]It received 11 nominations at the77th British Academy Film Awardsand won 5 awards, including forBest Actress in a Leading Role.[79][80]TheAmerican Film Instituteand theNational Board of ReviewnamedPoor Thingsone of 10 best films of the year.[81][82]

Film4 Productionsis a British film production company owned byChannel Four Television Corporation. The company has been responsible for backing many films made in the United Kingdom. The company's first production wasWalter, directed byStephen Frears, which was released in 1982. It is especially known for its gritty,kitchen sink-style films andperiod dramas.
In 1981, producerDavid Roseleft theBBCfor Channel 4 where he was appointed the Commissioning Editor for Fiction byJeremy Isaacs, the channel's founding Chief Executive but became mostly identified with theFilm on Fourstrand. With an initial overall budget of £6 million a year,Channel Four Filmswas to invest in twenty films annually for Film on Four.[1]The first film backed wasNeil Jordan's debut filmAngel(1982).[2]The first film shown as part of Film on Four wasStephen Frears'sWalterwhich was screened on 2 November 1982, the launch date of Channel 4.P'tang, Yang, Kipperbangscreened the following day was also an early highlight.[3]Originally, the company's films were intended for television screenings alone; the "holdback" system prevented investment in theatrical films by television companies because of the length of time (then three years) before broadcasters could screen them. An agreement soon concluded with the Cinema Exhibitors Association allowed a brief period of cinema exhibition if the budget of the films was below £1.25 million.[3]Channel Four Films struck several deals with other film production companies including theBFI Production Board,Goldcrest FilmsandMerchant Ivory.[3]By 1984, Channel Four Films were investing in a third of the feature films made in the UK.[4]
Channel Four's Business Development Department was formed in 1983 for TV and film sales[5]and they also invested in foreign films includingWim Wenders'Paris, Texas(1984) andJan Svankmajer'sAlice(1988).[3]In 1985FilmFour Internationalwas created as a separate international film sales arm and to invest in foreign film, includingAndrei Tarkovsky'sThe Sacrifice(1986).[5][2][3]
Channel Four Film's first big hit was Frears' third feature film for the cinema,My Beautiful Laundrette, in 1985.[6]Originally shot in16mmfor Channel 4 it was met with such critical acclaim at theEdinburgh Film Festivalthat it was acquired byOrion Classicsand distributed to cinemas and became an international success.[7][8][2]
In 1987, FilmFour International agreed a licensing deal with Orion Classics to handle US distribution of two more FilmFour features,Rita, Sue and Bob TooandA Month in the Country.[9]By 1987, Channel 4 had an interest in half the films being made in the United Kingdom.[10]
Rose and Channel Four Films are credited by many as being a significant figure in the regeneration of British cinema and particularly remembered for films such asWish You Were Here,Dance With a Stranger,Mona Lisa, andLetter to Brezhnev. Channel Four Films also invested in earlyWorking Title Filmsas well as most of the films of Frears,Ken LoachandMike Leigh.[2]Leigh told writerHannah Rothschildaround 2008 that Film on Four had saved the British film industry: "This is a non-negotiable, historical fact of life and anybody who suggests that this isn't the case is simply either suffering from some kind of ignorance or has got some terrible chip."[1]
Rose remained in his post as Commissioning Editor until March 1990.[6]During his tenure at Channel 4, Rose approved the making of 136 films, half of which received cinema screenings.[11]Of the films Rose backed, 20 were from overseas sources, including work by directorsTheo Angelopoulos,Andrei TarkovskyandWim Wenders.[12]The company also helped British minority filmmakers includingPo-Chih Leong(Ping Pong(1986));Horace Ové(Playing Away(1986)) andHanif Kureishi(My Beautiful Laundrette;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid(1987)). This continued after Rose's departure with films directed byGurinder Chadha(Bhaji on the Beach(1993)) andSteve McQueen(Hunger(2008)).[13]
David Aukinjoined as head of drama in October 1990 and took over responsibility for Film on Four.[6]He changed his title to head of film in 1997 which he remained until 1998.[2]
The company had another big international success with Jordan'sThe Crying Gamein 1992.[2]In addition it was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Pictureas wasHowards Endthe same year.Damagealso received an Academy Award nomination that year.[6]Later in 1993, Leigh'sNakedand Loach'sRaining Stoneswere entered into competition at the1993 Cannes Film Festival.[6]
The following year,Mike Newell'sFour Weddings and a Funeralbecame thehighest-grossing UK film of all timeandDanny Boyle'sTrainspotting(1996) was also very successful.[2]
In the 1990s, Channel Four partnered withThe Samuel Goldwyn Companyto create a distribution company to release Channel Four films and Goldwyn films in the UK but Goldwyn pulled out late on and in August 1995,Film Four Distributorswas formed.[14]Its first release wasBlue Juice(1995) and its first major successes wereSecrets & LiesandBrassed Offin 1996.[15][16][2]
In 1998, the company was re-branded asFilmFourwith an annual budget of £32 million for 8 to 10 films.[6]East Is East(1999) becomes their biggest self-funded film.[6]In 2000, the company signed a three-year deal withWarner Bros.to make seven films with budgets of more than £13 million but their first,Charlotte Gray(2001) was not the success they hoped for.[6]
The company cut its budget and staff significantly in 2002, due to mounting losses, and was reintegrated into the drama department of Channel 4. The name "Film4 Productions" was introduced in 2006 to tie in with the relaunch of the FilmFour broadcast channel asFilm4.[citation needed]
Tessa Rosswas head of both Film4 and Channel 4 drama from 2002 to 2014.[17][18]

Lanthimos's feature film career started with the 2001 mainstream Greek comedy filmMy Best Friend, which he co-directed withLakis Lazopoulos.[7]Robert Koehler ofVarietydeclared "Lanthimos works mightily to make a big impression. As a result [the film] is asex farceon steroids, overflowing with energy and excessive curiosity about what the movie camera actually can do".[8]
His sophomore project was theexperimentalandpsychological dramaKinetta, which premiered at the2005 Toronto Film Festival.[9]The film revolves around three nameless protagonists as they attempt to film and photograph various badly reenacted struggles between a man and a woman at a Greek hotel. The film earned mixed to negative reviews. Roger Moore ofMovie Nationdescribed it as "overtly navel-gazing, obscure to the point of suggesting obscurant. It’s a 95 minute exercise inminimalism,behavior studies, psychology and boredom."[10]John DeFore ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote a positive review he stating, "The standoffish debut holds some pleasures for patient viewers" adding, "Lanthimos enjoys provoking us visually...The camera’s gaze is as idiosyncratic as the visions the Driver tries to bring to life, but unlike him, the film seems satisfied with what it creates."[11]

But its edgy integrity and distinctive atmosphere should win fans in some corners, particularly among those who admire the less tongue-in-cheek work ofLars Von Trier."[18]In 2010, he acted in and co-producedAttenberg, a Greek drama film directed byAthina Rachel Tsangari. His fourth feature film,Alps(2011), won the Osella Award for Best Screenplay at the68th Venice International Film Festival.[19]A. O.

It premiered at the2017 Cannes Film Festivalwhere it competed for thePalme d'Or.Mark KermodeofThe Guardianwrote: "As black comedy gives way to grand guignol, we are reminded of the tortured games thatMichael Hanekeonce played upon his bourgeois protagonists and audiences."

Scottwriting, "Lanthimos, his camera gliding through gilded corridors and down stone staircases — in exquisitely patterned light and shadow, with weird lenses and startling angles — choreographs an elaborate pageant of decorum and violence, claustrophobia and release."[28]The film went on to tie with theAlfonso Cuarondirected drama filmRomafor the most nominations at91st Academy Awards, with ten, includingBest PictureandBest Directorfor Lanthimos (winning theAcademy Award for Best ActressforOlivia Colman).[29]

In his first of three film appearances in 1996, Dafoe made a cameo appearance as an electrician in the biographical dramaBasquiat.[51]Next, he played an operative in the romantic war dramaThe English Patient.The English Patientwas filmed inTuscany, where Dafoe said he particularly enjoyed the "quiet moments in the monastery between shoots".[52]In the period dramaVictory—which was filmed in 1994 and premiered in Europe in 1996, but was not released until 1998—Dafoe played a European living on an island in the Southeast Asia who becomes the target of redemption after preventing a woman, played byIrène Jacob, from being raped.[53]
"I really made a conscious effort to mix it up, not because in itself it's not the job of an actor to do all different things, but for me that's what I'm interested in. You've got to be careful because you've got to work with what you have, not just for vanity's sake, but I think the best part of being an actor sometimes is the opportunity to transform yourself superficially, and deeply."
In 1997, Dafoe returned to playing a villainous role in the action thrillerSpeed 2: Cruise Control, expressing the necessity of appearing in both independent andblockbusterfilms.[55]The film starredSandra BullockandJason Patricas a couple vacationing on a luxury cruise that has been hijacked by Dafoe's character, Geiger, a hacker that has programmed the ship to crash into an oil tanker.Speed 2was met with negative reviews from critics,[56]with Dafoe himself receiving aRazzie Awardnomination forWorst Supporting Actor.[57]For his next film,Affliction(1997), Dafoe worked with Paul Schrader for a second time, playing the brother ofNick Nolte's character and served as the film's narrator.[58]Also in 1997, Dafoe took on a voice acting role in an episode of the animated sitcomThe Simpsonstitled "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", voicing the commandant of a military academy thatBartandLisa Simpsonare attending.[59]Following a villainous supporting role in the romantic mystery dramaLulu on the Bridge,[60]Dafoe starred alongsideChristopher WalkenandAsia ArgentoinAbel Ferrara'scyberpunkdramaNew Rose Hotelin 1998.

Much of the film's critical praise went to Dafoe; Roger Ebert wrote that Dafoe "embodies the Schreck ofNosferatuso uncannily that when real scenes from the silent classic are slipped into the frame, we don't notice a difference".[69]TheChicago ReadercriticJonathan Rosenbaumfelt the film's "only redeeming quality" was Dafoe's "enjoyably over-the-top, eye-rolling performance".[70]Dafoe received numerous awards and nominations for his performance, including his secondAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actornomination.[71]Dafoe took on two leading roles in 2001, both of which were as priests.

O. Scottwrote that his performance was "uninspired and secondhand".[77]IGN'sRichard George commented that Green Goblin's armor, particularly the helmet, was "almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression".[78]Steven Scaife atVicewrote that Dafoe's Goblin "represents everything that's fun about superhero villains, as well as everything that's great about Raimi's campy films", also commending Dafoe's voice and body language, which helped overcome the bulky Green Goblin costume that he compared to that of aPower Rangersvillain.[79]

Hunter was born in New York to Greek parents, and was raised in England.[7][8]She trained atRADA, where she is now an associate and regularly directs student productions, and studied clowning withPhilippe Gaulier.[9]
In her stage work, Hunter is particularly associated withphysical theatre, having been described as a "virtuoso physical performer."[10][11]
She has worked with renowned companies in that field includingShared ExperienceandComplicité.[11]She won anOlivier Awardin 1991 for playing the millionairess inFriedrich Dürrenmatt'sThe Visit.[12]
Critics have noted Hunter's unusual physical presence and her range.Charles SpencerofThe Telegraphwrote, "diminutive in stature, and slightly lame, she has a deep, guttural voice, eyes like black olives and the most expressive of faces. Almost nothing seems beyond her range, from farcical clowning to deepest, darkest tragedy."[13]
Hunter's "uncommon ability to shape-shift"[14]has led her to play roles typically reserved for male actors. She was the first British woman to playKing Learprofessionally.[15][16]
Hunter's portrayal of Lear conscientiously challenged the audience to separate character and performer: her voice and clothing read as male, but she physicalized lines such as "Down from the waist they are Centaurs/Though women all above" to remind the audience of the female body playing the part.[17]Another male role she played was inThe Bee, directed byHideki Noda, which played at theSoho Theatrein June 2006 and 2012.[18]
Hunter has also played animals and other creatures. InKafka's Monkey, a solo piece based onFranz Kafka's"A Report to an Academy," she played a monkey delivering a speech to a scientific society about its transformation from a monkey to a man.[19]The piece was a highly acclaimed sell-out success at theYoung Vicin 2009, where it was reprised in May 2011.[20]It toured to theBaryshnikov Arts Centerin New York in April 2013. According toCharles IsherwoodofThe New York Times, Hunter's performance had "wry wisdom, a touch of cheeky humor and, above all, a sense of dignity."[19]
In November 2013, she co-starred as the fairyPuckinJulie Taymor's production ofA Midsummer Night's Dream,the show that opened theTheatre for a New AudienceinBrooklyn.[21]Ben BrantleyofThe New York Timesdescribed Hunter's Puck as "genuinely original" and "part music-hall comedian, part fairground contortionist."[22]
In 2008, Hunter co-starred in the first[citation needed]English-language production ofFragments, a collection of short plays bySamuel Beckett, directed byPeter Brook.[23]Of the London run at the Young Vic, Andrew Dickson ofThe Guardianwrote, "the evening belongs to Kathryn Hunter, who crams into a few minutes of stage time more than most actors achieve in a career."[24]The piece toured internationally, appearing in New York in 2011.[23]
Hunter was made an Artistic Associate at theRoyal Shakespeare Company(RSC) in 2008.[25][26]
From January to March 2009, she debuted as an RSCdirectorwith a production ofOthelloat theWarwick Arts Centre,Hackney Empire,Northern Stage,Oxford PlayhouseandLiverpool Playhouse.[27]Her husband Marcello Magni was movement director on the production and appeared in it as Roderigo. Other cast members includedMichael Gouldas Iago,Patrice Naiambanaas Othello, andNatalia Tenaas Desdemona.
In 2010, Hunter played Cleopatra in a production ofAntony and Cleopatra[28]and the Fool in a production ofKing Learat the RSC's Courtyard Theatre inStratford-upon-Avon.[28][29]The latter performance was described as "outstanding".[29]
In January 2011, she withdrew from these roles shortly before the plays were due to be revived.[30]
In February 2016, Hunter took the title role ofCyrano de Bergeracat theSouthwark Playhouse, London.GuardiancriticMichael Billingtonwrote, "Hunter is an astonishing shape-shifting performer who can play just about anything"[31]butTelegraphcritic Jane Schilling called Russell Bolam's production "an opportunity squandered."[32]In 2017, she starred in the title role inThe House of Bernarda Albaat theRoyal ExchangeinManchester.
In 2018, Hunter returned to the RSC to play the title role inTimon of Athens, directed bySimon Godwin.[33]
From December 2022 to June 2023, Hunter played the lead role of Janina Duszejko in a stage adaptation of the Polish mystery novelDrive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead, adapted for the stage byComplicité.[34]
Her screen work includes a supporting role in the TV seriesRomeasCleopatra's companion,Charmian, and voicing Gorn inTron: Uprising. Notable film work includesMike Leigh'sAll or Nothing(2002) andHarry Potter's neighbour,Arabella Figg, in the fifth film of theHarry Potterseries,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix(2007).

She first worked for Fassbinder in 1965 and became an active participant in theNew German Cinema. Schygulla won the 1979Berlin Silver Bear for Best Actressfor Fassbinder'sThe Marriage of Maria Braun, and the 1983Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actressfor theMarco FerrerifilmThe Story of Piera.[2]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
