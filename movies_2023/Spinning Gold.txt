As a Jewish teen in London, Isaacs enduredantisemitismby theNational Front, afar-right extremistorganisation. His parents eventuallyemigrated to Israel.[9]He later told an interviewer, "There were constantly people beating us up or smashing windows. If you were ever, say, on a Jewish holiday, identifiably Jewish, there was lots of violence around. But particularly when I was 16, in 1979, the National Front were really taking hold, there were leaflets at school, andSieg Heilingand peoplegoose-steppingdown the road and coming after us."[7]Following in the footsteps of his three brothers (one who became a doctor, one a lawyer, and one an accountant),[6]he studied law atBristol Universityfrom 1982 to 1985, becoming involved in the university's theatre club there; he eventually acted in over 30 plays and performed each summer at theEdinburgh Festival Fringe, first with Bristol University and then twice with the National Student Theatre Company.

I suddenly understood why my friends, who I'd thought were slightly backward, had been so addicted to these children's books. They're likecrack." (From an interview in 2009 on ITV'sThe Justin Lee Collins Show)[16]
In "The Naked and the Dead", an article published in theSan Francisco Chronicle, on 26 November 2006, Neva Chonin named the character Lucius Malfoy one of the 12 "Sexiest Men Who Were Never Alive" and Isaacs one of the 13 "Sexiest Men Who Are Real and Alive".[17]

[Isaacs joked], 'I fell to my knees and begged ... It didn't do any good. I'm sure she doesn't need plot ideas from me. But I made my point. We'll see. Like everybody else, I'm holding my breath to July to see what's in there. I just want to bust out of prison, that's all. I don't want to stay inAzkabanmost of my life.' "[19]Ultimately Isaacs did reprise the role of Malfoy as acameo appearanceinHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince(2009), where he is seen in a movingportrait.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
