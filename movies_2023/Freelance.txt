Freelanceis a 2023 Americanaction comedy filmdirected byPierre Moreland written by Jacob Lentz in his feature writing debut. It starsJohn Cena,Alison Brie,Juan Pablo Raba, andChristian Slater.
Mason Pettits is a formerU.S. Army Special Forcesoperator, who was injured and medically discharged after a failed mission to assassinate Juan Venegas, the dictator of the South American country of Paldonia. Years later, Mason, stuck in a dead-end job at a law firm, is approached by an old teammate, Sebastian Earle, who offers him a highly paid private security job where he has to protect disgraced journalist Claire Wellington as she travels to Paldonia at the invitation of Venegas, who wishes to improve his public image with an interview in the midst of an uprising against his regime. The mission upsets his wife Jenny, who doesn't want their daughter Casey to live without a father, should something happen.
After arriving in Paldonia and meeting Venegas, they are ambushed by an anti-Venegas militant group, destroying their vehicles in the process. Mason fights off the assailants and they escape into the jungle. Venegas deduces that their attackers were his own soldiers in disguise, and that the assassination attempt is actually a coup orchestrated by his nephew Jorge with the aid of military advisor Colonel Jan Koehorst. Mason tries to leave Venegas behind while bringing Claire with him, but the two are ambushed by mercenaries. Mason, with a little help from Venegas, fights them off, and the group arrives at a village where Venegas is highly respected.
Claire successfully films her interview with Venegas. While Mason bonds further with Claire, he resists her romantic advances, remembering his family back home. The next day, Venegas hints at a real purpose for Mason's job - Mason calls Sebastian, who informs him that he was actually hired to ingratiate himself with the dictator and then assassinate him. Jan and his men subsequently arrive at the village and chase the group; Mason and Venegas manage to escape while Claire is captured.
While on the way to Paldonia's capital, Venegas reveals that he wasn't responsible for killing Mason's friends during their mission. Later, the two stage a trade with Claire, while Venegas reveals that the "revolution" against his regime was staged and that he is in fact much loved by his people. The next day, during said trade, Venegas brings in fake protestors to distract Jan as he, Mason, and Claire flee to the safety of the presidential palace. There, Venegas convinces Jorge to help him lead the country better, but General Martínez, Venegas's trusted lieutenant, reveals himself as another conspirator; Jorge is killed shielding his uncle.
Jan and his men arrive at the palace, and a shootout ensues between them and Venegas' palace guards, during which Mason fights Jan alone. Jan reveals that he was responsible for killing Mason's crew. Claire, who films the battle, helps Mason defeat Jan. Afterwards, Sebastian and his team arrive and deal with the rest of Jan's militants.
Sometime later, Claire has managed to restore her career with the footage from Paldonia, Venegas steps down from power in favor of democratic elections, and Mason reunites with his family before being gifted $5 million by Venegas, allowing him to leave his hated job.
Mason's and Jenny's daughter is portrayed by child actress Molly McCann.

Relativity Media, LLCis an American independentmedia companyfounded in 2004 by Lynwood Spinks andRyan Kavanaugh.[3]The company brokeredfilm financedeals and later branched into film production and other entertainment ventures. The company was commercially successful prior to bankruptcy.
In 2015, Relativity Media filed forChapter 11 bankruptcyafter lawsuits and missing loan payments.[4][5][6][7]The bankruptcy was noted as one of the most notorious in entertainment industry history.[8]As a result, the company began selling off previously acquired films. Relativity Media reorganized and emerged from bankruptcy in March 2016,[9]but in May 2018 it filed for bankruptcy again.[10]The studio is now a wholly owned subsidiary of UltraV Holdings.[11]
Relativity Media was founded byRyan Kavanaughand Lynwood Spinks in 2004. Kavanaugh convinced Spinks, a formerCarolco Picturesexecutive[12]to invest $1 million into the venture.[13]Relativity began operations as a middleman brokering deals between film studios and banks,[14]private equity firms, and hedge funds to finance multi-film slates.[15]In 2005, the funding needs ofHollywoodstudios became more critical when a German tax shelter that had supported them for 25 years[16]was eliminated,[12]and Relativity Media met that need withWall Street'splentiful funds in the early 2000s.[13]Relativity arranged financing for slates produced byWarner Bros.,Universal Pictures, andSony Pictures.[13]For each film, Relativity received equity and brokerage fees of $500,000[13]to $1 million,[15]and Kavanaugh arranged an executive producer credit for himself.[12]
In 2007, Kavanaugh sued Spinks after the partners had a falling out.[14]
In 2008,Elliott Managementbought 49.5% of Relativity Media for $67 million[12]and provided access to about $1 billion in capital and a revolving credit line.[14]The increased funds allowed Relativity to expand involvement with film production companies. In 2009, Relativity reached anoutput dealwithLionsgate,[17]and boughtRogue PicturesfromUniversal Picturesfor $150 million.[18]In 2010, a deal withNetflixallowed Relativity Media-owned films to be streamed on the platform,[19][20][21]and Relativity purchasedOverture Films' distribution and marketing operations.[22][23]
Elliott Management's funding eventually allowed Relativity Media to begin operating its own studio, producing and distributing its own films.[24]The studio distributed its first film on December 3, 2010.[citation needed]
In 2011, Elliott Management pulled its financial backing from Relativity amid reports of tension between the companies.[25]In May 2011, Relativity's president Michael Joe moved to Elliott Associates to manage their investment in Relativity[26]after Elliott had invested hundreds of millions of dollars with very little inreturn.[27]Kavanaugh had structured a slate deal between Elliott and Universal titled "Beverly 2" that comprised the majority of Elliott's investment in Relativity at the time, but the investment turned out poorly for Elliott and further enormous losses were forecasted. Relativity was also scheduling their own movies opposite Universal's, including competingSnow Whiteadaptations,[28]which Universal executives saw as Relativity using "Beverly 2" funds to gain a competitive advantage. Elliott put pressure on Kavanaugh to hand Beverly 2 over to Elliott in exchange for releasing Michael Joe from hisnon-compete.[29]Two weeks before the opening of Relativity's first big-budget epicImmortals, Elliott reportedly threatened to further reduce its investment unless Kavanaugh made significant concessions when Relativity was already short on funds.[13]
Relativity took out a $200 million loan fromRon Burkle, who had other entertainment investments including withBobandHarvey Weinsteinthrough his associated firm Colbeck Capital. The loan was taken in part to cover the multi-million dollar marketing costs forImmortals.[30]In January 2012, as Relativity continued to struggle financially, Kavanaugh sought a new major investor, and Burkle, and his  invested between $600 million and $800 million[31]and became a shareholder.[32]
In May 2012, Relativity announced that Colbeck structured $350 million in debt financing for the company, with Elliott departing from its investment in the company.[13]Later that month, it signed a co-production and co-financing deal on two movies withEuropaCorpthat Relativity would distribute in the United States.[33][34]Relativity also has co-production deals withAtlas EntertainmentincludingProject.[17]
On June 12, 2012, Relativity Media andRoguesold 30 of their films to Manchester Library Company,[35]which was acquired byVine Alternative Investmentsin April 2017.[36]
In July 2012, Relativity merged its Rogue Sports, a Maximum Sports Management basketball agency, a football agency, and SFX Baseball into Relativity Sports.[37]Relativity Sports represented more than 400 clients includingAmar'e Stoudemire.[38]
In 2013, hedge fund investor Carey Metz made a $10 million investment in Relativity Media based on what he later described as Ryan Kavanaugh's lies.[39]
In April 2013, Relativity partnered with Glenn Kalison to create a film and performing arts school called Relativity School.[40]
Most of the studio's movies performed poorly at the box office.[41][12]The movie slate financing Relativity Media brokered for Wall Street investors also fared poorly for equity holders.[12]
In July 2015, Relativity Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. With estimates of $500 million to $1 billion in liabilities and only $100–$500 million in claimed assets, the company's unpaid debts were reportedly paralyzing the company.[42]The bankruptcy filing came after a last-ditch effort from investors to salvage the company by preventing Ryan Kavanaugh and Relativity from carrying out any unsupervised transactions.[43]The Hollywood Reporterlater called it "one of the most notorious Hollywood bankruptcies ever."[8]The company would remain in U.S. Bankruptcy Court reorganizing itself for nearly 8 months until March 2016.[44]
As a result of the bankruptcy, the company sold off previously acquired films includingSuffragette,Jane Got a Gun,The Bronze,Love the Coopers,The Space Between Us,The Foreigner,Solace,Collide,Kidnap,Before I Wake,Animal Crackers,Shot Caller,Hillsong: Let Hope Rise,FallenandThe Secret Scripture.Suffragettewas sold toFocus Featuresand as a result Ryan dropped out of producing the film due to financial struggles with his company;Jane Got a Gunwas sold toTWC,The Bronzewas sold to bothSony Pictures ClassicsandStage 6 Films,Love the Cooperswas sold toCBS Films,The Space Between UsandThe Foreignerwere both sold toSTX Entertainment,Solacewas sold toLionsgate Premiere,Collidewas sold toOpen Road Films,Kidnapwas sold toAviron Pictures,Before I WakeandAnimal Crackerswere both sold toNetflix,Shot Callerwas sold toSaban Films,Hillsong: Let Hope Risewas sold toPure Flix EntertainmentandFallenandThe Secret Scripturewere both sold toVertical Entertainmentand transferred its distribution rights ofEuropaCorptoSTX Entertainmentin January 2017.
In September 2015, three women who were involved in a Relativity Media reality show filed a lawsuit alleging the company never followed through on promises to support the women in escaping sex work and gaining improved housing, educational, medical and legal situations. The first litigant said she was paid $250 for her appearance and assured the "real" compensation would come in the form of assistance after the show. Two of the women also sued Relativity Media for not blurring their faces in footage as they had promised to do for the women. One of these women said she "has suffered incessant humiliation and embarrassment which continues to this day".[45][46]
On January 6, 2016, Relativity Media acquiredTrigger Street Productions. OwnersKevin SpaceyandDana Brunettiwere given the roleschairmanandpresidentof Relativity Studios, respectively.[47]That March, Spacey announced that he would not accept Relativity's offer; Brunetti's position is still in place.[48]
On January 26, 2016, Relativity Television, Relativity Media's television division, became an independent company named Critical Content after the post-bankruptcy.[49]
On March 18, 2016, the company reemerged from the supervision of U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Michael Wiles.[44]In the wake of the bankruptcy, Ryan Kavanaugh chose to pay himself $2.6 million between April and November 2016 while his company failed to pay bankruptcy fees or file tax returns.[50]
On September 8, 2016, it launched R2 Entertainment which will be based in Canada and is now an independent film distributor focused on releasing films with budgets under $15 million. It will be co-headed by Mark Kassen and Dana Brunetti.[51]
On October 28, 2016, Kavanaugh announced that he was selling Relativity to Singapore-based social networking platformYuuZoofor $250 million.[52][53][54]Other companies have attempted to bid, including Chinese technology companyLenovo.[53]On March 2, 2017, YuuZoo announced they were canceling the investment in the fledgling studio saying "conditions precedent to the investment had not been met".[55]
In May 2018, the company filed for bankruptcy once again and arranged to sell all of its assets.[10]TheU.S. Trustee's officeexpressed concern at the bankruptcy filing, saying that it appeared "designed to benefit Kavanaugh and lender UltraV Holdings at the expense of other creditors" and advocated for a robust investigation. This concern was partially based on the negligence of Relativity to satisfy even the administrative fees owed from the 2016 bankruptcy. Greg Zipes, the attorney for the U.S. trustee's office in New York wrote "the Debtors [Relativity Media] have apparently been unable to pay even the administrative claims owed under the confirmed (bankruptcy) plan" of 2016... In summary, while the Debtors appear to have raised some capital and paid down some debt, their finances are largely a mystery, apparently even to themselves." The filing from the trustee's office also uncovered the $2.6 million Kavanaugh paid himself between April and November 2016 while remaining delinquent on what Relativity owed from the bankruptcy agreement. The trustee's office also expressed concern that this 2018 bankruptcy filing might be an "arm's length transaction", as Kavanaugh continued to have inappropriate access to computer systems, email, bank accounts, and servers at Relativity after the filing stated Kavanaugh had left the company.[50]
In June 2018, Netflix sued Relativity Media for breaching an exclusivity agreement after five films that were to be exclusively featured on Netflix were provided toAmazonandStarz. According to the suit, Netflix paid Relativity Media for licensing fees and exclusive rights to streamThe Lazarus Effect,The Woman in Black 2,Beyond the Lights,And So It Goes, andHector and the Search for Happiness, but Relativity's led to their loss of control over the titles which third parties then distributed to Amazon and Starz. Netflix also alleged Relativity Media failed to provide their contracted number of films. Relativity Media promised to provide Netflix with 22 films between 2016 and 2018, including eight in 2017, but allegedly delivered only three.[56]
In June 2018, an arbitration case found that executives from Relativity Media, including Kavanaugh, had fabricated a memo alleging sexual harassment by a former co-president of the company. A forensic audit of Relativity Media found that the memo had been altered by a user named "kav kav".[57]Kavanaugh stated that the finding was "patently false" and filed a counterclaim alleging a violation of the arbitration process.[58]
Also in June 2018, investor Carey Metz filed a lawsuit against Relativity's CEO Ryan Kavanaugh alleging Kavanaugh's deceptive representations of his proprietary algorithm had defrauded Metz of $12.5 million. After a 5-year relationship with Relativity, Metz described Kavanaugh's algorithm as a poor predictive tool which Relativity used only inconsistently in determining which films to finance.[39]
In August 2018, the US Bankruptcy court approved the sale of the company to Ultra V Holdings.[11]
In 2020, Lex Miron, CEO of Relativity Media, announced thatCome Awaywould be the first commercial release of the "new Relativity Media" under Ultra V Holdings. Miron gave an interview toThe Hollywood Reporterabout taking two years after the 2018 bankruptcy to "quietly and deliberately rebuild the studio and its industry relationships" and said Relativity Media's strategy going forward would be to focus on smaller to mid-budget films.[59]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
