The film stars Sennott,Ayo Edebiri,Ruby Cruzin her feature film debut,Havana Rose Liu,Kaia Gerber,Nicholas Galitzine, Miles Fowler,Dagmara Domińczyk, andMarshawn Lynch. The plot follows two high school senior girls who start a fight club as a way to hook up with cheerleaders.
Bottomspremiered atSouth by Southweston March 11, 2023, and was released in the United States on August 25, byMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures. The film received positive reviews from critics.
Best friends PJ and Josie are unpopular lesbian virgins atfootball-obsessed Rockbridge Falls High School. At the back-to-school fair, they unsuccessfully flirt with their respective crushes, popular cheerleaders Brittany and Isabel. When they see Isabel arguing with her boyfriend Jeff, the school's starquarterback, PJ and Josie invite her into their car to escape. They gently bump into Jeff when he refuses to move, prompting him to feign injury in front of the entire football team.
At school, rumors spread that PJ and Josie spent the summer at juvenile detention. Threatened with expulsion for Jeff's "injury", Josie lies that they were practicing for a feminist "self-defense club" to avoid punishment. With the help of their friend Hazel, PJ and Josie actually start the club, with the ulterior motive of attracting girls. They persuade their disinterested history teacher Mr. G to serve as the club's required advisor, convincing him that the group promotes female solidarity.
PJ and Josie embrace their reputation as violent delinquents as the club attracts more members, including Brittany and Isabel, with "lessons" in self-defense that consist of the students beating each other up. The club bonds through their chaotic, bloody sessions, and PJ and Josie grow closer to Brittany and Isabel. Meanwhile, Jeff's overprotective best friend and teammate Tim confirms his suspicions that PJ and Josie never went to juvie.
Hazel discovers that her recently divorced mother is sleeping with Jeff, and Josie informs Isabel, who breaks up with Jeff in front of the entire cafeteria. While the club vandalizes Jeff's house, Josie and Isabel almost kiss before a vengeful Hazel blows up Jeff's car with a homemade bomb. Tim warns Josie to end the club, but the members decide to disband before they can be punished for the explosion, and a frustrated PJ lashes out at Hazel. Josie and Isabel have sex, while PJ kisses Brittany, but is disappointed to learn she is straight.
At a pep rally for the school's upcoming football game against longtime rival Huntington High, Tim tricks Hazel into representing the club by fighting the school's top boxer. Despite showing off some of her newly acquired skills, Hazel is badly beaten, as Tim exposes PJ and Josie's lies and their original selfish reasons for founding the club. Isabel turns against Josie, who falls out with PJ, and they are told off by Mr. G, who renounces feminism. The feuding friends are further ostracized at school, while Jeff wins back Isabel.
Josie seeks advice from her and PJ's childhood babysitter Rhodes, who reveals that Huntington tradition involves killing a Rockbridge football player. Josie and PJ reconcile with each other and with Hazel, reuniting the club in an effort to stop Huntington's plans. At the game, they discover pineapple juice has been added to the football field's sprinkler system to kill Jeff, who is deathly allergic to pineapple.
Hazel attempts to distract the crowd with another bomb, which fails to detonate, leading her and PJ to divert attention by making out. Isabel and Brittany rejoin the club in a brutal brawl with the Huntington team, as Josie carries Jeff to safety before the sprinklers go off. With most of the Huntington players dead, Tim realizes the plot to kill Jeff and leads the crowd in celebrating the club for saving him. Josie and Isabel embrace with a kiss, while Hazel's bomb finally explodes.
In April 2021, it was announced that Seligman and Sennott were working withOrion PicturesandBrownstone Productions, withElizabeth Banks, Max Handelman, and Alison Small producing for Brownstone, andAlana Mayoproducing for Orion. It is the third collaboration between Seligman and Sennott after the 2018 short filmShiva Babyand its 2020feature-length adaptation.[6]Whilst promoting that film, Seligman described her next project as a "campyqueerhigh school comedy in the vein ofWet Hot American Summerbut more for aGen-Zqueer audience".[7]
Seligman faced significant difficulties during the processes of pitching, shooting and editingBottoms, the bulk of which were due to the potentially alienating nature of the film's overtly sexual, lesbian premise. She and Sennott received a number of rejections while introducing the concept to various studios, and often were not even permitted to properly pitch their idea to executives. Additionally, several companies declined to feature their products in the film due to its supposedly "offensive" content. Once their project was accepted by Orion, they were nearly unable to find high school campuses in New Orleans that were willing to lend their space; Seligman had to resort to shooting mostly in an abandoned elementary school and a college gymnasium. The initial drafts of the script included scenes of PJ and Josie being sent to a "militaristic boot camp" for "horny girls", where Punkie Johnson's character would've been introduced as head of the camp; however, these scenes were removed due to poor reception at test screenings.[8][9]
Eunice Jera Lee served as costume designer on the film. She took inspiration fromGrease(1978),Ferris Bueller's Day Off(1986),Heathers(1988),Jawbreaker(1999), andBring It On(2000).[10]
On September 12, 2022, it was confirmed byThe New York Timesthat filming had wrapped. Sennott described the film as, "Two girls in a classic American football town who start a fight club under the guise of female empowerment, but it's actually so they can have sex with cheerleaders."[11]
In April 2022, it was announced thatAyo Edebiri,Marshawn Lynch,Ruby Cruz,Havana Rose Liu,Kaia Gerber,Nicholas Galitzine, Miles Fowler,Dagmara DomińczykandPunkie Johnsonwere added to the cast.[12][13]Filming was scheduled to take place inNew Orleansbetween April 18 and May 27, 2022.[14]Seligman has said that she cast Marshawn Lynch at the suggestion of Mayo, who pointed her to his appearance on the Netflix seriesMurderville, the majority of which he had improvised.[15]Seligman also thought that having a "legendary football player" portraying an advisor to queer girls in the film is good representation for "that kind of straight, male character".[16]She and Mayo were "not entirely expecting" Lynch to accept the role when he was sent the script, with Lynch later saying that he did it as "an opportunity to correct [his] wrongs", explaining that his sister had come out as a lesbian to him when he was sixteen and that he had not initially handled this well; he also spoke with his sister about the role before taking it.[16]
The originalfilm scoreforBottomswas composed byCharli XCXandLeo Birenberg. In addition, the film features songs such as "Complicated" byAvril Lavigne, "Pain" byKing Princess, "Total Eclipse of the Heart" byBonnie Tyler, and "Party 4 U" by Charli XCX.[17]
Bottomspremiered atSouth by Southweston March 11, 2023.[18]The film was given alimited theatrical releasein the United States byMetro-Goldwyn-Mayeron August 25, 2023, before expanding to additional screens on September 1, 2023. It was also released theatrically in Canada on the same day.[19]The film was released in the US and Canada onAmazon Prime Videoon September 22.[20]
Warner Bros. Picturesreleased the film in 405 theaters in the United Kingdom and Ireland on November 3, 2023,[21]and in Australia and New Zealand on November 30.[22]
On March 31, 2024,Kino Lorberannounced that they would be releasing the film onBlu-ray.[23]It was then announced the following March that it will be released on May 27, 2025.[24]
Bottomsopened in limited release at ten theaters in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, andAustin, grossing $461,052 in its opening weekend, a per-venue average of $46,105.[25]It was the highest per-screen average on ten or more screens sinceEverything Everywhere All at Once(April 2022).[26][27]The film expanded to 715 theaters in its second weekend, making $3 million, and a total of $3.58 million over the four-day Labor Day frame.[28]Expanding to 1,265 theaters in its third weekend, the film made $2 million, finishing in 10th.[29]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 90% of 221 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Propulsive and over-the-top,Bottomsis an instant high school comedy classic that feels both current and nostalgic."[30]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 74 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[31]Audiences polled byPostTrakgave the film a 93% positive score, with women under 25 giving it 98% score and 96% saying they would definitely recommend it.[32]
Reviewing the film forVariety, following its premiere atSouth by Southwest,Owen Gleibermancommended the direction and screenplay (particularly its characters and humor), stating: "Bottomsis unlike any high-school comedy you've ever seen. It's a satire of victimization, a satire of violence, and a satire of itself. It walks a tightrope between sensitivity and insanity (with a knowing bit of inanity), and it's full of moments that are defiantly what we once used to call incorrect."[33]Valerie Complex ofDeadline Hollywoodadmired the lead performances and Seligman's direction, but found some faults with the screenplay, ultimately concluding: "Bottomsis fun, but with some slight tweaks this could have been an epic exploration of the gray areas of queerness and what it means to stand in the center of that as an adolescent."[34]Referring to the film as the "horniest, bloodiest high school movie of the 21st century" in a highly enthusiastic review forRolling Stone, David Fear lauded every aspect of the film, including its direction, screenplay and cast performances.[35]
FilmmakersKaryn Kusama,David Lowery,Raine Allen-Miller,Laurel ParmetandJuel Taylorall citedBottomsas among their favorite films of 2023.[36]

Orion Releasing, LLC(doing business asOrion Pictures) is an Americanfilm productionanddistributioncompany owned by theAmazon MGM Studiossubsidiary ofAmazon.
It was founded in 1978 asOrion Pictures Corporation, ajoint venturebetweenWarner Bros.and three former senior executives atUnited Artists(UA). The company produced and released films from 1978 through 1999 and was also involved in television production and syndication in the 1980s and early 1990s. It was one of the largest mini-major studios during its early years, when it worked with prominent directors such asWoody Allen,James Cameron,Jonathan Demme, andOliver Stone.[3]Four films distributed by Orion wonAcademy AwardsforBest Picture:Amadeus(1984),Platoon(1986),Dances with Wolves(1990), andThe Silence of the Lambs(1991).[4]
In 1997, Orion was acquired byMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM), which revived the Orion name for television in 2013 and relaunched Orion Pictures a year later. In 2022, Amazon acquired Orion when it acquired MGM.
On February 6, 1978, three executives ofTransamerica(TA)-owned studioUnited Artists(UA)—Arthur B. Krim(chairman),Eric Pleskow(president and chief executive officer), andRobert Benjamin(chairman of the finance committee)—quit their jobs. Krim and Benjamin had headed UA since 1951 and subsequently turned around the then-flailing studio with a number of critical and commercial successes. Change had begun once Transamerica purchased UA in 1967 and, within a decade, a rift formed between Krim and Transamerica chairmanJohn R. Beckettconcerning the studio's operations. Krim suggested spinning off UA into a separate company which was rejected by Beckett.[5]
The last straw came for Pleskow when he refused to collect and deliver the medical records of UA department heads to Transamerica's offices in San Francisco for the sake of confidentiality. The tensions only worsened whenFortunemagazine reported an article on the clash between UA and TA in which Beckett had stated that, if the executives disliked the parent company's treatment of them, they should resign.[5]Krim, Benjamin and Pleskow quit UA on January 13, 1978, followed by the exits of senior vice presidents William Bernstein andMike Medavoythree days later. The week following the resignations, according to the websiteReference for Business, 63 important Hollywood figures took out an advertisement in a trade paper warning Transamerica that it had made a fatal mistake in letting the five men leave. The 'fatal mistake' came true following the box-office disaster ofHeaven's Gate[6]in 1980 which led to Transamerica selling UA toMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM).[7]
That same year, the five men forged a deal withWarner Bros.[8]The executives formed Orion Pictures Company, named afterthe constellationwhich they claimed had five main stars (it actually has seven or eight). The new company intended only to finance projects, giving the filmmakers complete creative autonomy; this ideal had been successfully implemented at United Artists. Orion held a $100 million line of credit and its films would be distributed by theWarner Bros.studio. Orion, however, was contractually given free rein over distribution and advertising as well as the number and type of films the executives chose to invest in.[9]
In late March 1978, Orion signed its first contract, a two-picture deal withJohn Travolta's production company. Contracts with actress and directorBarbra Streisand; actorsJames Caan,Jane Fonda,Peter Sellers,Jon Voight, andBurt Reynolds; directorsFrancis Ford CoppolaandBlake Edwards; writer/directorJohn Milius; singerPeter Frampton; and producerRay Starksoon materialized.[6][10]Orion also developed a co-financing and distribution deal withEMI Films.[6]In its first year, Orion had fifteen films in production and had a dozen more actors, directors and producers lining up to sign with them.[6]
In October 1979, Benjamin died.[11]Orion's first film,A Little Romance,[12]was released in April that year. Later that year, Orion releasedBlake Edwards'10which became a commercial success, the first for Edwards in over a decade (aside from installments ofThe Pink Pantherfranchise). Other films released by Orion over the next two years included a few successes such asCaddyshack(1980) andArthur(1981); critically praised but underperforming films such asThe Great Santini(1979), an adaptation of aPat Conroynovel, andSidney Lumet'sPrince of the City(1981); and pictures by young writer-directors such asPhilip Kaufman'sThe Wanderers(1979) andNicholas Meyer's debutTime After Time(1979); plusMonty Python's Life of Brian(1979) which Orion only distributed in the United States. Out of the 23 films Orion released between April 1979 and December 1981, only a third of them made a profit.[13]Orion executives were conflicted over financing big-budgeted films and passed onRaiders of the Lost Ark(1981) for that reason.[14]
By early 1982, Orion had severed its distribution ties with Warner Bros. As part of the deal, the rights to Orion's films made up to that point were sold to Warner Bros. Orion was now looking to have its own distribution network by acquiring another company with such capabilities. The four partners looked intoAllied ArtistsandEmbassy Pictures[15]before settling onFilmways.[16]Orion subsequently purchased Filmways and reorganized the flailing company. New employees were hired and all of Filmways' non-entertainment assets (Grosset & DunlapandBroadcast Electronics) were sold off.[6][16]
Another result of the merger was that Orion entered television production. Orion's biggest TV hit wasCagney & Lacey, which lasted seven seasons onCBS. In 1983, Orion Pictures introduced art-house divisionOrion Classicswith executives who had previously runUnited Artists Classics.[16][17]
Out of the initial 18 films released by the firm under the name of Orion Pictures Corporation, ten made profits, five just managed to cover their costs, and three suffered losses under $2 million.[6]One such film,Francis Ford Coppola'sThe Cotton Club, was mired in legal troubles and Orion lost $3 million of its investment.[6]"We've had some singles and doubles [but haven't] had any home runs," lamented Krim.[6]In September 1984, Orion distributedAmadeus, which garnered many accolades, winning eightAcademy Awards, includingBest Picture.[6]That year, on April 3, 1984, Orion Pictures launched Orion Entertainment Group, that would consist of four groups, Orion Television, Orion Home Video, Orion Pay Television and Orion Television Syndication, and the new organization would produce and distribute product for television, home video, pay and syndicated markets, withJamie Kellnerserving as president.[18]On October 26, 1984, the company released theJames Cameron-directedscience fiction filmThe Terminatorwhich was well received by critics and audience and led to a franchise involving five further films. However, Orion distributed none of the follow-ups.
For Orion, 1985 was a dismal year. All but two films,Desperately Seeking SusanandCode of Silence, made less than $10 million at the United States box office, including an unsuccessful attempt at aJames Bond-type franchise,Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins.[6]Orion's haphazard distribution channels and unsuccessful advertising campaigns made it impossible to achieve a hit. Another factor was that Orion was about to venture into the video business and stopped selling home-use rights to its films. Furthermore, the production of theRodney DangerfieldcomedyBack to Schoolwas put on hold when a co-producer died, taking the film off of its Christmas 1985 release slate.[19]
In January 1986,Mario KassarandAndrew Vajna, producers of theRambofilms (the first film,First Blood, was distributed by Orion) attempted to buy $55 million worth of the studio's stock through the duo's company,Anabasis. Had they succeeded, Kassar and Vajna would have controlled the board and laid off every executive save for Krim.[19]Warburg Pincus subsequently limited its 20% stake in Orion to 5%; the remaining stock was acquired byViacom International.[6]Viacom hoped to use Orion's product for its pay-TV channelShowtime.[20]Orion expanded into home video distribution with the formation of Orion Home Entertainment Corporation in 1985,[21]which began distributing videos under theOrion Home Videolabel in 1987 (before OHV's formation,HBO Videoand their predecessors, as well as former Orion's partnerWarner Home Video,Vestron VideoandEmbassy Home Entertainment, had been responsible for home media releases of Orion product).[6]
On May 22, 1986, a 6.5% stake in Orion was purchased byMetromedia, a television and communications company controlled by billionaire (and a friend of Krim's)John Kluge. Metromedia had just divested its television station group toRupert Murdoch'sNews Corporation(which would form what is now theFox network). Kluge's investment in Orion came at the right time;Back to Schoolwas a success that earned $90 million at the box office.[6]By March 1987, the studio's fortunes had increased dramatically with a succession of critical and commercial hits, includingPlatoon(which ultimately won a Best Picture Oscar), Woody Allen'sHannah and Her Sisters, and the sports filmHoosiers. Orion's 1986 offerings drew 18 Academy Award nominations, more than any other studio.[6]In 1987, Orion achieved further success withRoboCopandNo Way Out.[6]By this time, Orion's television division had expanded into the lucrative syndicated game show market under the name Century Towers Productions, a reference to Orion's street address. It produced revivals of format inherited fromHeatter-Quigley Productions, owned since the late 1960s by Filmways; this includedThe New Hollywood Squares, which ran from 1986 to 1989, and a revival ofHigh Rollersthat aired in the 1987–88 season. 1987 also saw the arrival of formerCBS/Fox Videoexecutive Len White, who became president and CEO of Orion Home Video, with plans to release its first home video titles in the third or fourth quarter of that year; he reported to Larry Hilford, who joined the home video division two years earlier.[22]
In January 1987, Kluge faced competition with the arrival ofSumner Redstone, whose theater chain,National Amusements, purchased 6.42 percent of Orion's stock. National Amusements later acquired Viacom, increasing their Orion stake to 21%, then 26%. Soon Kluge started buying more Orion stock, touching off a battle with Redstone over control of the company.[23][24]Kluge won on May 20, 1988, when Metromedia took over about 67% of Orion.[6]One analyst toldThe Wall Street Journal: "This amount is probably so small to Kluge it doesn't matter. He probably burns that up in a weekend."[6]
In 1989, Orion suffered from a disastrous slate of films, placing dead last among larger Hollywood studios by box office revenue. Among its biggest flops that year wereGreat Balls of Fire!, a biography ofJerry Lee LewisstarringDennis QuaidandWinona Ryder;She-Devil, a dark comedy starringMeryl StreepandRoseanne Barr;Speed Zone, an action-comedy vehicle forSCTValumniJohn Candy,Joe Flaherty, andEugene Levy; andMiloš Forman's adaptation ofLes Liaisons dangereuses,Valmont, which competed withDangerous Liaisons, also based on the same source material. Test screenings of the"Weird Al" YankoviccomedyUHFwere so strong that Orion had high expectations for it, but it flopped at the box office (though it later developed a cult following on video).[6][25]Also that year, it signed a deal withNelson Entertainmentto distribute titles on videocassette and theatrically.[26][27]
In February 1990, Orion signed a deal withColumbia Pictures Entertainmentin which the much larger studio would pay Orion $175 million to distribute Orion's movies and television programs overseas. Orion had previously licensed its films to individual distributors territory by territory.[6]That same month, Mike Medavoy left Orion and became head ofTri-Star Pictures.[28]
The box-office returns for Orion's 1990 releases were just as dismal, with failures inThe Hot SpotandState of Grace. The only bright spot wasKevin Costner's western epicDances with Wolves,which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture,[29]and grossed $400 million worldwide. A few months later, Orion garnered another winner withThe Silence of the Lambs, but these two films could not make up for years of losses. Only Kluge's continued infusions of cash were enough to keep the company afloat, but soon he had enough.
Kluge first attempted to sell Orion to businessman (and former20th Century Foxowner)Marvin Davis.Sony, which had recently purchasedColumbia Pictures, was also interested.[30]When those talks fell through, Kluge took drastic steps. First, Orion shut down production. Second, Kluge ordered the sale of several projects, such asThe Addams Family(which went toParamount, though the international rights to the film were retained by Orion), in order to accumulate much-needed cash. Finally, in the spring of 1991, Kluge's people took over the company, leading to the departure of Arthur Krim.[31]Orion's financial problems were so severe, that at the 63rd Annual Academy Awards in March 1991, hostBilly Crystalmade reference to Orion's debt in his opening monologue, joking that "Reversal of Fortune[is] about a woman in a coma,Awakenings[is] about a man in a coma; andDances with Wolves[was] released by Orion, a studio in a coma."[32]
It was during this time thatABCstepped in to co-finance and assume production over many of Orion TV's shows it had in production, such asAmerican DetectiveandEqual Justice. After Orion had to shut the television division down, this resulted in projects likeThe Chuck Woolery Show, which was planned to be produced by Orion, instead having to find new production companies (such asGroup W Productionsin the case of Woolery).[33]Gary Nardino, former employee of Orion Television Entertainment, moved on to producing forLorimar Television, taking some of Orion's projects with him, includingBill & Ted's Excellent AdventuresonFox, andHearts are Wild, a co-production withSpelling Television, forCBS; talent deals Orion Television had at the time (withThomas Carter,Robert Townsend, Paul Stajonovich, Clifton Campbell andDeborah Joy Levine) were also taken by Nardino to Lorimar.[34]On November 25, 1991, Orion sold itsHollywood Squaresformat rights toKing World Productionsafter Orion closed down its television division.[35]
On December 11, 1991, Orion filed forChapter 11 bankruptcyprotection.[6]That same month, Orion was in talks withNew Line Cinema, a successful independent film company, to acquire the bankrupt studio. By the following April, Orion and New Line Cinema cancelled their plans on the issue of price.Republic Picturesand the then-newSavoy Picturesalso attempted to buy Orion, but no deal materialized.[36][37]
In February 1992, Bernstein, who was president and chief executive of Orion at that point, resigned from the studio, Bernstein would go on to become executive vice president at Paramount Pictures.[38][39]
At the Academy Awards ceremony, broadcast on March 30, 1992, Crystal made another reference to Orion, this time about its demise:
Take a great studio like Orion: a few years ago Orion releasedPlatoon, it wins Best Picture.Amadeus, Best Picture. Last year, they releasedDances with Wolveswins Best Picture. This yearThe Silence of the Lambsis nominated for Best Picture. And they can't afford to have another hit! But there is good news and bad news. The good news is that Orion was just purchased, and the bad news is it was bought by the House of Representatives.[40]
The Silence of the Lambsswept all five major Academy Awards; however, a majority of key executives, as well as the talent they had deals with, had left the studio. Hollywood observers had doubts that Orion would be resurrected to its former glory.[41]
In May 1992, it was reported that Pleskow was resigning from Orion on July 1 of that year.[42]stating in the New York Times: "There is little for me to do at this point".[43]
On November 5, 1992, Orion reemerged from bankruptcy. Its reorganization plan would allow for Orion to continue producing and releasing films, but financing for the features would be provided by outside sources, with the studio purchasing the distribution rights to them after their completion.[44][45]
Orion's bankruptcy also delayed the release of many films the studio had produced or acquired, among them:Love Field(1992),RoboCop 3(1993),The Dark Half(1993),Blue Sky(1994),Car 54, Where Are You?(1994),Clifford(1994),The Favor(1994), andThere Goes My Baby(1994). Orion started releasing these films after their reorganization.Blue Skywon starJessica Langean Academy Award for Best Actress in 1995.
In August 1994, Orion Home Video partnered withStreamline Picturesin distributing the latter's licensedanimevideo titles to general retailers, which animation historianFred Pattenconsidered a major development in anime's growing popularity in Americanpop culture.[46]
In November 1995, Orion, two other companies controlled by Kluge, and film and TV houseMCEGSterling (producer of theLook Who's Talkingseries) were merged to form the Metromedia International Group.[47]Few of the films released during the four years afterbankruptcy protectionwere successful either critically or commercially.
In 1996, Metromedia acquired production companyMotion Picture Corporation of America, and installed its heads, Brad Krevoy and Steve Stabler, as co-presidents of Orion. Both received a six picture put picture distribution deal as a part of their contracts.[48]
In the years ahead, Orion produced very few films, and primarily released films from other producers, includingLIVE Entertainment.Orion Classics, minus its founders (who had moved toSony Pictures Entertainmentand foundedSony Pictures Classics), continued to acquire popularart-housefilms, such asBoxing Helena(1993), before Metromedia merged the subsidiary withSamuel Goldwyn Entertainmentin 1996.
In July 1997, Metromedia shareholders approved the sale of Orion Pictures (as well as Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment andMotion Picture Corporation of America) toMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM). This led to the withdrawal of 85 employees, including Krevoy and Stabler, while 111 other employees were to be laid off within nine months, leaving 25 of them to work at MGM. Orion Pictures also brought with it a two-thousand film library, ten completed movies and five direct-to-video features for future release[49]and the Krevoy and Stabler movie put picture distribution deal.[48]Krevoy and Stabler retained the right to the Motion Picture Corporation of America name and their three top movies. Metromedia retained Goldwyn Entertainment's Landmark Theatre Group.[49]One Man's Hero(1999) was the last film released by Orion Pictures for 15 years.
MGM kept Orion Pictures intact as a corporation, mostly to avoid its home video distribution agreement withWarner Home Videoand began distributing Orion Pictures films under the Orion Home Video label. MGM acquired the two thirds of the pre-1996PolyGram Filmed Entertainmentlibrary (which included theEpic film library) fromSeagramin 1999 for $250 million, increasing their library holdings to 4,000. The PolyGram libraries were purchased by its Orion Pictures subsidiary so as to avoid its 1990 home video distribution agreement with Warner Home Video.[50]In March 1999, MGM bought out its distribution contract with Warner Home Video for $225 million, effectively ending the distribution problem.[51]
In 2013, Orion returned to television production (after its original TV unit was shut down during its bankruptcy period) with a new syndicatedcourt show,Paternity Court.[52]
The Orion Pictures name, also as Orion Releasing, was extended in fourth quarter 2014 for smaller multi-platform video on demand and limited theatrical distribution. Its name was first seen again on September 10, 2014, in front of the trailer forThe Town That Dreaded Sundownthat was released in October. The label's first release was the Brazilian filmVestido pra Casar.[53]
In September 2015,Entertainment One Filmsrelaunched theMomentum Picturesbanner with an announced deal with Orion Pictures to co-acquire and co-distribute films in the United States and Canada, and selected foreign markets, such as theUnited Kingdom(Momentum's country of origin). The initial films under the deal wereThe Wannabe,Fort TildenandBalls Out.[54]Other films released by Orion Pictures andMomentum PicturesincludePocket ListingandDiablo.[55][56][57]
Starting in September 2016 withBurn Country, Orion Pictures andSamuel Goldwyn Filmspaired in acquiring several films.[58][59][60][61]
Orion Television launched a second court show in the fall of 2017,Couples Court With The Cutlers, which features married couple Keith and Dana Cutler presiding over romantic and domestic disputes.[62]
On September 6, 2017, MGM officially revitalized the Orion Pictures brand as a standalone, US theatrical marketing and distribution arm with the hiring of John Hegeman, who joined fromBlumhouse Tilt(distributor of Orion'sThe Town That Dreaded SundownandThe Belko Experiment) and incidentally got his start at the original Orion in the 1980s. Hegeman would serve as president of the expanded label and report toJonathan Glickman, president of MGM's motion picture group. Under his leadership, the "new" Orion will produce, market and distribute four to six modestly budgeted films a year across genres and platforms, and both wide and limited releases for targeted audiences. Its first release, the young adult romance dramaEvery Day, was released on February 23, 2018.[4][63][64][65]
In May 2018, it was announced thatOrion Classicswould be revived as a multiplatform distribution label, with 8 to 10 films being released per year.[66]

Worldwide Gross
Almost all of Orion's post-1982 releases, as well as most of the AIP and Filmways backlogs and all of the television output originally produced and distributed by Orion Television, now bear the MGM name. However, in most cases, the 1980s Orion logo has been retained or added, in the case of the Filmways and AIP libraries.
Most ancillary rights to Orion's back catalog from the 1978–1982 joint venture period remain with Warner Bros., including such films as10(1979),Caddyshack(1980),Arthur(1981),Excalibur(1981), andPrince of the City(1981). Some post-1982 films originally released by Orion—Lionheart(1987),The Unbearable Lightness of Being(1988), andAmadeus(1984) (the latter two beingSaul Zaentzproductions)—are currently distributed by Warner Bros. as well.HBOalso owns video distribution rights toThree Amigos(1986), as they co-produced the film and owns pay-TV rights. However, MGM owns all other rights and the film's copyright.[citation needed]The Wanderersis owned by the film's producers; however, the copyright is held by MGM/Orion. Orion also retains a controlling interest inThe Cotton Club, although major rights are now withLionsgate, which owns the library of presenting studioZoetrope Corporation.
Woody Allen's filmsA Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy(1982) andZelig(1983) are the only Orion films from the original joint venture period now owned by MGM, as the rights for them remained with Allen, who sold them to MGM in 2000.[79]Orion releases produced by theHemdale Film CorporationandNelson Entertainmentare included in MGM's library as well, and are incorporated into the Orion library. MGM did not acquire the Hemdale films (which includeThe Terminator,Hoosiers, andPlatoon) or the Nelson films (including theBill & Tedfilms) until MGM bought the pre-1996 library of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment (the "Epic library"), which included both companies' libraries, although the television and digital rights to certain Nelson films are now held byParamount Television(the result of a pre-existing deal Nelson had with Viacom), with television syndication handled on behalf of Paramount Television byTrifecta Entertainment & Media.
Many of the film and television holdings ofThe Samuel Goldwyn Companyhave now also been incorporated into the Orion library (with ownership currently held by MGM), and the copyright on some of this material is held by Orion, exceptThe New Adventures of Flippernow carries the MGM Television Entertainment copyright.[citation needed]
MGM still holds distribution rights to the 1980s revival ofHollywood SquaresandHigh Rollersthe company produced, as well as the remnants of the Heatter-Quigley library that was not erased, including all remaining episodes of the originalSquares; they do not own the rights to the format, which is currently owned byCBS Television Distribution, successor-in-interest to King World, who purchased the format rights in 1991 and produced another syndicated revival from 1998 to 2004.
Orion distributed the firstRambo film,First Blood(1982).[80]That film, like the rest of theRambofranchise, is now owned byStudioCanalas a result of purchasing the library of its co-distributor,Carolco Pictures.[81]

Seligman was born on May 3, 1995, inToronto, Ontario, to aJewishfamily.[1]She was raised in aReformAshkenazicommunity in Torontoand attendedNorthern Secondary Schoolthere. Herbat mitzvahceremony was held onMasadainIsrael; the party that followed, held in 2008, was filmmaker-themed.[1][2]She grew up watchingAt the Movies with Ebert & Roeperwanting to "beRoger Ebert."[3]As a teenager, Seligman ran a now-defunct blog calledConfessions of a Teenage Film Buffand contributed film reviews toThe Huffington Post,[4][5]including a review forSpring Breakers, which she wrote at seventeen years old.[1]She studied film atNew York University Tisch School of the Arts, graduating in May 2017.[6][7]Seligman remained in New York after graduating and interned with the production companyAnimal Kingdom.[8]
While atNYU, she made short films includingLonewoods,Void,and her senior thesis film,Shiva Baby. During this time, Seligman also interned at a variety of production studios. She also served on theToronto International Film Festival's select youth committee, where she helped program films for the festival.[9][10]
Her thesis film,Shiva Baby,was selected for2018 South by Southwestfilm festival. At the encouragement of the short film's star,Rachel Sennott, whom she befriended during the audition process, Seligman began developing it into afeature, where Sennott would reprise her lead role.[11][12]The feature-length version ofShiva Babywas set to premiere at2020 South by Southwest, but the premiere was cancelled due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[13]The film eventually premiered at the2020 Toronto International Film Festival.[14]
Shiva Babywas met with critical acclaim. Kristy Puchko ofThe Playlistwrote, "It's astounding this is Seligman's first film, [considering] how masterfully she orchestrates the tension and comedy,"[15]and Dana Piccoli forQueer Media Matterspraised that "while Seligman is still a relative newcomer to the film world, she handlesShiva Babylike an experienced pro."[16]In 2022, the film won theJohn Cassavetes AwardfromFilm Independent, at the time designated for productions with budgets of $500,000 or less.[b][17]
Seligman reunited withRachel Sennottfor her second feature film,Bottoms, ateen sex comedyin which two high school lesbians start a fight club in order to attract their cheerleader crushes. Seligman had the idea for the film while still at NYU, and began working on it with Sennott there.[13]Bottoms was scored by English singer-songwriterCharli XCX.[18]To promoteBottoms, Seligman appeared on the cover ofNew York Magazinewith the films' stars Rachel Sennott andAyo Edebiri. The film headlined theSXSW film festivalon March 11, 2023.[19]Aisha Harris ofNPRpraised the film writing, "Sennott and Seligman strike both a sweet and an abrasive tone that's tricky to pull off, though they do so quite handily."[20]Seligman's inspiration for the film came from high-school comedies such asBring It On,Mean Girls, andGrease.[18]
Seligman's work often focuses on sexual themes, particularly women's relationship to sex. Regarding this choice, she has stated:
Women decode sexual messaging from a young age, from eight years old to twenty-two years old. They have to process what sex means, what it can do for them, what it should do for them, what they're supposed to do for it. Technology, for example with porn or dating sites, has made the sexual messaging more confusing, and I'm interested in how women figure it out.[6]
She has stated that her filmmaking process as a very collaborative experience, and enjoys being able to discuss her work with her actors.[6]
Seligman uses both "she/her" and "they/them" pronouns. She formerly identified asbisexual, but as of 2023 considers herself "justgay".[21]Seligman briefly moved toLos Angelesin 2021, but resides inBushwickas of 2023.[22][13]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
