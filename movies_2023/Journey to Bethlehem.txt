Everything in the telepic, though, is designed to make Villa a likable force, which pushes and pulls Banderas in a number of directions, only some of which play well. Eventually, 'Villa' exposes a dark side in the man, and Banderas forsakes crafting the image of a hero to allow the man’s ambiguity to shine."[33]Banderas was nominated for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movieand theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Filmfor his performance.[34]

ScottofThe New York Timeswrote, "Banderas... can be marvelously subtle and affecting as well as magnetic.

Banderas once described himself as anagnosticin an interview withPeoplemagazine in 2006: "I have to recognize that I am agnostic. I don’t believe in any kind of fundamentalism. I prefer to take life in a different way, with a sense of humor. I try to teach my kids to be open. Whatever they believe is fine with me."[70]He does describe himself close toCatholicspirituality, especially toHoly Week, which he considers a "metaphor for life".[71]He is an officer (mayordomo de trono) of a religious brotherhood in his hometown ofMálagaand travels during Holy Week to take part in theprocessions.[72]Banderas developed his relationship with Catholicism back in 1994 after a spiritual search.[73][74]
"There was a moment in my life in which I separated a bit from the Church. I was searching for a spiritual connection in other places, until in 1994, after my brother had a surgery we were very afraid of, in which we could lose him, I realized I should have not searched for so much, that I had had always that connection with the trascendental in front of my face. It also happened in a way which followed our own traditions, which we shouldn't look for inthe Buddha, as these characters were right there. In my own neighborhood was that way to connect myself to the trascendental through thePassion of the Christ, until concluding inResurrection."
In 2021, he described his religious beliefs and vision of the Holy Week toEl País:[75]
"I live comfortably in the mystery, I'm very doubting, I don't know if agnostic is exactly the word. But I think yes, there is something, although we don't know what is it. TheBig Bang, yes, and before the Big Bang, what? Holy Week has many colors, it's a very strange poliedrum. It is related to faith, popular religion and Andalusian idiosyncrasy. It's just the RomanIdes of March: winter dies and spring is born. The Andalusian version is so colourful and merry because everybody knows the guy will resurrect on Sunday. And there is a happy ending."
Banderas marriedAna Leza[es]in 1987 and divorced her in 1996. He met and began a relationship with American actressMelanie Griffithin 1995 while shootingTwo Much.[6][76]They married on May 14, 1996, in London.

In June 2014, Banderas and Griffith announced they were divorcing "in a loving and friendly manner,"[78]despite "irreconcilable differences."[79]The divorce became official in December 2015.[80]Despite their divorce, Banderas and Griffith remain close friends; his former stepdaughterDakota Johnsonconsiders Banderas part of the family, calling him a "bonus dad."[81][82]As of November 2015, Banderas is dating Nicole Kimpel, a Dutch investment banker.[83]
In 2009, Banderas underwent surgery for a benign tumor in his back.[84]Speaking at theMálaga Film Festivalin March 2017, Banderas revealed he had suffered a heart attack on January 26, 2017, but said it "wasn't serious and hasn't caused any damages." Following that incident, he underwent heart surgery to insert three stents into his arteries.[85]In aFresh Airinterview in September 2019, he recalled it as being life-changing. He said, "It just gave me a perspective of who I was, and it just made the important things [go to] the surface. When I say this, people may just think that I'm crazy, but it's one of the best things that ever happened in my life."[86]
He has invested some of his film earnings inAndalusianproducts, which he promotes in Spain and the US. He owns 50% of a winery inVillalba de Duero, Burgos, Spain, called Anta Banderas, which produces red and rosé wines.[87]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
