It was directed by Alejandra Marquez Abella from a screenplay written byBettina Giloisand re-written byHernán Jiménezand Abella, based on Hernandez's autobiographyReaching for the Stars.
The film was released onAmazon Prime Videoon September 15, 2023.[1]
In the late 1960s and 70s, José is a young boy whose family travels fromMichoacánas migrant workers picking grapes inCalifornia, his parents hoping to buy a house back home after they’ve made enough money. While they are working in the harvest season, José attends school and works in the fields with his family after. His teacher, Ms. Young, notices his potential and visits his parents at home to express her concern over the disruption to his studies by going back and forth as migrant workers. After his father is only paid partial wages for his work, he realizes José’s teacher was right to be concerned and the family decides to stay in California full time.
Years later, José graduates from theUniversity of the Pacificand is hired as an engineer at theLawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Feeling as if he needs to fit in better, he trades in his customized 1963Chevrolet Impalafor a usedMazda RX-7. While signing the paperwork, he meets Adela, whom he asks out. After an intimidating first meeting with her family, they see each other more until they marry. They have five kids and José continues to work successfully at the lab, now instructing the researchers who had previously ignored him.
One day during class, José’s boss offers him a chance to join a team going toRussiato evaluate a shipment ofenriched uraniumtheUnited Statesis looking to purchase forNASA, noting that a trip like that would look really good on an application to the NASA space program. After several rejections, José hand delivers his 12th application in person toFrederick Sturckowwho trains incoming astronauts and is a veteran of theSpace Shuttle program. He makes a positive impression on Sturckow and is accepted into the program shortly thereafter.
José struggles with the training, falling further behind the rest of his class. When he learns of the death of Beto (a cousin and close friend of his), he loses focus and is exhorted by Sturckow to catch up with the rest or he may be dismissed from the program. He later has a conversation with the head trainer,Kalpana Chawla, who describes to him why going to space makes all of their hard work worthwhile, and ends by letting him know she’s been selected as theMission SpecialistforSTS-107onSpace ShuttleColumbia.
As José sits with his family watching the broadcast ofColumbia's re-entry, they are shaken when news comes in thatColumbiadidn’t survive. Nevertheless, José continues on and begins excelling among his classmates at NASA.
In 2008, Sturckow pulls José into a conference room to meet with the selection team, who informs him that he’s been chosen to joinSTS-128as their Mission Specialist. José visits Adela’s restaurant outside the NASA grounds and tells her the news, with his family later watching him at the press conference. He quotes Beto's words to him that it's fitting for a migrant farmworker to go into the unknowns of space. As he enters quarantine in preparation for the mission, Adela visits him with a surprise: his former teacher Ms. Young, who tells him she’s been waiting for this moment for over 30 years, having followed his progress and career, always believing in his enormous potential.
The launch day finally arrives, José is prepared along with the rest of the crew who board the shuttle, and launch into orbit. After main engine cutoff, José looks around at the shuttle cabin and imagines seeing the samemonarch butterflythat landed on his dad’s arm the day their family decided to stay in California, hinting that he had achieved his destiny.
Closing titles note that Mission STS-128 remained on board theInternational Space Stationfor 13 days, and that José had tacos and listened toJosé Alfredo Jiménez’s“El Hijo del Pueblo” while there. José was the first migrant farmworker in space, and still picks grapes with his father today, albeit in his own vineyard: Tierra Luna Cellars inLodi, California.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
