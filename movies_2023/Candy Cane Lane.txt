Candy Cane Lanewas released byAmazon Prime Videoon December 1, 2023.
Corporate marketer Chris Carver makes his own hand-carved decorations for the local neighborhood Christmas decoration competition but has never won, thus being envious of his neighbor Bruce who repeatedly wins withinflatablesand other inexpensivemass marketdecorations. Shortly before Christmas, he is laid off, leading to him desperately competing for the $100,000 grand prize given to the winner by Prism Cable.
Seeking supplies, Chris and his youngest daughter Holly stumble across a mysterious Christmas shop called "Kringle's", filled with beautiful decorations and figurines. He buys a large tree-shapedzoetropebased on"The Twelve Days of Christmas". When presented with the receipt, Chris is urged to sign it by shopkeeper Pepper without reading the fine print. Using the new decoration, the family impresses at the competition.
The next day, the images from the tree are gone and there are seven swans swimming in the family's pool. Chris blames Bruce for the act and returns to Kringle's with Holly, seeking replacements. Meanwhile, Chris's wife Carol is attacked at work by six geese laying and three French hens (wearing Frenchman costumes).
Upon returning to the shop, they meet several living glass figurines in a Christmas village: Pip, Cordelia, Gary, and a group of carolers. They explain that Pepper is an evilChristmas elfwho has tricked Chris into aFaustian bargain, and that they are all previous victims of hers. Chris has to find five golden rings held by the missing images, now alive, before 8 p.m. on Christmas Eve or else he will turn into a figurine as well.
Chris and Holly acquire the first two rings from the two turtledoves and the three French hens. Then he rescues the figurines, taking them home in the village's clock tower, where he shows them to his family.
At Chris's older daughter Joy's track meet, Pepper has the eight maids milking and ten lords leaping attack the family. Despite the chaos, they manage to retrieve the third and fourth rings. Joy, however, becomes upset when her father inadvertently insults a college recruiter, leading her and her brother Nick to accuse him of focusing on Christmas for his own sake and not letting them live their own lives.
Back at home, Chris reveals what is going on, so the family resolves to help. Realizing that Pepper has the fifth ring, they set up a trap for her during the night of the competition, where everyone learns from Prism Cable's news program that the $100,000 reward is actually in taco coupons.
After trapping Pepper and getting her ring,Santa Clausappears to send her back to theNorth Pole. When Chris presents the five rings to her, she taunts him, saying he needs more. As "five golden rings" is said eight times in "The Twelve Days of Christmas", the family realize they need 40 rings.
Pepper then unleashes the remaining decorations (the nine ladies dancing are unseen) on the neighborhood. The Carvers scramble to get the rings, with Santa assisting them. Pepper then cheats by turning the clock tower forward five minutes, prematurely turning Chris into a figurine. The family only manages to get 38 rings, but Santa points out that Chris and Carol's wedding rings, made out of gold, bring the total to 40, turning Chris back to normal. Holly then has the other figurines returned to normal as her Christmas wish. Santa takes Pepper and all the former figurines except for Pip on his sleigh, saying goodbye to the Carvers.
On Christmas morning, the Carvers enjoy their free tacos with Bruce and his family, as Chris made amends with him. Pip then arrives, wishing to not spend Christmas alone, and is welcomed by the family.
One week later in the mid-credits, Pepper is then shown to have been turned into a glass figurine by Santa as punishment where her good behavior will get her back to the reindeer poop-scooping rank. Chris has gained ownership of Pepper's store, now renamed "Chris Kringle's".
Additionally,Pentatonix(Scott Hoying,Kirstin Maldonado,Mitch Grassi,Kevin OlusolaandMatt Sallee) portray thecarolersand also voice them in their glass figurine form.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 46% of 70 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "Candy Cane Lanegets credit for its willingness to get weird, but in most other respects, this Eddie Murphy-led holiday comedy is a dead end."[11]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 47 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[12]
Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film a score of two out of four, writing "Candy Cane Laneis a stunningly uneven film that careens between cornball family drama, slapstick comedy and special-effects-laden gimmickry".[13]James Dyer writing forEmpirescored the film a three out of five saying, "PartIt's A Wonderful Life, partDrag Me To Hell, this unholy concoction of ideas is unlikely to become a seasonal staple, but sift through the nonsense and there’s a surprising amount to enjoy in this bonkers Noel nightmare. In what other film can you hear the phrase, 'This chicken is trippin'', and watch a psychotic elf kick Black Santa in the nuts?".[14]
Owen GleibermanofVarietycriticized Murphy's persona as being too "forced". He further explained: "I wouldn't callCandy Cane Laneone of Murphy's good comedies; it's too long, too jammed together, and beneath it all too Christmas cookie cutter. Yet Murphy inhabits the role of a doting dad who lives for Christmas with reassuring ease". He closed his review writing, "Candy Cane Laneshows you that the Christmas movie as we've known it may be all used up, and that it has now entered its anything-goes surrealist phrase. 'Tis the season to be batty".[15]

Brian Grazer and Ron Howard met in 1982 onNight Shift, with Howard directing and Grazer co-producing. They followed it up by working on 1984'sSplash.[8]
The company was originally founded in November 1985, following the success of the motion pictureSplash. It was originated from a merger of two production companies,Ron Howard's Major H Productions andBrian Grazer's self-titled production company Brian Grazer Productions.[9]The company went public the following year. At first, the company set a deal withTri-Star Picturesto produce feature films and television shows. Imagine granted Tri-Star the right of first refusal to syndicate their off-network shows produced by Imagine. Its offering was sold toAllen & Co.for 1,667,000 units for common stock and warrant it to purchase additional one-third of its stock. The net proceeds were used for development and production of theatrical films, television series, mini-series and made for television movies, although "the company does not presently intend to develop game shows or daytime soap operas." Imagine however has its prospectus having negotiations withParamount Televisionfor a commitment withABCfor a half-hour pilot and five episodes based on the comedy filmGung Ho.[10]
Later the same year, Imagine had a five-year deal withShowtime/The Movie Channel, Inc.and it was able to develop projects for the channelsShowtimeandThe Movie Channel. The agreement would kick-off with 1989 pay television availabilities and include pay-per view exhibition rights to all Imagine-produced films and about 30 motion pictures and "an unspecified number of original products" are also covered by the agreement. "There was the option of developing "long-form dramas" or series as part of the original material to be developed and aired exclusively onShowtime, adding that it could also acquire the syndication rights to these films and original products.[11][12]
In April 1987, producers Philip and Mary Ann Hobel had inked a pact with Imagine Films Entertainment to develop and produce theatrical fare for the company through Hobel Productions, and expected to serve as the eyes and ears of Imagine of New York, and will be backed by a development fund for the purchase of books, plays, scripts and ideas to be developed as film projects, and plans to do both comedy and drama projects with a concentration on contempo themes and issues through a first-look agreement.[13]
On July 29, 1987,Tri-Star Picturesand Imagine Films Entertainment announced the termination of obligations by Imagine to offer Tri-Star distribution rights for all of its television programming and feature films. Imagine, which received more than $1.7 million from Tri-Star, made a $1.3 million payment to Tri-Star, the companies said and advances from Tri-Star were eliminated. The companies said they "intend[ed] to work together on a project-by-project basis" and that projects already in development were not affected. Imagine said the modified agreement "provide[d] it with the flexibility to pursue certain financing and distribution opportunities which were not anticipated when the companies entered the original agreement."[14]
In November 1987, Imagine Films Entertainment announced its plans to move its financial and administrative activities fromNew YorktoLos Angeles, and Neil Braun, who was president and chief-executive officer of the company would not be part of the move, and instead would leave the company and is expected to reveal of his plans shortly and his personal commitments would keep him from making the shift, but he called the consolidation "the right decision for the company" while expressing his disappointment at not being able to stay on.[15]
On December 1, 1987, the company sealed a production and distribution deal withUniversal Picturesvia a "long-term multiple picture agreement" that they distributed Imagine's films for three to five films a year and the agreement "contemplates the possibility" that Universal acquired a 20% share in Imagine[16][8]and it ran through November 1992 for financing 50% of 30 films. Imagine had an IPO in 1986 at $8 for a package of one share and one warrant. Shares rose to $19.25 before falling in the stock market crash in 1987 to $2.25. In the summer of next year, Imagine struck a deal withMCA TVto handle distribution of its television material. MCA and Imagine had a joint television venture which MCA had the exclusive network and home video distribution rights. Imagine retained domestic distribution rights for now and was banking on those rights becoming more valuable in the future as its theatrical and television programs gained exposure. Imagine's television division focused on half-hour comedies, whereas MCA focused on one-hour programs for the networks.[17][18]
In September 1988, Robert Harris who was employee ofMCA, and president ofUniversal Television Groupjoined the company as president of motion pictures and television. Harris said the studio was also taking original feature cable projects withShowtime,HBO,TNT,USAandMTV Network(which includesNickelodeonandVH-1, in addition to projects with on-air networks).[18]

Imagine andCentralretained rights in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively. The Imagine-Central joint venture was separate from MCA's own ongoing exploration of a joint venture with a European company for Europe-based long-form co-production. The company was in discussions with two or three potential partners, but a deal was not expected soon. Its projects required U.S. and UK presales to go forward, although the venture intended to seek U.S. buyers going beyond the three big commercial networks to includeFox, as well as cable networksTNT,USA Network,ShowtimeandHBO. The deal also allowed for theatrical distribution, although such co-productions were not in the planning.[19]
Imagine andSecond Citysigned a joint venture deal in May 1989.

Both MCA/Universal and Imagine agreed to an extension that Universal would handle theatrical distribution, network, foreign and home video rights, whileUniversal Studios Floridahandled the theme park rights to the properties that were proposed by Imagine Family Films.

Because of their weak financial pact renewal with Universal in January 2012, Imagine laid off 5 employees, including production executive Jeremy Steckler.[27]This also moved Imagine from exclusive to afirst-look deal. By 2013, Imagine was considering other funding methods for the company's films including crowdfunding for aFriday Night Lightsfilm.[28]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
