The film is the tenth installment in theSawfilm series, followingSpiral: From the Book of Saw(2021) and serving as a directinterquelset between the filmsSaw(2004) andSaw II(2005).  It starsTobin BellandShawnee Smith, who reprise their roles from the previous films, alongsideSynnøve Macody Lund,Steven Brand,Renata Vaca, andMichael Beach. The film seesJohn Kramer(Bell) travelling toMexicoin hopes that an experimental procedure may cure his terminal cancer. John later discovers that the operation is a scam, prompting him to kidnap those responsible and subject them to his trademark death traps as retribution, with Amanda Young (Smith) acting as his accomplice.
A tenth installment was reported to be in development withTwisted Picturesin April 2021, when Stolberg and Goldfinger, writers for the previous two entries of the series, announced that they had completed the script in December 2021. Greutert, who had directed two other installments of the series and edited six, was also confirmed as the film's director. Filming took place between October 2022 and February 2023 inMexico City.
Saw Xwas theatrically released byLionsgate Filmson September 29, 2023. It grossed $125 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, making it the best-reviewedSawfilm. A sequel,Saw XI, is scheduled for release on September 26, 2025.
John Krameris told he has only months to live due to advancedbrain cancer.  He attends a cancer support group meeting and befriends Henry Kessler, who later claims he has been cured by an experimental Norwegian cancer treatment conducted by a group led by Dr. Finn Pederson. A desperate John contacts the doctor's daughter Cecilia, who refers him to her clinic outsideMexico City.
On arrival in Mexico, John is driven to the clinic and introduced to Cecilia and her team — anesthesiologist Mateo, nurse Valentina, and Dr. Cortez — as well as patients Gabriela and Parker and the caretaker's young son Carlos, with whom he bonds. John goes under for surgery and awakens to Cecilia telling him that he is now cancer-free. Finding a new lease on life, he purchases a gift for Gabriela. However, upon returning to the clinic, he finds it abandoned. He uncovers a video simulating his supposed brain surgery and removes his bandages to find no scar on his head, revealing the entire operation to be a scam.
Deducing that "Dr. Cortez" was his taxi driver Diego in disguise, John kidnaps and interrogates him, then forces him to play a "game" where he must removepipe bombslashed to his arms by cutting through his flesh, which he completes successfully. Meanwhile, Jigsaw's apprenticeAmanda Younghelps him abduct Cecilia and also abducts Mateo, Valentina, and Gabriela. They wake up in the clinic, now subjects in Jigsaw's games.
Valentina is tasked with severing her leg with aGigli sawand extracting enoughbone marrowto trigger a scale and deactivate the trap. She manages to amputate her leg but is unable to collect enough marrow, and a second Gigli saw decapitates her. Cecilia later uses Valentina's intestines as a rope to retrieve her phone and call for help, but Amanda shocks her into submission and confiscates the phone.
Parker breaks into the clinic, demanding his money back. Amanda restrains him while Mateo is forced to drill into his own skull and remove a piece of cerebral tissue to dissolve in a beaker and obtain a key. Although he successfully performs the task, the tissue fails to dissolve in time, and a heated mask closes over his face, killing him. Next, Gabriela is suspended from shackles and subjected toionizing radiation, tasked with freeing herself by using a sledgehammer to break her shackled limbs. She succeeds, but before Amanda can take her to a hospital, Parker forces them at gunpoint to release Cecilia.
Cecilia kills Gabriela by breaking her neck and reveals she called Parker, who is part of the scam, to rescue her. She forces John to chain himself into the trap meant for her. When she hears Carlos outside, she takes the child and chains him opposite John. The trap beginswaterboardingthem with blood. Parker and Cecilia go to retrieve their bag of stolen cash from John's control room but activate a tripwire, sealing them both in the room and freeing John and Carlos. Flashbacks reveal that Diego outed all of the scammers — including Parker and Henry — and that John tricked Cecilia into luring Parker to the facility. Adeadly chemical gasbegins filling the room; the only respite is a ventilation hole large enough for one person's head, forcing Cecilia and Parker to fight each other. Cecilia kills Parker but can only watch as John, Amanda, and Carlos exit the facility, leaving her trapped.
Sometime later, Henry awakens in a dilapidated bathroom[a]with a new trap strapped to his stomach, overseen by John andMark Hoffman.
In April 2021, a tenth film installment to theSawfranchise, titledSaw X, was reported to be in development withTwisted Pictures.[6]Josh Stolbergand Peter Goldfinger, writers for the previous two entries of the series,Jigsaw(2017) andSpiral(2021), confirmed the script was completed in December 2021.[7]ProducersMark BurgandOren Kouleshad planned the story ofSaw Xsince 2018, but plans for the film were put on hold whenMichael Burns, the Vice President ofLionsgate, met withChris RockinBraziland approved hispitchforSpiral. That film's box office under-performance led Burg and Koules to go back to the franchise's roots for its tenth installment and make the story they had planned.[8]In August 2022,Bloody Disgustingreported the film would be directed byKevin Greutert, who edited most of the previous installments, and directedSaw VI(2009) andSaw 3D(2010).[9]Lionsgate and Media Capital Technologies, a specialty finance company, signed an muti-year deal to co-finance a slate of films, which includedSaw X.[10]
In October 2022,Tobin Bellwas confirmed to reprise the role ofJohn Kramer / Jigsaw.[11]Greutert toldEmpirethat Bell is featured in the film more than any other in the series.[12]Bell was also involved in the film's script and post-production, coming up with extra dialogue that was incorporated into the story after shooting concluded.[8]In December 2022,Synnøve Macody Lund,Steven BrandandMichael Beachjoined the cast,[13]along with Renata Vaca,Paulette Hernández,Joshua Okamoto, and Octavio Hinojosa.[14]Shawnee Smithreprises her role asAmanda Young.[15]While never officially announced,Costas Mandylorreturned with acameoof his role asMark Hoffman. Greutert toldEntertainment Weeklythat this cameo was "the mostfan-serviceything" he has done.[5]
On a budget of $13 million,[2]principal photographytook place on location inMexico Cityfrom late October 2022 to February 2023.[13][16][15]The trap designs were more complex than in previous installments, so the filming schedule was split into two parts—three weeks in November and three weeks in January. Greutert toldSFX, "We had to make so many prosthetics and machines, and over Christmas, we spent the entirety of it figuring this stuff out".[17]
At the Midsummer Scream 2023 convention, cinematographer Nick Matthews said they wanted to pay homage to the earlierSawfilms. He explained, "I think for Kevin and I, it was really important that we were able to pay homage to all the early films, we love that the early films are[1.85] (ratio), we love that they're textural, that they're gritty, that there's these really bold, yellow color palettes, and we want to do our work to hearken to that, with pervasive darkness, and really throwing the audience subjectively right into this graphic, gritty world".[18]Production designer Anthony Stabley looked back at the color palette from those mid-2000s films and ensured that all technology, like graphics, seen inSaw Xwould have been available when those films took place.[19]
Most of the gore was done withpractical effects, withCGIonly used for touch-ups.[17]The filmmakers considered the use ofvisual effectstode-ageBell and Smith due to the 17-year gap between their appearances inSaw III(2006), in which their characters both died, andSaw X. However, they decided against it; Greutert expressed his support for this decision, saying that "some of the films that have de-aged their actors, it puts some distance between the character and the audience," feeling that Bell and Smith have some emotionalclose-upsthat should not be altered.[8]
Steve Forner, the film's first assistant editor, had local police called on him during an editing session involving sound design of the custodian's trap.[20]According to Greutert, Forner was working on the scene in his office when the police knocked on the door, citing neighbors' concerns of someone being "tortured to death" inside: "And [Forner] was like, 'Actually, I'm just working on a movie. You can come in and see it if you want.' The cops started laughing. They said, 'We want to, but, you know, you're all right.' It must have been a pretty realistic performance".[21]
On September 9, 2023, Lionsgate announced the return of theSawBlood Drive, a promotional event allowing audiences to donate blood to theAmerican Red Crossin exchange for free tickets to the opening weekend ofSaw X.[22]
On September 13, 2023, a parody of theNicole Kidman AMC Theatres commercialwas published to YouTube and to Lionsgate's social media platforms.[23]It featured a remote-controlledBilly the Puppeton a tricycle[24]in place of Kidman, with some changes to reflect the graphic nature ofSaw. While the parody was met with humorous responses by news outlets, it was pulled from Lionsgate's accounts due to acease and desistorder byAMC Theatres.[25]
Saw Xwas released theatrically in the United States byLionsgate Filmson September 29, 2023.[26]The film was set to be released on October 27, 2023, before Lionsgate announced atSan Diego Comic-Conthat it would be moved up to its current date.[9][27]
Saw Xwas released onPVODin the United States on October 20, 2023, and on DVD, Blu-ray and4K UHDon November 21, 2023. The 4K and Blu-ray discs include over three hours of bonus footage, containing a making-of documentary titledReawakeningand deleted scenes.[28]The film was also released alongside the previous nine films in a 20th anniversary collection Blu-ray box set on March 5, 2024.[29]
Saw Xgrossed $53.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $71.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $125.3 million.[4][3]
In the United States and Canada,Saw Xwas released alongsideThe Creator,PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie, and the wide expansion ofDumb Money, and was projected to gross $15–18 million from 3,262 theaters in its opening weekend.[2]It made $8 million on its first day, including $2 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $18.3 million, finishing second behindPAW Patrol. It was below the average opening weekend of the franchise ($23 million), but higher than recent installmentsSpiral($8.8 million in 2021) andJigsaw($16.6 million in 2017).[30]The film made $8.2 million in its second weekend and $5.7 million in its third, finishing in third and fourth place, respectively.[31][32]
Saw Xtopped the box office in the United Kingdom and Ireland, grossing $2.31 million in the first three days.[33]
The film received positive reviews from critics,[b]who praised Bell's performance, adding that it was the best entry in the franchise since the first film.[38][39]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 81% of 150 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Led by a franchise-best performance by Tobin Bell,Saw Xreinvigorates the series with an installment that has a surprising amount of heart to go with all the gore."[40]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 60 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[41]This made it the highest-rated film of the franchise on both websites, topping the first (50%) and third film (48 out of 100), respectively.[38][42][43]Audiences surveyed byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled atPostTrakgave it an 82% overall positive score, with 62% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[30]
Variety'sOwen Gleibermanwrote thatSaw Xseemed "more like a real movie than many of the films in the series in that there's more talking and less torturing". He was satisfied with that ratio but was concerned if it would "pay off at the box office". He explained, "The torture set pieces in theSawfilms are lavish gifts of baroque horror presented to the audience. They are, quite simply, the reason we came".  He gave particular praise to Tobin Bell, "with his stare of pitiless wisdom".[44]Frank ScheckofThe Hollywood Reporteralso praised Bell for his performance, saying "None of this would work nearly as well without Bell, whose raspy voice and menacinggravitasare so riveting that he makes Jigsaw's oft-repeated declaration 'I'd like to play a game' scary as hell".[45]
Beatrice Loayza calledSaw Xthe "most well-groomedSawfilm to date" in her review forThe New York Times. She continues with: "The story mostly makes sense and Greutert pulls back on the frenetic editing techniques that made the older movies look like the blood and guts equivalent of white noise".[46]Bob Strauss of theSan Francisco Chroniclecalled the film "a well-told tale" and praised its character development and plot twists.[47]Wendy Ide ofThe Observergave three stars out of five despite calling the film "unpleasant"— in her review she insists "that's rather the point."[48]
Helen O'HarafromEmpiregave the film a score of two out of five, positively commenting on the blood and gore, calling it "all present and correct." However, O'Hara criticized the film's main focus on Kramer's vulnerability and human side, adding that it "sits at odds with his awful judgmentalism. Let monsters be monsters."[49]Kyle Turner writing forSlantgave the film a score of two and half out of four, saying "The real disappointment is that Shawnee Smith, who makes a return to the series for the first time sinceSaw VI, is relegated to mostly doing John's dirty work. It's hard out here for a disciple, and Smith hasn't had the chance to show off her chops as an actor sinceSaw III. But inSaw X, we do get crumbs of what makes her so thrilling as a performer, particularly one in the horror genre: She's allid, a tempest of emotion and fully embodied desperation and psychosis."[50]
In December 2023, Lionsgate announced that a sequel,Saw XI, was scheduled to be released on September 27, 2024.[51]Producer Oren Koules stated the upcoming film will possibly be a direct sequel toSaw X.[52]Kevin Greutert will return as the director for the upcoming film.[53]In April 2024, the release date was changed to September 26, 2025, with another Lionsgate film,Never Let Go, taking the previous date.[54]Marcus Dunstanbegan work on the script in December 2023.[55]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
