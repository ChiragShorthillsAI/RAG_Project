Next Goal Winsis a 2023 Americansportscomedy-dramafilm directed byTaika Waititi, who co-wrote the screenplay withIain Morris. It is based on the 2014documentary of the same nameby Mike Brett and Steve Jamison aboutDutch-AmericancoachThomas Rongen's efforts to lead theAmerican Samoa national football team, considered one of the weakest association football teams in the world, toqualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The film starsMichael Fassbenderas Rongen, alongsideOscar Kightley, Kaimana,David Fane,Rachel House,Beulah Koale,Will Arnett, andElisabeth Moss.
Next Goal Winspremiered at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 10, 2023, and was released in the United States on November 17, 2023, bySearchlight Pictures.[4][5]
In 2001, theAmerican Samoa national football teamsuffers a0–31 defeatagainstAustralia. Since then, the team goes through a long period without any notable victories. After yet another humiliating defeat at the2011 Pacific Games, Tavita Taumua, head of the nation's football federation, announces that he will hire a new coach. Meanwhile in the United States, football coachThomas Rongenhas just been sacked by theAmerican Soccer Federation. He is then offered to become the new coach for American Samoa. Because he doesn't want to live without a job, Rongen reluctantly accepts the offer. When Rongen begins his new job, he is frustrated by the players' lack of football skill and the islands' limited facilities. He also dislikes Jaiyah — a transgender (fa'afafine) defender — because he thinks Jaiyah lacks discipline and focus. Eventually, the two are involved in a minor brawl after Rongen taunts Jaiyah by calling her by her legal birth name.
Jaiyah later visits Rongen's house to apologize and the two agree to forgive each other. With Jaiyah's help, Rongen travels around the islands to recruit new faces for the squad. Rongen changes his training approach and begins to show more respect toward the American Samoan players and staff. Although they lack football skill and have to work at multiple jobs, they are still passionate enough to do everything to support the national team. Four weeks after Rongen's first arrival in American Samoa, the team are finally ready to play their first competitive match under Rongen against Tonga in a FIFA World Cup qualification match. Rongen chooses Jaiyah as the captain for this match. American Samoa start the match well. However, the pressure begins to affect the American Samoa players after Rongen repeatedly yells, and throws a tantrum in front of his players. Eventually, Tonga are able to score first after intercepting a misplaced American Samoan pass. The first half ends with Tonga leading 1-0.
During the half-time break in the dressing room, Rongen angrily calls the players useless and accuses them of not trying to play seriously. Rongen later announces his resignation from the head coach position and plans to leave the stadium immediately. Before Rongen is able to leave the stadium, Taumua convinces Rongen to rethink his decision. Eventually, Rongen changes his mind and returns to the dressing room. Rongen apologizes to his players and tells his players to play as they want without needing to worry about the result. Rongen also admits that two years prior, he lost his daughter in an accident. That event affected Rongen so deeply that he continues to feel guilty and often shows emotional outbursts throughout his managerial career. Feeling touched and motivated by Rongen's speech, the American Samoa players play a lot better in the second half. Eventually, they are able to score the equalizing goal. However, when the players and staffs are celebrating the goal, Taumua suddenly faints due to heatstroke.
Taumua later wakes up when the match has ended. His son, Daru, who also played that match, later explains that when his father was still unconscious, American Samoa were able to score another goal and ended the match in 2-1 victory. During a gathering with American Samoan players and staffs, Rongen announces that he will leave his position as American Samoa head coach because he wants to take an extended break from football. Although initially shocked, Taumua accepts Rongen's decision and wishes him well for the future. The epilogue covers what happened after the events of the film. After defeating Tonga 2-1 in 2011, American Samoa has never again been at the bottom of the world rankings. Rongen went on to be the Chief Scout for the United States national team, before working as commentator atCBS Sports. Jaiyah was the first openly transgender athlete to compete in a World Cup Qualifier, and later became FIFA ambassador for equality.

Small had written his first full-length play,Horizons, about the Samoan experience in New Zealand, and invited Kightley to perform in it in his first acting role, along with Muagututi'a and Ifopo.Horizonsopened the Performing Arts Theatre on 19 October 1991 in a production directed by Christina Stachurski.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
