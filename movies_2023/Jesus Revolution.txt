Based on the autobiographical book of the same name co-written byGreg Laurie, the film follows the teenage Laurie (Joel Courtney), ChristianhippieLonnie Frisbee(Jonathan Roumie), and pastorChuck Smith(Kelsey Grammer) as they take part in theJesus movementin California during the late 1960s.Anna Grace BarlowandKimberly Williams-Paisleyalso star.
The film was theatrically released in the United States byLionsgateon February 24, 2023.  Although it received mixed reviews from critics, the film grossed $54 million worldwide against a production budget of $15 million.
In 1968, the stern yet respectedSouthern CaliforniapastorChuck Smithrealizes his church,Calvary Chapel, is slowly dying and he is unable to connect with the younger, live-freehippiegeneration of teens and young adults. His daughter, Janette, gives a ride to a colorful hippie hitchhiker namedLonnie Frisbee, who says he is traveling around and telling people about theministry of Jesus. Smith, at first suspicious of Frisbee, eventually warms up to him and welcomes him to his church and his home. To the dismay of Chuck and his wife, more hippies soon arrive at the Smith house. After Lonnie introduces Chuck to a newly-formed band calledLove Song, and the group performs a song in his living room, Chuck develops a new attitude toward the young people. He and Lonnie end up joining forces and start a successful movement to evangelize hippies and other youth.
Meanwhile, high-school studentGreg Laurieruns away from hisJunior Reserve Officers' Training Corpsclass and joins a girl named Cathe and her friends, who "turn him on" to drugs at aJanis Joplinconcert. At the concert,Timothy Learyis seen preaching the value ofLSDfor self-discovery. However, Greg sees that various hippies are dangerously irresponsible; at one point, Cathe's sister gets sick from a drug overdose. When watching a movie, Cathe gets angry at Greg for not caring about the dangers of drugs and ends their friendship. They reconcile the next day, with Cathe telling Greg she found Lonnie's church and he should attend with her. After getting baptized atPirates Cove, Greg and Cathe find solace at Smith's and Frisbee's church, though Cathe's establishment and conservative parents are not enthusiastic about Greg.
The ministry explodes in popularity, being seen as a "Jesus Revolution" and the young attendees as "Jesus freaks". Christian conversions and group baptisms in the Pacific Ocean follow as membership at Calvary Chapel grows to such proportions that services have to be held outside under a large tent.Timemagazine does a cover story on the movement in 1971, and both Lonnie and Chuck are featured onKathryn Kuhlman'sweekly television show.[5]Lonnie and his wife, Connie, start having difficulties in their marriage, and Lonnie believes Chuck is trying to diminish his contribution to their joint ministry. Lonnie eventually leaves for Florida with Connie after increasing disagreement with Chuck. Before Lonnie's departure, Greg offers to take over a ministry branch of Calvary chapel inRiverside. He eventually marries Cathe and becomes a pastor of his own church, which becomesHarvest Fellowship. At the end of the film, the credits reveal that Smith and Frisbee reconciled and both are remembered as founders of and leaders in the widespreadJesus movementthat started at Calvary Chapel.

As a mainstream Christian film, it focuses on a feel-good faith message, which is more than welcome amid today's culture."[38]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
