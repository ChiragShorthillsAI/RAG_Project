In 1987El Paso, Aristotle "Ari" Mendoza is a surly teenager frustrated by his parents' refusal to tell him about his incarcerated brother Bernardo. At a public pool, Ari meets unconventional fellow Mexican-American Dante Quintana, who teaches him how to swim. The two boys become fast friends despite their differences. Dante's well-off parents invite Ari on a camping trip, where both he and Dante appreciate the vastness of the night sky. During a rainy evening near the end of the summer, Dante tells Ari that the Quintanas will be moving toChicagofor the following school year due to his father's professor job. Dante gets distracted by a baby bird and is nearly hit by a car; Ari gets injured pushing him out of the way.
In the year that follows, Ari adopts a dog, is gifted a truck by his parents, and slowly begins to fit in at school. He begins fooling around with a female classmate, Elena. Meanwhile, Dante's letters speak of burgeoninghomosexuality. Ari finally learns what caused Bernardo's imprisonment – he had killed atransprostitute as a teenager.
The Quintanas return at the beginning of the next summer. Ari and Dante drive out to the desert, where Dante asks Ari to kiss him. The kiss makes Ari uncomfortable and he insults Dante. Ari's Tia Ophelia also passes away, and he learns that she had been disavowed by most of the extended family for living with a female partner.
Dante is hospitalized after some homophobic boys attacked him in an alley after seeing him with his boyfriend Daniel. A furious Ari tracks down Daniel, then one of the perpetrators, and brutally attacks the latter. A discussion with his parents causes Ari to realize that he is in love with Dante. The two boys drive out to the desert, where Ari confesses his feelings. The film ends with them lying in the back of Ari's truck, holding hands.

They had a Catholic wedding ceremony at theSaint-Germain l'AuxerroisChurch in Paris on July 7, 2007.[120]On November 17, 2010, Longoria filed for divorce from Parker in Los Angeles, citing "irreconcilable differences".[121]In the divorce petition, she requested that her family name be restored, and soughtspousal supportfrom Parker.[122]The couple had aprenuptial agreementsigned in June 2007, a month before their wedding, and amended two years later in June 2009.[123]
Longoria told her friendMario Lopezthat she had discovered hundreds of text messages from another woman on her husband's phone.[124]Extraidentified the other woman as Erin Barry, then-wife ofBrent Barry, Parker's former teammate, and revealed that the Barrys were also divorcing.[125]In light of her divorce, Longoria canceled her scheduled appearance at the 2010American Music Awards.[124]On November 19, 2010, Parker filed for divorce from Longoria inBexar County, Texas,[126]on the grounds of "discord or conflict of personalities", establishing a legal battle over where the case would be heard. Unlike Longoria's divorce petition, Parker's did not mention a prenuptial agreement and claimed that the parties would "enter into an agreement for the division of their estate".[127]The divorce was finalized in Texas on January 28, 2011, the same day Longoria's lawyer filed papers to dismiss her Los Angeles petition. Longoria later said, "I didn't realize it at the time with Tony, but I had become my own version of a desperate housewife."[128]
On December 13, 2015, Longoria reported her engagement to Mexican businessman José Antonio "Pepe" Bastón Patiño,[129]then the president ofTelevisa, the largest media company in Latin America.[130][131]They met on a blind date arranged by a mutual friend inMexico City; at the time, Bastón did not know who Longoria was, and initially declined the invitation to meet her because of his busy schedule.[132]They were married in Mexico on May 21, 2016.[133][134]
On December 19, 2017, it was reported that Longoria was pregnant with her first child.[135]She gave birth to a son in 2018.[136][137][138]
In November 2024 she revealed that she moved out of the United States with her family and they split their time betweenMexicoandSpain.[139]
According to research done in 2010 byHarvardprofessor andFaces of AmericahostHenry Louis Gates Jr., Longoria's oldest identifiable Spanish immigrant ancestor is her ninth great-grandfather, Lorenzo Suárez de Longoria (b.Oviedo, 1592), who was a colonist of theViceroyalty of New Spain(modern-day Mexico) in 1603. His family was based in a small village called Llongoria,Belmonte de Miranda, Asturias, Spain.Longoriais the Castillanized form of thisAsturian-languagesurname.
In 1767, her seventh great-grandfather received almost 4,000 acres (16 km2) of land along theRio Grandein a land grant from KingCharles III of Spain. The family retained this land for more than a century. After the US-Mexican border was moved southwards in the aftermath of theMexican–American War, the land ended up on the American side of the border. Her family had to deal with the influx of United States settlers following the Mexican–American War and theAmerican Civil War.[140]
According toDNA testing, Longoria's overall genetic ancestry is 70% European, 27%Indigenous American, and 3%African.[141]A computer analysis of the DNA results of Gates's dozen guests showed that Longoria has the same genetichaplogroupas cellistYo-Yo Ma, who is of Chinese heritage.[141]As women have two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, Longoria did not inherit her father'sY-DNA, but she did inherit her mother'smitochondrial DNA(genetic information passed from mother to child). Longoria's mtDNA belongs to theHaplogroup A2, making her a direct descendant of a Native American woman, aMayanfrom the territory of Mexico long before it was Mexico. Her ancestors include many other Maya on both sides of her family.[142][143]
Longoria identifies as a "Texican"—a Mexican-American Texan.[142]
Longoria has over 60 credits to her name within film and television.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
