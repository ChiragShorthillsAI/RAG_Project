Big George Foreman: The Miraculous Story of the Once and Future Heavyweight Champion of the World(or simplyBig George Foreman)[4][a]is a 2023 Americanbiographicalsportsdrama filmon the life of world heavyweight boxing championGeorge Foreman, played byKhris Davis. It was directed byGeorge Tillman Jr.and also stars Jasmine Mathews,John Magaro, Sullivan Jones,Lawrence Gilliard Jr.,Sonja SohnandForest Whitaker.
Development onBig George Foremanbegan in 2021 and after several production delays, filming took place on a budget of $32 million from February to March 2022 in New Orleans. The film was released theatrically bySony Pictures Releasingon April 28, 2023, and grossed $6 million.
A youngGeorge Foremanlives in poverty inHouston, Texaswith his siblings and his religious mother Nancy. Foreman, however, is riddled with anger issues and violent outbursts. As a young adult, Foreman barely evades arrest for mugging and decides to join theJob Corpsas a last-ditch effort to turn his life around. There, he befriends his roommate Desmond Baker, though his violent outbursts nearly get him expelled. However, the Job Corps' chairman Doc Broadus, a boxing trainer, encourages Foreman to take up boxing and channel his rage into the sport instead of fighting.
Foreman proves to be gifted in the sport and after one year of boxing, he wins the gold medal for the United States againstJonas Čepulisat the1968 Summer Olympics. He moves toOakland, Californiato train, where former champions Dick Sadler andArchie Moorejoin his team as trainers, and he meets journalist Paula, whom he starts a relationship with and eventually marries. Doc, Paula and Desmond are by his side as Foreman's career flourishes, ultimately winning afightagainstJoe Frazierin 1973 and becoming the heavyweight champion. Following his win, Foreman hires Desmond to handle his finances. Foreman's career enables him to live lavishly, however he regularly cheats on Paula with other women and he is dismissive over his mother's attribution of his successes as blessings from God.
Foreman is heavily taunted byMuhammad Ali, whom he fights atThe Rumble in the Junglein 1974, where he loses due to Ali'srope-a-dopestrategy. Foreman fires Sadler and Moore, and Paula divorces Foreman due to his infidelity. Following an embarrassing Foreman vs. Five match where he is further mocked by Ali, he is called to the hospital where his sister Mary's newborn baby is in poor health. Witnessing his family praying for the baby, Foreman goes outside and angrily prays to God for a sign, offering himself instead of the baby's life. The baby is miraculously saved, and Mary names her son after her brother.
After losing toJimmy Youngin 1977, Foreman suffers fromheatstrokeand collapses from exhaustion, having anear-death experiencewhere he finds himself in a place of nothingness and says that he finally believes before waking up. He becomes a devout Christian and disavows boxing to become a full-time preacher, much to the delight of Nancy and the disappointment of Doc. He makes amends with Ali and Paula for his past behavior towards them. At church, he meets and pursues a relationship with fellow believer Mary Joan Martelly.
Years later, Foreman has married Mary Joan and started a family with her. He is a preacher at theChurch of the Lord Jesus Christ, and opened a youth community center to help troubled youth. However, in 1985, he realizes the center is in danger of being closed down after finding out he is in debt due to Desmond mishandling his funds. Nancy tells him that despite losing everything, all he needs is already inside him, and he decides to forgive Desmond after confronting him.
Foreman's attempts to capitalize on his earlier fame is not enough to save the center. He reluctantly decides to return to boxing to earn money, and with Mary Joan and Doc's encouragement, he trains to get back in shape and decides to start his career again from the bottom. Rejecting his prior rage for a more positive outlook, Foreman manages to win several fights and enters amatchagainstEvander Holyfield. Although he loses to Holyfield, the payments from the fight - as well as a profitable deal involvinggrills- are enough to pay his debts and reopen the center. He works his way up to amatchagainst reigning championMichael Moorer, which he wins and regains his title as heavyweight champion of the world. Foreman reflects that he had to be knocked down to the bottom to realize everything he was searching for was already there.
An epilogue shares that Foreman had become close friends with Ali; Doc was inducted in the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1998; and Foreman continues to preach at his church and run his youth center in Houston.

George Tillman Jr.(born January 26, 1969) is an American filmmaker.[1]
Tillman directed the filmsSoul Food(1997) andMen of Honor(2000). He is also the producer ofSoul Food: The Serieson television and the four films in theBarbershopseries:Barbershop,Barbershop 2: Back in Business,Beauty ShopandBarbershop: The Next Cut.

Tillman was nominated for theBlack Film Awardfor Best Director forSoul Food(1997). Tillman was also nominated for theBlack Reel Awardfor Best Director and Best Screenplay forNotorious(2009).
Tillman was born inMilwaukee, Wisconsin. His father, George Tillman, worked at theAmerican Motorsplant inKenosha, Wisconsin, and his mother was a secretary.[3]Throughout his early childhood, Tillman would borrow his father's8mm cameraand would start to shoot things with Milwaukee'sPublic-access televisioncable TV channel.[3]By age eight, Tillman got his hands on his very first television script,All My Children, and wrote his first soap opera as well as his first five-minute show. Tillman recalled, years later, to an interviewer in regard to receiving theAll My Children's script," I told them about a certain plot change that I wanted and I thought I could help the characters out…That was the beginning for me, the writing."[3]
In 1975, Tillman became inspired to create his own films after seeing the film,Cooley High.[3]To Tillman,Cooley Highspoke to the African American audience in both tears and laughter, and Tillman decided he wanted to contribute to that medium, but did not necessarily know if he wanted to become an actor, writer or director. In 1973, when Tillman watchedFive on the Black Hand SideandClaudinein 1974, he felt empowered and knew he wanted to become a filmmaker.[3]"Those were the films that made me realize that African American films- this is before they started calling some films of that eraBlack exploitation films-spoke for us, and I wanted to be involved with that."[3]
Tillman went toJohn Marshall High Schoolin Milwaukee[4]and he took Mass Communications Magnet Classes. As a teenager, Tillman made amateur videos and createdSplice of Life, which was a program for a local Public-access television.[5]After high school, Tillman attendedColumbia Collegein Chicago and majored in Film and Video. Tillman decided to move to Chicago because he thought a lot was happening there creatively. "There is a lot of theater there, and there are a lot of things happening in Chicago that I wanted to be a part of, so that's where I went tofilm school," according to Tillman.[3]While in film school, he created a 30-minute short,Paula, which was a story of a 17-year-old, single African American mother who works in adinerand motivates the people around her.Paula's success attributed to numerous awards including the Black Filmmaker's Hall of Fame Award "George Tillman Jr.".[6]and winning the Midwest Regional, Dramatic Category, of theAcademy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences' 19th AnnualStudent Academy Awardcompetition (1992).[7]In 1991, Tillman graduated from Columbia College and became a part of a directing and producing partnership with his college friend,Robert Teitel. Together, they created Menagerie Films. During that time, Tillman supported himself by being aproduction assistant.[5]He helped work on various commercials, but he always knew he wanted to direct. "Usually, I was the first guy on the set and the last guy to leave—eighteen hours of hard work. And I just felt like if I want to direct, why am I doing this?"[3]Tillman's only experience of being close to a director was made was when he worked on the film,Mo' Money. The writer ofMo' Money,Damon Wayanstold the union that he wanted more African Americans to be a part of the crew, which is the major reason why Tillman got hired. Tillman was aset dresserand was able to see how they made the film. At that point, Tillman realized that if he wanted to direct he had to write his own script to make everything happen. "It was going to be a long road from being a PA (production's assistant) to a director."[3]
Tillman began to write his script forScenes for the Soul, and sent the script toNew Line, but they passed on it. Initially, thebudgetto produceScenes for the Soulwas a million dollars, but Tillman and his partner, Tietel, could not raise a million. The amount they had raised was $150,000 and that was over a period of two years.[3]Tillman had to resort to his film short,Paula, and decided to have a screening. He invited investors to come donate from anything to $500 to $5,000. By the end of the screening, Tillman and Tietel raised $130,000 and with that, started shooting.[3]
In 1994, Tillman directed and wrote his ownfeature-length film,Scenes for the Soul, which was shot in Chicago. Tillman had thirty days to shoot the film and on top of that, work with a lot of actors who never acted before. InScenes for the Soul, Tillman intertwines three stories based on the day in the life of a diverse group of African American characters.[5]In 1995, Tillman finished editing the film. Upon completion, Tillman went to Hollywood with the copy ofScenes for the Souland a few hundred dollars. Tillman was able to sell his film toGeorge JacksonandDoug McHenrywho bought it forSavoy Picturesfor $1,000,000. However, Savoy Pictures went bankrupt before the film went out in theaters.[citation needed]
Tillman, disappointed that his film did not make it to screen, went to Chicago and wrote the screenplay toSoul Food. Tillman told theChicago Tribune, "I wanted to make a movie about a black family inMiddle America. I wanted to make a film where everyone can look at them and say, 'this is my family.'"[8]When Tillman finished his screenplay, he returned to Hollywood. Tillman made sure to focus on female characters and tell a humble story about the importance of family.
When it was time for Tillman's agents to sell the script, they marketed it as an independently produced and low-budget project and asked the musician,Kenneth Edmonds, if he would want to contribute and record a soundtrack album. At the same time of requesting his musical talents, Edmonds and his wife/business partner,Tracey Edmonds, had recently formed a television and film development company.[5]Both Kenneth and Tracey Edmonds loved Tillman's screenplay so much that they decide to makeSoul Foodtheir company's first production. Edmonds stated that "I read the script and just immediately went crazy over it. The story was so great and the characters were so real."[9]
The Edmonds' were able to negotiate with20th Century Foxto underwrite the film for $6.5 million.[5]In the beginning, 20th Century Fox wanted to have a more experienced director, but the studio changed their decision once they viewed some of Tillman's past work. In October 1996, the filming ofSoul Foodbegan to commence as Kenneth Edmonds served as the executive producer, and both Tracey Edmonds and Robert Teitel were the producers. Originally, 20th Century Fox would have wanted to have more pre-production work and start the actual filming sometime during 1997, but the leading actresses—Vivica A. Fox,Vanessa L. Williams, andNia Long- had other obligations they had to attend to, which made them unavailable for the next year.[5]Tracey Edmonds was concerned about not having the same cast, so the production settled on "a schedule to accommodate everybody. We had only 38 days to shoot the movie and could not go a day over that."[9]Due to Tillman's persistence,Soul Food's location took place in Chicago.
Tillman was pleased with the Edmonds' efforts in the film's production, stating "I was able to bounce a lot of ideas off of them. They were there every day to see what was going on, but they didn't interfere with what I was doing. They let me make the film."[10]
On November 6, 1996, the production ofSoul Foodbegan on a thirty-day schedule. Tillman finished the film on schedule because he already had so much of the big ideas worked out in advance. Tillman told Murray during an interview, "I knew all the shots. I knew the locations…It was pretty much based on my experiences, so it wasn't hard for me."[10]
Soul Foodis originated from Tillman's passion to make a motivating and straight from the heart story about a modern African American family. It is based around three sisters that live in Chicago—Maxine (Vivica A. Fox), a full-time house wife and mother; Teri (Vanessa L. Williams), a strong willedattorneywho pays little to no attention to her own personal life; and Bird (Nia Long), a hairdresser that is married to an ex-convict.[5]When find out their mother is put in a hospital and their traditional bigSunday dinneris put on pause, the sisters struggle to keep their family together. Tillman was able to incorporate a lasting impression on the audience while touching on the big ideas of family tradition and bonds. According toTy BurrofEntertainment Weeklyin referencingSoul Food, "George Tillman Jr. writes and directs with homespun style and a minimum of flash, reminding us that behind a lot of clichés lie simple truths."[11]
In September 1997,Soul Foodreached theaters and earned $11 million during its first weekend.[5]$14 million was earned by the end of its first week, which validated Tillman's success because the film received twice the amount it originally cost to make.[5]Tillman later told Murray, "the shows were sold out, people were laughing, crying, it was just incredible."[10]The grand total fromSoul Food's release was $43 million and it also thrived in video sales. Initially, it was hoped thatSoul Foodwould be able to attract white moviegoers, especially after all the success from the first week, but it did not work out that way. After learning that only 12 percent of the film's ticket buyers were white,[5]Tillman stated "I do feel sometimes that white audiences are still not coming to black films as much as I would like. I think we're still working on that. But I'm really comfortable with where the film ended up."[12]However, even with the lack of white supporters, it proved that African American audiences are able to make a film a commercial success. According toJack Trout, president of Trout & Partners, in regard to black audiences, "this segment is really sizable, and Hollywood is just starting to recognize that."[5]
Due toSoul Food's astonishing success, Tillman and Teitel signed a two-year deal with 20th Century Fox and changed their production company's name from Menagerie Films to State Street Pictures, which was their way of paying tribute to the early film years taken place in Chicago.[8]
Tillman received offers to start a new project starringSteve Martin, and to create biographical films based on African American figures such asDorothy Dandridge,Marvin Gaye, andRichard Pryor.[5]Tillman told Murray in an interview, "I love Marvin Gaye..there's something about him and his struggle that I think will make a great film. It's so interesting to see how someone was so very talented and at the same time so very insecure."[10]In regard to Tillman's next big upcoming film, he is going to base a film on the heroic story ofCarl M. Brashear—theU. S. Navy's first African American master deep sear diver. It is a project that Tillman envisions to be similar to popular classics such asAn Officer and a GentlemanandGlory.[5]Tillman told Painter, "I love characters people can identify with and relate to—characters that go through struggles we can learn from in our everyday lives. I feel that with a lot of films today, we're getting away from that."[12]
Tillman's next big hit was his film,Men of Honor, starringRobert De Niro, andCuba Gooding Jr.Tillman was inspired to do this film after seeingF. Gary GrayinThe Negotiator(1998) because he realized there were little to no opportunities for African American directors to work with big time stars and he wanted to change that.[3]When Tillman first got his hands on the script while he was editingSoul Food, he was very impressed by it. "I think a great script is when you have a great other world—a world that other people can explore and other people don't know about—and that script had that."[3]
It was Tillman's first time experience being an African American director "working in a white film world."[3]When working with De Niro and Gooding, Tillman felt a bit intimidated because he knew both were big stars. He knew De Niro could take up to fifty takes and knew from his research that he looks to the director to possess all the answers.[3]"I remember I called him one day and I said, 'Bob, I wanna know how you like to work on a set because I wanna make it easy for you.' And he told me, 'I like what you did withSoul Food, you won't have any problems with me,'" according to Tillman.[3]In regard to Gooding, he knew that he always had to know the back-story to his character. Tillman enjoyed what Gooding presented in his first film,Boyz n the Hood, and wanted to incorporate that persona. Tillman really had to do his research on both actors in order to achieve the direction he was going for in the film. "It all depends on a person, on an actor, and it's my job to figure those things out."[3]
Tillman's transition betweenSoul FoodandMen of Honorwas challenging. Tillman was not used to all thevisual effectsthatMen of Honorpossessed. He also had a problem dealing with the crew because he felt that he had to prove himself. "Right away you have to let everyone know that you know what you're doing. That has to be done right away," Tillman said.[3]The second hardest part for Tillman was shooting everything in a specific number of days. "There were times when I was shooting four and five scenes a day, because they try to put so much in the schedule."[3]Tillman knew there was a lot to be done especially since the film cost $32 million to produce.[3]Tillman also had to take into account of shooting under water and on top of the water. However, Tillman prevailed through all the obstacles came out proud with the overall product.
On November 10, 2000,Men of Honorwas released in theaters.[8]Men of Honorturned out to be a success especially oversees. The film generated $85 million.[3]
While Tillman was editingMen of Honor, his producing partner Robert Teitel presented him with theBarbershopscript, written by Mark Brown.[3]Both Tillman and Teitel instantly knew thatBarbershopwas going to be comical yet hit an emotional chord with the audience.BarbershopstarsIce Cube,Anthony Anderson, andCedric the Entertainer, and it is based on the social life of a South Side of Chicago Barbershop. The film also has three original songs by the famous R&B singer, Sherod Lindsey.
Tillman and Teitel took the script to Twentieth Century Fox, but they failed to pass it because they were not satisfied with the script. The same was said withFox 2000andFox Searchlight. A bit discouraged, the two went toMGMdue to one of the executive ofMen of Honor, Alex Gardner, and they bought it.[3]
In 2001,Barbershopbegan filming in Chicago. The film was located in theSouth Chicagocommunity area and what was once a laundromat, was now the set for the barbershop. In comparison toSoul Food, which was made in 1997, Tillman still strived to show African Americans in a more positive outlook.
In regard to marketing the film, MGM spent $12 million in marketing alone because the company knew how important and effective it would be. According to Tillman, "if a studio get behind an African American film, which has universal themes, and markets it like any other movie, you can make a lot of money."[3]Both Tillman and Robert made sure to be involved with the marketing scheme because they wanted to make sure that the film was delivered as a heartfelt yet comical piece.
On September 13, 2002,Barbershopwas released in theaters and made a grand total of $77, 063, 924.[3]
Tillman directed the 2015 romantic dramaThe Longest Ride, based onNicholas Sparks'2013 novel of the same name.
More recently, his production company State Street Pictures, signed a first look deal with Sony Pictures Television.[13]
Tillman is married to actress Marcia Wright and has one child.[5]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
