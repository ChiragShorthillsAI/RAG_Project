AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.(doing business asAMC Theatres, originally an abbreviation forAmerican Multi-Cinema; often referred to simply asAMC) is an Americanmovie theaterchain founded inKansas City, Missouri, and now headquartered inLeawood, Kansas. It is the largest movie theater chain in the world. Founded in 1920, AMC has the largest share of the U.S. theater market, ahead ofRegal CinemasandCinemark Theatres. After acquiringOdeon Cinemas,UCI Cinemas, andCarmike Cinemasin 2016, it became the largest movie theater chain in the world.[3]It has 2,807 screens in 353 European theaters and 7,755 screens in 593 American theaters.[2][4]
The company is listed on theNew York Stock Exchange; from 2012 to 2018, the Chinese conglomerateWanda Groupowned a majority stake in the company. Private equity firmSilver Lake Partnersmade a $600 million investment in AMC in September 2018, but the voting power of AMC shares was structured so that Wanda Group still controlled the majority of AMC's board of directors. Amid financial downturns caused by theCOVID-19 lockdowns, in January 2021, Wanda's ownership was increasingly diluted due to new financing by AMC, as well asshort squeezesthat resulted in Silver Lake converting its $600 million debt holding to equity. In early-February 2021, Wanda converted itsClass B sharestoClass A shares, thus reducing its voting power to less than 50%.
AMC Theatres was founded in 1920 by Maurice, William, Irvin, Edward, and Barney Dubinsky, sons of Russian Jewish immigrants Simon and Sarah Dubinsky. The Dubinsky brothers had been traveling the Midwest performing melodramas and tent shows with actressJeanne Eagels. They purchased the Regent Theatre on 12th Street between Walnut and Grand in downtownKansas City, Missouri.[5]Maurice, the oldest brother, died in 1929, and Barney left the company in 1936 after being injured in an auto accident.[6]Edward, the youngest brother, eventually changed his last name to Durwood, and the company they formed eventually became known as Durwood Theatres, after a legal fight with his brothers.[6]The chain also had theaters inSt. JosephandJefferson City, MissouriandLeavenworthandTopeka, Kansas.[7]
When Edward's sonStanleyleft theU.S. Air ForceafterWorld War II, he joined the company in 1945. He persuaded his father to builddrive-in theatersin St. Joseph, Jefferson City, and Leavenworth. In 1947 they expanded further with the acquisition of the Liberty Theater in downtown Kansas City which they remodeled and renamed the Roxy.[8]They won anantitrustsuit to enable them to show first-run product at the Roxy and went on to acquire all of the downtown cinemas in Kansas City includingThe Empire Theater, theCapri Theatre, theMidland Theatreand the Paramount Theatre.[7]
In 1961, after Ed died, Stanley took control of Durwood Theatres, a small ten-theatre chain. With aninterstateplanned around Kansas City, Durwood looked to sites outside downtown and acquired two sites at a shopping center on Kansas City'sWard Parkwayto build a 700-seat theater. As the sites could not be combined, they opened two theaters side-by-side as the Parkway Twin Theatre in 1963.[7]This was the company's first foray into using themultiplexmodel.  According toVariety, Stanley Durwood later claimed in 1962 that he "was standing in the lobby of his 600-seat Roxy in Kansas City mulling over its poor grosses, when he realized he could double his box office by adding a second screen and still operate with the same size staff."[9]
Following the success of the Parkway Twin, AMC followed up with the Embassy 3 triplex at theCountry Club Plaza; the Metro Plaza, a four-screen theater in Kansas City in 1966; and a six-screen theater inOmahain 1969.[10][11][7]
The industry quickly embraced the multiplex concept, where additional screens meant very little difference in staff and operating costs but resulted in a significant profit increase. The concept also provided more film choices at one location, drawing bigger crowds. It also gave owners the flexibility to show big hits on more screens and less reliance on any individual film that could turn out to be a bust.[12]
Stanley renamed Durwood Theatres as American Royal Cinema on October 1, 1968, after theAmerican Royallivestock and horse show, but the latter's producers sought an injunction, and the name was changed to American Multi-Cinema, Inc.[13][7]
Stanley began to apply military management and the insights ofmanagement scienceto revolutionize the movie theatre industry.[14]As he later explained toVarietymagazine, "We needed to define what our company was doing in the (exhibition) business. My dad wasn't that organized."[15]It was structured under the belief that every customer was a "guest".
By the 1980s, the company was experiencing strong growth; in 1983, it had itsinitial public offering.[16]AMC Theatres built its first multiplex overseas in 1985, the 10-screen multiplex atThe Point, Milton Keynesin theUnited Kingdom,[16]and later opened additional sites in the UK such as inDudleyandTamworth, Staffordshire. In October 1988, they announced a joint venture withUnited Artists TheatersandCinema International Corporation(a partnership ofParamount PicturesandUniversal Studios) to run their combined cinemas in the UK, Ireland under the AMC name, however, AMC pulled out of the joint venture in December 1988, and sold their U.K. assets, including their 12 cinemas, to the new entity (later calledUnited Cinemas International) for $98 million and withdrew from the UK market.[17][18][19]
In 1988,Kinepolis Brussels, the firstmegaplexin the world,  with 25 screens and 7,600 seats, was opened byKinepolis, the European chain.[20][21][22][23]
In 1995, AMC Theatres opened the first North American megaplex, the AMC Grand 24 inDallas, Texas, a theater complex that could accommodate thousands.[24]AMC continued to open other megaplex theaters, such as the AMC Hampton Towne Center 24 in Hampton, Virginia, and the chain's busiest theater in the US, theAMC Empire 25inNew York CitynearTimes Square.
On December 13, 1996, AMC opened theOntario Mills30, a 30-screen theater inOntario, California, which at the time was the largest multiplex in the world.[25][16]AMC Theatres' megaplex theatres were a success overseas as well. In April 1996, they opened Canal City 13 inFukuoka, Japan, which was followed on December 20, 1996, by the AMC Arrábida 20 inPorto, Portugal.[19]In January 2002, the 16-screen Great Northern theatre was opened inManchesterin the U.K., marking the chain's return to the UK market after 14 years. This was later supplemented by the opening of a 12-screen cinema on the Broadway Plaza site inBirminghamin October 2003. AMC Theatres sometimes serve a dual function; in addition to the regular cinema functions, they also cater to companies' business conferences that can make use of their projectors for displaying presentations.[26]
In 2004, AMC Theatres was acquired by Marquee Holdings Inc., an investment vehicle controlled by affiliates ofJ.P. Morgan Partners, LLC, the private equity arm ofJPMorgan Chase, andApollo Global Management, a private investment firm.[27]At the time, AMC was publicly traded onAMEXunder the code AEN.[28]
In 2006, the company announced a newinitial public offering(IPO) expected to be worth approximately $789 million;[29]however, adverse market conditions convinced the company's management to withdraw from such an offering on May 3, 2007.[30]The company filed for a $450 million IPO in its third such filing since 2006 on July 14, 2010.[31][32]
Stanley Durwood died in 1999, and his successor was Peter Brown, the first non-Dubinsky/Durwood family member to head the company.[9]Gerardo I. Lopezsucceeded Brown as president and CEO of AMC Theatres on March 2, 2009.[33]Previously, Lopez was the Executive Vice President of President Consumer Products Group,Seattle's Best Coffee, and Foodservice atStarbucks.[34]Under new leadership, one of the first major announcements came in March of the same year; the company announced that it would equip 1,500 of its screens withReal Dprojectors.[35]In the same month, AMC Theatres announced it had closed on a $315 million deal withSonyto replace all of itsreel projectorswithdigital cinemaprojectors, starting in the second quarter of 2009 and completing in 2012.[36]
The company was formerly headquartered in downtown Kansas City. In September 2011, AMC Theatres announced plans to move its headquarters to a new $30 million four-story building designed by360 Architecturein the Park Place development at 117th Street and Nall Avenue inLeawood, Kansasin suburbanKansas City. Kansas had offered $47 million in incentives to get the 400 jobs to move across the Kansas/Missouri border.[37]
After reaching a settlement with the state of Illinois regarding complaints from adisability rightsorganization in April 2012, AMC pledged to equip all of its theaters in the state with captioning and description services by 2014. The disability rights group had accused the company of only providing closed captioning or audio description systems at some of its locations in the state.[38]
In May 2012, AMC Theatres was acquired by Chinese conglomerateWanda Group, headquartered inDalian, who paid $2.6 billion to acquire AMC's 5,048 screens in 347 theaters in the U.S. and Canada.[39]The deal was finalized on September 4, 2012.[40]The acquisition made Wanda the world's largest cinema chain.[41]Wang Jianlin, CEO of Dalian Wanda Group, announced that the company would plan to spend $500 million renovating AMC locations.[40]
AMC Theatres had eight movie theatres in Canada. In July 2012, four locations were sold toCineplex Entertainment, and two more locations were sold toEmpire Theatresand later acquired byLandmark Cinemas. The two remaining locations have since closed.[42]
Gerardo I. Lopezannounced his resignation as CEO of AMC in August 2015. Craig Ramsey was appointed as the interim CEO by the company board.[43]In December 2015, AMC announced thatAdam Aronwould be the company's president and chief executive officer, as well as a member of the company's board of directors, beginning on January 4, 2016.[44]
In March 2016, AMC Theatres announced it would acquire competitorCarmike Cinemas.[45]In July 2016, Carmike's management accepted a revised offer, pending regulatory and shareholder approval.[46]The deal was closed on December 25, 2016, making AMC the largest cinema chain in the United States.[47]
On March 1, 2017, AMC Theatres CEO Adam Aron stated that the company would rebrand Carmike Cinemas locations under the AMC name; smaller locations were rebranded under the new banner AMC Classic (which repurposes trademarks associated with Carmike). Aron also announced a plan to rebrand its kitchen-equipped theaters as AMC Dine-In.[48][49]
In July 2017, AMC Theatres announced they would cut $30 million in expenses by the end of the year. This cost reduction would be accomplished by reducing operating hours, cutting staffing levels, and other measures.[50]
In September 2018,Silver Lake Partnersmade a $600 million investment in AMC Theatres, whose proceeds were used to repurchase approximately 32% of Wanda Group's class Bcommon stock.[51]However, the voting power of AMC's shares is structured in such a way (granting three votes per-share for each Class B share if its stake in the company is above 30%)[52]that, even after reducing its ownership of AMC common stock to just under 50% by the end of 2019, Wanda Group continued to retain majority control over AMC's board of directors.[53]
In October 2019, AMC began to offer on-demand rentals and purchases of digital film releases under the banner AMC Theatres On Demand. The service is tied to the company's Stubs loyalty program.[54][55][56]
On March 18, 2020, AMC announced the closure of all of its theaters due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, in compliance withCDCguidance against any gathering of over ten people. AMC said this shutdown would last for at least six to twelve weeks.[57]On March 25, 2020, AMC furloughed all of its 600 corporate employees, including CEO Adam Aron. All furloughed corporate AMC employees and associates retained active employment status, including all health benefits.[58]
On April 28, 2020, AMC announced they would no longer carry films fromUniversal PicturesafterNBCUniversalCEOJeff Shellcommented inThe Wall Street Journalthat the studio wanted to release films via premium video-on-demand simultaneously with theatrical releases. The company threatened that this will also be done with any other studio "who unilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us, so that they as distributor and we as exhibitor both benefit and neither are hurt from such changes."[59]
On June 3, 2020, AMC stated that it had "substantial doubt" that it would remain in business.[60]On July 28, 2020, AMC and Universal were able to resolve their dispute, with AMC agreeing to a shorter theatrical window of 17 days before Universal could release their films via premium VOD, as well as revenue sharing on the premium VOD window.[61]
On August 20, 2020, AMC began the process of reopening selected locations in the United States where allowed under local health orders. In honor of the company's centennial year, AMC also offered a special 15-cent ticket promotion that day, promoted as "Movies in 2020 at 1920 Prices." The company aimed for at least two thirds of its locations to be open in time for the September 3 release ofTenet.[62]The company upgraded itsair filtrationsystems to four times the rates before the pandemic and installed electrostatic sprayers in the auditoriums.[63][64]In October 2020, the company reported that its existing cash resources "would be largely depleted by the end of 2020 or early 2021."[65]
On January 26, 2021, AMC stated that it had raised $917 million in new funding, including $506 million in equity and new common shares, and commitments for $411 million in debt financing. The company stated that this new funding "should allow the company to make it through this dark coronavirus-impacted winter".[66][67]The next day, as part of a wider series ofshort squeezescoordinated by theRedditcommunityr/wallstreetbets(whichprimarily targetedvideo game retailerGameStop), AMC experienced a major, 300% surge in its share price to a peak of $20.36.[68][69]The surge triggered Silver Lake Partners'convertible bonds; on January 28, it reached an agreement to convert $600 million of its debt holdings in AMC to equity at $13.51 per-share.[70]Mudrick Capital Managementmade nearly $200 million in profit off its holdings of AMC debt.[71]
On February 5, 2021, a U.S.-based subsidiary of Wanda Group issued a filing with the SEC, stating that it had converted its Class B common stock toClass A sharesto permit their sale. While Wanda remained AMC's largest single shareholder, the conversion, as well as AMC's financing efforts taking its stake below 37%, effectively surrendered its majority control since Class A stock only provides one vote per-share.[52][72]On May 21, 2021, Wanda filed a 0.002% stake with the SEC, largely confirming the end of their involvement in AMC.[73]
During its fourth-quarter earnings call in March 2021, the company reported that its revenue had fallen by 88% year-over-year. CEOAdam Aronstated that AMC was facing the "most challenging market conditions in the 100-year history of the company", but cited progress on COVID-19 vaccinations, decisions to allow cinemas in New York City and Los Angeles to re-open, and a "significant" number of upcoming blockbuster films as signs of optimism.[72]Aron also confirmed that Wanda no longer had majority control, and the company would now "be governed like most other publicly traded companies with a wide array of shareholders".[52][74]
In June 2021, retail investors once again poured into AMC stock, propelling shares to an all-time high of $77.26 in another alleged short squeeze.[75]Short sellers betting against AMC incurred losses of over $2.8B as a result.[76]AMC issued more shares during the surge, but warned potential investors against buying the shares "unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment". The cinema chain operator said it believed current prices reflected "market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business".
In the year to date, shares in AMC had soared 2,421% – despite its cinemas being largely shut during the pandemic.[77]
In August 2021, the company revealed plans to begin acceptingcryptocurrenciessuch asBitcoinfor purchases in the future,[78]which it did in November 2021 for online purchases viaPayPal.[79][80]In April 2022, AMC added integration withBitPayas a payment provider to its mobile app, allowing customers to use crypto payments such asDogecoinandShiba Inu.[81]
On August 4, 2022, AMC took Wall Street by surprise with the announcement of its "AMC Preferred Equity Units" after market close, a new preferred share class. The units were to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "APE," a nod to the individual investors who turned the company into ameme stock, who often refer to themselves as "apes". Over 516 million APE units were subsequently issued to AMC shareholders in a 1:1 special dividend, with the units wielding similar economic properties as common shares.[82]AMC stock gained 19% to $22.18 at the close on Friday after initially falling following the announcement of the new units on Thursday. The preferred shares started trading under the "APE" ticker on the New York Stock Exchange starting Aug. 22.[83]AMC CEO Adam Aron stated "We are making great strides on our path towards pandemic recovery".[citation needed]
In February 2023 AMC announced plans to test adynamic pricingmodel for tickets for showings that occur after 4pm based on seat location. Seats located near the front of the theatre and select ADA seats will be priced less than other seats and will only be made available to members of the Stubs rewards program and seats in the middle of the theatre will be priced more than the other non-front row seats. In addition, AMC Stubs A-List members will be able to reserve the expensive middle seats at no additional charge.[84][85]In July 2023 AMC chose to abandon dynamic pricing after testing showed that customers were still not likely to choose front-row seats despite their lower prices, with most customers still sitting in the middle of the theatre or other non-front seats despite the upcharge. This made AMC believe that this made their prices less competitive as competitors did not also adapt dynamic pricing. The company also stated that it would test seats that recline further back in the front rows that would potentially allow better views.[86]
On July 31, the company reported their highest single-week admissions revenue in company history due to theBarbenheimercraze.[87]On September 6, AMC announced that it had planned to sell up 40 million shares.[88]
AMC patentedcup holderarmrestsin 1981.[16]AMC also introduced stadium-style seating. The seats are placed on risers so that each person has an unobstructed view of the screen. In 1995, they introduced "Love Seat" style seating with retractable armrests so that there can be no barrier between two seats.[16]In July 1994, AMC signed an agreement with Sony to begin installing SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound) in auditoriums,[89]and began upgrading selected older auditoriums in 2003. On March 26, 2009, AMC announced an agreement to convert 1,500 existing auditoriums to fully digital 3D screens usingRealDtechnology.[90][non-primary source needed]
On March 30, 2009, they announced they would convert all 4,500 screens in their chain to4Kdigital projectors provided by Sony.[91]In April 2022, AMC also announced an agreement with Cinionic to install laser projectors at 3,500 of its screens in the United States through the end of 2026.[92]
Selected AMC locations offer premium screens and features for a higher ticket price, includingpremium large formats.
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. invested $20 million in virtual-reality arcades and productions: $10 million to virtual reality entertainment company Dreamscape Immersive and another $10 million in a content fund.[102]
AMC Theatres created the now-defunct MovieWatcher program[when?]that rewarded frequent movie-goers similar to other rewards programs but featured innovative aspects. It was based on a points-per-movie-ticket-purchased system, with rewards varying from concessions to movie passes based on point-based level. However, points were limited to a maximum of four points per three-hour time period, which was equal to two tickets.[103]For the AMC cinemas that were not part of the Loews Cineplex acquisition and therefore ticketed byMovieTickets.com, the website's surcharge was waived for MovieWatcher members.[citation needed]
On April 1, 2011, AMC started a new rewards program known as AMC Stubs,[104]which could be purchased for a fee of $12 for an entire year. For that initial fee, members would receive $5 on every $50 spent between the box office and the concession stand at any AMC theater nationwide. AMC Stubs members also received a free size upgrade with every popcorn and drink they purchase (for example, an AMC Stubs member can get a large popcorn for the price of a regular).
Other perks include birthday gifts and waived ticketing fees for online ticketing sites such asMovieTickets.comandFandangoand also online ticket purchases through AMC's own website and mobile app. Receipts or ticket stubs were required for manual adjustments.

Following the acquisition of Carmike Cinemas, AMC began to unify its cinemas under one of three main banners in 2017:[112][113][114][115]
AMC also formed a short-lived partnership withPlanet Hollywoodthat failed due to that company's bankruptcy. The Planet Movies by AMC venture planned to open complexes worldwide with the objective of having icon locations in major metropolitan and other select areas, likeOrlandoandColumbus. Initially, seven existing, unnamed AMC megaplex theaters with more than 150 combined screens were to be re-branded under a license arrangement to incorporate certain elements of the new concept. The initial seven re-branded locations were to include markets such asOrlando, Florida. The AMC Pleasure Island 24 megaplex in Orlando, situated directly across from Planet Hollywood's most successful restaurant and retail unit and adjacent to Disney'sPleasure Island(nowDisney Springs) was to be the first Planet Movies location.
After the initial seven, the joint-venture planned to own and operate all subsequent units including 8 to 10 complexes with 200 to 250 screens planned to open over the next 18 to 24 months. Over the longer term, the venture anticipated rolling out units at the rate of 5 to 10 per year. From almost the very start, the well-publicized financial strains on Planet Hollywood hindered the project. The only Planet Movies location to actually open, a 30 screen megaplex, did so in the summer of 1999 atEaston Town CenterinColumbus, Ohio. The location was also located alongside anOfficial All Star CaféandPlanet Hollywoodrestaurant.
The continued poor financial performance of Planet Hollywood led the company to declare bankruptcy in December 1998, and even before the first location had opened stated that "the joint venture has no definitive plans to expand this concept once the Columbus site is completed". As Planet Hollywood was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy in October 1999 their re-organization plan emphasized focus back on their core restaurant business and away from side-ventures like Planet Movies and their Cool Planet ice cream chain.  The Planet Hollywood restaurant and All Star Café in Columbus were closed in late 2000, and the film memorabilia were also removed from the theater as it was rebranded AMC Easton 30, and continues to operate.  The Planet Movies by AMC joint venture was formally dissolved on January 9, 2001.
Both of theDisney Parksin the United States at one time included AMC movie theaters at their Downtown Disney sections: AMC Dine-In Disney Springs 24 all-stadium-seating megaplex with Dolby Cinema and Dine-In Theatres (opened in 1996) (formerly AMC Pleasure Island 24) atWalt Disney World Resortand AMC Downtown Disney 12 atDisneyland Resortstadium-seating multiplex (opened in 2001, closed in 2018). The AMC CityWalk Stadium 19 located onUniversal Studios Hollywood'sCityWalkwas relaunched after a renovation as "Universal Cinema, an AMC Theatre", on April 21, 2017.

On January 26, 2006, AMC merged withLoews Cineplex Entertainmentto form AMC Entertainment;[135]the deal brought into AMC's fold the entire Loews and American Cineplex chains, along withMagic Johnson Theatres(named afterNBAplayerMagic Johnson) andStar Theatres, based inMetro Detroit. In 2010, AMC acquiredChicago-basedKerasotes Showplace Theatres, LLCfor $275 million, combining the nation's second and sixth largest movie theater chains, except for the Showplace 14 in New Jersey and the Showplace ICON theatres.[136][137][138][139][140][141]
In December 2015,Starplex Cinemaswas sold to AMC for approximately $175 million.[142]Most of these theaters now operate as AMC Classic as of July 2017.
On March 3, 2016, AMC announced its intent to acquireCarmike Cinemasin a $1.1 billion deal, pending regulatory and shareholder approval, which would allow it to overtakeRegalas the United States' largest movie theater chain.[143]The merger officially closed in December 2016.[144]
In July 2016,UCI & Odeon Cinema Groupwas sold to AMC for approximately $1.21 billion, subject to European Commission approval.[145]The acquisition was approved by the European Commission and the deal closed in November 2016.[146][147]
In January 2017,Nordic Cinema Group, the leading movie theater operator in theNordicandBalticarea, was sold to AMC for approximately $929 million.[148][149]The deal was completed in March 2017 after AMC received clearance from the European Commission.[150]
In July 2021, AMC Theatres announced that it would acquire the leases to theAmericana at Brandin downtown Glendale andThe Grove at Farmers Marketin Los Angeles locations, formerly owned byPacific Theatres, and that they would reopen in August as part of the AMC chain. The company has not ruled out acquiring the leases of other Pacific Theatres locations.[151]In December 2021, AMC Theaters also announced that they had acquired the leases to the former Pacific Theaters location atNorthridge Fashion CenterinNorthridge, Los Angelesand theArclightChicago 14 inLincoln Park, Chicago, which both opened in 2022.[152]In February 2022, AMC Theaters reached a deal to acquire the leases to the Arclight Montgomery 16 atWestfield MontgomeryinWashington D.C.and theWestfield UTC mall's Arclight UTC 14 inLa Jolla, with the former reopening that month and the latter in March of that year.[153]During the same month, the company reached an agreement to acquire the lease to the Century 12 Evanston, previously owned byCinemark Theatres, inEvanston, Illinois.[154]In December 2022, the company reached a deal on the acquisition of the former Arclight Cinemas located atThe Hub on CausewayinBoston.[155]
In April 2022, AMC Theaters acquired sevenBow Tie Cinemaslocations in Connecticut, New York, and Maryland.[156]
The early versions of stadium-style seating as built by AMC in 1995 had auditoriums configured with an entrance to a flat area immediately in front of the screen for wheelchair users.  People seated there had to either lean back or look up at an uncomfortable angle to see the screen. Able-bodied guests had to ascend the stairs to sit in the middle of the risers in order to have a comfortable line-of-sight with the screen. Since some wheelchair users have limited neck movement range, this configuration made AMC a popular target forAmericans with Disabilities Act(ADA)lawsuits.[157]AMC subsequently solved the problem in newer theaters by building full-stadium auditoriums where the main entrance is through a ramp that emerges onto a platform in the middle of the risers so that wheelchair users can enjoy optimal line-of-sight. However, theU.S. Department of Justicesued the company, and obtained an order requiring AMC to retrofit over 1,990 screens in 95 multiplexes and megaplexes across the United States.
The company successfully appealed the order to theU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled on December 5, 2008[158]that the order was excessive and violated AMC'sdue processrights under theConstitution of the United States.[157]AMC won by pointing out that theUnited States Access Boardhad not yet amended its guidelines for movie theaters to specifically require them to provide wheelchair guests sightlines that were as good as those from elevated risers, versus merely providing an unobstructed view of the screen. Therefore, the court ruled that it was unfair to AMC to retroactively hold it to a standard that did not exist at the time it began building stadium-style theaters.
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., and some of its executives and underwriters of federal securities law charges had agreed to settle in 2017 for $18 million. The case charged AMC with defrauding investors about the financial health of the acquired theater operators and integration challenges, artificially inflating the stock prices of its secondary public offering (SPO).[159]
When AMC announced that most of their theaters would reopen in mid-July 2020 during theCOVID-19 pandemic, the initial announcement said masks would be recommended but not mandatory. AMC CEO Adam Aron stated, "We are strongly encouraging our guests to wear masks all across the country, but not requiring it" and "We did not want to be drawn into a political controversy... We thought it might be counterproductive if we forced mask wearing on those people who believe strongly that it is not necessary."[160]After massive pushback from the public, Aron changed the policy to require masks: "This announcement prompted an intense and immediate outcry from our customers, and it is clear from this response that we did not go far enough on the usage of masks," Aron said.[161]

Diana Ross(born March 26, 1944) is an American singer and actress. Known as the "Queen ofMotown Records", she was the lead singer of the vocal groupthe Supremes, who becameMotown's most successful act during the 1960s and one of the world'sbest-selling girl groupsof all time. They remain the best-charting female group in history,[2]with a total of 12 number-one pop singles on theU.S.BillboardHot 100.
Following her departure from the Supremes in 1970, Ross embarked on a successful solo music career with the release of hereponymous debut solo album. She went on to release 26 studio albums, includingTouch Me in the Morning(1973),Diana Ross(1976),Diana(1980),Why Do Fools Fall in Love(1981) andSwept Away(1984). Her singles "Ain't No Mountain High Enough", "Touch Me in the Morning", "Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)", "Love Hangover", "Upside Down" and "Endless Love", all topped theBillboardHot 100, making her the female solo act with the most number-one songs in the United States at the time. Her success continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s with global hits, including "I'm Coming Out", "Why Do Fools Fall in Love", "All of You", "Chain Reaction", "If We Hold on Together", and "When You Tell Me That You Love Me".
Ross has also achieved mainstream success and recognition as an actress. Her first role was herGolden Globe Award-winning andAcademy Award-nominated portrayal ofBillie Holidayin the filmLady Sings the Blues(1972), which made her the first African-American actress to receive an Academy Award nomination for a debut film performance. The film'ssoundtrackbecame her only solo album to reach number-one on theU.S.Billboard200chart. She also starred in two other feature films,Mahogany(1975) andThe Wiz(1978), and later appeared in the television filmsOut of Darkness(1994), for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, andDouble Platinum(1999).
Ross was named the "Female Entertainer of the Century" byBillboardin 1976. Since her solo career began in 1970, Ross has sold over 100 million records worldwide.[3]She is the only female artist to have had U.S.BillboardHot 100 number-one singles as a solo artist, as the other half of a duet, as a member of a trio, and as an ensemble member, a total of 18. In 2021,Billboardranked her the 30th greatest Hot 100 artist of all time.[4][5]Her hits as a Supreme and a solo artist combined put Ross among the top-five artists on theBillboardHot 100 singles chart from 1955 to 2018.[6]She has scored a top 75 U.K. hit single for a record 33 consecutive years (1964–1996). In 1988, Ross was inducted to theRock and Roll Hall of Fameas a member of the Supremes, and is one of the rare performers to have two stars on theHollywood Walk of Fame. She was the recipient of aSpecial Tony Awardin 1977, theKennedy Center Honorsin 2007, theGrammy Lifetime Achievement Awardin 2012 and 2023 (becoming the first woman to win the award twice, the latter as a member of the Supremes), and thePresidential Medal of Freedomin 2016.
Diana Ross was born inDetroit, Michigan, on March 26, 1944.[7][8]She was the second of six children born to Ernestine (née Moten; January 27, 1916 – October 9, 1984) and Fred Ross Sr. (July 4, 1920 – November 21, 2007). Her mother named her Diane, but the birth certificate was mistakenly filled out with the name Diana. Her family and Detroit friends called her Diane all her life.[9]Ross grew up with two sisters (Barbara[10]and Rita) and three brothers:Arthur;  Fred Jr.; and Wilbert, also known as Chico. Ross was raisedBaptist.[11]
Ross and her family originally resided at 635 Belmont St., in theNorth Endsection of Detroit, nearHighland Park, Michigan, where her neighbor wasSmokey Robinson. When Ross was seven, her mother contractedtuberculosis, causing her to become seriously ill. Ross's parents sent their children to live with Ernestine's parents, the Reverend (pastor of Bessemer Baptist Church) and Mrs. William Moton inBessemer, Alabama. After her mother recovered, she and her siblings returned to Detroit.
On her 14th birthday, in 1958, her family relocated to the working-classBrewster-Douglass Housing Projects, settling at St. Antoine Street. Ross attendedCass Technical High School,[12]a four-year college and preparatorymagnet school, indowntown Detroit, and, aspiring to become a fashion designer, she took classes in clothing design, millinery, pattern making, and tailoring. In the evenings and on weekends she also took modeling and cosmetology classes (Ross has written that Robinson loaned her the funds required to attend these), and participated in several of the school's extracurricular activities, including its swim team. In 1960,Hudson'sdowntown Detroit store hired Ross as its first African Americanbus girl.[13]For extra income, she also provided hairdressing services to her neighbors. Ross graduated from Cass Tech in January 1962.
When she was fifteen, Ross joined the Primettes, the sister group to a male vocal group called the Primes, after she had been brought to the attention of music manager Milton Jenkins by Primes memberPaul Williams. Among the other members of the Primettes wereFlorence Ballard(the first group member hired by Jenkins),Mary Wilson, andBetty McGlown, Williams' girlfriend. After the Primettes won a talent competition in 1960 inWindsor, Ontario, A&R executive and songwriter,Robert Batemaninvited them to audition for Motown Records.
Later, following the success of her live performances atsock hopsand similar events, Ross approached William "Smokey" Robinson, her former neighbor about auditioning for Motown; he insisted that the group audition for him first. Robinson then agreed to bring the Primettes to Motown, on condition that they allow him and his group, the Miracles, to hire the Primettes' guitarist,Marv Tarplin(who had been discovered by Ross) for an upcoming tour. Tarplin ended up playing in Robinson's band(s) for the next 30-plus years. In her autobiography,Secrets of a Sparrow, Ross wrote that she felt that this had been "a fair trade".
The Primettes later auditioned forMotown, before various Motown executives. InBerry Gordy's autobiography,To Be Loved, Gordy recalled that he had been heading to a business meeting when he happened to hear Ross singing "There Goes My Baby", and that Ross's voice "stopped me in my tracks". He approached the group and asked them to perform it again, but, after learning how young they were, Gordy advised them to finish high school before trying to get signed by Motown.[14]
Undeterred, the group began coming to Motown'sHitsville U.S.A.headquarters every day, offering to provide extra help for Motown's recordings, often including hand claps and background vocals. That year, the group recorded two tracks forLu Pine Records, with Ross singing lead on one of them. During the group's early years, Ross served as its hairstylist, make-up artist, seamstress, and costume designer. In late 1960, having replaced McGlown withBarbara Martin, the Primettes were allowed to record their own songs at Hitsville studio, many written by "Smokey" Robinson, who, by then, was vice president of Motown ("Your Heart Belongs to Me" and "A Breathtaking Guy"). Gordy, too, composed songs for the trio, including "Buttered Popcorn" (featuring Ballard on lead) and "Let Me Go the Right Way". While these songs were regional hits, they were not nationwide successes.
In January 1961, Gordy agreed to sign the group on the condition they change their name. Songwriter and Motown secretaryJanie Bradfordapproached Florence Ballard, the only group member at the studio at the time, to pick out a new name for the group. Ballard chose "Supremes", reportedly, because it was the only name on the list that did not end with "ette". Upon hearing the new name, the other members weren't impressed, with Ross telling Ballard she feared the group would be mistaken for a male vocal group (a male vocal group was, indeed, named the Supremes). Gordy signed the group under their new name on January 15, 1961. A year later, Barbara Martin left the group, reducing the quartet to a trio. In late 1963, the group had their first hit with "When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes", peaking at No. 23 on theBillboardHot 100 pop chart. At the end of the year, Gordy made Ross the group's lead singer.
In June 1964, while on tour withDick Clark's Cavalcade of Stars, the group scored their first number-one hit with "Where Did Our Love Go", paving the way for unprecedented success. Between August 1964 and May 1967, Ross, Wilson, and Ballard sang on tennumber-one hit singles, all of which also made the UK Top 40.[14]The group had become a hit with audiences domestically and abroad, going on to be Motown's most successful vocal act throughout the sixties.
Ross began to dominate interviews with the media, answering questions aimed at Ballard or Wilson. She pushed for more pay than her colleagues. In 1965, she began using the name Diana from the mistake on her birth certificate, surprising Ballard and Wilson who had only known her as Diane.[15]Following difficulties with comportment, weight, and alcoholism, Florence Ballard was fired from the Supremes by Gordy in July 1967, hiringCindy BirdsongfromPatti LaBelle and the Bluebellesas Ballard's replacement. Gordy renamed the groupDiana Ross & the Supremes, making it easier to charge a larger performance fee for a solo star and a backing group, as it did for other renamed Motown groups. Gordy initially considered having Ross leave the Supremes for a solo career in 1966, eventually changing his mind because he felt the group's success was still too significant for Ross to pursue solo obligations. Ross remained with the Supremes until early 1970.
As the lead voice of the Supremes, she was really only the soul—or perhapsélan vital—of a machine, ready to plug into whatever arrangement, lyric, or show dress Berry Gordy and the Motown organization provided. She sang of the pain of love without appearing to suffer, but, that doesn't mean that the catch-phrases—'You keep me hanging on,' 'Where did our love go?' 'Love is like an itching in my heart, and I can't scratch it'—were softened or somehow corrupted. Instead, they were transcended with the vivacity that is Diana Ross' great gift. No matter how she is stylized, no matter what phony truism she mouths, this woman always lets you know she is alive.
The group appeared as a trio of singing nuns in a 1968 episode of the popularNBCTV seriesTarzan. Between their early 1968 single "Forever Came Today" and their final single with Ross, "Someday We'll Be Together", Ross would be the only Supremes member to be featured on many of their recordings, often accompanied bysession singersthe Andantesor, as in the case of "Someday We'll Be Together", Julia and Maxine Waters and Johnny Bristol.[17]Still, Wilson and Birdsong continued to sing on recordings. Gordy drove Ross relentlessly throughout this period and Ross, due to anxiety arising from Gordy's demands, began suffering fromanorexia nervosa, according to her autobiography,Secrets of a Sparrow. During a 1967 performance in Boston, Massachusetts, Ross collapsed onstage and had to be hospitalized for exhaustion.
In 1968, Ross began to perform as a solo artist on television specials, including the Supremes' own specials such asTCBandG.I.T. on Broadway,The Dinah Shore Show, and aBob Hopespecial, among others. In mid-1969, Gordy decided that Ross would depart the group by the end of that year, and Ross began recording her initial solo work that July. One of the first plans for Ross to establish her own solo career was to publicly introduce a new Motown recording act.
Though she did not claim their discovery, Motown's publicity department credited Ross with having discoveredthe Jackson 5. Ross would introduce the group during several public events, includingThe Hollywood Palace.[18]In November, Ross confirmed a split from the Supremes inBillboard. Ross's presumed first solo recording, "Someday We'll Be Together", was eventually released as a Supremes recording and became the group's final number-one hit on the Hot 100. It was also the final number-oneBillboardHot 100 single of the 1960s. Ross made her final appearance with the Supremes at theFrontier HotelinLas Vegas,Nevadaon January 14, 1970.[19]
In May 1970, Ross released her eponymousdebut solo album, which included hersignature songs, "Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)" and "Ain't No Mountain High Enough", the latter becoming Ross's firstnumber-one solo single. Follow-up albums,Everything Is Everything(1970) andSurrender(1971) came out shortly afterwards. In 1971, the ballad "I'm Still Waiting" became her first number-one single in theUK. Later in 1971, Ross starred in her first solotelevision special,Diana!, which includedthe Jackson 5.
In 1971, Diana Ross began working on her first film,Lady Sings the Blues(1972), which was a loosely based biography on singerBillie Holiday. Despite some criticism of her for taking the role, once the film opened in October 1972, Ross won critical acclaim for her performance in the film. Jazz criticLeonard Feather, a friend of Holiday's, praised Ross for "expertly capturing the essence of Lady Day". Ross's role in the film won herGolden Globe AwardandAcademy Awardnominations for Best Actress. ThesoundtracktoLady Sings the Bluesbecame just as successful, reaching No. 1 on theBillboard200, staying there for two weeks, and selling two million units. In November 1972, Ross sung the song "When We Grow Up" for the children's album,Free to Be... You and Me.
In 1973, Ross had her second number-one hit in the U.S. with the ballad "Touch Me in the Morning". Later in the year, Motown issuedDiana & Marvin, a duet album with fellow Motown artistMarvin Gaye. The album became an international hit. Touring throughout 1973, Ross became the first entertainer in Japan's history to receive an invitation to theImperial Palacefor a private audience with theEmpress Nagako, wife of EmperorHirohito. In April 1974, Ross became the first African-American woman to co-host theAcademy Awards, withJohn Huston,Burt Reynolds, andDavid Niven.
After the release of a modestly successful album,Last Time I Saw Him(1973), Ross's second film,Mahogany, was released in 1975. The film reunited her withBilly Dee Williams, her co-star inLady Sings the Bluesand featured costumes designed by Ross herself. The story of an aspiring fashion designer who becomes a runway model and the toast of the industry,Mahoganywas a troubled production from its inception. The film's original director,Tony Richardson, was fired during production, and Berry Gordy assumed the director's chair himself.[20]
Gordy and Ross clashed during filming, with Ross leaving the production before shooting was completed, forcing Gordy to use secretary Edna Anderson as a body double for Ross. While a box-office success, the film was not well received by the critics:Timemagazine's review of the film chastised Gordy for "squandering one of America's most natural resources: Diana Ross".[20]Nonetheless, Ross had her third number-one hit in the U.S. with "Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)".
A year later, in 1976, Ross released her fourth solo number-one hit, "Love Hangover", a sensual, dramatic mid-tempo song that bursts into an uptempo disco tune.[21]Later that year, Ross launched her "An Evening with Diana Ross" tour.[22]The tour's success led to a two-week stint atBroadway'sPalace Theatreand a 90-minute,Emmy-nominated television special of the same name,[23]featuring special make-up effects byStan Winston, for a scene in which Ross portrayed legendary cabaret artistJosephine Bakerand blues singersBessie SmithandEthel Waters,[24]and aSpecial Tony Award.[25]
The albumsBaby It's Me(1977) andRoss(1978) sold modestly. In 1977, Motown had acquired the film rights to the Broadway playThe Wiz, an African-American reinterpretation ofL. Frank Baum'sThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The film initially was to include the stage actors who had performed on the play, but producerRob Cohencould not garner the interest of any major Hollywood film studios. It was not until Ross convinced Cohen to cast her (instead ofStephanie Mills, who portrayed Dorothy on Broadway) as Dorothy thatUniversal Picturesagreed to finance the production.
This casting decision led to a change in the film's script, in which Dorothy went from a schoolgirl to a schoolteacher. The role of the Scarecrow, also performed by someone else onstage, was eventually given to Ross's former Motown labelmate,Michael Jackson.  Ross and Jackson had a modest dance hit with their recording for the film of "Ease on Down the Road". Their second duet, actually as part of the ensemble ofThe Wiz, "Brand New Day", found some success overseas.
Thefilm adaptation ofThe Wizhad been a $24 million production, but upon its October 1978 release, it earned only $21,049,053 at the box office.[26][27][28]Though pre-release television broadcast rights had been sold toCBSfor over $10 million, the film produced a net loss of $10.4 million for Motown and Universal.[27][28]At the time, it was the most expensive film musical ever made.[29]The film's failure ended Ross's short career on the big screen and contributed to the Hollywood studios' reluctance to produce the all-black film projects which had become popular during theblaxploitationera of the early to mid-1970s for several years.[30][31][32]
In 1979, Ross releasedThe Boss, continuing her popularity with dance audiences, asthe title songbecame a number-one dance single. On July 16, 1979, Ross guest-hosted an episode of Johnny Carson'sThe Tonight Show, featuringLynda Carter,George Carlin, andMuhammad Alias guests.[33]Later that year, Ross hosted theHBOspecial,Standing Room Only, filmed atCaesars Palace's Circus Maximus Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada, during her "Tour '79" concert tour.[34]This concert special is noted for its opening, during which Ross literally makes her entrance through a movie screen. In November of that year, Ross performedThe Bossalbum's title track as a featured artist during theMacy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, inNew York City.[35]
In 1980, Ross released her most successful album to date,Diana. Composed byChic's guitaristNile Rodgersand bassistBernard Edwards, the album included the hits "I'm Coming Out" and "Upside Down", the latter becoming her fifth chart-topping single in the U.S. Ross scored a Top 10 hit in late 1980 with the theme song to the filmIt's My Turn. Continuing her connections with Hollywood, Ross recorded the duet ballad "Endless Love", withLionel Richie. The song would become her sixth and final single to reach number one on theBillboardHot 100.
Ross began negotiations to leave Motown at the end of 1980. After over 20 years with the label, Ross received US$250,000 as severance.RCA Recordsoffered Ross a $20 million, seven-year recording contract, which gave her complete production control of her albums. Before signing onto the label, Ross allegedly asked Berry Gordy if he could match RCA's offer. Gordy stated that doing so was "impossible". Ross then signed with RCA on May 20, 1981. At the time, Ross's was music history's most expensive recording deal.
In October 1981, Ross released her first RCA album,Why Do Fools Fall in Love. The album sold over a million copies and featured hit singles such as her remake of theclassic hit of the same nameand "Mirror Mirror". Shortly thereafter, Ross established her production company, named Anaid Productions ("Diana" spelled backwards), and also began investing in real estate and touring extensively in the United States and abroad.
Before the release ofWhy Do Fools Fall in Love, Ross hosted her first TV special in four years,Diana. Directed bySteve Binder, the concert portions of the special were filmed atInglewood, California's 17,500-seatThe Forumindoor stadium and featured performances byMichael Jackson,Muhammad Ali,DallasactorLarry Hagman, music impresarioQuincy Jonesand members of theJoffrey Ballet.[36][37]In early 1982, Ross sang "The Star-Spangled Banner" atSuper Bowl XVI[38]and appeared on the musical variety showSoul Train.[39]The episode, devoted completely to her, featured Ross performing several songs fromWhy Do Fools Fall in Love.
On May 6, 1982, Ross was honored with a star on theHollywood Walk of Fame.[40]She followed up the success ofWhy Do Fools Fall in LovewithSilk Electric, which featured the Michael Jackson-written and -produced "Muscles", resulting in another Top 10 Grammy nominated success for Ross. The album eventually went gold on the strength of that song. In 1983, Ross ventured further out of her earlier soul-based sound for a morepop rock-oriented sound following the release of theRossalbum. Though the album featured the Top 40 hit single, "Pieces of Ice", theRossalbum did not generate any more hits or achieve gold status.
On July 21, 1983, Ross performed a free concert onCentral Park'sGreat Lawn, aired live worldwide byShowtime. Proceeds of the concert would be donated to build a playground in the singer's name. Midway through the beginning of the show, a torrential downpour began. Ross tried to continue performing, but the severe weather forced the show to be stopped after 45 minutes. Ross urged the large crowd to exit the venue safely, promising to perform the next day.
The next day's concert suffered no rain, but the memorabilia that was supposed to be sold to raise money for the playground had already been destroyed by the storm. When journalists discovered the exorbitant costs of the two concerts, Ross faced criticism from MayorEd Kochand the Parks Department commissioner. During a subsequent mayoral press conference, Ross handed Koch a check for US$250,000 for the project.[41]TheDiana Ross Playgroundwas built three years later.[42]
In 1984, Ross releasedSwept Away. The album featured "All of You", a duet with friendJulio Iglesias. The single was featured on both Ross's album and Iglesias's1100 Bel Air Place, his first English-language album. It became an international hit, as did theLionel Richie-penned ballad "Missing You", composed as a tribute toMarvin Gaye, whohad been killed earlier that year.Swept Awaygarnered gold record sales status.
Her 1985 albumEaten Alive, produced byBarry Gibbof theBee Gees, garnered a number one single overseas and a Top 20 spot on the album charts. The song "Chain Reaction" reached number one in the U.K., Australia, South Africa, Israel and Ireland, andthe title track, a collaboration with Michael Jackson and Gibb, also performed well. Both songs had strong music videos that propelled the tracks to success. The "Eaten Alive" video was patterned after the 1970s horror filmThe Island of Dr. Moreau, while the one for "Chain Reaction" saluted the 1960sAmerican Bandstand-style TV shows. The video for "Experience", the third single from the album, reignited the "Eaten Alive" romantic storyline with Ross and actorJoseph Gian.
Earlier in 1985, Ross appeared as part of USA for Africa's "We Are the World" charity single, which sold over 20 million copies worldwide. Ross's 1987 follow-up toEaten Alive,Red Hot Rhythm & Bluesfound less success; it reached No. 39 on theBillboardTop R&B Albumschart and No. 12 in Sweden. However, the album's accompanying television special was nominated for three Emmy Awards and won two: Outstanding Costume Design for a Variety or Music Program (Ray AghayanandRet Turner) and Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Miniseries or a Special (Greg Brunton).[43]On January 27, 1986, Ross hosted the13th annualAmerican Music Awards.[44]Ross returned the next year to host the14th annual telecast.[45]
In 1988, Ross chose to not renew her RCA contract and had been in talks with her former mentor Berry Gordy to return to Motown. When she learned of Gordy's plans to sell Motown, Ross tried advising him against the decision, though he ended up selling it toMCA Recordsin June of that year. Following the sale of the company, Ross was asked to return to the Motown label with the condition that she have shares in the company as a part-owner; Ross accepted the offer.
That same year, Ross was inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Fameas a member of the Supremes alongside her former singing partners Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard. She also recorded the theme song to animated adventure drama filmThe Land Before Time(1988). "If We Hold on Together" became an international hit, reaching number one in Japan.
Ross's next album, 1989'sWorkin' Overtime, was not a commercial success, despite the title track reaching the top three of theBillboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[46]The album peaked at No. 34 on theBillboardHot R&B Albums chart, and achieved top 25 chart placings in Japan and the UK. Subsequent releases,The Force Behind the Power(1991),Take Me Higher(1995), andEvery Day Is a New Day(1999) all failed to achieve major success in America, selling around 100,000 copies each.
In 1991, Ross became one of the few American artists to have headlined the annualRoyal Variety Performance, performing a selection of her UK hits beforeQueen Elizabeth IIandPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburghat theVictoria Palace Theatre, London.[47]This marked her second appearance at the Royal Variety Performance, the first being in 1968 with the Supremes.
The Force Behind the Powersparked a comeback when the album wentplatinumin the UK.[48]led by the No. 2 UK hit single "When You Tell Me That You Love Me". The album produced 9 singles across international territories, including another Top 10 UK hit "One Shining Moment". In 1993, Ross returned to acting with a dramatic role in the television film,Out of Darkness. Ross won acclaim for her role in the TV movie and earned her thirdGolden Globenomination.
In 1994,One Woman: The Ultimate Collection, a career retrospective compilation, became a number one hit in the UK, selling quadruple platinum. The retrospective was EMI's alternative to Motown's box setForever Diana: Musical Memoirs. Ross performed during the opening ceremony of the1994 FIFA World Cupheld inChicago, and during the pre-match entertainment of the1995 Rugby League World Cupfinal atWembley Stadium. The World Cup ceremony had her take apenalty kickthat was staged for her to score, and the goalposts were intended to fall down from the power of her shot. She infamously missed the penalty instead.[49]
On January 28, 1996, Ross performed at theSuper Bowl XXX halftime show, held at theSun Devil StadiuminTempe, Arizona.[50]Earlier that month, Ross's Tokyo concert,Diana Ross: Live in Japan, filmed live at the city's Nippon Budokan Stadium, was released.[51]In May 1996, Ross received theWorld Music Awards' Lifelong Contribution to the Music Industry Award.[52]On November 29,EMIreleased the compilation album,Voice of Love, featuring the singles "In the Ones You Love", "You Are Not Alone" and "I Hear (The Voice of Love)".[53]On February 8, 1997, EMI released the Japanese edition of Ross's album,A Gift of Love, featuring the single, "Promise Me You'll Try".[54]In May, she performed with operatic tenorsPlácido DomingoandJosé Carrerasagain at the Superconcert of the Century concert, held inTaipei, Taiwan.[55]She later inductedthe Jackson 5into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on May 6.[56]

Later that year, Ross presented at the1999 MTV Video Music Awardsin September of the year and shocked the audience by touching rapperLil' Kim's exposed breast and pasty-covered nipple, amazed at the young rapper's brashness.[58]In 1999, she andBrandy Norwoodco-starred in the television movie,Double Platinum, which was aired prior to the release of Ross's album,Every Day Is a New Day. From that album, Ross scored a Top 10 hit in the UK in November that year with "Not Over You Yet".
Ross reunited withMary Wilsonfirst in 1976 to attend the funeral service ofFlorence Ballard, who had died in February of that year. In March 1983, Ross agreed to reunite with Wilson andCindy Birdsongfor the television specialMotown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever. The Supremes did not rehearse their performance for that evening, due to time constraints. A scheduled medley of hits was cancelled.
Instead of following producerSuzanne de Passe's instructions to recreate their choreography from their finalEd Sullivan Showappearance, Wilson (according to her autobiography) planned with Birdsong to take a step forward every time Ross did the same, then began to sing lead on the group's final number-one hit song, "Someday We'll Be Together", on which Wilson did not perform.
Later, Wilson introduced Berry Gordy from the stage (unaware that the program's script called for Ross to introduce Gordy), at which point Ross subtly pushed down Wilson's hand-held microphone, stating, "It's been taken care of." Ross then re-introduced Gordy.[59][60]These moments were excised from the final edit of the taped special, but still made their way into the news media;Peoplemagazine reported that "Ross [did] some elbowing to get Wilson out of the spotlight."[61]
In 1999, Ross and mega-tour promoter SFX Entertainment (which later becameLive Nation) began negotiations regarding a Diana Ross tour which would include a Supremes segment. During negotiations with Ross, the promoters considered the creation of a Supremes tour, instead. Ross agreed. As the tour's co-producer, Ross invited all living former Supremes to participate. NeitherJean Terrellnor late 1970s memberSusaye Greenechose to participate. 70s SupremesLynda LaurenceandScherrie Paynewere then touring asFormer Ladies of the Supremes.
Ross contacted Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong, who then began negotiations with SFX. Negotiations with Wilson and Birdsong (who allowed Wilson to negotiate on her behalf) failed when Wilson refused SFX's and Ross's offer of $4 million for 30 performances. Following the passage of SFX's final deadline for Wilson to accept their offer, Payne and Laurence, already negotiating with SFX, signed on to perform with Ross on the tour.
Laurence and Payne would later say that they got along well with Ross. The newly formed group performed together onTodayandThe Oprah Winfrey Show, as well asVH1'sVH1 Divas 2000: A Tribute to Diana Ross. TheReturn to Love Tourlaunched in June 2000, to a capacity audience in Philadelphia. The tour's final performance was atNew York City'sMadison Square Garden.

U.S. ticket sales for the new tour were brisk, from coast to coast. Venues, such asLong Island'sWestbury Music Fair, California'sCerritos Center for the Performing Artsand Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay, attempted to add extra shows, due to public demand. Sold-out performances inBostonfollowed. In August, shortly after the tour began, however, Ross re-entered the Promises Institute's substance abuse rehabilitation program.

She stated, "I'm ready to share, I've been a very transparent person and now I'm ready to share the good, bad, and ugly parts of my journey—the concerning part of my journey. ... I really go into the specifics, I really go into the first time I was diagnosed, I go into assessing the first time I had anxiety in a romantic relationship and what it did to that relationship and then subsequently what it did to the next one." Williams said she hoped to "really help heal through my story" and "let people know what I do on a daily, what I do on a monthly–whatever it takes to get people whole and get people where they can maybe start seeing some better results in their own life."[165]

Roberson was born on November 1, 1981, inHouston,Texas, to Cheryl Lastrap and Terry Roberson.[citation needed]In the 1980s, before joining Destiny's Child, Roberson was a child model, appearing in commercials such as Soft and Beautiful's Just for Me Hair Carerelaxerfor kids.[6]
When LaTavia was eight years old, she auditioned to be a rapper and dancer in a local girl group and was one of many girls selected. She metBeyoncé Knowlesat this audition, and the two became best friends.[7]Singing and dancing with other young girls, LaTavia and Beyoncé made a video for a song called "One Time" which almost led to them becoming a duo.[8]LaTavia then metKelly Rowlandin elementary school; she was in the third grade while Rowland was in the fourth grade. After hearing Rowland sing, LaTavia told her to try out for the group, which she did.[9]Initially, due to her duties as a rapper and dancer, LaTavia did not sing; subsequently, she had vocal lessons and began singing at local events. LaTavia got her break when she entered the singing competition TV showStar Search, alongside Beyoncé, Kelly,Tamar Davisand LaTavia's cousins Nikki and Nina Taylor. The group, then named Girl's Tyme, were heartbroken after losing the competition to Skeleton Crew.[10]Beyonce's fatherMathew Knowlesbegan managing the group and changed the line-up, reducing it to a quartet, consisting of LaTavia, Beyoncé, Kelly, and Beyoncé's elementary school friendLeToya Luckett. The group also underwent several name changes: The Dolls, Something Fresh, Cliché, and Destiny.[11]
In 1995, they signed toElektra Records, but were later dropped from the label.D'wayne Wigginssoon began working on music with the group, briefly signing them to Grass Roots Entertainment. The Wiggins produced song "Killing Time" was included on theMen in Blacksoundtrack. After plenty of training to become prepared and ready for the music industry, they were signed byColumbia Recordsin 1997 under the name, Destiny's Child with Knowles as lead vocalist, Rowland as second-lead vocalist, and Roberson and Luckett as background vocalists. Roberson was thealto, adding the low notes, and Luckett was thesoprano, adding the high notes to the group's harmony.[12]Roberson was also designated as the group's spokesperson. In early 1998, Destiny's Child released their self-titled debut albumDestiny's Child. The singles were "No, No, No" featuringWyclef Jeanand "With Me".[13]Roberson can be heard rapping in the song "Illusions". Later in 1998, their song "Get on the Bus" featuringTimbaland(which was released as a single in Europe) was included on theWhy Do Fools Fall in Lovesoundtrack.
In 1999, Destiny's Child released their second albumThe Writing's on the Wall. It became one of the biggest selling albums released by a female group and was certified eight-times platinum in the U.S. The album includes four hit singles, "Bills, Bills, Bills", "Bug a Boo", "Say My Name", and "Jumpin', Jumpin'".[14]LaTavia also gained co-writing contribution more on this album than their first. Roberson performed lead on two songs: "Sweet Sixteen" and "Where'd You Go". Additionally, she sang lead on the song "Can't Help Myself" which was only released on the album'sHouston Edition. In late 1999, during the success ofThe Writing's on the Wall, Roberson and Luckett attempted to bring in a third-party mediator to work with their manager Mathew Knowles; however, they soon found themselves on the outs with Knowles.[15]When the "Say My Name" video debuted in February 2000, the pair learned they'd been replaced byMichelle WilliamsandFarrah Franklin,[16]which led to several lawsuits with the outcome of Roberson and Luckett being entitled to royalty checks from the previous albums they had made with the group.

Roberson performed with the group in live shows, toured as an opening act onTLC'sFanMail Tour, and won awards such asSoul Train Music Awards.

Due to personality differences, Ramos left the group. Before leaving, she introduced them to Naty Quinones, who auditioned and was added to the group. In February 2001, Anjel attended the Grammys. Later that year, Tiffany Beaudoin was introduced to Anjel by a mutual friend and joined after an audition. They recorded a 22-track demo, planning to release their album, Heavenly, with the help of Jagged Edge.[17]They also appeared in the music video for Jagged Ege's "Where the Party At" remix. The group made one live appearance in 2001 on Good Day, NY; where they talked about the album they were working on and sang part of their song "Missing You". The production company that handled the group fell through and the members went separate ways.[18]
Their label was 581 Entertainment, ran by Jagged Edge underSo So Def Recordings, while it was still underColumbia. So So Def ownerJermaine Dupri's decision to leave Columbia caused problems with 581 Entertainment. Before Dupri's move, Anjel's project was on track to be released. The members decided to look into individual projects while group business issues were being handled. In 2003, the record company folded and the group broke up. The group never released Heavenly and split up, before actually recording a full album. The tracks were later leaked on the internet.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
