Guy Ritchie's The Covenant(or simplyThe Covenant) is a 2023 Americanaction dramafilm co-written, produced and directed byGuy Ritchie. The film starsJake GyllenhaalandDar Salim. Its plot follows John Kinley, a U.S. ArmyGreen BeretMaster Sergeant, and Ahmed, his Afghaninterpreter, fighting theTaliban.
The film was theatrically released byMetro-Goldwyn-MayerandSTXfilmsin the United States on April 21, 2023, received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $21 million.
In March 2018, amidst theWar in Afghanistan,U.S. ArmySpecial ForcesMaster SergeantJohn Kinley and his unit are ambushed by a truck bomb attack orchestrated by theTalibanduring a routinevehicle inspectionatLashkargah, which claims the life of his interpreter. In need of a replacement, he is introduced to Ahmed Abdullah, a steadfast yet disliked interpreter, who claims he pursues the job only for money. During an undercover capture mission, Kinley learns that Ahmed was previously affiliated with the Taliban through theopiumtrade but had defected when the organization murdered his son. Ahmed later saves Kinley's team from being ambushed by a Taliban unit aided by a compromisedAfghan National Armysoldier, earning Kinley's respect.
During another raid to check for a possible insurgent arms cache about 100kilometres(62 miles) north ofBagram Air Base, Kinley's unit is attacked by Taliban reinforcements, who kill everyone except for him and Ahmed. The duo manage to escape on foot, killing several Taliban fighters in the process. Whilst attempting to return to the airbase by navigating through the mountainous Afghan terrain, they are once again ambushed by insurgents, who manage to wound Kinley, before clubbing him with a rifle butt, incapacitating him. Ahmed manages to kill the Taliban and resolves to take Kinley back to the air base. Receiving help from some sympathetic Afghans, Ahmed evades the Taliban hunting them, carrying Kinley over the country's treacherous mountain topography. Several days later Ahmed and Kinley are near Bagram but are attacked by Taliban fighters; Ahmed kills the fighters but is shortly thereafter apprehended by U.S. troops.
Seven weeks later, Kinley, having been repatriated to his home inSanta Clarita, California, is completely unaware of how he was saved, but understands Ahmed's role in it. Upon learning that Ahmed and his family were forced to move underground owing to the duo's escapade having become local folklore, Kinley attempts to procure U.S. visas for them for over a month, but in vain. Emotionally tormented and rendered near sleepless by his inability to repay his indebtedness towards Ahmed, Kinley finally resolves to save him himself, enlisting the assistance of his superior,Lieutenant ColonelVokes, to procure the visas.
Returning to Afghanistan under the alias of Ron Kay, Kinley meets with Parker, aprivate military contractor, who promises to provide support on the condition that the former locates Ahmed first. Kinley meets Ahmed's brother Ali, a Taliban supplier who manages to smuggle Kinley across their territory; in the process, he kills two insurgents after nearly being caught at a road checkpoint, which alerts the Taliban. Vokes informs Kinley that the visas have been processed and are with Parker. Finally arriving at Ahmed's hideout, Kinley persuades him and his family to accompany him to the U.S. Meanwhile, Parker deduces Kinley's true identity; realizing that the duo is in danger due to their value to the Taliban, he arranges for anAC-130gunship and anApacheattack helicopter to provide air support. Concurrently, the Taliban mount an attack on Kinley, who manages to escape with Ahmed's family to the nearbyDarunta Dam.
Cornered by approaching Taliban units, the duo engage them in a protracted gunfight, which ends when they run out of ammunition. However, the AC-130 and Apache helicopter arrive and wipe out the attackers. Parker arrives from the other end of the dam with a relief column of anti-Talibantechnicals.  He tells Kinley he would have supported his mission for free had he known upfront it was him. Escorted back to Bagram, the group boards anAirbus A400Mleaving Afghanistan.
The film's ending title states that in the aftermath of theTaliban's recapture of Afghanistan, over 300 Afghan interpreters affiliated with the U.S. military were murdered by the organization, with thousands more still in hiding.

In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014 (the "S" standing for Simonds, the company's founder; the "T" standing forTPG Growth, whose managing partner McGlashan helped launch the company; and the "X" standing for "secret project"),[2]with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[3][4]Investors in the company includedHony Capital,Tencent,PCCW, TPG Growth,RTL GroupandLiberty Global. Individual investors includeGigi Pritzker,Beau Wrigley, andDominic Ng.[5][6][7]
In September 2017, it was reported that STX was considering aninitial public offeringon theHong Kong Stock Exchange(SEHK). It was reported that a listing on the SEHK could bring STX closer to Chinese investors and audiences.[8]TheWall Street Journalstated that the company could be valued at $3.5 billion, after raising an additional $500 million following the IPO.[8][9]In April 2018, the company filed for an IPO on theHong Kong Stock Exchange.[10]
STX called off its IPO in October 2018, citing theChina–U.S. trade war, and conditions having deteriorated in Hong Kong due to turbulence in the mainland Chinese equity market.[11]An overall co-funding agreement with Chinese companyHuayi Brothers Medialapsed at the end of 2018,[12]and in April 2019, co-founder Bill McGlashan was fired due to his being indicted in thecollege admissions bribery scandal.[13]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
