Brooks and Barrino reprise their roles from the productions of the stage musical. It tells the story of Celie, an African American woman dealing with the hardships of living with an abusive husband and living in theAmerican Southduring the early 1900s.
The Color Purplepremiered in London on November 20, 2023, and was released in the United States on December 25, 2023, byWarner Bros. Pictures. Although it received positive reviews from critics, itperformed poorly at the box officegrossing $68.8million against a budget of $90–100 million. Danielle Brooks was lauded for her performance, receiving nominations for theAcademy Award,BAFTA Award,Golden Globe Award, andScreen Actors Guild Awardfor Best Supporting Actress. At the55th NAACP Image Awards, the film won a record-breaking eleven awards out of sixteen nominations, includingOutstanding Motion Pictureand acting wins for Barrino, Henson, Domingo, and the ensemble cast.
In 1909 Georgia, teenager Celie Harris lives with her sister Nettie and abusive father Alfonso. After her mother died, Alfonso started raping Celie, causing her to become pregnant twice. When Celie gives birth to her second child, Adam, Alfonso takes the child away as he had the first, Olivia. He then forces her to marry a local farmer and father of three, Albert "Mister" Johnson.
When Alfonso tries to molest Nettie, she moves into Mister's farmhouse, but when Nettie rebuffs his sexual advances he banishes her from his land; as she leaves, she promises to write to Celie every day. By 1917, Celie is still married to Mister. His son Harpo marries fierce, defiant Sofia, and builds a house for her. Celie befriends Sofia, but in a moment of jealousy advises Harpo to beat Sofia. Sofia leaves Harpo as a result, and he converts the house into ajuke joint.
Independent jazz singer Shug Avery, Mister's longtime lover, comes to town to perform at the joint and stays at Mister's house for a few days. Around the time, Mister's equally abusive father visits. Harpo has been seeing another woman, who he calls "Squeak". When he tries to dance with Sofia, Squeak cuts in and ends up starting a fight that trashes the joint. Escaping the brawl, Shug takes Celie to see a movie; the two kiss at the movie theatre and sleep together that night. In the morning, Shug picks up Mister's mail and finds a letter to Celie from Nettie; the two search the house and discover dozens of other letters from Nettie that Mister hid from Celie. The letters reveal that Nettie has been living in Africa and caring for Adam and Olivia, who were adopted by missionaries.
In 1930, the mayor's wife condescendingly offers Sofia a job as her maid; when Sofia refuses she gets involved in a physical fight, resulting in her arrest. She is released after six years and ends up having to work for the mayor's wife anyway, sinking into a deep depression that seemingly takes away all of her fierceness.
On Easter Sunday in 1943, when Shug and her new husband Grady are visiting, Celie confronts Mister in front of his father and their family. She leaves him and moves to Memphis with Shug. Squeak, whose real name is Mary Agnes, goes with them, inspiring Sofia out of her stupor. Celie vows to Mister that until he does right by her, everything in his life will crumble.
In 1945, when Alfonso dies, his wife reveals to Celie that he was not Celie or Nettie's biological father, and the sisters now own the grocery store and the home they were brought up in. Celie moves back to Georgia and becomes a tailor, selling pants in the former grocery store. Meanwhile, Mister has become a miserable drunk. He vows to do right by Celie and plots to reunite Celie and Nettie, selling some of his land to pay for Nettie to return from Africa. Later he visits her shop and buys a pair of pants; while she is hesitant to see him, she agrees to maintain a friendship with him.
In 1947, Celie reunites with Nettie, along with Adam and Olivia. She joins hands with them as she and everyone else thank God for how far they have come.
Additionally,Whoopi Goldbergmakes acameo appearanceas a midwife who helps young Celie give birth. Goldberg previously portrayed Celie in the original film.[6]

It was also announced thatAlice Walker,Rebecca Walker,Kristie Macosko Krieger, Carla Gardini, and Mara Jacobs will executive produce the film.[8]Siedah GarrettjoinedBrenda RussellandStephen Bray(in place of the lateAllee Willis) in contributing new material to the film's score.[9]The film had financing through Domain Entertainment.[10]

In an interview withThe Hollywood Reporter,Oprah Winfreyreported that the film had difficulty getting the cast that Bazawule wanted, as there were other productions with African American artists in progress.[21]However, Winfrey explained that "if you were making this film for $30 or $40 million, the interest in the cast would be very different", but some producers put pressure on the names of the cast when the film hit $90–100 million in production, asking to includeBeyoncéorRihannain the cast.[21][22][23]
Filming began in March 2022, with production taking place at Driftwood Beach onJekyll Islandfrom March 16 to March 25.[24]Filming officially wrapped in July 2022.
In a 2024 interview withThe New York Times,Taraji P. Hensonspoke out against unfair pay and working conditions while working on the film.[25]Henson said the studio forced her to audition despite being the director's first choice. She said, "At this point I’m aGolden Globe-winner andAcademy Award–nominated...So I went in there with a chip on my shoulder because I was like, ‘You will never second-guess me again".[26][27][28]Henson also alleged the production forced the cast to drive in production cars to set. She disagreed with the decision, citing safety and liability concerns, and alleged that she asked, "'Can I get a driver or security to take me?' I’m not asking for the moon. They’re like, 'Well, if we do it for you, we got to do it for everybody.' Well, do it for everybody! It’s stuff like that, stuff I shouldn’t have to fight for."[29][30]Fellow actorDanielle Brooksrevealed the actors did not initially get their own dressing rooms when they showed up for rehearsals, nor was food provided to them at that time.[31]The cast reached out toOprah Winfrey, one of the film's producers who eventually resolved the issue.[32][33][34]
Producer Oprah Winfrey said of the matter, "I’m not in charge of the budget," adding" "whenever I heard there was an issue or there was a problem, there was a problem with a cars or the problem with their food, I would step in and do whatever I could to make it right. And I believe that [Taraji] would even vouch for that and say that is true.”[35]In 2024, Henson toldToday, that she hopes the film's negative press surrounding the working conditions doesn't distract from the film. She said, "I hope they can focus back onto this film, because right now, to me, it feels like what I said is now becoming louder than this beautiful film". She also defended Oprah saying, "What you’re not gonna do is pit two Black women together".[36]
On December 1, 2023,BroadwayWorldrevealed that the film will not be a direct copy-and-paste adaptation of the stage musical, with elements from the novel and the 1985 film also being featured, including "Miss Celie’s Blues (Sister)," the song sung by the character of Shug Avery in the 1985 film. 13 songs from the musical were cut from the film, including "Somebody Gonna Love You," "Our Prayer," "Big Dog," "Dear God - Sofia," "Brown Betty", "Uh-Oh," "African Homeland," "Celie's Curse," "Any Little Thing," "What About Love (Reprise)," "That Fine Mister," "A Tree Named Sofia," and "All We Got to Say," while a song cut from the stage production, titled "She Be Mine," was reinstated for this film.[37][38]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 81% of 255 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.2/10.

Pete Hammond, reviewing the film forDeadline Hollywood, reports that although "Spielberg’s version still resonates", the direction of Bazawule "brings a unique vision that makes this version stand on its own as an authentic and valuable addition toThe Color Purplelegacy", appreciating the photography ofDan Laustsen, which "gives a vision of the early 20th century South rarely seen in films depicting the period, particularly Black lives".[65]Katie Walsh ofLos Angeles Timesdescribed the director's approach as "modern, while paying homage to the traditions of Broadway musicals", while the cast "takes your breath away", praising Barrino for her "stunning performance as Celie, holding the emotional center over decades" and Brooks, who "steals the whole movie, [...] She brings fire, humor and grit to a character who undergoes a dramatic, tragic arc".[66]
Peter BradshawofThe Guardianwrote that although "the plot strands are to finally tie up with startling serendipity", with "warmth and vehemence in this movie, especially in the big ensemble numbers", the film "is less successful in the solo scenes and the evocation of loneliness and suppressed despair", appreciating "an absolute powerhouse trio of female leads here, supercharging the action with their fierce charisma" by Barrino, Henson and Brooks' performances.[67]Peter Debruge ofVarietypointed out that the film made "a satisfying improvement" from the original film adaptation, adding "expressionistic flourishes". Even if "some of these tricks work better than others", the journalist wrote that "all work to expand the experience, makingThe Color Purplefeel even more monumental than it did in Spielberg’s hands".[68]

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.

In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]

On playing the lead villain he explained "there are villainous traits and there are heroic traits in all of us, and as an actor you are taught to dip into all those sections of your personality. I guess, in a non artistic profession, you have to keep certain doors locked. I like to play anything that is significant, and of a quality that I would call a stretch. Anything that is really quite different from what I have done before."[77]On his performance, he thought "he did one of his finest jobs of acting during the filming".[78]While the film got mixed to negative reviews,[79]critic Bernard Drew, in his review published inThe Courier-News, explained he liked it, enjoyed all performances and wrote that Gossett is "unctuous and evil as the arch-fiend".[80]The films was a success and was theeighth-highest-grossing film of 1977in the United States and Canada with a gross of $47.3 million.[81]Overseas, the film was Columbia's highest-grossing film and grossed over $100 million worldwide.[82][83]

He was a guy who was in a shootout in Detroit. He lost his family and close friends. He escaped to Algeria where he was given asylum for 10 years.

They'll have to put a sign on me with my name on it. The role appealed to me. I'll do anything I can to keep from being typecast. Even a small part if it offers something different. I had my choice of playing Mays, the doorman, or Mercer. Mays has a death scene, but Mercer gets to age".[92]At the Emmy Awards, Gossett was nominated for "Outstanding lead actor in a limited series or a special".[93]

Of his role Gossett said "they think he's getting too old. He figures if he trains a young man, they'll put a broom in his hand and take away his ace. To me, he represents old people quote-unquote and he shares their rage and predicament. He's still a vital man, he represents all those people faced with that predicament. I think it's a crime to send people that age off to pasture. They're in the prime of life and they have a lot to offer. I think it puts people in a psychological fear of reaching 70."[103]In his review published inNews-PressBill Hayden wrote that "Louis Gossett Jr. gives a fiery and moving performance in this powerful production as a proud black man who believes he is committing the ultimate crime by growing old."[104]
On July 28 of that year,Taylor Hackford's motion pictureAn Officer and a Gentlemanpremiered. In it Gossett plays drill instructor Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley. The role was originally conceived for a white actor.[105]Hackford said "when I visited the Navy Officers Flight Training Center in Pensacola, FLA, I discovered that many of the Drill Instructors there were men of color. I found it interesting that Black & Brown enlisted men had 'make-or-break' control over whether white college graduates would become officers and fighter pilots. At that moment I changed the casting profile for Sergeant Foley and started meeting actors of color. Lou Gossett came to see me – I knew and admired his stage work. He told me that he'd served in the US Army as a Ranger, so in addition to being an accomplished actor, he knew military life. I hired him on the spot."[106]Hackford also pointed out that they were impressed because he "played the role as it was written'" and none of the script was modified "'to make the character black."[105]Gossett explained that his mindset guided him toward the part as he blamed both "white unconscious racism" and "black acceptance of that, so a black doesn't go out for a part Blacks need to change their mentality to knock down the walls of racism, and this includes trying out for parts like a district attorney or a lawyer or Judge traditional white roles. How do you know they won't hire you? I had to reeducate myself Gossett said. There are parts I'm sure I could have played before I came to this realization." To prepare for the role Gossett spent 10 days with a drill instructor and lifted weights to improve his upper body.[107]During shooting Gossett's accommodation were in different location from the rest of the cast, to keep him emotionally distant from the other actors.[105]The role won him anAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

It is about a prince (Peter Barton) and his guardian played by Gossett who escaped their planet after the royal was assassinated. Now living on earth, the prince, who has telekinetic and mind reading abilities, passes for regular high school student who goes on various adventures.[111]Gossett explained that "it's another role he says he got because neither he nor those casting the film thought of race."[107]Of his role he said "people have been complaining a lot lately about the image of the black actor on television. Well, if there was ever a redeeming character, it's Walter Sheppard. He teaches goodness, character-building, values and morals to young Matthew. He's sort of likeObi-Wanwas onStar Wars."[103]The shooting was delayed due to an on set accident that injured both Gossett and more severely Barton.[112]The show lasted until 1983.[113]
In 1983, he played the title role inSadat, a two-part miniseries which chronicled the life and assassination of Egypt presidentAnwar Sadat.[114]The producers of the show offered the role to Gossett due to his resemblance to Sadat.[115]However, in Egypt, the casting of ablackactor as Sadat was controversial, as theEgyptian Ministry of Culturepointed out that the real Sadat was sensitive about his dark complexion for which he was often ridiculed and that "the portrayal of Sadat by a black has revived the issue of race in Egypt, which is usually deeply submerged." It was among the reasons that a ban on all films and television programs distributed by Columbia Pictures.[116]On playing the role Gossett said "I was becoming over-prepared and stilted. Sadat is so recent in people's memory that I wanted to capture him exactly but what I was doing was becoming an imitation and not a living breathing human. I felt Sadat. I felt from the first day on the set that the spirit of Sadat was part of me I began to move more like him talk like him and even think like him. This is the first time in my career that I have not totally memorized all my lines."[114]For his performance, Gossett was nominated at the Emmy Awards forOutstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series,[117]and was nominated for theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film.[110]
That same year, Gossett acted inJoe Alves's third instalment of the shark attack thriller film seriesJaws 3-D.[118]On accepting the role, Gossett said "I turned downJaws 3-Dthree or four times," he admits. "It was just a little part. Finally they said they'd expand the role." He also added that he accepted "because there was nothing else. There have not been a lot of offers sinceOfficer." On developing his character he said "I made my character a Creole, it gives him a more interesting flavor. He starts off as a shrewd entrepreneur, but he makes one mistake and everything falls through. He's almost likeCaptain Ahab."[119]The film grossed $13,422,500 on its opening weekend,[120]which was 1983's second highest-grossing opening weekend of the year,[121]playing to 1,311 theaters at its widest release and accounting for 29.5% of its final gross.

In 1984, Gossett acted inRichard Lester's ensemble comedyFinders Keepers.[125]The film generally received good reviews.[126][127][128][129][130][131]James Monacoreviewed the film in his book,The Movie Guide, and said of the acting "Finders Keepersbenefits from the well-judged performances of its energetic cast."[132]
Also that year Gossett andMartin Sheenco-starred inDavid Greene's television filmThe Guardian.[133]The inhabitants of a New York City apartment building are plagued by burglaries and murder, and they have finally had enough. So they employ ex-military man (Gossett ) to protect their building as a security guard. His techniques are precise and intense, and soon his overbearing and power-mad nature begins to chafe resident (Sheen).[134]Gossett's role was originally written for a white actor but since he had just won an Oscar for a role that aimed at same demographic he was chosen. WriterRichard Levinsonsaid "Lou had a lot of heat going for him. We didn't have to change anything in the script when he was cast." Gossett appreciated the duality of his role. On the project he said the "script said something about a modern social problem. When I was growing up in Brooklyn, there was a real feeling of community in our neighborhood. That kind of neighborhood is gone, and that's one of the reasons for the increase in crime. I think of the character I play as a necessary evil in today's society."[135]
In 1985, Gossett co-starred withDennis QuaidinWolfgang Petersen'sEnemy Mine. The film is about a human (Quaid) and alien soldier (Gossett), respectively, who become stranded together on an inhospitable planet and must overcome their mutual distrust in order to cooperate and survive.[136]About accepting the project, Gossett explained "everybody turned [the role] down because you couldn't see your face or your eyes. 'How can you do a performance?' So, there's a littleLon Chaney Sr.in me, you gotta try it. That's why I took it, because it was a challenge."[137]The production was troubled as the original director and the producer had creative difference. Petersen was asked to take over the directorial duties, however when he joined he found the original location, and footage unusable. Hence the production moved and new set were built. Quaid and Gossett received a salary to wait throughout the transition so they wouldn't start working on other projects. Also, Gossett's original alien costume was scrapped and it took five months to create the one used in final product.[138]On his preparation Gossett said "I went to the zoo with a mime, a dancer, an athlete and a linguist. There we studied lizards, snakes, wildcats, giraffes and the kangaroos, especially the females with the pouch. I also used a little ordinary cat and dog, and in the scenes where the Drac is in his religious ecstasy, a little bit of Stevie Wonder." On the scene where the alien gives birth he said "I don't think I'm gonna try and bear a child. But I wanted to do it. It was a cinematic first for an actor to give birth to a child. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do, physically, but I took it because I would rather fail doing something difficult than succeed doing something too easy."[139]Petersen said "It took Lou several hours to get into makeup and the sand was always getting under his contact lenses and, yet, he never complained. He also gives a great performance, even though you can only see his lips.

He's credibly extraterrestrial and touchingly human."[145]

He doesn't have all that much dialogue. That makes him very hard to do as an actor. "What you have to do is use more concentration.

Ciara is known for her often "breathysoprano" vocals.[134][135]Allison Stewart ofThe Washington Postcommented that she has a "reedy, agile voice, capable of conveying the only three emotions (sexy, sassy, sad) an R&B singer needs".[136]Randall Roberts of theLos Angeles Timessaid that she "has been the most synthetic of the R&B divas over the past decade, an electro-leaning vocalist whose instrumental palate has heavily favored stark  808 beats, sassy and seductive vocal lines, and, often, weird, futuristic Gary Numan-esque bleeps woven through."[137]He further commented:
"Ciara's sights are mostly set on one aspect of said universal truth -- desire -- and how it manifests itself on the dance floor ... at the mall ... or in the bedroom...[137]
Ciara's debut album featured production fromJazze Pha. In reviewing the album,Slant Magazinenoted the influence ofDestiny's Child, and compared some of its material toAaliyah's, albeit "less sexy".[138]In reviewing her second albumCiara: The Evolution, Jody Rosen ofEntertainment Weeklywrote: "Ciara's comfort with rave-inspired beats sets her apart fromCassie,Amerie,Rihanna, and other would-Beyoncés...[Her] singing is nimble throughout: She whispers, coos, wails, and reels off speedy syncopations worthy of Beyoncé herself."[139]Her third album,Fantasy Ride, saw the singer showcasing a new pop anddancedirection, which she recalled later on her sixth albumJackie. Ciara's music is generallycontemporary R&B, but it also incorporates other genres includinghip hop,crunk,dance-pop,electropopandfunk. Critics have described her singles "Goodies", "1, 2 Step", "Get Up", and "Go Girl" as club bangers.[140]Ciara has also dabbled ingospel,[141]country,[142]andafrobeats.[143]
Ciara said that watchingDestiny's ChildandJanet Jacksonperform on television inspired her to pursue a career in music,[14]and cites Jackson and her brotherMichaelas her biggest inspirations.[144]Ciara considered herself to reach "a career pinnacle" when she featured on Janet Jackson's 2008 albumDiscipline. Ciara spoke of Michael Jackson's legacy, "Whenever someone asks me who inspires me to do what I do, I always say Michael. That's it for me. He's everything to me. He's really a part of the reason why. He's going to be remembered in so many ways for me. I feel it's important for me to continue to let my generation know how important he was to music."[145]
Ciara also citesTLC,Jodeci,[146]Sade,Frank Sinatra,[147]Aaliyah,[148]andWhitney Houston[149]as some of her other musical influences. Her second studio albumCiara: The Evolution(2006) was influenced by Michael Jackson,Prince, and pop singerMadonna.[150]During the recording of her fifth self-titled albumCiara(2013), she was inspired byAl GreenandMissy Elliott.[151]
Ciara has generally received praise for her stage presence and routines during live performances. Dalondo Moultrie ofThe Morning Call'sapplauded Ciara's stage presence saying that she "put on one of the best performances I have seen yet at [Crocodile Rock]".[152]Moultrie continued to call her dance steps "incredible", notings her "pelvic thrusts", "body bending twists", "periodic bursts of light", and commending her for being in sync with the music. In summary, he praised Ciara's live performances for their "high-energy songs, sexy dance moves, flawless vocals, and [the] top-flight light show".[152]Sia Michel ofThe New York Timesalso praised Ciara's relentless professional presence stating: "Ciara led a squad of hip-hop dancers through stylishly choreographed routines. Striding about in a headset, she was a commanding and relentlessly professional presence."[153]Bill White ofSeattle Post-Intelligencerwrote that due to Ciara's high energy, "it hardly mattered that she was singing to backing tracks ... Usually this type of performance seems cut-rate and dishonest, but Ciara, with the help of slick lighting and sharp choreography, made it work".[154]
Ciara has still gotten some criticism for her performances, typically relating to her vocals.Jon CaramanicaofThe New York Timesgave a mixed reception of Ciara's performance ability, writing that her physical style reduced her emotional impact, and that her "lack of vocal presence guarantees that it is easier to connect with her music physically than emotionally."[155]Vincent Jackson ofThe Press of Atlantic Cityalso noted Ciara's limited vocal ability when critiquing herfirst headlining tour, but praised her confidence and approved of her decision "to put most of her energy into her almost nonstop, aerobic dance performance".[156]
Dance is big part of Ciara's artistry and music videos.[157][158]Writing forThe Guardian,Bim Adewunmisaid "She makes music to dance to, and her videos are testament to that ... Ciara's currency as a dancer is precision and high difficulty. Her body becomes a sort of human syncopated beat – an urgent thing, parts moving seemingly independently but all working to a greater good. On a purely technical level, her dancing is damn near untouchable".[159]Ciara's dancing is generally praised and she's often considered one of the best or most emulable dancers in music.[160][161][162]Ciara's dance ability has been compared toMichaelandJanet Jackson.[160][163]Her dancing is often described as sexy, energetic, and precise.[164][165]Ciara is noted for her often tomboyish dance aesthetic andandrogynouschoreography, particularly in her videos for1, 2 StepandLike A Boy.[158]Ciara's style of dancing is generallystreet, but she has also doneballroomandstepin her videos and performances.[166][167]Ciara also did aninterpretive danceroutine inpointe shoesfor herI Betmusic video, though her use of the shoes prompted some backlash from theballetcommunity.[158][168]
"Super C is a character that people will learn more about on this record. That is my alter ego. Super C doesn't hold back. She is definitely aggressive. She goes hard. Super C can do some magical and funky things. She works hard. She dances to the 10th power. She does everything to the 10th power."
At the time ofFantasy Ride's(2009) release, Ciara introduced her alter ego "Super C". Ciara said that Super C is her "inner strength and aggressive persona" – a futuristic, superhero-esque woman, loosely based on the robotic character Ciara portrayed in the "Go Girl" music video. Ciara described her reasoning for developing an alter ego, "There's so much negative energy in the world, especially within the blogging world, they try so hard to tear you down. [With the superhero concept] it's like, 'I refuse to let you and that negative energy tear me down or stop any blessing that I know is there for me.' That's when the inner superhero comes out."[170]
With the release of her debut single "Goodies", Ciara was dubbed thePrincess of Crunk[171][172]or the First Lady of Crunk&B.[173]In the early to mid-2000s, "Goodies" along with other crunk music hits like "Get Low", "Yeah!" and "Freek-a-Leek" produced by Lil Jon climbed to the Top 10 of theBillboardHot 100charts. "Yeah!" and "Goodies" were the first tracks to introduce the substyle of crunk music andcontemporary R&B, calledcrunk&B, to the public. Both of those tracks (performed byUsherand Ciara, respectively) were the top mainstream hits of 2004.[174]Since then, crunk&B has been one of the most popular genres of sung African-American music along withelectropop, the genre that replaced crunk and crunk&B on the charts in 2008. "Goodies" spent seven weeks at number one on theBillboardHot 100, becoming the longest-running number-one debut single by a female artist since 1977.[175]
The album's lead single's success exemplifiedurban music's commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massivecrossoversuccess on theBillboardchartsby R&B and hip hop artists.[176]In 2004, all 12 songs thattopped theBillboardHot 100were African-American recording artists and accounted for 80% of thenumber-one R&B hitsthat year.[176]Along with Usher's streak of singles,Top 40radio and both pop and R&B charts were topped byOutKast's "Hey Ya!",Snoop Dogg's "Drop It Like It's Hot",Terror Squad's "Lean Back", and Ciara's "Goodies".[176]Chris Molanphy ofThe Village Voicelater remarked that "by the early 2000s, urban musicwaspop music."[176]
Ciara is considered to be "one of the most reliable suppliers" of beat-driven party music and the female face of crunk.[177][178]Her debut album has been credited with helping "return  R&B toAtlanta" and setting the standard for a new generation of R&B singers.[179]Many female R&B andK-popacts have had their image or style of music compared to Ciara's.[180][155][181]Ciara peaked commercially in the mid-2000s, but she continued releasing hit songs in the 2010s.Billboardwriter Natalie Weiner said that Ciara's 2013 hit "Body Party" was "one of [her] biggest and most critically acclaimed songs".[182]It was certified double platinum in the U.S. and received numerous accolades.[183][184][185][186]Ciara's 2015 single "I Bet" also went platinum in the U.S.[187]Pitchforkjournalist Katherine St. Asaph took note of Ciara's longevity, and responded to her reemergence in 2018:
"Ciara's "Goodies" came out almost 15 years ago. That's a testament to just how improbably resilient Ciara's career has been. Though she's never quite regained that initial "princess of crunk-n-B" level of mainstream stardom, she has sustained acult fanbaseand delivered a remarkably consistent run of songs to back it up.[188]
Ciara'sviral2018 hit "Level Up" was likely the most saturated hit single of her career.[189][190][191]Along with the wildly popular #LevelUp dance challenge that accompanied, the song was pushed to the forefront of Arizona politicianMark Kelly's winning campaign for the senate.[192]The song is also noted for helping to bringJerseyandBaltimore clubmusic to the mainstream, with the former being incorporated into its production.[193]Ciara's music in general is popular and influential amongstclubandundergroundmusic producers, with many remixes sampling her voice gaining popularity over the years.[194]Canadian underground producerJacques Greenewas convinced to prioritize his music career after his song "Another Girl", which leaned on her vocals, gained traction.[195]Latin R&BartistRauw Alejandroadmired Ciara early in his career because her music was 'club-friendly' and 'ripe for remixing'.[196]
Ciara has been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.[197][158][198]According toThe Fader, Ciara positioned herself as a "tomboyish, androgynous alternative" to her peers and the gender-swapping looks from her "Like A Boy" video both predates similar efforts from artists likeBeyoncéandLady Gaga, and madegender-swapping"cool" for female popstars.[158]The publication also said her dance videos created a template for artists likeTinasheand raised discussion on female sexuality beforefeminismbecame more prominent in the music industry.

Music is a real form of connection to a higher power at its greatest; music was a form of community that brought people together and gave them a common purpose. Jazz is really a term that doesn't encompass what it's pointing at, [...] the intellectual breadth of black geniuses who were basically denied the credential of being a genius in society because of their skin tone. [...] We always talk about improvisation, and it really is one of the only forms of music that exemplifies the American experiment putting all these different cultures into one country and coexisting and trying to create beautiful music together.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
