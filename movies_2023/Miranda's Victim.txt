Phil Hoad ofThe Guardiangave the film 4 out of 5 stars and stated, "Danner essentially pits the rights of the suspect and the victim in a tug of war for the film's centre ground." Hoad also wrote, "It is meatily performed across the entire ensemble, with the curt and resolute Breslin selflessly letting the legal eagles fly high."[19]
Donald Liebenson ofRogerEbert.comopined, "The script sometimes wields a heavy expository hand" and "The distinguished cast is uninformedly excellent in a film they clearly did not do for the money (one of the joys of the endangered mid-budget film)."[20]
Patrice Witherspoon ofScreen Rantnoted, "Crucially, Danner gives her actors the space to excel in every moment, giving us a compelling final product that is worth the watch. Abigail Breslin certifies her talent with every tear shed while giving an equally amazing physical performance. Ryan Phillippe also returns to form with his cutthroat approach to his character John Flynn."[21]

The long list of Sutherland's roles and accomplishments shows a man who understood emotion well. But it's this marriage of suspicion and empathy, human feeling and the fear of humanity gone wrong, that secured his place in acting history and made him an uncommon kind of star. He didn't disappear into a role, not exactly; he was too distinctive for that. More often, the role disappeared into him, and the result was something unforgettable".
Helen Mirrennamed Sutherland as "one of the smartest actors I ever worked with. He had a wonderful enquiring brain and a great knowledge of a wide variety of subjects. He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity, and with seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became."[156]David Oyelowo, who worked with Sutherland on what became his final performance inLawmen: Bass Reeves,stated that "Given the iconic status he rightly achieved, having a front row seat to Donald Sutherland's last onscreen performance was both a privilege and clear evidence to me of his deep passion for the craft of acting. The glint in his eye was that of an inquisitive, hungry artist still on the hunt for the truth. Seeing that glint, up close, in the eyes of a legend was something to behold."[157]Jane Fonda, who worked with Sutherland on the 1971 filmKlute, wrote: "Donald was a brilliant actor and a complex man who shared quite a few adventures with me, such as theFTA Show, an anti-Vietnam war tour that performed for 60,000 active duty soldiers, sailors, and marines in Hawaii, Okinawa, the Philippines, and Japan in 1971. I am heartbroken."[158]
Sutherland'sBBCobituary says that the "late Donald Sutherland cast a literal and figurative shadow over his industry for almost 50 years".[159]The Guardian'sPeter Bradshawwrote that "Sutherland was an utterly unique actor and irreplaceable star" and "was an aristocrat of screen actors".[160]Variety'sOwen Gleibermanwrote that "in 1970, Donald Sutherland ... was the coolest movie star on the planet. The moment I saw him in "MASH," I knew he was the person I wanted to be, the same way that I wanted to beMick JaggerorSteve McQueen".[161]Canadian Prime MinisterJustin Trudeaustated, "He was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft, and truly a great Canadian artist and he will be deeply missed."[162]
Over his career he receivednumerous accoladesincluding aPrimetime Emmy Award, aGolden Globe Award, and anAcademy Honorary Award. He received theCommandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettresin 2012, and the Companion of the Order of Canada (CC) in 2019.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
