It serves as a sequel toGood Burger(1997), which was based on a comedy sketch featured on theNickelodeonseriesAll That. The story follows Dexter Reed reuniting with Ed at his old workplace Good Burger, where the pair unveils a secret involving a successor to their old rival restaurant.
Talks of a sequel forGood Burgeroccurred in 2018 through the interest of both Thompson and Mitchell, three years after the pair were reunited in a sketch onThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallonin 2015.[1]The sequel was officially announced in March 2023. Kopelow and Seifert, the co-creators of the original sketch and co-writers of the first film, were hired to write the screenplay, and Traill was confirmed to be directing. Thompson and Mitchell were also confirmed to be returning as Dexter Reed and Ed, respectively. The film was produced byNickelodeon MoviesandAwesomeness Films, and was filmed from May to June of that same year, mirroring the same production window as the original.[2]Record producerOak Felderwas hired to compose the film's score.
Good Burger 2was released on November 22, 2023, on the streaming serviceParamount+, and received mixed reviews.
Twenty-six years after the events ofthe first film, Dexter Reed has quit Good Burger in the hopes of becoming a successful entrepreneur, but his ideas turn out to be failures. His latest invention, a spray that can make any material flame-retardant, backfires as he attempts to showcase the material on his own house in a demonstration for investors, includingMark Cuban, that ends up burning it down. Left without a home and business, Dexter looks to move in with his sister Charlotte, but she refuses as she is one of his investors. He then calls Ed, who still works at Good Burger and agrees to let him stay at his home.
Dexter visits Good Burger to find numerous new employees: twins Cindy and Mindy; the elderly Ruth; Ed's son Ed 2, who looks and acts exactly like Ed; and Dexter's niece Mia, Charlotte's daughter who wants nothing to do with Dexter. The restaurant has a new manager named Mr. Jensen. In addition to working as the cashier, Ed is now the owner due to his love of the restaurant. The only familiar employee is Fizz, whom Ed had accidentally left in the freezer for 22 years and is thawed out. At Ed's home, Dexter meets Ed's family: his wife Edie and their numerous other children who look like Ed and are named after condiments. Dexter is shocked to find that Roxanne, who previously tried to seduce Ed for the recipe for his sauce for Mondo Burger, now works as their nanny.
Dexter decides to work at Good Burger again while considering his next entrepreneurial venture. When he pitches his permanent ice idea to Mia, she laughs it off. Meanwhile, Ed has been hounded by Cecil McNevin, a lawyer for the conglomerate MegaCorp, to turn Good Burger into a global franchise, but Ed is uncertain. MegaCorp sends a pair of goons to force Ed into signing the agreement, but Ed's natural clumsiness gets them hurt. Cecil tries to appeal to Dexter, explaining their intent is to expand Good Burger but not to take it away from Ed and are planning to give the employees big raises. Dexter considers it based on the financial benefit and then brings Ed to lunch with Cecil to explain the deal and they both agree to sign.
At the franchise launch party, Cecil reveals that the flagship store is being shut down with their employees being fired as mandated by the contract, which Dexter and Ed had failed to read before signing. With everyone turning against Dexter, he takes Ed to MegaCorp headquarters to demand they reinstate the flagship restaurant and rehire the employees. They meet with the CEO Katt Bozwell, the sister of former Mondo Burger owner Kurt Bozwell who wants revenge on Good Burger after sending Kurt away to prison. She is planning to rebrand the restaurant Mega Good Burger and has plans to replace all employees with robot versions of Ed. After destroying the Good Burger car, MegaCorp sends them home in a self-driving delivery car which Katt sends out of control to get rid of them. Dexter forces the car to drive in a circle until it runs out of power.
Lamenting his failures, Dexter gets Ed to rally the Good Burger employees to stop the launch of Mega Good Burger. They plan to infiltrate MegaCorp headquarters so Mia, a computer expert, can shut down the machines before the launch. While Dexter, Ed, and Mia infiltrate the building, the other employees create a distraction, but their ruse is discovered. Dexter and Ed get separated from Mia and find the control room while Mia is trapped on a conveyor belt. Dexter goes off to find Mia, leaving Ed to shut down the restaurants. Dexter saves Mia, but they are captured and taken to the control room where Ed is also taken. As Katt gives the first demonstration on national television, the robotic Ed throws food at her, followed by the other machines shooting food at everyone at every location around the world, due to Ed reprogramming the machines to go haywire.
In the aftermath, MegaCorp is shut down and Ed is given back ownership of the original Good Burger. Charlotte comes to visit Dexter and Mia and Dexter is allowed to apologize to her. Ed and Ed 2 reveal to Dexter that they figured out how to make permanent ice and Good Burger successfully sells it to Mark Cuban, making $10,000,000.

Murtada Elfadl ofVarietycriticized the lack of use of Thompson in the film, saying: "The sequel denies him a showcase for his obvious comedic talent. Forced into playing the straight man to Mitchell's more flashy character, Thompson ends up explaining the wacky shenanigans happening instead of doing anything comedic. Almost every nonsensical line Mitchell utters is followed by a sober explanation from Thompson, suggesting the writers don't trust the audience to get the obvious jokes". He also took issue with the underused cameos of otherSNLcast, labeling them "wasted one-scene characters". He ended his review saying, "When a fast food sequel takes this long to make, it ought to come out tasting a lot better thanGood Burger 2".[24]
Jennifer Green reviewing forCommon Sense Mediagave the film a score of three out of five and wrote "Mitchell, Thompson, Howery, and Bell are all comical in their over-the-top roles, though Mitchell's Ed is funnier if viewed as single-minded rather than just simple (or even intellectually challenged)".[25]
Good Burger 2debuted at number one as the most-watched domestic launch in its first three days for an original film in Paramount+ history, as of December 2023. Viewership for the film was up 50% compared to the previous record holder,Pet Sematary: Bloodlines.[26]
Director Phil Traill told theRadio Timesin November 2023, that there were plans for a third film and other sequels:
The character of Ed has not changed [...] he now has a family, he's got a bunch of kids and a wife, but he is still the same old Ed. As that doesn't change, we can just do it again and again and put them in crazier and crazier situations. There's plans afoot for various things. I don't think it has to be limited to a trilogy, it can go on.[27]

Nickelodeon Movies Inc.[1]is an Americanfilm productioncompany based inLos Angeles, Californiaand owned byParamount Global. Originally founded in 1995, it serves as both the film production arm of the American children's networkNickelodeonand the family film distribution label ofParamount Pictures.

In 1993, Nickelodeon agreed to a two-year contract with20th Century Foxto make feature films. The joint venture would mostly produce new material, though a Nickelodeon executive did not rule out the possibility of making films based onThe Ren & Stimpy Show,RugratsandDoug.[2]None of the movies were produced due to the 1994 acquisition of Paramount Pictures by Nickelodeon's parent company,Viacom, and they would distribute the movies instead. With the creative differences withJohn Kricfalusi, the creator ofRen & Stimpyand an inability to market that property in a family-friendly manner instead of a "cynical and gross humor" scuttled the film.[3][4]However, Paramount and Viacom would go forward and start development onThe Rugrats Moviea year after the acquisition.
The Nickelodeon version of theDougfilm was not made due to the acquisition of the show's production studio,Jumbo Pictures, byThe Walt Disney Companyin 1996.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (FullÂ list...)

She was the fourth child ofEugÃ¨ne de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with AmÃ©lie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria AmÃ©liawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and AmÃ©lie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of AmÃ©lie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich DÃ¼rck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
