After incurring a manic bout of bullying, her miserable roommate, Eliza (Blim), notifies the administration and hercraft storeproprietressmother, Sherri (Smith-Cameron), of Clemence's disparaging attitude and mood swings. This prompts Sherri to wrangle her daughter into quitting school and compel her to begrudgingly return home, whereupon she discovers her old bedroom has been converted into a home office. Instead, she'll be "banished" to the furnished basement.
Upon visiting apsychiatrist(Buck), Clemence is diagnosed withbipolar disorderand is prescribed a regimen of medication beginning withlithiumto balance her oscillatingmaniaanddepressionepisodes, which will require experimental adjustments. Initially, she is defiant and reluctant; however, an exasperated Sherri encourages her.

Her father, localschoolteacherDon (Buscemi), attempts to be relentlessly positive, while her younger siblings are far less enthused. Her sister, Carlin (Robinson), fears Clemence's attributes will be imparted unto her, and thus strives to achieve highACT scoresto prevent this. Her brother, Neil (Oleff), is trepidatious about being absorbed into Clemence's unstable orbit, and retains an ambivalent attitude when in her presence.

She forges a strained connection with co-worker Beth (Simone), and manages to stay sober from alcohol and illicit drugs.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 80% of 15 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.9/10.[13]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 61 out of 100, based on four critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[14]
Mike McGranaghan ofThe Aisle Seatwrote, "A personal pet peeve ismovies that use mental illnessas a “quirky” personality trait for their central characters....The Year Betweendeftly avoids all that. This is one of the most authentic depictions of bipolar disorder I've seen."[15]Dennis Harvey fromVarietyis equally effusive, praising Heller for maintaining a tonal balance of the subject matter: "The result is a useful mix of the pseudo-random and finely honed that refuses to hand-wring over Clem’s travails, yet simultaneously makes an upbeat case for her emerging from them intact — even if she’ll never exactly be Miss Congeniality." He also lauds the performances from the cast, and stated, "[The characters are] all amusing, yet free of caricature, and the prickly dynamics between them feel tart without being cynical."[16]
Nick Allen, a critic atRogerEbert.com, wrote in his 3½/4-star review, that "Alex Heller pulls off a dazzling tonal high-wire act for her directorial debut"; compliments the film's dialogue as "naturally, wildly funny, without sugarcoating the issues it embraces"; and concludes, "…that a daring dramedy like this can be made, and tactfully.…It's proof of a major talent."[17]Steven Warner ofIn Review Onlinepraised Buscemi and Smith-Cameron, both of whom he stated "have arguably never delivered a bad performance in their entire careers".[18]
Rendy Jones ofRendy Reviewshad a mixed reception to the film, rating it 2½/5 stars. Jones applauded Heller's "deadpan charisma"; alluded to her having "chemistry with her co-stars", especially for her acting debut; and particularly complimenting the acting ensemble of Smith-Cameron, Buscemi, Robinson, and Oleff (who portray her mom, dad, sister, and brother, respectively). On the flipside, Jones had a bad reaction to the "deplorably crass main character" and took umbrage with the screenplay, evoking unfavorable comparisons toLady Bird(2017). He felt it was "too formulaic…reminiscent ofJudd Apatow'sslacker comedies".[19]In a more scathingly negative review, Carla Hay ofCulture Mixlambasts the character of Clemence, calling her an "emotional terrorist", and summarizing, "The misguided comedy/drama“The Year Between”is an irritating slog that offensively uses bipolar disorder as an excuse for the central character to be cruel and toxic to everyone around her."[20]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
