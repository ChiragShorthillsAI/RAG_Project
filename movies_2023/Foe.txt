Foeis a 2023science fictionpsychological thrillerfilm directed by Australian directorGarth Davis, from a screenplay he co-wrote with Canadian writerIain Reid, based on Reid's 2018novel of the same name. It’s an Australian-U.S. co-production filmed in Australia. StarringSaoirse Ronan,Paul Mescal, andAaron Pierre, it concerns a young couple, Hen and Junior, having marital issues when Junior is called to serve on a space station.
Foepremiered at the2023 New York Film Festivalon September 30, 2023. It was released in the United States byAmazon MGM Studioson October 6, 2023, and in Australia byTransmission Filmson November 2, 2023. In early 2024, the film was available to stream onAmazon Prime Video.
In the near future, Junior lives with his wife Henrietta 'Hen' on a remote farm. One night a stranger appears at their door who introduces himself as Terrance from anaerospacecorporation called OuterMore. Terrance announces that Junior has been drafted to work on the Installation, a largespace stationin orbit around Earth. He will remain there for about two years before returning home. Although there are signs that Hen is deeply unhappy, Junior is very protective of Hen and likes the routine of their life together. He is not happy about leaving Hen alone for so long. Terrance reassures Junior that while he is gone, he will be replaced by abiomechanicalduplicate of himself that will keep Hen company. Junior is horrified at the concept, but ultimately has no choice, as the government has mandated that all those selected for participation in the Installation must go. Terrance begins to visit the farm house regularly to interview Junior and collect data to help configure his replacement.
Relations between Junior and Hen become more visibly strained after Terrance’s first visit. After a brief period of tension, Junior expresses to Hen that he wants to work on their relationship, and she agrees. The couple becomes more spontaneous, affectionate, and caring towards each other. As they grow more in love, Junior begins to resent Terrance's frequent visits.
After about two years, Terrance moves in with them full-time so he can monitor Junior's daily routine. During his extended stay, Terrance also spends time interviewing Hen. This angers Junior, who has become increasingly jealous and suspicious of both Hen and Terrance. Junior manages to eavesdrop on some of Hen’s and Terrance’s conversations and learns that Hen often feels stifled and trapped in her marriage, and that she feels he will not allow her to grow or pursue her own interests. Once Terrance asks her if she would like to get away, and she relates to him a fantasy she has of walking out on her husband and experiencing life beyond the farm - somewhere with other people and new ideas. After seeing Terrance spend so much time with Hen, Junior becomes convinced that it is Terrance who will be replacing him when he has gone.
After a climactic confrontation with some OuterMore employees, Junior is knocked out. He wakes up hog tied on the floor of his guest bedroom, in front of an audience of OuterMore employees. Terrance congratulates him, saying that he did very well. Junior is confused, then astounded when another man looking exactly like him walks in through the door. Terrance introduces the stranger as the real Junior who has just returned from the Installation. He explains to the tied-up Junior that he is the duplicate, placed in the home and activated by Terrance’s car headlights during Terrance’s first visit to the house. The duplicate refuses to believe this and cries out to Hen for help, but she remains quiet in another room. Finally, Hen cannot bear the sound of duplicate Junior’s pleas and she fights through OuterMore security to comfort him. She then becomes belligerent, attacking the onlooking OuterMore employees for being cruel to the duplicate. Security drags her outside and holds her there. Her display of emotion stuns everyone in the room including her husband, the real Junior. As the duplicate becomes increasingly distressed, Terrance says, "it’s time for this to end," and shrink wraps him for storage. Terrance remarks that this unexpected scientific breakthrough of love between a human and a biomechanical duplicate will be written about for years.
The real Junior is pleased to be back home again with his wife, but is still a bit disturbed and offended by her display of affection towards his duplicate. She tells Junior that the duplicate helped her rediscover her love for her real husband by reminding her what their relationship used to be like. She says she regrets him having been shut down but wants to find that dynamic again with the real Junior. This angers Junior, who can't understand how she could have felt anything at all for her "fake digital husband." Their relationship deteriorates as Hen realizes that the real Junior no longer has the qualities she loved in the duplicate, and maybe never did.
Eventually, Hen walks out. We see her on a bus, narrating that there will only ever be one Hen. Terrance comes to the house, leaving his headlights on as Junior allows him inside. He sees that before Hen left, she destroyed the piano that the real Junior never allowed her to play. That night Hen returns, but has changed – she is affectionate, submissive, and happy. She promises she will never leave. Junior is slightly wary, but pleased to have his wife back to the way he likes her. A few days later, Terrance visits again briefly to check on them. Hen greets him warmly and tells him that everything is fine. Junior agrees, adding, "things are finally getting back to normal."

But despite the stars' best, hot-and-bothered exertion, Davis and Reid's screenplay eventually hangs them out to dry".[15]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
