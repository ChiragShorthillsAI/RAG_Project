Robert Abele from theLos Angeles Timeswrote, "The hack-noir ofGod Is a Bulletis one long slog".[11]Mary Beth McAndrews ofDread Centralawarded the film one and a half stars out of five and wrote, "Cassavetes gets in his own way with a bloated attempt at exploitation that goes so far as to be more boring than interesting."[12]Whang Yee Ling ofThe Straits Timesawarded the film two stars and wrote, "But no number of David Bowie and Bob Dylan on the soundtrack will make this exploitation picture the arty thriller Cassavetes seems to think it is."[13]Christian Zilko ofIndieWiregraded the film a C− and wrote, "A tighter edit that prioritized the rescue plot over meandering character development probably could have turnedGod Is a Bulletinto a fun airplane movie, but Cassavetes’ arthouse ambitions always resurface at inopportune times."[14]
Robert Daniels ofRogerEbert.comawarded the film one and a half stars and wrote, "If God is a bullet, it can’t come fast enough."[15]Keith Garlington of theArkansas Democrat-Gazettegave the film a negative review and wrote, "God Is a Bulletis hopelessly dark and dour -- a seemingly endless two hour 35 minute malaise of misery that eventually wears you down and even worse tests your patience."[16]Meagan Navarro ofBloody Disgustingawarded the film three "skulls" out of five and wrote, "The filmmaker’s staging and the natural charm and charisma of Coster-Waldau and Monroe, no matter how buried under grit and tattoos, offsets the otherwise familiar setup."[17]Dennis Harvey ofVarietygave the film a negative review and wrote, "These 156 minutes, (...), are not exactly dull. But they are rather ludicrous, without being much fun."[18]
Richard Whitaker ofThe Austin Chronicleawarded the film three stars out of five and wrote, "But the resolute commitment to finding tiny sparks of hope in a pitch-black cosmos yields its own bitter and oddly warming reward."[19]Luke Y. Thompson ofThe A.V. Clubgraded the film a D+ and wrote, "CutGod Is A Bulletdown to a tight 90 minutes, and it might at least consistently deliver the cheap thrills and nihilistic kick it only occasionally achieves."[20]Ross McIndoe ofSlant Magazineawarded the film one and a half stars out of five and wrote, "Aside from the red stuff, the film is scarcely interested in what's inside its characters."[21]Frank ScheckofThe Hollywood Reportergave the film a negative review and wrote that it "Shoots itself in the foot."[22]
Jeannette Catsoulis ofThe New York Timesgave the film a negative review and wrote, "But themisogynyof the movie’s risibly sadistic villains is only one distasteful thread in this sleazy saga of rescue and revenge."[23]Peter Martin ofScreen Anarchygave the film a positive review and wrote, "As Bob and Case, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Maika Monroe capture the personalities of characters who are often as scary to watch as anyone else on screen. Their shared intensity starts high and kicks quickly into overdrive, which animates the film past the breaking point."[24]Bob Strauss of theSan Francisco Chroniclegave the film a negative review and wrote, "The result is a distasteful, overlong slog, but at least the filmmaker appears to have put everything he wanted to up on the screen."[25]

At age five, Clay was entertaining his family withimpressions, and by seven he was playing drums, inspired by the sounds ofbig band music.[12][13]Clay attendedJames Madison High Schoolin Brooklyn and as a teenager worked as a drummer on theCatskill Mountainscircuit in the 1970s, playingbar mitzvahsand weddings under the name Clay Silvers.[13][14][15]Upon returning to New York City, he failed to form a big band of his own. He pursued higher education but dropped out to become a full-time comedian.[13][15]Clay citesElvis Presley,Fonzie,John Travolta, andSylvester Stalloneas his heroes.[14]
Clay began his stand-up career in 1978 when he auditioned at Pips comedy club in Sheepshead Bay, which turned into a headline spot at the venue the next week, billed as Andrew Clay.[14]His act was mainly impressions, including a character named "The Diceman", based onJerry LewisasBuddy LovefromThe Nutty Professor, which transformed intoJohn TravoltainGrease.[15]It took him three weeks to prepare the act.[13]A picture of him on stage during his early sets at Pips was described: "In a baggy white shirt, pants rolled up to his knees and a pair of thick glasses", with a black leather jacket underneath the shirt so he could seamlessly switch to his Travolta character when the lights went out.[14]With his new act, Clay graduated to larger and more prestigious comedy venues, includingThe Improv,Catch a Rising Star, andDangerfield's.[15]He recalled his father being supportive of his act during one performance at Dangerfield's. "He knew it was different right off the bat [...] He saw it worked". The persona was more of a shock to his mother, but she got used to it and he recalled her laughing at his jokes.[14]
By 1980, Clay had moved to Los Angeles and landed work at theComedy Store, owned byMitzi Shore.[14][15]His sets were not an instant hit, and because of his dirty act and her unwillingness to have other comics follow him, Shore had Clay perform at late hours, making him "wait and perform for ten drunks".[14]In 1982, Clay landed his first film role, inWacko.[15]In 1983, Clay added the "Diceman" moniker to his name and no longer relied on impressions, instead creating an alter ego based on his heroes.[14][15]He first used the act at the Comedy Store after he was asked to fill in for a comic who canceled their spot. He said: "I didn't have my Jerry Lewis stuff with me, so I just winged it, saying whatever popped in my head".[16]
His performances at the venue led to his first sitcom roles, with appearances onM*A*S*HandDiff'rent Strokes, and feature-length films, includingMaking the Grade(1984),Pretty in Pink(1986), andCasual Sex?(1988).

Clay's breakthrough came in 1988 when he performed at an all-male Big Brother Association dinner event with "all of Hollywood's royalty [...] dressed in tuxedos, and I show up in a black leather jacket with a flag on the back that said 'Rock and Roll'".

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
