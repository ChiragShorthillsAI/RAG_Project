The film starts off in Rome, Italy 1516, whereLeonardo da Vinciis using a 'telescope', made out of a mirror contraption, to examine the Moon's features in order to find if there was indeed life and seas on its surface. Leonardo is followed by members of thePapal Courtinto the room whereZoroastroreveals a human body for scientific probing, to search for theanswer to lifeitself and the soul. The Pope is informed of this and orders Leonardo to cease further investigation intoGod's works.
A soldier informs the Pope of the defeat of the army and their Milanese allies atMarignanoand appoints Leonardo as a military engineer; however, his career is short-lived as he persuades the Pope to make peace with theFrench king, Francis I. Leonardo shows Francis his inventions and Francis decides to invite Leonardo to theroyal court.
Leonardo arrives inAmboise, and Francis orders Leonardo and his assistant,Cecco, to visit the under-construction castle inRemorantin, where he first meetsMarguerite. Being away from the Pope, Leonardo continues his search for the soul and is confronted byDeath. Leonardo explains his findings to Marguerite and she intends to help him in his research. Marguerite helps Leonardo build his 'Ideal City' instead of the castle which Francis had in mind.
As Francis prepares for the festivities to which he has invited EmperorCharles Vand KingHenry VIII, Leonardo is forced to stop designing his Ideal City and works on inventions that Francis can show off to the other kings (including military devices and an equestrian statue of Francis).
Leonardo falls ill and is visited by the Papal Court, he decides to show them his research on the soul; however, Cecco disagrees with Leonardo's decision. As he is lying in bed he claims that he has discovered the "Secret to Life itself".
Leonardo stages a show on the Solar System (with the Sun played by Francis in person) and the understanding of the Universe. A song called "A Life well spent is long" is interpreted and Leonardo flies into what appears to be the Milky Way may suggest his death.

How dare you? How dare you create a world where there is such misery that's not our fault? It's utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?"[262]Within days, the video was viewed over five million times.[263]Fry later stated he did not refer to any specific religion: "I said quite a few things that were angry at this supposed God. I was merely saying things thatBertrand Russelland many finer heads of the mind have said for many thousands of years, going all the way back to the Greeks."[264]"Because the God who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, utter maniac."[265]In May 2017, it was announced that Fry, along with broadcasterRTÉ, were under criminal investigation for blasphemy under theDefamation Act 2009, following a complaint from a member of the public about the broadcast: the case was dropped afterGardaíconfirmed that they had not been able to locate a sufficient number of offended people.[266]The following year, in 2018, the article on blasphemy was removed from the Irish Constitution following a referendum.

I wish I could take credit for ushering the club up from League One to the Premiership during that time on the Board. Actually, I'm going to. It was all me. It can't have been a coincidence ... But now I'm so happy to relinquish my seat on the board to Thomas Smith and to engage as fully as I can in the role of ambassador for Norwich City."[293]In February 2014, Fry became the honorary president ofProud Canaries, a supporters' group for Norwich City's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender fans.[294]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
