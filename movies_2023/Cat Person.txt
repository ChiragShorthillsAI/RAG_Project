College sophomore Margot works at a local movie theater. Her roommate, Taylor, moderates a feministsubredditcalled "The Vagenda", and tends to see the worst in men. Margot begins dating a frequent visitor of the movie theater, Robert. Margot begins to imagine Robert violently attacking her.
After their first official date, Robert learns Margot is only 20. They are turned away from a bar and return to his house to have sex. Throughout the encounter, Margot speaks to a second version of herself. Her other self tries to convince her to tell Robert she has changed her mind. Instead, Margot has sex with him and fakes an orgasm, telling her other self she is afraid of violent retaliation. She discovers Robert is 33, and notes that the house has no sign of the cats he mentioned in his texts.
Margot debates whether or not toghostRobert and imagines him dying in various ways. Taylor steals Margot's phone and texts him "I'm not interested please stop texting." Robert initially takes this well, but later sends Margot a barrage of messages and calls her a whore.
Later, Margot realizes Robert is following her. She reports this to the police, who say he technically is not breaking the law, but advise her to contact the reporting officer if she has more solid evidence. Margot considers buying a taser, and the salesperson suggests she buy a gun. She ends up buying tracking devices to see if Robert is actually stalking her.
While planting the tracking device in Robert's car, she comes face to face with a dog, the same dog she previously saw inside the dorm. She realizes that Robert had been following her before they met. Robert hears the commotion and comes into the garage to investigate, discovering Margot. In a panic, Margot accidentally sprays herself with pepper spray and hits her head on the garage floor, rendering her unconscious.
When Margot regains consciousness, she finds herself inside Robert's house. Robert explains that he stalked her before they began dating, and they begin to argue. He muses the idea of drugging Margot to induce memory loss and dropping her off at her dorm, fearing that if she left in her current injured state, she would alter the story to be in her favor, which could possibly lead to Robert getting arrested. Margot tries to escape, but Robert drags her back inside and a physical struggle ensues.
During the struggle, Margot opens a door that leads to the basement, and a cat escapes, meaning Robert did not lie about having cats after all. They continue to fight and end up falling down the basement stairs. During the fall, a space heater is knocked over and starts a fire. Robert climbs into his house's cistern to avoid the flames and Margot hesitates before joining him. Both survive the fire.
Margot wakes up in the hospital and eventually recovers. She was told that Robert left town and did not leave a way for anyone to contact him. After Margot returns to work at the movie theater, a new man hits on her.

In 1991 it bought a five percent stake in the independent American studioCarolco Pictures.[2]However, in 1992, Le Studio Canal+ suffered financial difficulties afterCarolco Picturesentered a corporate restructure.[citation needed]

They contacted me again when they had allocated some money to experiment in making a web series. At first, I thought I didn't know what to say, I didn't know what to write and then thought it might be really fun to do little short films about animals. This is how the first three episodes ofGreen Pornocame about. When I showed them the pilot, Sundance commissioned eight more. It was a huge hit![16]

When talking about motherhood, I would find examples of ten different species that either don't get pregnant in the belly but in the mouth or back. Or species that abandon their children all-together so that I don't tell ten stories that are too similar."[16]
After the completion of herGreen Pornoproductions, Rossellini acted in the filmEnemy, withJake Gyllenhaal, which was shown at the 2013Toronto International Film Festival(TIFF). Rossellini praised the film during a TIFF interview: "I love the subtlety of the film. It reminded me of Kafka. It's very metaphysical, but yet it's also a solid thriller. It made me leap up out of my seat at the end." Rossellini also played the silent film actorRudolph Valentino's mother[24]inVlad Kozlov'sSilent Life, a feature-length version of the director's silent, black-and-white short filmDaydreams of Rudolph Valentino.[25]Kozlov's film was due for release in 2012, but, as of February 2014, the film has not been officially released.[26]

Rossellini's friend,Carole Bouquet, also a model who later became an actress, suggested thatGreen Pornocould be transformed into a lecture format with a longer duration. Bouquet then introduced Rossellini to the French filmmaker and screenwriter,Jean-Claude Carrière, and they created a 70-minute-long monologue that expands upon theGreen Pornofilms. The structure of the performance is in accordance with the types of reproductive systems:
Some animals reproduce with male and female; some animals change sex – they start female and they end male or vice-versa. Some fish do that. Some animals are hermaphrodites – they don't need anybody, they have both vaginas and penises. Then we have animals that don't need sex at all, they just clone themselves.[21]
In the live show, Rossellini explores the topics of homosexuality ("I think society has made the mistake of seeing the act of making love or mating as an act of reproduction, when actually it is used for other things, too. Animals use it for social events, bonding, solving conflict and so on.") and maternal instincts, and has explained that her research has influenced her perspective on societal notions of beauty: "If you look at nature, there is no perfection. Everything is always evolving and adapting according to whatever the environmental pressure. The more diversity there is, the more things are going to survive."[21]
Rossellini debuted the live version ofGreen Pornoat theAdelaide Festival of Artson 15 March 2014 and was warmly received by the audience.

Rossellini's "smallest circus in the world", a stage play exploring the ability of animals to think, was premiered in May 2018, at the Jerome Robbins Theater of the Baryshnikov Arts Center. The play "addresses the scientific discoveries about animal minds, intelligence, and emotions. Joined onstage by various animals portrayed by Pan, her trained dog, Rossellini transforms herself intoAristotle,Descartes,B.F. Skinner,Charles Darwin, and more, to deliver a vivid monologue about the brilliance of the animal kingdom".[34]
Rossellini performed "Link Link Circus" (as in Ring Ring) as a benefit for The Gateway Performing Arts Center of Suffolk County, inBellport, New York, the south shore Long Island village where she is a local organic farmer.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
