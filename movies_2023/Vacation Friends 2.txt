After theevents of the first film, Marcus and Emily join Ron and Kyla, along with their infant son (also named Marcus) and Maurillio - acting as a babysitter - for a trip to theCaribbean. Marcus has an ulterior motive for the trip, planning to interview withKoreanhotel company Kim Wae for a job to build a five-star hotel inChicagoafter Ron and Kyla have left. As on their previous vacation, Ron and Kyla encourage Marcus and Emily to party excessively. The next morning, Marcus discovers that his meeting has been moved up, and the Kim Wae executives are already at the hotel ahead of company owner Mrs. Kim's arrival.
The foursome meet for drinks with Kim Wae executive Yeon, who tells Marcus he is not his first choice for the Chicago project. The event is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of Kyla's father Reese, who has just been released fromSan Quentin State Prison. Reese quickly clashes with Ron, who is unaccustomed to having people dislike him. Reese tells Kyla that he has an investment opportunity for acryptocurrencycalled SCOM Coin. Marcus and Emily are immediately dubious, but Emily encourages Marcus to have faith in Reese.
Marcus and Ron take Reese surfing, where they see Reese meet with mysterious stranger Jerome. Marcus and Ron are goaded by Yeon and Reese, respectively, into surfing high waves; Marcus is badly injured after wiping out. At the hotel casino, Marcus forces Ron to play a drinking game, putting Kim Wae executive Minjin in the hospital. Emily is ejected after Kyla gives hercard countingtips. Reese meets with drug lord Warren, and makes a deal to recover Warren's downed plane. Warren threatens to kill Reese, but is interrupted by Marcus and Ron's arrival. Later, the two return a drunken Yeon to his hotel room, who endorses Marcus for the project but complains that Mrs. Kim does not value his opinion.
Reese invites the four on a snorkeling expedition as a cover for him and Jerome to retrieve five million dollars in cash from Warren's plane. As they depart, they are chased by authorities for trespassing inCubanwaters. The group manages to escape, but damage to the plane forces them to make a crash landing. Jerome escapes with a bag of money, while the rest is destroyed by the plane exploding. The crash is spotted by Warren and his men, and the five are chased and captured. Reese lies to Warren, telling him that the money was never recovered. Warren's men trap the group in acargo containerwhile they go to retrieve the money. Ron and Reese begin to argue, but are interrupted as the container is dropped into the water, leaving the group to drown. Ron lights ajoint, using the smoke to discover a weak point and break open the container. Kyla hotwires a car to assist the escape.
The group rushes back to the hotel, chased by Warren's men, to get Marcus to his meeting. After reaching the hotel, Reese, Marcus, and Ron are held up by Warren's men, but are saved by Maurillio, who impersonates notorious drug kingpin Chencho Novar to negotiate a peace. Warren agrees to release Ron and Marcus, but demands the five million dollars be repaid for Reese's freedom. Ron agrees to pay the ransom, revealing that he took Reese's SCOM Coin tip and made millions from it. Reese is amazed at Ron's generosity and gives him and Kyla his blessing. Marcus rushes to stop a departing Mrs. Kim, but she is unwilling to hear him out after failing to make their meeting. Yeon speaks up on Marcus's behalf, winning him the job. The group celebrates, but theFBIarrives, revealing that Reese was not paroled, but in fact broke out of prison to spend time with Kyla. The rest of the group make plans for the evening, except for Ron, who plans to attend to "unfinished business" - a drinking rematch with Minjin.

It was launched on October 29, 2007, initially as ajoint venturebetweenNews Corporation(later21st Century Fox) andNBC Universal, which was laterbought byComcast. Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initiallybrandedas "Hulu Plus," which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and un-delayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—anover-the-topstreaming television service offering access tobroadcast televisionchannels.
In 2011, Hulu launchedits services in Japan, marking its first and only international expansion. Three years later in 2014, Hulu Japan was acquired byNippon TVand spun off from its American counterpart.[2]Since February 2021, Hulu's original content has since been distributed outside of the U.S. viaDisney+under theStarbrand. In 2019, Disney acquired a majority stake in Hulu as part of itsacquisition of 21st Century Fox, and subsequently acquired the remaining stakes held by AT&T and Comcast in 2019 and 2023, respectively, giving it full ownership. After the acquisition, Disneysoft launchedan integration of Hulu into Disney+ as a content hub in December 2023, allowing subscribers of both services to access Hulu content from within the Disney+ app. Hulu is one of the three streaming services in the Disney Bundle, alongside Disney+ andESPN+.
On January 6, 2025, Disney began its acquisition of a 70% stake inFuboTV, with the latter merging with Hulu's Live TV service. The combined company will remain publicly traded on theNew York Stock Exchange, but will be controlled by Disney executives. As part of the deal, Fubo settled a lawsuit againstESPN Inc.(majority-owned by Disney),Fox Corporation(21CF's successor), andWarner Bros. Discovery(WarnerMedia's successor after its merger withDiscovery, Inc.) over a joint venture known asVenu Sports, with Fubo being granted a preliminary injection to stop its launch in August 2024.

The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners." Jason Kilar was named Hulu CEO in late 2007.[10][11]NBC shut down its earlier online video effortNBBCin order to focus on Hulu.[12]
The nameHuluwas chosen in late August 2007, when the website went live with an announcement only and no content. It invited users to leave their email addresses for the upcomingbeta test.[13]In October 2007, Hulu began the private beta testing by invitation, and later allowed users to invite friends.[14]Hulu launched for public access in the United States on March 12, 2008.[15]
Hulu began an advertising campaign during NBC's broadcast ofSuper Bowl XLIIIwith an initial ad starringAlec Baldwintitled "Alec in Huluwood."[16]Advertisements have since aired featuringEliza Dushku,Seth MacFarlane,Denis Leary, andWill Arnett.[citation needed]
In July 2007,Providence Equity, the owner ofNewport Television, became one of the earliest "outside" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 millionequity investment,[17]before the company was known as "Hulu."[18]With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an "independent voice on the board."[18]In April 2009,the Walt Disney Companyjoined the Hulu consortium as a stakeholder, with plans to offer content fromABC,ESPNandDisney Channel.[19][20][21][22]
Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

However, Comcast had not offered reasonable terms for an early buyout[54]and had instead expressed interest in buying Hulu themselves if it were for sale.[53]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
