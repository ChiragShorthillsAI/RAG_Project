Tetrisis a 2023biographicalthriller filmbased on true events around the race to license and patent the video gameTetrisfrom Russia in the late 1980s during theCold War.[3][4]It was directed byJon S. Bairdand written byNoah Pink. The film starsTaron Egerton,Nikita Efremov,Sofia Lebedeva, andAnthony Boyle. The plot followsHenk RogersofBullet-Proof Software, who becomes interested in the game Tetris, created byAlexey Pajitnov, during an electronics show. Desperate to obtain handheld console rights for Nintendo, he takes trips between Japan, the United States, and Russia to win legal battles over the game's ownership.
Development ofTetrisbegan in July 2020. Filming began inGlasgowin December 2020, includingGlasgow Prestwick Airport. In February 2021, filming took place inAberdeenat locations including theUniversity of Aberdeen'sZoology Building. Filming took place for 7 days in and around the former (RAF) military base at Balado in Perth & Kinross. Production wrapped in early March 2021.
Tetrispremiered at theSXSW Film Festivalon March 15, 2023, and was released on March 31, byApple TV+. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and was praised by Pajitnov and Rogers.
At the 1988Consumer Electronics Showin Las Vegas, Dutch video game designerHenk RogersofBullet-Proof SoftwarediscoversTetris, a captivating puzzle game developed by Soviet programmerAlexey Pajitnov.Tetrisis owned by the Soviet Union'sELORG. Rogers learns that the worldwide licensing rights were sold to British entrepreneur Robert Stein, who sublicensed them toRobert Maxwell'sMirrorsoft, headed by Maxwell's son,Kevin. Rogers acquires the rights to distribute Tetris in Japan for PC, console, and arcade.
Rogers pitches a partnership to Nintendo CEOHiroshi Yamauchi, proposing to adaptTetrisfor theFamicomconsole and arcades. Yamauchi agrees, and Rogers secures a $3 million loan from bank manager Eddie, using his family home ascollateral. However, Kevin informs Rogers thatSegahas already been promised arcade rights, complicating Rogers's ability to move forward with the Famicom version. Rogers desperately presses Nintendo for an advance on residuals, hoping to buy enough time to secure the needed rights, but is instead redirected to Nintendo's Seattle headquarters. There, Rogers proposesTetrisas the launch title for Nintendo's upcomingGame Boyhandheld console instead ofSuper Mario Land.Nintendo of America's PresidentMinoru Arakawaand General CounselHoward Lincolnagree, provided Rogers secures handheld rights.
Rogers negotiates with Stein in London, offering $25,000 for the handheld rights. However, Stein later promises the rights toAtarifor $100,000. Realizing he must deal directly with ELORG, Rogers travels to Moscow despite the risks of operating in a tightly controlled Soviet system. At ELORG, Rogers meets chairman Nikolai Belikov and learns that his Famicom version ofTetrisis considered illegal because Stein exploited ambiguous contract language to sublicense rights beyond PC versions. Rogers reveals these manipulations, leading Belikov to draft a new contract defining platform-specific rights.[a]
Rogers meets Pajitnov, and they gradually develop a friendship. However, the growing potential ofTetrisattracts scrutiny from Valentin Trifonov, a corruptCommunist Partyofficial withKGBconnections. Trifonov attempts to leverageTetrisas a political and financial asset, threatening Rogers, Pajitnov, and their families. Trifonov pressures Belikov into selling Tetris to Mirrorsoft. Belikov tells Kevin that Mirrorsoft can haveTetrisif they are wired $1 million within a week. Belikov then privately talks to Rogers about making his own offer within the week and gives him a separateletter of intent. Back in Tokyo, Rogers faces personal strain when his dedication to the Tetris deal causes him to miss his daughterMaya's concert.
Ordered by Belikov, Pajitnov faxes Mirrorsoft's letter to Rogers at his job, showing that Mirrorsoft failed to obtainTetrisrights on the agreed upon deadline. Nintendo tells Rogers of Atari releasing theirTetrisversion. Rogers says Stein and the Maxwells lied and that the letter expired the day before, meaning Atari has zero rights toTetris. He urges Arakawa and Lincoln to finalize the deal in Moscow. Stein furiously confronts Kevin for dealing with ELORG behind his back, leading the Maxwells to personally warn Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachevagainst selling to capitalist interests. Gorbachev dismisses their concerns but orders Trifonov to be monitored. ELORG ultimately accepts Nintendo's $5 million offer for console and handheld rights.
Tensions escalate when Robert Maxwell offers Trifonov a 50% stake in Tetris in exchange for blocking Rogers. A high-stakes car chase ensues as Trifonov tries to intercept Rogers, Arakawa, and Lincoln en route to the airport. Sasha, Rogers's interpreter and a covert KGB agent, intervenes to arrest Trifonov, allowing the trio to escape.Tetrisbecomes a global phenomenon following its release on Game Boy and other platforms. Rogers returns to Tokyo, reconciling with his family and showing his wife Akemi the $5 million check to Bullet-Proof Software. In his homeland, Pajitnov watches theSinging Revolutionand receives a Game Boy with Tetris from Rogers. Rogers helps Pajitnov and his family relocate to the US. An epilogue reveals Rogers and Pajitnov co-foundedThe Tetris Company, of which Maya later becomes CEO, and remain friends.
In July 2020, it was reported that a biopic was being made about the making ofTetris, which would delve into the legal battles that took place during theCold Warover ownership of the game, withJon S. Bairddirecting andTaron Egertoncast to portray the game publisherHenk Rogers.[7]Egerton confirmed this report in an August 2020 interview, explaining that the film would mirror a tone similar toThe Social Network.[8]In November 2020,Apple TV+acquired the film.[9]
Baird explained that the appeal of the film's script lay in its focus on the legal battle over the rights to the game, set against the backdrop of theCold War.[10]With a background in politics and international relations, Baird was drawn to the high-stakes, thrilling nature of the story, which he likened to a "fast-paced, high-stakes thriller on steroids." He emphasized that, unlike typical video game adaptations, the film centers on the real-world drama surrounding the game's distribution rights rather than trying to adapt the gameplay itself.[10]When asked why the film was made now, Baird remarked that, while the story had been in development for years, the current geopolitical situation—particularly theongoing conflict in Ukraine—provided new resonance. He noted that the film's portrayal of East-West relations during the Cold War would be more meaningful now than it might have been in the past, as modern audiences have a clearer understanding of how dangerous and politically charged that period was.[10]
Filming forTetrisoriginally planned for Moscow was disrupted by theCOVID-19 pandemicin 2021, prompting the production to relocate to various locations inScotland, includingEdinburgh,Ayrshire,Glasgow, andAberdeen. Director Jon S. Baird, a native of Aberdeen, described filming in his hometown as a special experience, highlighting the region’s untapped cinematic potential and the enthusiastic local reception. Producer Gillian Berrie noted the serendipitous connection between Moscow's architecture—partially influenced by Scottish designers—and the Scottish filming locations, which helped create a convincing stand-in for the Russian capital. Lead actor Taron Egerton remarked on Scotland's "abundance of greyness" and architectural similarities to Moscow, particularly in parts of Glasgow. The production was supported by £500,000 from Screen Scotland’s production growth fund.[11][12]
Filming began in Glasgow in December 2020, includingGlasgow Prestwick Airporton the Ayrshire coast.[13]In February 2021, filming took place in Aberdeen at locations including theUniversity of Aberdeen'sZoology Building, which was used as the headquarters of Soviet firmELORG,[14]and Seamount Court which was used for several scenes.[15]Filming took place for 7 days in and around the former (RAF) military base at Balado in Perth & Kinross; particularly internal scenes for a quasi-military backdrop. Production then returned to Glasgow for a few days, before wrapping in early March 2021.[16]
Coffee & TV was tasked with creating motion design for the Tetris film, incorporating a "blocky" pixel art style to align with the film's1980sretro gamingaesthetic. The project began in the post-production phase, where Coffee & TV was commissioned to design various graphic and animation assets, including titles, scene establishers, and maps to enhance the storytelling.[17]
The team faced a challenge in rendering the pixelated aesthetic in 4K resolution, initially attempting to pixelize graphics made at 4K, but finding the results unsatisfactory. To maintain control over pixel placement, they scaled the designs to approximately 1:10, creating artwork 400 pixels wide.[17]The artwork was developed on small canvases using Adobe Photoshop, Aseprite, and Pixaki, the latter two being specifically designed for retro, 8-bit pixel art. In Adobe After Effects, the team discovered a simple method to preserve the pixelated look by disabling a specific checkbox that otherwise smoothed out lines and gradients, contradicting the desired aesthetic. For the animations, they ensured that movements felt blocky, adjusting motion to maintain the pixelated style even in high resolution.[17]
Coloring was approached with some flexibility, using different color schemes to set the scene contextually—red for Russia, blue for London, and green for Tokyo—while still drawing from Tetris' extensive visual history.[17]The original game’s simple, bracket-like visuals served as inspiration, challenging the designers to make concise decisions about storytelling and character design within the pixelated constraints.[17]Reflecting on the project, Boyle highlighted the rewarding nature of working within these boundaries, emphasizing the creative discipline required to convey narrative and visual elements in a minimalist style.[17]
The movie'ssoundtrackfeatures original score cues from the film composed byLorne Balfeand songs performed byAaron Hibell,aespa, Polina,ReN, as well as remixes of yesteryear songs newly produced for the film. The album was released on 31 March 2023 byParlophone RecordsandMarv Music, and was led by two singles — "Benevolence" byAaron Hibelland "Hold on Tight" byAespareleased on 17 and 24 March.[18]
The film premiered at theSXSW Film Festivalon March 15, 2023.[19]It premiered on Apple TV+ on March 31, 2023.[20]According to aSamba TVresearch panel of 3.1 million smart television households who tuned in for at least one minute,Tetrisdrew in 88,000 viewers in its first two days.[21]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 82% of 190 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website's consensus reads: "While it's nowhere near as addictive or fast-paced as the game,Tetrisoffers a fun, fizzy account of the story behind an 8-bit classic."[22]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 61 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[23]
Several reviewers contrasted the film with the real-life events. Matthew Jackson ofThe A.V. Clubwrote, "Tetris doesn't cast the same spell as its namesake, but it will at least make you look at those falling blocks in a new way."[24]In contrast, Vince Mancini ofUPROXXfound the film "mostly entertaining and simplifies an impossibly complex story admirably, but it also loses some its most important themes in the process." "The legal battle over Tetris has been thoroughly dissected in the decades since," wrote Ollie Barder ofForbes, "and while this movie sticks to the spirit of that, there are some inevitable film related exaggerations."[25]Tim Robey said "Tetris is best when it’s geeking out right in front of us... There's no nostalgia quite as addictive, this proves, as the 8-bit kind."[26]Jeannette Catsoulis ofNew York TimessaidTetrisis, "Fast and fizzy and relentlessly buoyant, "Tetris" finds its heart in the connection between [Pajitnov and Rogers], the game's modest creator and its tenacious evangelist."[27]
Henk Rogers, the entrepreneur who played a key role in securing the rights to Tetris, and Alexey Pajitnov, the game's creator, shared their thoughts on the impact of the film and their personal connections to the game.[10]Rogers expressed excitement that the origin story of Tetris would be revealed to the public, as many people play games without knowing the behind-the-scenes history of their development. Pajitnov, meanwhile, praised the filmmakers for capturing the most significant moment in the Tetris story, noting that it was a pivotal point in the game's journey to global popularity.[10]In a 2023 interview,Alexey Pajitnovadmitted that the film "didn't make an actual biography or an actual recreation of what actually happened", but was "close enough and very right emotionally and spiritually".[28]
In August 2023,Dan Ackerman,[32]the chief editor ofGizmodo, sued Apple for "illegally copying" his 2016 bookThe Tetris Effect: The Game That Hypnotized the World. Ackerman asked the court for monetary damages of $4.8 million, which was 6% of the film's $80 million production budget.[2]The claim was rejected by the court later.[33]
In an interview prior to the film's release, Henk Rogers said that he and Alexey Pajitnov reviewed the script and made suggestions. However, Rogers noted, "It's a Hollywood script, a movie. It's not about history so a lot of [what's in the movie] never happened." Some events in the movie were true. For instance, Rogers notes that he convinced Nintendo to bundleTetriswith the Game Boy at launch in place ofSuper Mario Land. Rogers emphasized that the producers wanted to "capture the darkness and the brooding" that he felt during his time trying to get the rights toTetrisinSoviet Russia.[34]For dramatic effect, the interpreter in the film was a KGB agent, which Rogers had already been aware of. In the end of the film, a car chase is depicted, although this did not happen when Rogers left the Soviet Union.[35]

Apple TV+is an Americansubscriptionover-the-topstreaming serviceowned byApple. The service launched on November 1, 2019, and it offers a selection of original production film and television series calledApple Originals.[9]The service was announced during theApple Special Event of March 2019,[10][11]where entertainers from Apple TV+ projects appeared onstage, includingJennifer Aniston,Oprah Winfrey, andSteven Spielberg.[12][13]The service can be accessed through Apple's website and through theApple TV app, which has gradually become available on manyApple devicesand some major competingdigital media players,[14]including somesmart TVmodels and video-game consoles.
Apple plans to expand the services' availability,[15][16][17][18]and there are workarounds for subscribers whose device is not presently supported.[14]Access is included as part of theApple Onesubscription.[19]Most of the content is available inDolby Visionprofile 5 andDolby Atmos. Upon its debut, Apple TV+ was available in about 100 countries, fewer than the reported target of 150.[20][21]Several countries were excluded from service despite other Apple products being available.[22][23][24]Commentators noted that the fairly wide initial reach of the service offered Apple an advantage over other recently launched services such asDisney+, and that because Apple distributes its own content through the service instead of distributing licensed third-party content (as, for example,Huludoes) it will not be limited by licensing issues during its expansion.[25][26][27]
By early 2020, Apple TV+ had poor growth and low subscriber numbers relative to competing services.[28][29][30][31]In the middle of that year, Apple began to license older television programs and films, attempting to stay competitive with other services, attract and retain a viewership for its original content, and convert into subscribers users who were trialing the service.[29][28]Since then, the service has become the home to critically acclaimed content: between September 2021 and March 2022, Apple TV+ netted aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy SerieswithTed Lassoand theAcademy Award for Best PicturewithCODA, the first Best Picture win for a film distributed by a streaming service.[32]Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston have all signed a multi year look deal with Apple TV+ to develop more television projects under their production companies after their critically acclaimed shows. Apple TV+ (along with the simultaneously announceda-la-cartepremium-videosubscription aggregation serviceApple TV app) is part of a concerted effort by Apple to expand its service revenues.[16][33][34]The service's programming arm isApple Studios.
Apple had long been rumored to have an interest in beginning astreaming televisionservice, and in 2015 entered into negotiations with varioustelevision studiosand programmers to aggregate their content for a live-television streaming bundle.[35][36]Negotiations fell apart over differing views on how to value the content, lack of transparency on details, and the personality of Apple's chief negotiator,Eddy Cue.[35]
In October 2016, Apple CEOTim Cooksaid that television is "of intense interest to me and other people here", and added that Apple has "started focusing on some original content", which he called "a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it's an area we're focused on."[37]
In June 2017, Apple began to take the first major steps to form its new television unit by hiring the co-presidents ofSony Pictures Television, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to oversee all aspects of worldwide video programming.[36][2]In August, Matt Cherniss was hired as Head of Domestic Creative Development, reporting directly to Van Amburg and Erlicht.[3]For the rest of 2017, Apple continued to fill out its executive team for Apple TV+, with Kim Rozenfeld joining as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted,Jay Huntjoining as Creative Director for Europe,Morgan Wandelljoining as Head of International Creative Development, Tara Sorensen joining as Head of Kids Programming, and Max Aronson, Ali Woodruff, Carina Walker, and Michelle Lee joining as development and creative executives.[38][39][4][6][40]
Throughout 2019, Apple continued to build out its unscripted content team, with Molly Thompson hired as Head of Documentaries in April.[5]In November, Rozenfeld stepped down as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted to focus on producing content again with a first-look content production deal with Apple under his Half Full Productions. Cherniss took over Rozenfeld's duties overseeing current scripted programming.[41]
In May 2018, it was reported that Apple was expected to start a sister project to its original content service, and begin selling subscriptions to certain video services directly via itsApple TV appapplication oniOSandtvOS, rather than asking Apple device owners to subscribe to those services through applications individually downloaded from Apple's app store.[42]
In October 2018, it was reported that Apple would distribute its future original content through a still-in-development digital video service within its TV application that is pre-installed in all iOS and tvOS devices. The service was expected to feature both original content, free to owners of Apple devices, as well as subscription "channels" from legacy media companies such asHBOandStarz, which would allow customers to sign up for online-only services.[43]Later that month, it was reported that Apple intended to roll out the service in the U.S. during the first half of 2019 and that it would expand its availability to around 100 countries in the months after its launch.[44]
On March 25, 2019, Apple held a press event to announce Apple TV+. At the event, Apple showed a teaser of its upcoming original content and formally announced some of it, with actors and producers attached to the content appearing on stage. The announced content includedHelpsters, the first series fromSesame Workshop, the producer ofSesame Street, and Oprah Winfrey's first projects for Apple TV+, including a documentary under the working titleToxic Labor[45]about workplace sexual harassment, a documentary series about mental health, and a revival ofOprah's Book Clubas a standalone television series.[46][47]
On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would launch on November 1 at $4.99 per month (with a 1-week free trial) for an account that can be shared with up to six family members. Apple also announced that it would be give away a year of Apple TV+ to anyone who bought a newApple TV,Mac,iPad,iPhone, oriPod Touchbeginning that day.[48]Student subscribers to the monthlyApple Musicservice at a discounted rate also have Apple TV+ bundled in at no additional cost for the time being.[49]
From the start of Apple TV+ on November 1, 2019, Apple offered a free one-year subscription to anyone buying certain of its hardware products (an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod Touch, or Mac).[50]Apple initially extended the free year that was due to end on November 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021,[51]but then announced in mid-January 2021 that it would extend it a second time to July 31, 2021.[52]
In mid-June 2021, Apple added a note to its website advising customers that new users subscribing after June 30, 2021, would receive only three months of free subscription instead of a year.[53]
On October 24, 2022, Apple announced it was to increase pricing of Apple TV+ (along withApple MusicandApple One) subscriptions in many regions. The monthly plan increased $2 to $6.99, and the annual plan increased $20 to $69.[54]
During the announcement of Apple TV+, Apple announced a number of prominent writers, directors, and stars who would be featured in the service. The signing of high-profile talent was intended to attract viewers to the service.[55]
As of March 2019[update], five of the upcoming series had completed production, with six more well into filming.[56]On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would have eight original series (seven scripted and one unscripted) and one original documentary available at launch, with plans to launch new original content every month thereafter. Most series were expected to launch with three episodes, with a new episode released weekly thereafter, although Apple said that not all series would follow that model and that some series might instead launch all at once.[57]
Early critical reaction to the bulk of the service's programming was mixed to poor, but commentators predicted that Apple would have time to grow into its new role as a content provider and to produce well-regarded content, especially as the free year of the service provided with many Apple product purchases enticed users to continue watching, and for some to eventually pay for a subscription, as new series are released.[58][59][15]
On March 13, 2020, Apple suspended all active filming on Apple TV+ shows due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, and all production on series was postponed for an indeterminate period.[60]
Apple's decision in mid-2020 to license large swaths of existing older content for the Apple TV+ service was viewed, in part, as buying time for its original content production during the pandemic by keeping users engaged and in a habit of visiting the service regularly, so that a viewer base would be in place by the time new Apple original content was released.[29][28]
In addition, Apple TV+ endeavored to gain new high-profile content, taking advantage of the pandemic's disruption of theatrical film releases. Among these acquisitions were the 2020 feature filmGreyhoundstarringTom Hanks, which was purchased fromSony Picturesfor $70 million.[61]In July 2020, the service won a heated bidding war forEmancipation, a slavery-based action-thriller starringWill Smithand directed byAntoine Fuqua.[62]Apple paid a record $105 million for the rights.[62]Apple also reportedly considered a $350 to $400 million offer for the rights to stream theJames BondfilmNo Time to Die, which was far short of the $650 to $800 million studioMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(owned byAmazon, which is one of theBig Techcompanies alongside Apple) was willing to accept.[63]

In September 2018, it was reported that Apple had decided to shelveVital Signs, a six-episode biopic television series centering on the life of hip-hop producer and performerDr. Dreand starringIan McShane,Sam Rockwell, andMichael K. Williams, due to concerns about the show's content being too graphic, with moments cited including characters usingcocaine, instances ofgun violence, and an explicitorgyscene. Reports further indicated that Apple CEO Tim Cook was taking a hands-on approach to the company's Worldwide Video Unit, with programming decisions reportedly being aligned to Cook's personal taste, with a preference for family-friendly shows. Various programs in different stages of production apparently had their content altered, including the toning down ofThe Morning Showand the removal of crucifixes from a scene in theM. Night Shyamalandrama series. Additionally, Apple reportedly passed on a television series from comedianWhitney Cummingsabout the #MeToo movement because it was "too sensitive a topic".[70][71][72]Cummings's series was ultimately put into development byAmazon Prime Videoin October 2018.[73]
In November 2018, Apple entered into a multi-year agreement with entertainment companyA24to produce a slate of original films in partnership with its Worldwide Video Unit.[74]The same month, Apple signed a deal with DHX Media (nowWildBrain) and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide to develop and produce original programs, including new series, specials, and shorts based on thePeanutscharacters.

Apple TV+ released its first movie in theaters,Killers of the Flower Moon. Apple has said that its primary goal in releasing the film is to attract more subscribers, not to do well at the box office, but it brought in $145 million.[118]Apple TV+ also released another movie,Napoleon. Apple is seemingly pleased with its box-office returns, which reached $221 million and nearly made back its budget. It is apparent that Apple is attempting to compete with movie production companies.[119][120][121]
In March 2022, Apple announced that it would airFriday Night Baseball, a weekly doubleheader ofMajor League Baseball(MLB) games with live pre- and postgame shows on Apple TV+ in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom starting in the2022 Major League Baseball season.[122]
In June 2022,Major League Soccer(MLS) announced that Apple had acquired the global streaming rights to the league beginning in the2023 season.[123][124][125]All regular season and playoff matches are streamed onMLS Season Pass, a subscription offering separate from Apple TV+. Apple TV+ subscribers can watch select games at no additional charge, and receive a discount on the MLS Season Pass.[126][127]
In mid-2020, Apple began discussions with film and television studios to license their previously released content as part of an effort to build a back catalog of non-original films and television shows for the streaming service.[30][29]The shift was designed to help the service better compete against the large content libraries competitors likeNetflixhave.[30]This represented a pivot for Apple, which had initially attempted to build the service entirely on original content, avoiding licensing fees to help keep monthly subscription fees low, and relying on its Apple TV Channels content partners to supply other content users wanted.[30][29]
Analysts believed that the addition of older, highly re-watchable content like popular sitcoms and well-liked films would help retain the slowly growing subscriber base while Apple continues to develop original content.[28]The shift was also an acknowledgement of poor growth, especially relative to competing services.[28]The back catalog development was also seen as a move to attempt to persuade free trial users to transition into paid users as the first wave of one-year trials was scheduled to expire in November 2020.[29]
On May 26, 2020, Apple announced its first acquisition of catalogue content would be theFraggle Rockseries.[128]In addition to being the exclusive home of the 1983–1987Jim Henson Companyseries, Apple would develop a new, full-length, rebootedFraggle Rockseries after the success of theFraggle Rock: Rock On!short-form series on Apple TV+.[129]On October 19, 2020, Apple announced the exclusive transmission rights of the various animated productions of thePeanutsfranchise, withdrawing them from broadcast television after 55 years; as part of that agreement, Apple TV+ must make the majorPeanutsspecials available for free in short windows.[130]After an outcry from fans of the specials, Apple sublicensedA Charlie Brown ThanksgivingandA Charlie Brown ChristmastoPBSfor commercial-free airing.[131]In 2021,It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brownalso came to the PBS rotation. The PBS sublicensing arrangement ended before October 2022.[132]

By February 2020, about 10 million people had signed up for Apple TV+.[30][29]This included users who received a free one-year trial with the purchase of an Apple device,[30][29]although it was estimated that less than 10% of Apple device owners eligible for the trial had activated it, perhaps because of Apple's failure to promote the service, Apple's desire to slow the uptake rate due to accounting concerns, or users' lack of interest in the service's perceived poor content options.[30]About half of those 10 million users actively used the service.[31]In late 2020, the continuing expansion of availability of the Apple TV app to a growing number of smart TV platforms and to newer lines ofPlayStationandXboxvideo game consoles (specifically, thePS4andPS5, and the XboxOne,Series S, andSeries X[141]) was seen as potentially boosting subscriber numbers for Apple TV+, including as part of Apple One subscription bundle purchases.[142]But Apple has created no native TV app for theWindowsandAndroidplatformsor official method to stream the content toChromecastor on theAndroid TVplatform (except for selectSonyBraviatelevision models[143]), leaving users of those devices to use a web browser to view Apple TV+ content, where possible, or to employ other workarounds, especially for sending Apple TV+ content to a television set.[14]On December 16, 2020,Googleannounced it would add the Apple TV app to itsChromecast with Google TVdevice in early 2021 and to its Android TV platform by June 1, 2021;[144][145]Google made Apple TV available on its Chromecast with Google TV, as well as on selectSonyandTCLsmart TVsrunning the Google TV interface, on February 18, 2021.[146]On December 18, 2020, theBritish Urban Film Festivalannounced that it was to be the first UK film festival to host all of its official selections on theApple TV app.[147]
The service received several nominations for the2021 Golden Globe Awardsin both the television and film categories and was regarded as having "established an impressive track record for turning out consistently good—and sometimes great—programming for subscribers, despite offering a much, much smaller overall offering."[148]Apple's seriesTed Lassowon fourPrimetime Emmy Awards in 2021, includingOutstanding Comedy Series,Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series(Jason Sudeikis),Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series(Brett Goldstein) andOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series(Hannah Waddingham).[149]

He always wants to know a character's needs, and what's beneath those needs. Then he takes all that material and somehow embeds it into the character and physically inhabits the character, so that you never think he's playing the character. It's fascinating to watch him close up. He carries the emotional complexities in every tiny gesture that his character makes so that you immediately can see what his character is like. A character like Roger is full of contradictions, a city banker with an air of entitlement but also a little insecurity picking away at him. Toby can portray that in his walk alone. That's what's great about him, he can portray cold he can portray warm and he can portray both of those things at once."[14]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
