Reggie is a naiveBorder Terrierwho lives with his deadbeat owner Doug, who only keeps him around to spite his ex-girlfriend. When Reggie inadvertently destroys Doug's bong, Doug makes several attempts to ditch Reggie, which Reggie views as a game. Losing track of Doug in the city three hours away, Reggie meets a street-wise dog named Bug who teaches him how to be a stray after he defends him from aRottweilerand aDoberman. After a night with Bug and his friends, anAustralian Shepherdnamed Maggie and a therapyGreat Danenamed Hunter, Reggie finally realizes that Doug does not love him. He decides to get revenge by biting off Doug's penis, and the other strays accompany him for support. However, as Reggie has never been that far from Doug before, they are forced to rely on landmarks he saw, including a 'large hamster ball' (a carnival ferris wheel), a 'giant cone' (a hill), and 'the Devil in the sky' (a picture of apostmanon a billboard).
During the journey, the group bonds as they get into several situations, culminating in getting caught byanimal controlafter a hallucinogenic mushroom-induced high causes them to maul a family of rabbits, which they mistake forplushies. During their captivity, Bug admits that he used to have a family of his own but was forced to escape when they tried to euthanize him after he bit the daughter (though he fails to see exactly what he did wrong). In an attempt to escape, the dogs plan to use Hunter's erect penis to hook the kennel keys but are unsuccessful. Then in another attempt to escape, Reggie suggests that every dog defecate on the floor at the same time so when the security guard opens it, they can all run out, in which they are successful. After escaping the pound, however, Reggie convinces himself that he is to blame for Doug treating him poorly. This causes Bug to urinate on Reggie's bandana in a fit of anger and Reggie leaves the other strays. Making their way back to the city, Bug, Maggie, and Hunter stumble upon a lostgirl scout, and alert a search and rescue worker to her location.
Reggie returns to Doug's house, and after reminiscing about all the times Doug mistreated him, he finally sees what he was. He confronts and cuts ties with him. However, an enraged Doug prevents Reggie from leaving and attempts to kill him while making explicit that he never even once cared about Reggie. The other strays, with the help of the Girl Scout, intervene and, with their help, Reggie successfully bites Doug's penis off. Hunter also defecates in Doug's mouth, and during the altercation, Doug's house and pickup truck are burned down. While Doug is taken to a hospital, the strays reconcile, but they wanted to go into their new lives. Afterwards, the strays move on: Hunter returns to being a therapy dog and starts a relationship with Maggie, the latter begins training as apolice dog, the Girl Scout adopts Bug, and Reggie remains a stray and chooses to guide new strays, though still often spends time with the other dogs.

Philip Anderson Lord(born July 12, 1975) andChristopher Robert Miller(born September 23, 1975) are American filmmakers. They are the creators and co-stars of the adult animated sitcomClone High(2002–2003, 2023–2024), and the writers and directors of the animated filmsCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs(2009) andThe Lego Movie(2014), as well as the directors of the live-action comedy film21 Jump Street(2012) and its sequel,22 Jump Street(2014).
Lord and Miller are best known for working on the film series forCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,The Lego MovieandSpider-Verse, which won them theAcademy Award for Best Animated FeatureforSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018) and a nomination for the aforementioned award for producing the sequel,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse(2023). They have also worked on the television seriesThe Last Man on Earth(2015–2018) forFox,Unikitty!(2017–2020) forCartoon Network, and most recentlyThe Afterparty(2022–2023) forApple TV+.
Lord is fromMiami; his mother is aCuban-born psychologist, and his father retired from the aviation business and before that directed a dance company, Fusion, for 10 years. Miller is from theSeattlearea, where his father runs a lumber mill.[3]
Lord and Miller both grew up making short films with an affinity for animation. They both attendedDartmouth College, where they first met, and had separate comics in the school newspaper,The Dartmouth. Lord was a member ofAmarna, a co-ed undergraduate society while Miller was a brother atAlpha Chi Alpha. During his time in college, Miller met his girlfriend, now wife.
During their time at Dartmouth, the school paper published a profile on Miller, which caught the attention ofMichael Eisner, then chairman ofDisney. According to Lord, Eisner brought the profile to the attention of his fellow Disney executives who offered to set up a meeting with Miller. Miller agreed to the meeting as long as he could bring Lord. After three months, the two moved to Los Angeles and after one meeting were offered a two-year development deal atWalt Disney Television Animation.[4]
Though nothing they pitched made it to air, they produced the pilot toClone High, which was subsequently dropped byFox. After they wrote and produced on a series of sitcoms,MTVinformed the duo that they were interested in purchasing a 13-episode season ofClone High. Although the show was met with acclaim, MTV canceled the series afterhunger strike protestsoccurred in India over the show's portrayal of Gandhi as a motor-mouthed partier.[5]
In 2003, the two were tapped to write a screenplay forCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, their first feature film. After a year working on the script, they were fired for story issues and replaced with new writers, who after a year were fired themselves. Lord and Miller were re-hired in 2006. The two completely redid the script, this time with the creative input of their crew. The new draft had the protagonist as a failed inventor who wanted to prove himself to his town. The two were almost fired again afterAmy Pascal, the head ofSony Picturesat the time, criticized the film for a lack of story. Although the film succeeded on the comedic front in theanimaticstage, Pascal cited the lack of an anchoring relationship in the film as a failure in the story telling. Unable to create new characters and environments to suit the new story demands, the two elevated the character of the tackle shop extra to be the protagonist's father, thereby creating the relationship Pascal had requested.[6]
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballswas released in 2009 to positive reviews.
AfterCloudy with a Chance of Meatballswas released, the two sought to try to make something different and pitched themselves as possible directors for the21 Jump Streetscript thatMichael BacallandJonah Hillhad written. The studio agreed and the two directed their first live-action R-rated film, released to critical acclaim, which led to the production of the sequel22 Jump Street.
In an interview withRobert K. Elderfor his bookThe Best Film You've Never Seen, Lord stated that "in an animated feature, you remake the movie three or four times, and it's really easy to get bummed out that the way you did it before didn't get greenlit, didn't get paid, and you're making a totally different version of that movie."[7]
During the production of21 Jump Street, they pitched a take on a possible Lego film toDan Lin. Lin andWarner Bros.loved the take, so Lord and Miller wrote and eventually directed their third feature film together,The Lego Movie. The duo were picked by Warner Bros. to write the story treatment for the then-upcoming superhero filmThe Flash, but dropped out of the project in favor of directing the then-untitledSolo: A Star Wars Story.[8]The duo were picked bySony Pictures Animationin 2015 to create an animatedSpider-Manfilm, with the option to direct. The film was eventually made asSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018), which the duo produced and which Lord co-wrote.[9]
The duo have developed a live-action/animated series,Son of Zorn, forFox, withJason Sudeikisvoicing the lead role of animated character Zorn, andJohnny PembertonandCheryl Hinesplaying the live-action roles.[10]They are producing a cable-TV drama based on the popularNPR/This American Lifespinoff podcastSerial.[11]

They were unwilling to compromise with Lucasfilm and writerLawrence Kasdanon the direction of the film, preferring their vision. Two days later,Ron Howardwas announced as the replacement, to complete the film and reshoots.[13][14]Lord and Miller received executive-producer credits onSolo: A Star Wars Story.[15]
In November 2017, Lord and Miller commented on their departure fromSolo: A Star Wars Story. Lord stated "The experience of shooting the movie was wonderful. We had the most incredible cast and crew and collaborators. [...] We're really proud of the work we did on the movie and we wish everybody the best." Miller added "As Phil said, we had such a great relationship with cast and crew, we were really rooting for them.

Work on both parts was taking place simultaneously, or at least believed to be until June 2023 whenanimators claimed they were overworkedto complete Part One,[25]with Part Two since renamed toSpider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.[23][26]A release date has yet to be announced, as the film was removed from the release schedule on July 28, 2023, reportedly due to the then-ongoing2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[27]Its original release date of March 29, 2024, was taken byGhostbusters: Frozen Empire.

Orville Willis Forte IV[3]was born inAlameda, California, on June 17, 1970.[4]The son of artist and former schoolteacher Patricia C. (néeStivers)[5][6]and financial broker Orville Willis "Reb" Forte III.[3]He grew up inMoragabefore moving toLafayetteat age 13.[7]He went by "Billy" in his early years until he was teased at school for it also being a girl's name. At that point he decided he would from then on be known as "Will".[8]Forte described himself as having been a "really happy little boy" whose parents were "wonderful" and created a "very loving environment".[9]He was interested in comedy from a young age, growing up idolizing comediansPeter Sellers,David Letterman, andSteve Martinas well as the sketch-comedy television seriesSaturday Night Live.[10]He often pulled pranks on his parents,[10]and would record himself performing imaginary radio shows. He did not aim to be a comedian, but initially wanted to become afootballplayer.[9]
Forte was "a laid-back teen with a lot of friends", and a member of the varsity football and swim teams atAcalanes High Schoolin Lafayette where he graduated in 1988. He was voted "Best Personality" by his graduating class and served as freshman class president.[8][11]He had no ambitions for a television or film career, though his mother noticed a "creative streak" in him. After high school, he attended theUniversity of California, Los Angeles, where he was a member of theLambda Chi Alphafraternity and completed a degree in history.[12]Forte wanted to become a financial broker like his father atSmith Barney Shearson, but felt "miserable" there.[8]He co-wrote a feature-length script while there,[9]and later said that he discovered he loved writing "more than anything [he] had ever done in [his] life".[8]He had been encouraged to attempt comedy during his years at university, and he decided to change his career path to do so.[13]
Forte began taking classes atThe GroundlingsinLos Angeles, animprovisationalandsketch comedytroupe and school, while tutoring children to make ends meet. His first successful foray into comedy was101 Things to Definitely Not Do If You Want to Get a Chick, acomic bookhe produced about incompetent men.[10]The comics landed him his first professional job writing forThe Jenny McCarthy Show, a short-livedvariety showstarringJenny McCarthy. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to submit a packet to theLate Show with David Lettermanand was told Letterman responded favorably to animation.[10]After only nine months atLetterman, he was "let go" from the job. He recalled his stint on the program as unpleasant, noting that he did not have enough experience in writing.[14]"What an honor to work at that show but I don't think I was fully mentally prepared. [...] I always wonder what it would be like if I'd had a couple more years of experience before going there."[15]
Forte left New York and returned to Los Angeles, where he began performing with the Groundlings' Main Company, withCheryl Hines,Jim Rash, andMaya Rudolph.[9]He triedstand-up comedythree times, mostly at open mic nights, but quit after being voted into the Main Company.[9]He joined the writing teams of two failed sitcoms, includingThe Army ShowandAction. Forte got jobs writing for3rd Rock from the SunandThat '70s Show. He loved writing and had mostly given up on acting, aside from acting with the Groundlings.[9]While performing with the troupe in 2001, he was spotted byLorne Michaels, the creator ofSaturday Night Live(SNL). Forte felt his confidence was higher than usual, asThat '70s Showhad been picked up for two more years.[9]He was invited to audition forSNL, which he regarded as unexpected.[14]
At his audition forSNL, he performed multiple original characters, includingTim Calhoun, a speed reader, a prison guard, in addition to impressions of singerMichael McDonaldand actorMartin Sheen.[9]His final character was an older piece from his days with the Groundlings, in which he portrays a gold-painted street performer who performsfellatioto pay for his face paint, which devolves into a song needlessly uttering the words "cock" and "face paint" dozens of times.[14]He felt his time to shine as a performer was already over, as he was in his thirties when he auditioned.[8]To his surprise, he was offered a chance to be on the show, but declined, opting instead for the financial stability of his work atThat '70s Show.[16]He felt working forSNLcould not live up to the idealized version he had dreamed of, but he later realized he would be making a mistake.[15][17]
AfterWill FerrellleftSaturday Night Livethe following spring, Forte joined the cast, premiering at the beginning of the show'stwenty-eighth seasonin the autumn. He was promoted to repertory player after his first year.[13]His early years on the program were characterized bystage frightand an inability to properly interpret sketches that he did not write himself.[17]He had to "re-learn" how to perform after years as a writer, and later felt his natural tendency to "overthink" things improved his performance.[15]He was particularly uncomfortable portraying PresidentGeorge W. Bush, as he felt he was not the best impressionist and it paled in comparison to Ferrell's impersonation of Bush.[18]His only role was often Bush, leaving him no chance for more "absurd" pieces he favored. He was nearly fired from the program following his third season (2004–05), but after two three-week extensions to decide his fate, he was brought back.[17]Forte estimated it took five seasons for him to feel fully comfortable performing on the show.[19]He made his film debut inAround the World in 80 Days.[20]
"I've always liked weirder stuff. My main thing onSNLwas that I was never gonna change my sensibility to get on TV—I was just gonna write what I liked writing and hopefully have a hit on that show somewhere."
His humor atSNLhas been described as bizarre,[14]and he became known for many "10-to-1" sketches—pieces that were considered odd, placed at the very end of the show. He was also well known for his charactersTim Calhoun,Greg Stink, andthe Falconer. Forte's favorite sketch on the show was one in which he played a motivational coach alongside football starPeyton Manning.[13]He also co-starred withAndy Sambergin the firstSNLDigital Short, "Lettuce". He often spent long hours crafting his sketches for the program, missing deadlines, but his pieces were usually received warmly attable reads.[16][17]During his time at the show, he co-starred in and wrote the 2007 filmThe Brothers Solomon. The film was originally a pilot forCarsey-Werner, and its creation was an extension of his agreement to terminate his contract to appear onSNL.[21]
Forte's best-known character onSNLwasMacGruber, aspecial operationsagent who is tasked in each episode with deactivating a ticking bomb but becomes distracted by personal issues. The sketches were based on the television seriesMacGyver. It was created by writerJorma Taccone, who relentlessly pitched the idea to Forte.[18]He was initially reluctant to commit to the sketch, deeming it too dumb, but accepted after persuasion from Taccone.[22]The first sketch aired in January 2007, and led to multiple more segments in the following years. In 2009, the sketches were spun off into a series of commercials sponsored byPepsipremiering duringSuper Bowl XLIIIwhich featured the actor behind MacGyver,Richard Dean Anderson, as MacGruber's father. The advertisements led the character and sketches to receive a wider level of popularity.[22]After the success of the advertisements, creatorLorne Michaelsapproached Forte, Taccone, and writer John Solomon with the idea to produce aMacGruberfilm.[23]
Regarding his experiences onSNL, Forte remarked, "Looking back, the experience is something I'll never forget. I still miss it, and I'll always miss it. That's my family."[19]His celebrity impressions includedGeorge W. Bush,Tom DeLay,John Edwards,Timothy Geithner,Newt Gingrich,Chad Lowe,Zell Miller,David Petraeus,Harry Reid,Brian Williams, andHu Jintao.[24]
In the summer of 2009,MacGruberwas shot on a tight schedule for four weeks inAlbuquerque, New Mexico.[22][25]It was written while simultaneously producing the weekly episode ofSNL, and the show'sproduction processleft the trio deprived of sleep.[26]Forte was positive regarding the film, saying,
What you see with this movie is exactly what we wanted to do. It's the three of us having a bunch of fun writing it, then having fun making it with a bunch of our friends—old friends and new friends. I think that fun comes across when you watch it. It's rare that you get that kind of creative freedom.[18]
The film was released in May 2010 and received mixed reviews.[27]It fared worse at the box office, where it failed to recoup its budget and was pulled from theaters after its third week.[28]Forte found the failure tolerable, commenting, "When you make something that you're really proud of and it doesn't do well, you can live with it."[17]The film has since seen more of a positive reception and has been dubbed acult classic.[29][30]
Forte leftSaturday Night Liveshortly before the beginning of the show'sthirty-sixth seasonin 2010. He felt it was the "right time to go", considering his eight-year tenure there, his expansion into film withMacGruber, and his age. In addition, his sister had just had children and he wanted to move to the West Coast to be closer to them.[13]He soon regretted the decision, calling the following year an "emotionally trying period", as he felt "devastated" that he would no longer be on the program.[10]He assumed his shot at a film career was ruined,[17]and he imagined that if acting did not work out, he would return to mostly writing.[10]Afterwards he entered what he has called a "lost period"[14]and had small supporting roles, such asRock of Ages,That's My Boy,andThe Watch, all of which were not successful.[14]The only commercial successful film which he worked on wasGrown Ups 2, where he made acameoas a male cheerleader.[14]He also took a role asPaul L'astnamé, the cross-dressing boyfriend ofJenna Maroneyon the critically acclaimed sitcom30 Rock.[14]
Forte took his first dramatic role for the 2013 filmRun & Jump. DirectorSteph Greenoffered him the part, and Forte imagined it a "fun thing to try", though he noted that she had more confidence in him than he had himself.[13]Later, he sent an audition tape toAlexander Paynefor a role in his next film,Nebraska.[13]He equated his casting in the film to his fear of joiningSNLa decade prior, noting that he was "terrified" to begin working on it.[14]He felt scared initially, but followedBruce Dern's acting advice to "look for the truth" in each scene—in other words, "In every scene, you're just trying to play it as honestly and as real as you can."[15]
Forte began working onThe Last Man on Earth, a sitcom, with longtime collaboratorsPhil Lord and Christopher Millerin 2013. Though it was the duo's idea, Forte attached himself to the concept, crafting atreatmentover a weekend. The series waspitchedaroundHollywoodto positive responses and was picked up in 2014 byFox.[31]Forte served as the series' creator, a writer, the lead role, and showrunner for the first season. He felt odd being in charge of its writing team (composed of longtime friends), and awkward at delegating tasks, so much so that he would end up doing the work himself.[15]Being a showrunner "truly was an amount of work I never knew existed," he said, which involved him working a "minimum of 12 hours" daily.[32]The series premiered in 2015 to positive responses,[33]and was renewed for the next three seasons.[34]
In 2016, Forte played Hulka, a low-level weed dealer, in the comedyKeanu, starringJordan PeeleandKeegan-Michael Key.[35]In 2018, he playedNational Lampoonmagazine co-founderDouglas Kenneyin theNetflixbiographical filmA Futile and Stupid Gesture.[36]The film was directed byDavid Wainand featuresDomhnall Gleesonas co-founderHenry Beard.[37]Forte voicedShaggy Rogersin theScooby-DoofilmScoob!.[38]In 2021, Forte starred inSweet Tooth, reprised his role as MacGruber in aTV seriesonPeacock, and began voicing Wolf Tobin in the animated sitcomThe Great North. In 2022, it was announced that Forte had a leading role for Disney and Pixar's first animated television seriesWin or Lose. It is set to premiere on Disney+ in 2025.[39]He voiced an older version of the titular character inScott Pilgrim Takes Off. In 2024, Forte was announced in the main role of Martin inSunny Nights.[40]
Forte dated hisLast Man on Earthco-starJanuary Jonesin 2015.[41]He and Olivia Modling were engaged in 2019; they met in 2018.[41]They have two daughters Zoe Douglas Forte, born in February 2021, and Cecilia, born approximately 18 months later.[42]He and Modling married on July 31, 2021.[43]They live in a modestly sized Craftsman home inSanta Monica, California. Forte bought the home in 2002, just two weeks before joining the cast ofSaturday Night Livewhich required him to move toNew York City. He admitted later that "it was not the greatest timing."[5]
Forte's mother, Patricia has visited every film set on which he has worked and made an appearance on aMother's Dayepisode ofSNL, in which he sang a song to her onWeekend Update. Will  officiated his sister Michelle's wedding; he filmed the birth of his niece and nephew.[44]
Will Forte has discussed and joked about hisOCDtendencies.[45][5]He recounted listening to only one song in his office atSNLfor an entire year because he wanted to challenge himself.[46]During an interview withLarry King, he discussed his OCD as a challenge he had to overcome but not one he wished he did not have, as it is a part of his personality.[47][48]In a February 2015 article onGrantlandthe writer of the article said that Forte mentioned OCD often but it was not clear if he had ever been formally diagnosed, though Forte related how he and a former girlfriend had gone through an OCD questionnaire and it concluded that Forte "should immediately talk to someone about this".[45]
Forte is an avid gamer. While filmingA Good Old-Fashioned Orgy, he achieved one of the world's highest scores on the arcade version ofDonkey Kong.[49]

In a 1996 interview withThe Sun-Herald, she spoke of her success and experiences on the show: "I would be stupid to let it go to my head because it could all end tomorrow and I would just fade back into obscurity. I like working onHome and Awaybut it's a heavy workload so I get stressed out a lot. We work about 15 hours a day, including the time it takes to learn lines. I know a lot of people work those sort of hours but I think we really feel it because most of us are young and fairly inexperienced. But I am very grateful because it is good experience. It's like an apprenticeship, but we do it in front of 20 million people so all our mistakes are up for the world to see."[13]For her performance in the series, Fisher received nominations forMost Popular New Talentat the 1995Logie Awards,[14]and forMost Popular Actressat the 1997 ceremony.[15]
After leaving the soap, Fisher enrolled atL'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq, a theatre and arts training school in Paris, and went on to appear inpantomimein the United Kingdom.[16][17]She also toured withDarren Dayin the musicalSummer Holiday;appeared in the London theatre production ofCosì,[18]and played an ill-fated member of an elite group of international students in the German slasher filmSwimming Pool(2001).[19]

AlthoughScooby-Dooreceived negative reviews, the film was a commercial success, grossing US$275.7 million worldwide.[20]On that early stage in her career, Fisher remarked: "I only came out on the back of the movie for the premiere ofScooby Doo. And then, I ended up getting representation and ended up getting a job, almost straight away. So, I was fortunate, in that I didn't have to come out to L.A. and join a queue of however many people, and try to get work. I came in on the back of what was deemed as a big studio movie that had had extraordinary success".[21]She subsequently played supporting roles in the independent filmDallas 362(2003) and the Australian comedyThe Wannabes(also 2003). In his review for the latter, David Rooney ofVarietyfelt that Fisher "adds easy charm and a thinly developed hint of romantic interest", in what he summed as an "uneven but endearing farce about breaking into showbiz".[22]In the comedyI Heart Huckabees(2004), directed byDavid O. Russell, she played what was described as a "punchy little part", by newspaperThe Age.[23]

On her part in the film, she remarked: "It was an interesting character to play, because she was so crazy and lacking in any kind of social etiquette. She doesn't care what anyone thinks." For one particular scene, involving sexual content, she used abody double. "I negotiated that from the beginning, trying to analyse why. I find pornographic violence, just gratuitous and unnecessary than nudity, because there's nothing more peaceful and beautiful".[25]The film was favourably received by critics and made US$285.1 million worldwide.[26]Empiremagazine found Fisher to be an "unexpected, scene-stealing joy",[27]and her performance earned her theBest Breakthrough Performance Awardat the 2006MTV Movie Awardsand twoTeen Choice Awardsnominations.

Describing on how she took her character, she said: "It was one of those situations where I read the script and thought, 'This is the take. I don't want to play the cliché femme fatale. I don't want to come in and be the woman with the sexual appetite, who wants to take down this man. I want to come in and make her this big beating heart, and innocent a woman who has no identity, who knows the man she's with, who doesn't have an agenda.' Because every character in the script has an agenda. I thought how interesting if my character doesn't have one if she's a victim of her own kindness. So, that was my starting point."[21]WhileThe Lookoutreceived a limited release, the film was favourably received.[31]The comedyHot Rod(also 2007), withAndy Samberg, saw Fisher star as the college-graduate neighbour on whom an amateur stuntman has a crush.

She felt "apprehensive" as she took on her firststar vehicle, stating: "I was gobsmacked that anyone would give me my own movie. I am eternally bewildered. Every time I see [producer]Jerry Bruckheimer, I want to shake him and say: 'Are you mad? Why would you put me on a poster?'".[36]Upon its release, the film received lukewarm reviews from critics; whileTime Outdescribed her as "silly and adorable",The Christian Science Monitorremarked: "Isla Fisher is such a bundle of comic energy that watching her spin her wheels in the aggressively unfunnyConfessions of a Shopaholiccounts as cruel and unusual punishment for her as well as for us".[37]Despite the critical response, the film was a commercial success; it opened with US$15 million on its North America opening weekend and went on to gross US$108.3 million worldwide.[38]Fisher received her thirdTeen Choice Awardnomination.[39]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
