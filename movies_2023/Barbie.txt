Its concurrent release withUniversal Pictures'Oppenheimerwas the catalyst of the "Barbenheimer" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as adouble feature.

A "stereotypical"Barbieand fellow dolls reside in Barbieland, amatriarchalsociety populated by different versions of Barbie,Ken, and a group of discontinued models who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits. While the Kens spend their days playing at the beach, considering it their profession, the Barbies hold prestigious jobs in law, science, politics, and so on. Ken ("Beach Ken") is only happy when he is with Barbie, and he seeks a closer relationship with her, but she rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships.
One evening at a dance party, Barbie is suddenly stricken withworries about mortality. Overnight, she develops bad breath,cellulite, andflat feet, disrupting her routines and impairing the aura of classic perfection experienced by the Barbies. Weird Barbie, a disfigured doll, tells Barbie to find the child playing with her in the real world to cure her afflictions. Barbie follows the advice and she travels to the real world, with a Ken joining Barbie by stowing away in her convertible.
After arriving inVenice Beach, Barbie punches a man after he gropes her. The duo are briefly arrested. Alarmed by the dolls' presence in the real world, the CEO ofMattelorders their recapture. Barbie tracks down her owner, a teenage girl namedSasha, who criticizes Barbie for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards. Distraught, Barbie discovers that Gloria, a Mattel employee and Sasha's mother, inadvertently caused Barbie'sexistential crisisafter starting to play with Sasha's old Barbie dolls. Mattel attempts to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with the help of a mysterious elderly woman named Ruth. 
Gloria and Sasha arrive just in time to rescue Barbie from Mattel's executives, and the three travel to Barbieland with the executives in pursuit.
Meanwhile, Ken learns aboutpatriarchyand feels respected for the first time. He returns to Barbieland to persuade the other Kens to take over. The Kens begin toindoctrinatethe Barbies into submissive roles, such as agreeable girlfriends, housewives, and maids. Barbie arrives and attempts to convince the Barbies to be independent again but fails, and she becomes depressed. Gloria expresses her frustration with theconflicting standards women are forced to follow in the real world. Gloria's speech restores Barbie's confidence.
With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie,Allan, and the discontinued dolls, Gloria uses her knowledge from the real world todeprogramthe Barbies from their indoctrination. The Barbies thenmanipulatethe Kens into fighting among themselves, which distracts them from enshrining male superiority into Barbieland's constitution, allowing the Barbies to regain power. Having now experienced systemicoppressionfor themselves, the Barbies resolve to rectify the faults of their previous society, emphasizing better treatment of the Kens and alloutcasts.
Barbie and Ken make amends, acknowledging their past mistakes. When Ken bemoans his lack of purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find an autonomous identity. Barbie, who remains unsure of her own identity, meets with the spirit ofRuth Handler, Mattel co-founder and creator of the Barbie doll, who explains that Barbie's story has no set ending and her ever-evolving history surpasses her roots.
After bidding goodbye to the other dolls and Mattel executives, Barbie decides to become human again and return to the real world. Some time later, Gloria, her husband, and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name "Barbara Handler", to her firstgynecologistappointment.
Tanner, a discontinued toydogknown for hisdefecatingfeature, makes a non-speaking appearance as one of the discontinued characters living with Weird Barbie.[29]
The concept of a live-actionBarbiefilm was in development atCannon Filmsin the mid-1980s.[39]Renewed development on a film based on theBarbietoy line began in September 2009, when it was announced thatMattelhad signed a partnership withUniversal Picturesand producerLaurence Mark, but nothing came to fruition.[40]In April 2014, Mattel teamed withSony Picturesto produce the film, which would haveJenny Bickswriting the screenplay andLaurie MacDonaldandWalter F. Parkesproducing through theirParkes+MacDonald Image Nationbanner. Filming was anticipated to begin by the end of the year.[41]In March 2015,Diablo Codywas brought onto the project to rewrite the screenplay, andAmy Pascaljoined the producing team.[42]Sony ordered further rewrites by Lindsey Beer,Bert V. Royaland Hillary Winston, who submitted separate drafts.[43]
In December 2016,Amy Schumerentered negotiations for the title role with Winston's screenplay. She helped rewrite the script with her sister, Kim Caramele.[44]In March 2017, she exited negotiations, initially saying it was due to scheduling conflicts with the planned June 2017 filming; she revealed in 2023 that she left due to creative differences with the film's producers.[45][46]That July,Anne Hathawaywas considered for the title role; Sony hired Olivia Milch to rewrite the screenplay and approachedAlethea Jonesto direct as a means of interesting Hathaway in signing.[47]Jones was attached to direct by March 2018.[48]
In August 2018, Mattel CEOYnon Kreizhired film executiveRobbie Brenner, who was later appointed head ofMattel Films.[49][50]Sony's option on the project expired in October 2018, and film rights were transferred toWarner Bros. Pictures, causing Hathaway, Jones, Macdonald, Parkes and Pascal to leave the project.Margot Robbieentered early talks for the role, andPatty Jenkinswas briefly considered as director.[51]Kreiz was determined to cast Robbie after meeting with her; both he and Brenner felt that Robbie's appearance resembled that of a conventional Barbie doll and were impressed by her ideas. Initial meetings occurred at thePolo Loungelocated inThe Beverly Hills Hotel.[52][50]Brenner eventually partnered with Robbie's production company,LuckyChap Entertainment, and Robbie's husbandTom Ackerleyand Josey McNamara were enlisted as producers.[49][50]Robbie's casting was confirmed in July 2019.[10]
In her capacity as a producer, Robbie pitchedBarbieto Warner Bros. herself. During the green-light meeting, she compared the film toSteven Spielberg'sJurassic Park(1993) and also jokingly suggested that it would gross over $1 billion.[53]Later on, she approachedGreta Gerwig—whose previous films, particularlyLittle Women(2019), Robbie enjoyed—to screenwrite. Gerwig was in post-production for another film, and took the assignment on the condition that her partner,Noah Baumbach, also write the script.[54][55]Gerwig would sign on to also direct the film in July 2021.[56]Robbie said the film aimed at subverting expectations and giving audiences "the thing you didn't know you wanted".[57]In August 2023,Varietyrevealed that she would earn "roughly $50 million in salary and box office bonuses" as star and producer.[58]
As writers, Gerwig and Baumbach were given full creative freedom. They worked on the screenplay during the 2020–2021COVID-19 pandemic lockdownsat their house in Long Island. Baumbach felt he understood the film's purpose once Gerwig had shown him the first scene, identifying the "element" as "embracing mortality and sadness and sickness and everything that it means to be human". Gerwig was also inspired by the real-life story of Barbie creatorRuth Handler.[59]Gerwig'sfilm treatmentconsisted of anabstract poemon Barbie influenced by theApostles' Creed. For the narrative arc, she was partially inspired by the non-fiction bookReviving Ophelia(1994) byMary Pipher, which accounts the effects of societal pressures on American teenage girls. She also found inspiration in classicTechnicolormusicals such asThe Red Shoes(1948) andThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg(1964), and said: "They have such a high level of what we came to call authentic artificiality. You have a painted sky in a soundstage. Which is an illusion, but it's also really there. The painted backdrop is really there. The tangibility of the artifice is something that we kept going back to."[60]The script also contains candid criticism ofMattel, which created skepticism among Mattel officials when they received the first version. However, Kreiz decided to trust Gerwig. Brenner noted that "being safe in this world doesn't work" as she interpreted Barbie to be a "bold" and "trailblazer" figure. As a result,Will Ferrell's portrayal as the Mattel CEO was meant to be anallegoryfor corporate America. Kreiz praised Ferrell and said that while Mattel officials took their brands seriously, they did not take themselves seriously.[50]Gerwig and Robbie had felt the film was "most certainly a feminist film", but Mattel officials rejected the description. Gerwig and Robbie informed the studio that they would explore the controversies and problematic parts of Barbie, but also convinced the studio that they would respect the product.[61]
Gerwig was also influenced by her childhood experiences with Barbie. Her mother discouraged her from purchasing such dolls, but eventually allowed her to.[62]Opting to acknowledge the controversial nature of the Barbie doll, Gerwig chose to create a film where she would be both "doing the thing and subverting the thing", in the sense that she would be celebrating the feminism behind Barbie while also noting the controversial beauty standards associated with it. She was also fascinated by the idea that humans created dolls, which in turn imitate humans, feeling that "we're in constant conversation with inanimate objects" while also conveying an affirmative message to the audience to "just be yourself and know that that's enough". The film deliberately juxtaposed contradictory messaging, such as critiquingconsumerismyet glamorizing plastic products; and in the film's ending, where Barbie desires to be more than just a plastic doll. Gerwig made the film as an "earnest attempt to make amends" between affirming women's worth and conveying the impossibility of perfection, which some perceived to be standards associated with Barbie.[5][63]
Reflecting upon themaximalismof Barbie, Gerwig said the "ontologyof Barbie" was similar to what she perceived asWilliam Shakespeare's maximalism, which she enjoyed in his works. She grounded the film in what she described as a "heightened theatricality that allows you to deal with big ideas in the midst of anarchic play".[64]She also described the film as being anarchic, unhinged, and humanist.[62][65]She felt the film originated from the "deep isolation of thepandemic", opining that the line in which Barbie says "Do you guys ever think about dying?" exemplifies the film's anarchic nature. She also found the idea of Barbie being "constrained in multitudes" as "all of these women are Barbie and Barbie is all of these women" to be "trippy" and felt as a result, Barbie did not need to have her own personal life, as she was attuned to her environment. She also described the story as mirroring a girl's journey from childhood to adolescence, though she did not deem it to be acoming of agefilm and felt that the film ultimately "ends up, really, about being human".[62]
Primarily, she began her writing by interpreting Barbie as living in autopiaand eventually experiencing reality, where she would have to "confront all the things that were shielded from them in this place [Barbieland]". She also drew parallels to the story ofAdam and Eveand taking inspiration fromJohn Milton'sParadise Lost, particularly being inspired by the concept that there is "no poetry without pain".[55]To underscore the tragic elements of Barbie and Ken facing the real world, she focused on elements of dissonance.[54]As such, she chose to keep a scene featuring Robbie's Barbie telling an older woman that she is beautiful after being requested to remove it, as she felt that the scene epitomized "the heart of the movie". She also desired to provide a "counterargument" to Barbie by featuring a scene in which Barbie learns that some women do not like her, and felt it gave the film "real intellectual and emotional power".[65]As such, a scene is featured in which Barbie is being stared at inappropriately on the Venice Beach, which Gerwig chose to feature as she felt it was a universal experience, being especially relevant for actors. She was inspired by an audition she did in which she wore overalls and felt that she did not perform well in.[66]
The ending of the film features Barbie saying the line "I'm here to see my gynecologist", with Gerwig describing it as a "mic drop kind of joke". She had chosen to include the line as she had wanted to instill confidence in younger girls, as she had been embarrassed about her body when she was younger.[67]Barbiealso explores the negative consequences of hierarchical power structures, with Gerwig saying that she extrapolated that "Barbies rule and Kens are an underclass" and felt it was similar to thePlanet of the Apes.[65]Ken has low self-esteem and seeks approval from Barbie, which Gerwig identified as a good source for a story. Gosling compared Gerwig's vision toMilton Glaser'sI Love New Yorklogo as he felt Gerwig created the film's characters as a way of understanding the contemporary world.[68]Ken has the onlypower balladin the film, and Gerwig had identified it as the moment in which she felt the film transcended what a Barbie film traditionally should have been.[5][69]
Gerwig and Robbie searched for actresses with "Barbie energy", a trait they described as "a certain ineffable combination of beauty and exuberance".[60]In October 2021,Ryan Goslingentered final negotiations to play Ken in the film.[18]America Ferrera,Simu LiuandKate McKinnonwere cast in February 2022.[70][71][72]Liu auditioned for the film after his agent raved about the script being one of the best they had ever read.[73]In March 2022,Ariana Greenblatt,Alexandra Shipp, andEmma Mackeywere revealed to be in the cast.[74][75][76]Will Ferrelljoined the cast in April, along withIssa Rae,Michael Cera,Hari Nef,Kingsley Ben-Adir,Rhea Perlman,Ncuti Gatwa,Emerald Fennell,Sharon Rooney,Scott Evans,Ana Cruz Kayne,Connor Swindells,Ritu AryaandJamie Demetriou.[77][28][78][79]In April 2023, a trailer revealed thatJohn Cenahad joined the cast. It was later reported that Cena had spontaneously been offered a part in the film after paying for Robbie's meal in London during production.[80]Helen Mirrennarrated the film's trailer and the film itself.[81]Robbie and Gosling were each paid $12.5 million for their participation as actors.[82]
Olivia Colmanfilmed a cameo but it was cut from the film.[83]Robbie wantedGal Gadotto play a Barbie in the film, but Gadot was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts.[84]Gerwig wanted her frequent collaboratorsTimothée ChalametandSaoirse Ronanto make cameo appearances, but neither was available;[85]Gerwig later revealed that during a visit to the set, Chalamet said he should have been in the film.[86]Additionally,Bowen Yang,Dan LevyandBen Plattwere considered to play Kens.Jonathan Groffwas the first choice for Allan, played by Cera, but turned it down.[87]Matt Bomerauditioned and was offered a role but ultimately turned it down due to the production schedule.[88]Ben Affleckwas initially set to cameo during the beach fight sequence but scheduling conflicts withAir(2023) resulted in him having to back out and his role in the film was rewritten for Cera.[89]
Sarah GreenwoodandKatie Spencerwere the set designer and decorator, respectively, forBarbie. For theBarbie Dreamhouse, they drew inspiration frommid-century modernistarchitecture found inPalm Springs, including the 1946Kaufmann Desert HousebyRichard Neutra, and the photography ofSlim Aarons. Gerwig wanted to capture "what was so ridiculously fun about the Dreamhouses", alluding to its previous models, and referencedPee-wee's Big Adventure(1985), the paintings ofWayne Thiebaud, and the apartment ofGene Kelly's character in the Technicolor musicalAn American in Paris(1951). "Everything needed to be tactile, because toys are, above all, things you touch", Gerwig said of the use ofpractical effectsinstead ofcomputer-generated imagery(CGI) to capture the sky and theSan Jacinto Mountains. The set design is also noted for its extensive use of a specific shade of pink, Pantone 219.Rosco Laboratories, the film's paint supplier, faced internationalshortagesdue toCOVID-19-related supply-chain issues, as well as freezing temperatures that damaged stock; the film's sets required the company's entire remaining stock of pink.[90][91][92]Because Gerwig also wanted to use practical builds,[93]and had to film sequences in miniature models, then composite the footage onto the actual image. She began discussing the production design with cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, Greenwood, and costume designerJacqueline Durrana year in advance of filming.[93]She also called directorPeter Weirfor inspiration on Barbie Land, with the idea of creating it as an "interior soundstage world".[66]
Costume designerJacqueline Durran, who previously collaborated with Gerwig onLittle Women(2019), employed a practical approach to create Barbie's wardrobe: "The defining characteristic of what she wears is where she's going and what she's doing, [i]t's about being completely dressed for your job or task." To match the film's Barbieland setting, Durran and her team created costumes made of roughly fifteen color combinations "that riffed off the idea of aFrench Rivierabeach in the early 1960s" and drew inspiration from actressBrigitte Bardot. For Ken's outfits, Durran zeroed in a look composed of colorful sportswear from the1980s, while actor Ryan Gosling suggested a Ken-branded underwear for the character. Durran closely adapted outfits from past iterations of Barbie dolls, such as the 1993 "Western Stampin'" dolls and the 1994 "Hot Skatin'" dolls. She noted the Barbie dolls as "a very useful way to look at different ideas offemininity: what that means, who owns it, and who it's aimed at" and reflected this idea in how she dressed the characters. While the majority of the clothing featured in the film were sourced by Durran and her team, they also pulled pieces from the fashion archives ofChanel.[94]Ivana Primoracwas the lead hair and makeup artist for the film.[95]In 2024, Primorac and Marie Larkin and Clare Corsick jointly won theMake-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild Award for Best Period and/or Character Hair Styling in a Feature-Length Motion PictureforBarbie.[96]
Principal photographybegan on March 22, 2022, atWarner Bros. Studios, Leavesdenin England and wrapped on July 21.[97]Among the notablelocationswas theVenice Beach Skateparkin Los Angeles, California.[98]Rodrigo Prietoserved as cinematographer.[99]Prior to filming, Gerwig organized asleepoverwith the female cast members for them to establish positive relationships, also feeling that it "would be the most fun way to kick everything off".[62]She opted to use filming techniques from the 1950s (as Barbie had been a popular toy since 1959) to create a period-accurate look.[93]She also watchedPowell and Pressburger'sA Matter of Life and Death(1946) to understand how pre-digital visual effects were used to create theatricality. To highlight the tragic nature of Barbie and Ken facing the difficulties of the real world, she directed Robbie and Gosling to act as if they were in a drama.[54]
Editor Nick Huoy returned to work with Greta Gerwig, having also cutLady BirdandLittle Women.[100]Finding the tone of the film was a playful experiment working collaboratively with Gerwig and VFX supervisor Glen Pratt and VFX producer Nick King.[101]Pratt focused on blending the practical with the digital.[102]Practical miniatures were built, scanned and captured with photogrammetry inspiring the creation of hundreds of digital miniatures to populate Barbie Land vistas, set extensions, backdrops and full CG shots.[103]Pratt worked with visual effects studiosFramestoreon Barbie Land scenes and UPP on the invisible effects deployed in the real world and a car chase sequence.
The palette chosen for the scenes in Barbie Land was inspired by the classic three-strip Technicolor look, and was named TechnoBarbie. This required the creation of a software called PPL, a color correcting program which separates the image into the three basic components of blue, green, and red, which can then be manipulated individually.[104]
Alexandre Desplat, who collaborated with Gerwig onLittle Women(2019), was set to scoreBarbiein early September 2022.[105]However, by May 2023, he had left the project, andMark RonsonandAndrew Wyattassumed scoring duties.[106]The score was released byWaterTower Musicon August 4, 2023.[107]
Ronson was also tasked with curating a compilation soundtrack that matched Gerwig's vision forBarbie. As the film was being edited, Ronson and Gerwig showed some of its scenes to artists they wanted on the soundtrack.[108]The soundtrack,Barbie the Album, was released on July 21, 2023, and features music byAva Max,Charli XCX,Dominic Fike,Fifty Fifty,Gayle,Haim,Ice Spice,Kali,Karol G,Khalid,Sam Smith,Lizzo,Nicki Minaj,Billie Eilish,PinkPantheress,Tame Impala,the Kid Laroi, and cast membersRyan GoslingandDua Lipa.[109]"Dance the Night" byDua Lipawas released as the album's lead single on May 26, 2023.[110]It was followed by "Watati" byKarol Gon June 2, 2023. "Angel" byPink Pantheresswas released on June 9, 2023, as the first promotional single.[111][112]"Barbie World" byNicki MinajandIce Spicewas released as the album's third single on June 23, 2023.[113]The album's second promotional single, "Speed Drive" byCharli XCXwas released on June 30, 2023.[114]On July 6, 2023, the album's third and final promotional single, "Barbie Dreams" byFifty FiftyandKaliiiwas released.[115]On July 10, 2023, Warner Bros. released a preview clip ofRyan Goslingsinging "I'm Just Ken".[116]The album's fourth single, "What Was I Made For?" byBillie Eilish, was released on July 13, 2023.[117]
Despite fan expectations for the 1997 song "Barbie Girl" by the pop bandAquato feature in the film, Ulrich Møller-Jørgensen, manager for Aqua lead singerLene Nystrøm, said that it was not used;Varietyspeculated that it was due to bad relations between Mattel andMCA Records, the song's American publisher, who engaged ina series of lawsuitsover it from 1997 to 2002.[118]"Barbie World", a rework of the song, was instead used in the film.[119][113]It samples "Barbie Girl";[120]Aqua is credited as a performer and co-writer on the track.[120][121]
The film features multiple renditions of the 1989 song "Closer to Fine" by theIndigo Girlsand the 1997 song "Push" byMatchbox Twenty, the latter of which Ken adopts as his favorite song after visiting the real world, which becomes "a tongue-in-cheek anthem of patriarchal dominance" in the fictional Barbieland.[122]While many reviews of the film interpreted this as a critique of the song,[123][124]directorGreta Gerwigsaid that she was a fan of Matchbox Twenty and "I never put anything in a movie I don't love."[125]"Spice Up Your Life" bySpice Girlsplays in a flashback scene showing a little girl's rough play creating "Weird Barbie".[126][127]
Barbiereceived an extensive marketing campaign. In the months leading up to its release, Mattel entered into severalBarbie-themed promotional partnerships and collaborations with various brands, includingAirbnb,[128]Aldo Group,[129]Bloomingdale's,[130]Burger KingBrazil,[131]Chi Haircare,[132]Forever 21,[133]Gap Inc.,[134]Hot Topic,[135]Krispy KremePhilippines,[136]Primark,[137]Progressive Insurance,[138]Spirit Halloween,[139]Ulta,[140]andXbox.[141]Studio parent companyWarner Bros. Discoveryalso engaged incross-promotionthrough its TV channels, most prominently with anHGTVrenovationreality competitionseries,Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge, coproduced by Mattel Television, which premiered shortly before the film's release.[142]Trade publicationVarietyreported that Warner Bros. spent $150 million promotingBarbie—more than the $145 million budget used to produce the film itself.[143][144]
A first-look image of the film was revealed during a Warner Bros. presentation atCinemaConin April 2022. Released to the public on April 27, 2022, it showed Margot Robbie as Barbie, behind the wheel of her iconic pink1956 Chevrolet Corvette.[145]Collidercommented: "This photo is just further proof that Robbie was made to play this role. She just looks like a Barbie doll come to life—it's almost uncanny."[146]On June 15, 2022, a second still featuring Ryan Gosling as Ken was released.[147]Despite noting similarities between his look in the image and his previous roles,The Guardianasserted that "there is a very strong chance that this will be [Gosling's] defining role".[148]
ABarbiebooth was opened at the 2022CCXPevent inSão Paulo, Brazil.[149]The film's first teaser trailer debuted during preview screenings ofAvatar: The Way of Waterin December 2022. It featured a parody of the opening "Dawn of Man" sequence inStanley Kubrick's 1968 film2001: A Space Odyssey, where Robbie (clad in Barbie's original 1959 outfit) imitates analien monolithwhose influence on the history of dolls is narrated byHelen Mirren.[150]Along with a theatrical poster, the teaser trailer was released to the public on December 16, 2022.[151]Rolling Stonepraised the2001homage and the trailer's vibrant colors, and remarked on its vague hints of the plot: "One has to wonder when, or better yet how, it will all get shaken up."[152]
At the2023 Academy Awards, Robbie co-presented a tribute to Warner Bros withMorgan Freeman. During the montage, they reflected on the roles and projects they had shared with the company, and Freeman eventually referred to Robbie as 'Barbie'.[citation needed]On April 4, 2023, 24 character posters of the several Barbies and Kens featured in the film, tagged with brief descriptions, were shared onBarbie'ssocial media accounts.[153]Empireremarked: "You might have thought thatMultiversefever would be constrained generally to comic book films and never-would-have-called-it Oscar winners [Everything Everywhere All at Once]. But ... it seems Greta Gerwig'sBarbiemovie will also be flooding the screen with variants, this time of plastic dolls Barbie and Ken."[154]A second teaser trailer was unveiled shortly after the posters' release, featuring a rendition ofthe Beach Boys' 1964surf rocksong "Fun, Fun, Fun".[155]The Washington Postnoted that the "visually striking" and "polysemic" teaser captivated multiple demographics because of its humor, color palette, and the Barbie doll's cross-generational appeal.[156]An official trailer for the film was released on May 25, 2023.[157]Critics noted itsexistentialtone set against upbeat music.[158][159][160][161]Ben Travis ofEmpiresaid: "There's much to discuss here—not least, that it looks visually impeccable" and speculatedAcademy Awardsattention for its production and costume design.[162]A  float promoting the film was featured in the 2023WeHo Pride Paradein Los Angeles; two of its LGBTQ+ cast members, Alexandra Shipp and Scott Evans, were present.[163]
In June 2023, a FrenchBarbieposterwent viralfor including the tagline "Elle peut tout faire. Lui, c'est juste Ken" ("She can do everything. He's just Ken").Kenis theverlanslang term for "fuck" in French—i.e. the phonological inversion ofnique, whilec'est("he is") is ahomophoneforsait("he knows how")—so the tagline could also be read as "She can do everything. He just knows how to fuck." Analysts concluded that the pun was most likely intentional, as the slang term is common knowledge among French speakers; Warner Bros. would neither confirm nor deny this.[164]
Leading up to the release, pink billboards, blank apart from the film's release date, appeared worldwide, and a real-world "Barbie Dreamhouse" in Malibu, California became available to rent through Airbnb.[165]On July 14, 2023,SAG-AFTRA, an Americanlabor unionof film, television and voice actors,declared a strike action, effectively halting any promotional event that involved the guild's members.[166]Robbie showed her support for the action.[167]SAG-AFTRA PresidentFran Drescherlater claimed that the studios "duped" the guild into accepting a 12-day extension for negotiations to continue promoting summer films likeBarbie.[168]To coincide with the film's release, astop motioncrossover trailer with the animated filmTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant MayhemfromParamount Pictures, produced bySeth Rogen, was released on July 20, 2023.[169]
Barbiehad its world premiere at theShrine Auditoriumin Los Angeles on July 9, 2023,[170]followed by the European premiere atCineworldLeicester Squarein London on July 12, 2023.[171]It was released theatrically in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21, 2023,[172][173]taking over the original release date of the now unreleasedCoyote vs. Acme.[174]Previous iterations of the project were set for June 2, 2017;[175]May 12, 2017;[176]June 29, 2018;[177]August 8, 2018;[178]and May 8, 2020.[179]
In August 2023, it was announced that the film would be re-released inIMAXtheaters on September 22, 2023, for one week only, along with a newpost-credit scene.[180]The IMAX edition starts with an onscreen introduction by Greta Gerwig, who notes the advantages of the IMAX format. The post-credits scene includes an intro of Margot Robbie's Barbie, in her 1959 Barbie bathing suit, taking a human-sized Ken doll on camera, which transforms into Ryan Gosling's Ken; followed by humorous outtakes, e.g. whether Barbie should marryBarney the Dinosaur, and a voiceover by Robbie hoping people enjoyed the experience. Too, as Sarah Little notes onScreen Rant, "The meta post-credits scene features [narrator Helen] Mirren as herself walking in on Midge, played by Emerald Fennell, giving birth."[181][182]The film also received a Spanish language release in the United States and Puerto Rico on the TheaterEars app.[183]
Barbiewas released on the same day asOppenheimer, abiographical filmaboutJ. Robert Oppenheimerwritten and directed byChristopher Nolanbased on the 2005 bookAmerican Prometheus, and distributed by Universal Pictures. Due to the tonal and genre contrast between the two films, manysocial mediausers createdmemesandironic postsabout how the two films appealed to different audiences,[184]and how they should be viewed as adouble feature.[185][186]Hence, the trend was dubbed "Barbenheimer".[187]In an interview withLa Vanguardia,OppenheimerstarCillian Murphyendorsed the phenomenon, saying, "My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain."[188]TheBarbenheimerphenomenon was widely credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend (52% forBarbie) being for the two films, a total of 18.5 million people.[4]
Barbiewas released on digital download on September 12, 2023,[189]and was released onUltra HD Blu-ray,Blu-ray, andDVDon October 17, 2023, byWarner Bros. Home Entertainment.[190]The film was available for streaming exclusively onMaxon December 15, 2023, including anAmerican Sign Languageversion.[191]
The controversy over the alleged appearance of thenine-dash line(a depiction of theSouth China Seafrom Chinese perspective) in the film began whenVietnam's film censorship authority banned the film for allegedly displaying such lines. In contrast, the counterpart from thePhilippinesrequested that the lines in question be blurred. Both countries have banned the filmsAbominable(2019) andUncharted(2022) for featuring the actual nine-dash line.[192][193]The nine-dash line is controversial due to maritime border disputes between China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines.[194]
On July 3, 2023, Vietnamese newspaperTuổi TrẻquotedVi Kiến Thành[vi], head of theDepartment of Cinema, as announcing thatBarbiewould be banned in Vietnam because it contained "the offending image of the nine-dash line".[195][196]TheTiền Phongnewspaper reported that the nine-dash line "appears multiple times in the film".[197][198]The film was originally scheduled to be released in Vietnam on July 21.[199]
Speaking toVoice of America, Trịnh Hữu Long (founder of the research group Legal Initiatives for Vietnam) said, "The censors will even be praised for overreacting to the unclear map, by both their superiors and the public, because anti-China sentiment runs deep into the country's political culture", and that "the government is surely using legitimate nationalist reasoning to strengthen its entire censorship system", while Michael Caster at the free expression groupArticle 19said, "Maps are political, and borders often bear historical wounds, but rather than ensuring free and open discussion, the knee jerk response to censor seldom supports historical or transitional justice."[200]
Speaking toVox,University of California, Berkeleyprofessor Peter Zinoman said, "To the Chinese, the nine-dash line signifies their legitimate claims to the South China Sea", and "to the Vietnamese, it symbolizes a brazen act of imperialist bullying that elevates Chinese national interest over an older shared set of interests of socialist brotherhood".Harvard UniversityprofessorHuệ-Tâm Hồ Tài[vi]said since the producers of the film were aiming for themainland Chinesemarket in the hopes that it would be a blockbuster, "they are ready to accept [mainland China's] view of geography. Disinformation works by repetition."New York Universityprofessor Kevin Li said, "In my view, banning [Barbie] was a no-brainer."[201]In response to Vietnam's ban,Chinese Foreign MinistryspokespersonMao Ningstated at a press briefing on July 4 that the "South China Sea issue" should not be linked with "normal cultural exchange".[202]
When news of Vietnam's ban reached the Philippines, SenatorFrancis Tolentino, vice chairman of thePhilippine Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, toldCNN PhilippinesthatBarbiemay also be banned in the country because it "denigrates" Filipino sovereignty.[203]SenatorJinggoy Estradacalled the film to be banned over the alleged inclusion of the nine-dash line; opposition senatorRisa Hontiverosquipped "the movie is fiction, and so is the nine-dash line", and suggested adding a disclaimer to the film instead of banning its release.[204]SenatorRobin Padilla, chairman of theSenate mass media committee, suggested that the film producers must edit out references to the nine-dash line or risk the film being banned.[205]
On July 11, the Philippines'Movie and Television Review and Classification Board(MTRCB) came to the conclusion that there was "no basis" to banning the film as the map was simply "cartoonish" and that there was no clear nor outright depiction of the nine-dash line, as the line in the film was "not U-Shaped" and had "eight dots or dashes" instead of nine.[206][207]The board gave the film a PG rating, as well as allowing it to be screened in the country, however they requested Warner Bros. to "blur the controversial lines in order to avoid further misinterpretations".[208][209]Senator Tolentino said that he respected the MTRCB's decision, but expressed his dismay at it emerging a day before the seventh anniversary ofPhilippines' victory in an arbitration over the nine-dash lineon July 12, 2016.[210][211]The film was released in the Philippines on July 19, 2023.[211]
With the rising concerns over the alleged appearance of the nine-dash line, several media outlets pointed to a drawing of a world map which appears in a trailer for the film.[212][213][214][215]TheLos Angeles Timesdescribed the particular image as a "map of 'the real world' [which] looks as if it's been drawn in crayon by a child" with a line of dashes "alongside the coast of what should be China".[212]On July 6, 2023,Warner Bros.issued a statement explaining that the map in the concerned image is a "child-like crayon drawing", with the dashed lines depicting Barbie's journey from Barbie Land to the real world and was "not intended to make any type of statement".[216][217]Jordan Richard Schoenherr from Concordia University said that while the map might seem innocuous, the repeated presentation of images that supported the goals of the Chinese government risks increasing their acceptance by international publics and is therefore a cause for concern.[218]In the world map drawing, dashed lines can be seen near Asia, the United States, Greenland, Brazil and Africa.[219]
In someMuslim-majority countries, there were attempts to ban the film on moral grounds or for allegedly showing LGBTQ+ themes. Some of them were successful.[220]
InPakistan, the film was released nationwide on July 21, 2023.[221]ThePunjab Film Censor Board(which handles the censorship in thePunjab province) and other regional equivalents cleared the film for screening.[221]But on July 22, Punjab province's caretaker Minister of Information and CultureAmir Mirused his authority to halt the screenings of the film in the province, alleging that it "[shows] homosexuality".[221]Punjab's Information Secretary Ali Nawaz Malik toldDawnthat the film "has been sent toDubaifor a censorship review".[222]On August 1, the final approval was given for the film to be shown in the province.[223]
In theMiddle East, the film was initially scheduled to be released on July 19, 2023, before being delayed to August 31.[224]Later,Vox Cinemas, the distributor of Warner Bros. films in the region, announced that the film would be released in the region on August 10.[225]Although the film censorship authorities in the region initially did not specify any reason, it was suggested that the inclusion of a transgender actress in one of the Barbie roles, and the narrations and dialogs related to LGBTQ+ matters might have been the issues with the film.[225]
On August 9, 2023,Lebanon'sMinister of CultureMohammad Mortada[de], who is backed byHezbollah, proposed that the film be banned in the country for "[promoting] homosexuality and sexual transformation" and "[contradicting] values of faith and morality" by "diminishing the importance of the family unit". Following Mortada's proposal, theMinister of Interior and MunicipalitiesBassam Mawlawiasked the relevant authority (which is under the scope of Interior Ministry'sGeneral Security) to review the film and give its recommendation.[226][227][228]On August 11, it was reported that the Lebanese authority, comprising the representatives from the General Security and theMinistry of Economy and Trade, found no reason to ban the film in the country.[229][230]On September 1, the film was formally approved for screening in Lebanon for audiences aged 13 and above.[231]Barbiewas released in Lebanese theaters on September 7.[232][233]
Also on August 9, 2023, theKuwaitiauthority[which?]formally announced the ban of bothBarbieand Australian horror filmTalk to Me(which stars anon-binary and transgender actor), with the head of the authority Lafi Al-Subaie accusing the former of "carrying ideas that encourage unacceptable behavior and distort society's values".[226][227][228]
On August 13, 2023, just three weeks after its release on July 19, the screenings ofBarbiewere halted in film theaters inAlgeria.[234][235]According toReuters, the official source was quoted as saying that the film "promotes homosexuality and otherWestern deviances" and that it "does not comply with Algeria's religious and cultural beliefs".[236]
Barbiegrossed $636.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $809.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.446 billion.[6][7]This was described byWarner Bros.as "reaching a Barbillion".[237]Deadline Hollywoodcalculated the film's net profit as $421million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses, television and streaming, and home media revenues placed it second on their list of 2023's "Most Valuable Blockbusters".[238]
It was described as a "record-breaking" box office success during its opening weekend,[239][240][241]and set the record for any film that was not a sequel, remake, orsuperheroproperty.[242]Barbiebecame the highest-grossing live-action comedy film of all time, smashing the domestic record formerly held byHome Alone(1990) and the worldwide record formerly held byThe Hangover Part II(2011) simultaneously.[243]It has also become Gerwig's highest-grossing film, overtaking its predecessorLittle Women(2019).[244]The film crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide on August 6, 2023, making it the only film by a solo female director to do so.[245]This was also the fastest Warner Bros. film to reach $1 billion, beatingHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2(2011).[246][247]In late August,Barbiesurpassed that same film again, becoming Warner Bros.'s highest-grossing film, not adjusted for inflation.[248]By September 2, the film surpassed $1.365 billion at the global box office, replacingThe Super Mario Bros. Movieas the highest-grossing film of the year.[249][250]Additionally, it became the highest-grossing film by a solo female director, surpassing the previous record held byJia LingforHi, Mom(2021).[251]
In the United States and Canada,Barbiewas released alongsideOppenheimer, and was originally projected to gross $90–125 million from 4,243 theaters in its opening weekend, with Warner Bros. predicting a $75 million debut.[252]The week of their release,AMC Theatresannounced that over 40,000 AMC Stubs members had pre-booked tickets toboth films on the same day.[253]It earned $70.5 million on its opening day, which included $22.3 million from Wednesday and Thursday night previews, both of which were the best of 2023.[254]Barbie's opening weekend gross of $162 million marked the largest opening sinceBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever($181.3 million in November 2022). It was also the biggest opening ever for a film helmed by a female director, bestingCaptain Marvel(2019), and surpassedSuicide Squad(2016) to have Robbie's highest opening weekend, as well asBlade Runner 2049(2017) to have Gosling's largest opening weekend.[255][256]It scored the third-highest July opening weekend at the time, behindThe Lion King(2019) andHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2.[257]This also marked the third-highest opening weekend for a Warner Bros. film, after the latter film andBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016).[258]Barbiealso scored the biggest opening for a film based on a toy, surpassingTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen(2009).[259]Furthermore, it dethronedThe Secret Life of Pets(2016) to achieve the biggest non-sequel July opening weekend.[256]Upon opening,Barbiereached the number one spot at the box office, defeatingOppenheimer,Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part OneandSound of Freedom.[260]
Following its opening weekend,BarbiesurpassedThe Dark Knight(2008) as the highest Monday gross ever for a Warner Bros. film, collecting a total of $26.1 million.[261]It also quickly beatLa La Land(2016) to become Gosling's highest-grossing film of all time.[262]In its second weekend, the film earned $92 million, dropping by 43%, which was the largest sophomore weekend ever for a Warner Bros. film and the seventh-largest ever.[263][264]The film remained in first place with $53 million in its third weekend,[245]and $33.7 million in its fourth weekend.[265]On August 16, 2023,Barbieonce again surpassedThe Dark Knight; this time as the highest-grossing domestic release in Warner Bros. history, having earned $537.5 million.[266]The film was dethroned in its fifth weekend by newcomerBlue Beetle($25 million), though it continued to hold well with a gross of $21.5 million.[267]On August 24, 2023,BarbiesurpassedThe Super Mario Bros. Movie($574 million) to become the highest-grossing film of the year in North America.[268][269][270]Barbiefinished in second place again in its sixth weekend, this time behind newcomerGran Turismo.[271]
Outside of the United States and Canada,Barbieearned $194.3 million from 69 offshore markets in its opening weekend. Of the 69 markets, it was the number one film for the weekend in 58, scored the largest opening weekend for a Warner Bros. film in 26 and marked the largest opening for a 2023 film in 24. In the United Kingdom, the film opened with $24.2 million, which was the year's largest opening. In France, it opened with $10.2 million, marking the largest debut for a Warner Bros. film sinceJoker(2019).[272]The following weekend,Barbieearned $127 million, dropping by just 31%.

By contrast, inSouth Korea(where the film opened on July 19, 2023),Barbieunderperformed at the box office. During the period between July 28 and 30, 2023, the film recorded around 81,000 admissions (earning $667,000) and finished in the fifth place in the South Korean box office, falling behindSmugglers(around 1.17 million admissions; $9.31 million),Elemental(around 360,000 admissions; $2.85 million),Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One(around 300,000 admissions; $2.43 million) and theDetective Conan: Black Iron Submarine(around 89,000 admissions; $703,000).[278][279]It was suggested that the animosity against feminist messages in the film, the lack of popularity ofBarbiedolls in South Korea, and cultural differences between United States and South Korea have contributed to the film's under-performance there.[280][281][282][283]Film critic Youn Sung-Eun toldYonhap News Agencythat 'in [South] Korea, where the recognition of feminism is not good, [people] don't want to accept that an amusement like film has a message [about social issues]', and that 'the film uses its later half to preach [about sexual discrimination], which might be hard to accept [to South Koreans]'.[281]In an interview withThe Hollywood Reporter, Kang Hye-jung, the producer ofSmugglers, said "I couldn't understand why Hollywood went so wild aboutBarbie, perhaps because it has never been our [toy]."[282]Writing forThe Korea Times, professor emeritus Mark Peterson atBrigham Young Universityopined that the film under-performed in South Korea because "it was one fully-loaded package of American culture of the last 50 years, which didn't convey much meaning to [South] Korean audiences".[283]
In Japan,Barbieranked at no. 16.[284]Prior to the release date, public opinion ofBarbiehad soured after the official Twitter account for theBarbiefilm had responded positively to several Barbenheimer memes, all of which depicted atomic bombing mushroom clouds comically. This was seen as an endorsement of such jokes, and, in turn, was met with disapproval from the Japanese public, who criticized their ignorance, particularly due to their negligence towards the history of theatomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Mitsuki Takahata, who provided Barbie's voice in the Japanese dub of the film, stated on herInstagramaccount that she was disappointed and had considered dropping out of one of the film's promotional events.[285]In China,Barbieearned more than $32 million as of August 2023.[286]
Barbieattained critical acclaim.[c]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 88% of 500 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8/10. The website's consensus reads: "Barbieis a visually dazzling comedy whose meta humor is smartly complemented by subversive storytelling."[297]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 80 out of 100, based on 67 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[298]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled byPostTrakgave it an 89% overall positive score, with 79% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[4]
In his review for theChicago Tribune,Michael PhillipscalledBarbie"a lovely, eccentrically imaginative example of brand extension and raw, untrammeled commercialism", applauded the production design, and summed: "The crucial partnership here is the one between director and performer, Gerwig and Robbie; anything Gerwig and Baumbach's verbally dexterous script requires, from Barbie's first teardrop to the final punchline, Robbie handles with unerring precision."[299]Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkercalled it "brilliant, beautiful and fun as hell", claiming the "giddily stylized vision of a doll coming to life makes a serious case for the art of adapting even the most sanitizedI.P." and commended the "free and wild" direction as well as the "profuse and exquisite" visual aesthetics.[300]Charlotte O'Sullivan of theEvening Standardhailed the film as "easily the comedy of the year" with a large amount of fun, where "star and producer Margot Robbie, and writer-director Greta Gerwig, have done themselves proud" with a "breezily outrageous" film "about a woman's right to be 'weird, dark and crazy'".[301]Eileen Jones ofJacobinsaid that the film "manages to overcome cumbersome plotting and feminist pieties to provide a delightful spectacle of funny moments that add up to something pretty good".[302]
InThe Guardian,Peter BradshawawardedBarbiea three out of five stars, describing it as "beamingly affectionate and deliriously pink-themed" but "perhaps a giant two-hour commercial for a product" and highlighted Gosling as a scene-stealer, being given "all the best lines".[303]
Lovia Gyarke ofThe Hollywood Reportercalled the film a "tricky balancing act of corporate fealty and subversion" lauding Gerwig's direction, the set design, costumes, soundtrack and lead performances, but criticizing the "muddled politics and flat emotional landing".[11]Varietycritic Peter Debruge praised the humor for giving "permission to challenge what Barbie represents" and lauded Gosling's physical performance, but concluded that the film is "an intellectual experience, not an emotional one, grounded largely in audience nostalgia".[304]In theVulturecomponent ofNew York, Alison Willmore commended the lead performances, particularly that of Robbie, whom she characterized "as capable of heartbreaking earnestness as humor, and who sometimes effortlessly achieved both at once", but lamented the themes of the film, opining that it "doesn't ultimately want to do much more than talk itself in circles about these themes".[305]On a similar note,Stephanie ZacharekofTimepraised Robbie's "buoyant, charming performance", Gosling's "go-for-broke" effort, and the "inventive production design", but criticized the "self aware" nature of the film especially following the first half-hour, concluding that it is a feminist film "only in the most scattershot way", and that it is not "subversive".[306]A mixed review inLe Mondealso expressed doubts about the treatment of the topical issue and found that the "doll drowned herself in kitsch derision" whileGQ-France, regretting that the film did not prove as radical as might have been expected, found it was somehow a continuation ofLittle Women.[307]
Camilla LongofThe Timeswrote that the film featured Mattel's "pink, squealing, corporate grasping", trying to be "ahead of thesexismcurve", but "ended up feeling sexist itself" for its portrayal that "men are stupid, go to the gym, run everything and don't care about women, while women are sensible, striving but ultimately conflicted victims".[308]In the review ofKyle SmithofThe Wall Street Journal, he stated: "As bubbly as the film appears, its script is like a grumpier-than-average women's studies seminar", exemplified by the Mattel employee character's "long monologue on how miserable it is to be female".[309]MovieWebranked it number 1 on its list of the "Best Comedy Movies of the 2020s (So Far)", writing that "Gerwig's ode to the Barbie girl and her Barbie world ... is as surprisingly modern and introspective as audiences have come to expect from her work. Scrunching 60 plus years of history into a two-hour time frame aside, this film gets straight at the heart of what it's like being a woman today while providing more than a laugh or two in the process."[310]Chinese film critic Li Jingfei (李竞菲) praised the film's humor and criticism of patriarchy, qualifying that its themes were too often advanced by slogans rather than the experiences of its characters.[311]
Filmmakers such asAllison Anders,Joe Dante,Drew Goddard,Chad Hartigan,Max Hechtman,Rachel MorrisonandPaul Schraderalso cited the film as among their favorites of 2023.[312][313][314]
TheNational Board of Reviewand theAmerican Film InstitutenamedBarbieone of the top-ten films of 2023.[315][316]The film's soundtrack album and score received 12 nominations at the66th Annual Grammy Awards.[317]Barbietied withCabaret(1972) for the second-most nominations inGolden Globe Awardshistory, earning a leading nine at the81st edition. It would ultimately win two awards at the ceremony, includingBest Original Song(for "What Was I Made For") and the inauguralGolden Globe for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[318][319]Earning 18 nominations at its29th ceremony, the film received the most nominations inCritics' Choice Movie Awardshistory.[320][321]Longlisted in 15 categories at the77th British Academy Film Awards,Barbie(along withOppenheimerandKillers of the Flower Moon) equalled the BAFTA longlist record for most nominations set byEdward Berger's Germananti-war filmAll Quiet on the Western Front(2022).[322]It also received eight nominations at the96th Academy Awards, includingBest Picture,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Supporting Actor(Gosling),Best Supporting Actress(Ferrera) and two nominations forBest Original Song(for "I'm Just Ken" and "What Was I Made For").[323][324]It eventually won Best Original Song (for "What Was I Made For").[325]
As with the doll itself,feminismand related themes in the film were the subject of discussion.[d]Some reviews for the film saw it as satirizingcapitalism, while others perceived it as being a satire utilizing capitalist themes.[333]
Barbiehas been characterized as exploring themes ofexistentialism.[334][335][336]Lucy Ford ofGQwrote that the film "ruminates on the very idea of what makes us human, the idea of 'the other', whether there's truly such a thing asautonomyor if we're all simply pawns to be picked up and disposed of when we are no longer useful". Ford observed that, in the film, Barbie and Ken go on "opposite but equal" journeys of self-discovery, after venturing out into the real world and learning that it is an oppressivepatriarchalsociety as opposed to thematriarchal utopiathat is Barbieland, and get "caught in the crosshairs of being bothsentientand someone else's idea, battling with free will and the omnipresent predetermined rules about where to go and how to act".[335]InClark University, Professor of Philosophy Wiebke Deimling compared a scene in the film, in which Barbie has to make a choice between going back to her perfect life in Barbieland or learning the truth about her existence in the real world, to theexperience machine, athought experimentby American philosopherRobert Nozick. Diemling also observed thatgender in Barbieland is performative, noting how the Kens behave before and after a patriarchy is established.[337]Alissa Wilkinson ofVoxcompared Barbieland to the biblicalGarden of Eden, with Barbie and Ken as inverted parallels ofAdam and Eve. She saw Barbie and Ken's first impression "that they're suddenly self-conscious and aware of being looked at" in the real world as the film's version ofthe Fall.[338]Chinese film critic Li Jingfei (李竞菲) compared Barbie's sudden awareness of death to the moment whenSiddhārtha Gautamaleft the palace of his birth and first learned of suffering and death, which eventually led to his enlightenment.[311]
Katie Pickles ofThe Conversationsaid thatBarbieshows how the matriarchy can be "as bad" as the patriarchy, with the Kens being theobjectifiedandexcluded sexin Barbieland. Pickles further comments that the true heroes were outcasts such as Weird Barbie and Allan, who deprogrammed the Barbies from tolerating thestatus quo. She believes that this aligns with Gerwig's conception of feminism, where "everyone stands in the sunshine".[339][340]
Jack Butler ofNational Reviewrejected the perception of the film as a "shallow, man-hating, and repulsive screed" and argued that the film is instead a "post-feministsatire of what feminists imagine a perfect world looking like and of what they imagine male dominance is like", noted that in the real world, "Ken is rebuffed in all of his attempts to join the male hierarchy that purportedly dominates the world. He must return to Barbie land to institute it; what he institutes there is so shallow that it collapses almost as quickly as it is set up. Meanwhile, though Robbie's Barbie restores female dominance in Barbieland, she chooses not to stay there, electing instead to become fully human."[341]
Ross Douthatwriting inThe New York Timesargued that the film "is a movie with a feminist default, but also [has] complicated and sometimes muddled feelings about what thesexual revolutionhas done and where feminism ought to go". Douthat comments that the female-centric nature of Barbieland is dystopian, where men are nothing more than "arm-candy", and where pregnant women and children are marginalized. He describes the film as "against the resilient patriarchy, but wary of thegirlbossalternative. It wants womanhood and motherhood, but it doesn't want the Kens back in charge, and it doesn't really know what purpose men should serve".[342]
Many journalists coupledBarbiewiththe Eras TourbyTaylor Swiftfor the concurrent representation of recontextualized mainstream femininity.[343][344][345]Michelle GoldbergofThe New York Timesdescribed the launch of the film and the tour, their rave public reception, and the associated critical discourses as the biggest cultural phenomena of 2023 summer, explaining that "beneath their slick, exuberant pop surfaces, [both the film and the tour] tell femalecoming-of-agestories marked by existential crises and bitter confrontations with sexism".[346]Ben Sisarioconsidered both the works ascritiquesof patriarchy,[347]while Talia Lakritz ofBusiness Insidersaid both of them "reclaim girlhood without rescinding power".[348]Similarly, Chris Willman stated that both use patriarchy as a subject ofirony"while being utterly friendly to and welcoming of men as much as anybody", eventually becoming a billion-dollar-earning phenomenon.[349]
In theLos Angeles Times, Jean Guerrero presented asubtextto the film's feminist exterior, in which "a world that disregards men and their feelings is an inverted form of patriarchy and also cruel", and added: "The film is a rare product ofmainstream culturethat invites men to reimaginemasculinityfor their own sake. It acknowledges the identity crisis and loss of hope, economic promise and life purpose among American men. These struggles are often ignored by progressives, but conveniently and poisonously exploited byright-wing manfluencersfromAndrew TatetoJosh Hawley... The film's reception has focused on its messages of women's empowerment, but what makes it a radical story is that it also invites women to reimagine feminism so that it doesn't ignore male struggles."[350]
Nicholas Balaisis contended inPsychology TodaythatBarbieprovides a "relatively nuanced portrayal ofmasculinity" in two cases that resonated with issues and concerns frequent inclinical psychologyandtherapy: In the first case, which concerns the "over-valuation of a woman'sgazeand attention on male sense of self-esteem, and even an existential sense of identity", Ken turns to patriarchal expression and masculine dominance "over other men, women or objects" because he does not receive the "sense of attractiveness, worth, and general self-value" he wants from Barbie's gaze and attention. In the second case, which concerns "the relationship to shame or existential solitude and the conversion to sex-as-soothing", when Barbie approaches Ken in the third act of the film for consolation, he interprets it as a sexual advance and tries to kiss her, which Dr. Balaisis likened to "the same way that shame can quickly morph into resentment and anger, here we see loneliness and existential angst being converted into a sexual plea — for sex to solve and resolve these bad feelings."[351]
Megan Garber ofThe Atlanticfound that Ken and his journey of self-discovery "mimicsadolescence", writing: "Like any teenager, Ken is figuring out who he is, and trying the world's possibilities on for size. But his immaturity is not contained, and this is its problem. His adolescent approach to the world, instead, inflicts itself on everyone else." Garber concluded that Ken embodies a "core idea" in the film "that patriarchy is a profound form of immaturity".[352]Eliana Dockterman ofTimenoted that Ken's radicalization resembles themen's rights movement, particularly in his "feelings ofemasculation",male fragilityandevangelizationof the patriarchy.[353]
On July 25, 2023, followingBarbie's premiere, directorGreta Gerwigstated she had no plans for a sequel.[354]On August 4, 2023, it was reported that Gerwig, co-writerNoah Baumbachand starsMargot RobbieandRyan Goslinghad been contracted for only one film.[355]On December 13, 2024,The Hollywood Reporterreported that a sequel film toBarbiehad entered early development fromWarner Bros.andMattel, with Gerwig and Baumbach set to return. Representatives for Warner Bros., Gerwig, and Baumbach denied the claim.[356]

The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]

In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.

The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros.

As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
