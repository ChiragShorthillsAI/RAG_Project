Its plot centers on a high school dropout who lands a job with a failing pharmaceutical company in Central Florida, where she soon finds herself at the center of a criminal conspiracy.

In 2011, Liza Drake is a struggling single mother living out of her sister's garage inFloridawith her epileptic daughter Phoebe. Working as an exotic dancer, she is offered a lucrative job by customer Pete Brenner.
An argument over money leads to Liza and Phoebe getting kicked out, so they move into a motel. When her car is repossessed, Liza finds Pete at pharmaceutical company Zanna to accept the job. She doesn't know the start-up is struggling, with difficulty breaking into the market and desperately scrambling for investors to fund a marketing push ahead of the plannedIPO.
Pete rewrites Liza's dismal resume, giving her a degree in biochemistry. She impresses the company founder, Doctor Jack Neel, who overrides their hiring freeze. Pete gives her five days to convince a physician to prescribe their drug,Lonafen.
Liza goes through the entire list of prospects in under five days without any success. Meanwhile, Phoebe experiences a seizure and they learn she hasCAVM. Thinking the job is over, Liza returns to Dr. Lydell's office, her first sales attempt, to collect someTupperwareand overhears a cancer patient discussing a commonly prescribed drug's side effects.
Liza argues that Lonafen would be a better option, so Lydell prescribes it. She invites him to launch their speaker program by sharing his experience with the drug's efficacy. The event fails and he nearly withdraws despite his patient praising the drug, but Liza gets the program on track. When Pete offers financial incentives, Lydell prescribes Lonafen to all eligible patients. Based on this success, they hire a team of sales reps and Zanna wins 86% of the regional market.
Larkin, an envious company executive, tries to expose Liza as a fraud for her doctored resume but Neel promotes her to National Sales Director and Pete to COO, who then fires Larkin. The profitable company moves into larger offices where Neel's eccentricities manifest more clearly. When CEO Eric Paley is found to be secretly recording an executive meeting, he is fired but cashes in big on his shares. As growth flattens, Neel pressures the team to market Lonafen for all types of pain, not just cancer. Liza disagrees with this, but Neel dismisses her. He also instructs Liza to fire her mother Jackie as a rep, after he slept with her.
Liza approaches Lydell with her new marching orders and is disappointed when he readily agrees to go along. Meanwhile, Phoebe experiences another seizure and requires expensive brain surgery. Although Liza offers her stock options in Zanna as collateral for a loan, she is denied because of the pharma sector's volatility. After Lydell is arrested in a DEA sting, a desperate Liza asks Neel for help paying for the surgery but he exhorts her to use Phoebe's situation as "fire" for inspiration, like he did when his wife was dying from cancer and he came up with Lonafen.
When a friend's husband dies from a Lonafen overdose and her condolences are rejected, Liza agrees to testify to theU.S. Attorney'soffice that's investigating Zanna. She admits her involvement in Zanna's speaker and bribery programs. Liza confirms who signed off on those programs: Eric Paley, Pete Brenner, and Jack Neel. Asked to come up with hard proof linking Neel to the criminal activity, she explains that he has completely insulated himself from daily operations.
After Liza unsuccessfully attempts to procure a printout from Pete's jacket, he is arrested, though Neel offers to take care of his family while he's in prison. Neel himself remains seemingly untouchable until Liza links him to Zanna's illegal activities via an old email exchange during his affair with her mother.
The investigation reveals that Lonafen is essentially fentanyl, which is why non-terminal patients became addicts and often overdosed. Lydell, Paley, Brenner, and Neel all receive prison sentences. After a heartfelt apology in court and the prosecution's recommendation that Liza not serve time in order not to discourage future whistleblowers, she is still sentenced to 15 months, as her greed cost lives.
After Liza's release, she partners with some of the previous Zanna reps to form the skin care company she and Jackie had envisioned years ago.

David was born on 8 October 1963 inSt Helens,Lancashire, England.[n 1]His parents died when he was young.[9]Raised in the village ofRainhill, Yates was inspired to pursue a career in filmmaking after watchingSteven Spielberg's 1975 movieJaws.[1]Yates's mother bought him aSuper 8mm camera. He used this to shoot various films in which his friends and family featured.[10]One such film,The Ghost Ship, was shot on board the vessel where his uncle worked as a cook.[11]He attended Grange Park High School,[12]St Helens Collegeand then theUniversity of Essex.[13][14][15]Yates said that he "used to skive off college all the time" and never expected to attend university before being surprised by his A-Level exam results. While at the University of Essex, Yates formed the Film and Video Production Society.[16]He graduated with aBAin Government in 1987.[17]
In 1988, Yates made his first filmWhen I Was a GirlinSwindon. The film entered the festival circuit where it was namedBest Short Filmat theSan Francisco International Film Festival. It contributed towards Yates's acceptance into theNational Film and Television Schoolin 1989 and led to theBBChiring him to directOranges and Lemons, a short drama film in 1991. Before completing film school, he began to direct, produce and write the screenplay to the dramatic shortThe Weaver's Wife. He also made his fourth short film,Good Looks, which was presented at theChicago International Film Festival.

The film, which was shown at theEdinburgh International Film Festival, was written by Joe Fisher and based on the true events of theTichborne Case. It starredStephen FryandRobert Hardyand was shot on location inMerseysideand on theIsle of Man.[25][26][27]
Yates returned to television in 2000 to direct the episodes ofGreed,EnvyandLustfor the BBC miniseriesThe Sins, starringPete Postlethwaite, as well asThe Way We Live Now, the four-part television adaptation of thenovel of the same namebyAnthony Trollope.

One year later, Yates attended the56th BAFTA Awardswith aBritish Academy Film Award nomination for Best Short Filmfor the fourteen-minute production,Rank, which expressed the social elements of racism, friendship and adolescence through the story of a street gang that crossGlasgowto witness the arrival of a group of Somali refugees.[29][30]Yates said that even thoughThe Way We Live Nowwas "a very big production" and "enormous fun to do",Rankwas an opportunity to "shake all that off" and "get back to [his] roots". Of the casting, Yates said that he "wanted to use non-actors to tell the story, to create a reality ... the kids we cast in Glasgow had never done a film before."[10]The film was noted for its gritty style and cinematography, with a review fromEye For Filmstating that "such intelligent use of camera and cast lifts Yates out of the pool of promising young directors into the front line of genuine hopefuls. This work demands respect."[19][31]
The 2003 six-part thrillerState of Playwas Yates's next achievement.[5]Yates collected the TV Spielfilm Award at theCologne Conferencein Germany and won theDirectors Guild of Great Britain Awardfor Outstanding Directorial Achievement.[3][32]The serial was recognised by various award ceremonies, receiving thePeabody Awardfor Broadcasting Excellence and being presented with twoBritish Academy Television Craft Awards.[33]The quality of the serial sparked Hollywood film bosses to consideradapting it into a film, with producerAndrew Hauptmandeclaring that "it's a blistering political thriller and we want to make an equally blistering movie."[34]State of Playis regarded by critics fromThe GuardianandThe Timesas one of the best British television dramas of the 2000s.[35][36][37]
Yates directed the television adaptation of nine-year-oldDaisy Ashford's novelThe Young Visiters, starringJim BroadbentalongsideHugh Laurie. According to a review byVarietymagazine forBBC America, Yates and his team yielded "a warm and surprisingly unsentimental production that has 'evergreen' written all over it".[38]
In 2004, Yates's two-part dramaSex Trafficwas broadcast onChannel 4. It won eight BAFTA Awards includingBest EditingforMark Day, who regularly worked with Yates on many of his television projects and short films. Day commented on his collaboration with Yates saying that "we are very good friends because we have spent so much time together". He also said, "David shoots in a similar style from piece to piece, although this wasn’t quite as frantic asState of Play."[39]Yates was nominated for another Directors Guild of Great Britain Award for his direction ofSex Trafficand won his second BAFTA for Best Drama Serial at the British Academy Television Awards.[40]Being a British-Canadian production,Sex Trafficgained four wins at Canada's annual television award ceremony, theGemini Awards, including Best Dramatic Miniseries. Spanning across two parts, the three-hour-long drama reveals how thetrafficking of young womeninto slavery is a big business which operates throughout Europe; both parts were acclaimed for their "shocking" portrayal of such a sensitive topic.[41][42][43]
Also in 2004, Yates was involved in plans for a film adaptation ofEvelyn Waugh's novelBrideshead RevisitedforWarner Independent Pictures. He was set to work withPaul Bettany,Jude LawandJennifer Connellyon the project, but pulled out in the later stages due to constant budget issues affecting the film's production.[44][45]
Yates then directedRichard Curtis' script toThe Girl in the Café, a television film starringBill NighyandKelly Macdonald. In June 2005, the film was aired on the BBC in Britain and was also broadcast in the United States onHome Box Office.The Girl in the Caféachieved three wins at theEmmy Awards, including thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Made for Television Movie, and gained a total of four nominations includingOutstanding Directingfor Yates.[13][46][47]
During the period of working on plans forBrideshead Revisited, Yates was told by his agent that he had made the director shortlist for the fifth film in theHarry Potterseriesand that Warner Bros. was eyeing him to direct. Shortly after, he was confirmed to directHarry Potter and the Order of the PhoenixbyWarner Bros. Pictures, with production scheduled to begin in early 2006.[45][48]When asked how Yates got the job, producerDavid Heyman("a big fan" of Yates's television work)[49]said that "actors in David's television projects give their best performance, often of their career. It's important to keep pushing the actors, particularly the young ones on eachPotterfilm. This is a political film, not with a capital P, but it's about teen rebellion and the abuse of power. David has made films in the U.K. about politics without being heavy handed."[50]
Before production began, Yates invitedHarry Potter and the Goblet of FiredirectorMike Newellto a pub and "picked his brains about what it was going to be like to step into someone's shoes on a movie of this scale".[3]The first scene that Yates shot featured agiantinteracting with human characters. The scene was the very first high-scalevisual effectspiece Yates filmed in his career.[3][51]After the film's post-production material was well received by the studio, Yates was chosen to direct the sixth film,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which according to Yates was going to be "a cross between the chills ofPrisoner of Azkaban[the third film in the series] and the fantastical adventure ofGoblet of Fire".[6][44]
In 2007,Order of the Phoenixopened to positive reviews and commercial success. Yates won the title ofBest Directorat theEmpire Awardsand collected thePeople's Choice Awardfrom theEuropean Film Academy.[52]However, the film was criticised by fans of the series for having the shortest running time out of the five released instalments; Yates said that the original director's cut was "probably over three hours", resulting in much footage being cut, condensed and edited to fit within the studio's preferred time frame.[53][54]
During production ofHalf-Blood Prince, Warner Bros. executiveAlan F. Hornannounced that the seventh and final novel in the series,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was to be split into two cinematic parts with Yates, once again, as the director.[55]Yates spoke of the decision to appoint him as the director of the final films, remarking that "they wanted to do aHarry Potterthat felt ... more grown up. What's smart about the studio and the producers is they have always wanted to push it a bit.Chris Columbusdid a wonderful job of casting and making this world incredibly popular. But rather than do more of the same, they said, 'Let's bring inAlfonso Cuarónand let him run with it. Then later, let's bring in David Yates, who's done all this hard-hitting stuff on TV.' It's a testament to their ambition to try to keep the franchise fresh. The bizarre thing is, I did one [film] and they asked me to stay for three more, so obviously they liked something."[3]
Half-Blood Princewas released in 2009 and became the only film in the series to earn anAcademy Awardnomination forBest Cinematography.[56][57]Yates worked alongside French cinematographerBruno Delbonnelon, what Yates called, extensively colour grading the "incredibly rich" picture by making it look "very European" and drawing influences from the Dutch painterRembrandt.[58][59][60]The film garnered a mix of accolades and was acclaimed for its stylised character-driven approach, but some fans complained about the script's deviation from the novel and the film's slightromantic comedynature.[61]In response to this criticism, BAFTA member and film criticMark Kermodepraised Yates's direction and ranked the film "second best" in the series, behindPrisoner of Azkaban.[62]
Yatesbegan to filmDeathly Hallows – Part 1andDeathly Hallows – Part 2back-to-back in early 2009 and finished reshoots in late 2010.[63]He stated that he had shot the two parts of the final adaptation differently, with Part 1 being a "road movie" and "quite real", "almost like avéritédocumentary", while Part 2 is "more operatic, colourful andfantasy-oriented", a "big opera with huge battles."[64][65][66]Yates reshot the final scene of theHarry Potterseries atLeavesden Studiosafter the original version, filmed atLondon King's Cross railway station, did not meet his expectations. In the film, the scene takes place at the magicalPlatform 9¾.[67]
Part 1 was released worldwide in November 2010 to commercial success along with generally positive reviews, some of which reflected on Yates's directing style.The Dallas Morning Newsaffirmed that "David Yates' fluid, fast-paced direction sends up the crackling tension of a thriller" andThe New York Timesanalysed Yates's approach to J. K. Rowling's character development by saying that he has "demonstrated a thorough, uncondescending sympathy for her characters, in particular the central trio ofRon Weasley,Hermione GrangerandHarry Potterhimself."[68][69]The film was praised for its "dark" atmosphere and its loyalty to the source material, but it was criticised for its slow middle act, the handling of exposition, and the somewhat disjointed pacing.[70][71]
Part 2 was screened in July 2011 and became an instant record-breaking success with critical acclaim.[72][73]The Daily Telegraphdescribed Part 2 as "monumental cinema awash with gorgeous tones" andTotal Filmwrote that Yates combines "spectacle and emotion into a thrilling final chapter."[74][75]Author J. K. Rowling remarked that "everyone who watchesDeathly Hallows – Part 2is going to see that he's steered us home magnificently. It's incredible."[76][77]Part 2 is one of twoHarry Potterfilms to pass the $1 billion mark during its original theatrical run; it became thehighest-grossingfilm in the series and the highest-grossing film of 2011, making Yates the director of the highest-grossing non-James Cameronfilm of all time in August 2011.[78][79]Amongst other accolades, Yates won his second Empire Award for Best Director and joined the principal creative team ofHarry Potterin receiving the 2012ADG Award for Outstanding Contribution to Cinematic Imageryfor their work onDeathly Hallows – Part 2and the series in general.[80]
Yates attended the64th British Academy Film Awardsin February 2011, where he was joined by J. K. Rowling, David Heyman, Mike Newell, Alfonso Cuarón,David Barron,Rupert Grint, andEmma Watsonin collecting theMichael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinemaon behalf of theHarry Potterfilms.Daniel Radcliffe, who portrayed the films' titular character, commented on working with Yates, saying that he "added his own sense of grit and realism [to the series] that perhaps wasn't there so much before. I think we all had a fantastic time working with David. I know we did."[1][81]
By 2012, Yates was working on a fewWarner Bros.projects, including aTarzanfeature film and anAl Caponebiopic calledCicero.[82][83]He also controversially said that he was working withBBC Worldwideon plans to develop aDoctor Whofilm,[84]although this was denied by the showrunner,Steven Moffat, in July 2012.[85]Because of production delays, Yates began to explore other projects including television work.[86]
In 2013, he returned to television by signing on to direct thetelevision pilotofTyrant, an American drama production set against the US–Middle East conflict.[87]The following year, Yates began shootingThe Legend of Tarzan, starringAlexander Skarsgård,Samuel L.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
