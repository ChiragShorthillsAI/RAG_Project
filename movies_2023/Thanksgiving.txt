A sequel is currently in development which is scheduled for a November 2025 release.
OnThanksgivinginPlymouth, Massachusetts, a mob gathers outside local superstore RightMart in preparation for aBlack Fridaysale. Jessica Wright, whose father Thomas owns the store, lets her boyfriend Bobby and friends Gaby, Evan, Scuba, and Yulia inside early. The crowd notices them and stampedes into the store in a frenzy. In the ensuing chaos, Amanda Collins (wife of RightMart's manager Mitch), a security guard, and a customer are killed and Bobby gets his arm shattered. Bobby later moves away from Plymouth.
The following year, RightMart begins preparations for another Black Friday sale. When Bobby returns to Plymouth, a waitress named Lizzie is killed by a figure wearing aJohn Carvermask. Lizzie's involvement in the RightMart incident leads police to believe those involved are being targeted.
The assailant, now fittingly called "John Carver", tags Jessica and her friends in grisly social media posts. Jessica lends camera footage from the RightMart incident to the town's sheriff, Eric Newlon. Carver kills several more residents involved in the riot, including students Lonnie and Amy, and security guard Manny. Evan and Gaby are soon abducted while Yulia is attacked in her home. Jessica and Scuba make it there but are unable to stop Carver from disemboweling Yulia with a saw. The police attempt to lure Carver out by having the Wright family participate in the Thanksgiving parade. Carver in a different disguise decapitates a mascot and sets off smoke bombs, causing chaos in which he is able to abduct Jessica, her stepmother Kathleen, Thomas, and Scuba.
Kathleen is prepared and cooked alive at Carver's hideout. Her corpse is served as a "turkey" at a table where the hostages and victims' corpses are seated. Carver then bludgeons Evan to death in alivestreamin front of the others. Jessica and Scuba escape from the table and Carver chases Jessica through the woods. She then comes upon Eric lying on the pavement and follows signs of movement into a building where parade float materials are being stored. She sees Bobby in the Carver costume but Eric joins her and tells her to go outside. Gunshots are heard but Bobby is not found.
The police inform Jessica that her friends and father are safe. In the sheriff's office, Jessica notices the same debris from the woods that stuck to her clothing is also stuck to the hem of Eric's pants, revealing that he is the killer. Jessica asks Eric why he engaged in his killing spree, and he reveals his motive for the murders: After Eric's wife left him, he met Amanda Collins and had an affair with her. Amanda became pregnant with his child, and she planned to divorce Mitch to be with him. Amanda was pregnant when she was killed during the RightMart incident. Eric then began targeting those he held responsible for the riot, as their negligence and violence caused Amanda's death. Eric had abducted Bobby and placed him in the Carver costume to frame him.
Jessica then reveals to a horrified Eric that she has live-streamed his confession, exposing him as the killer. Eric attacks her, but Bobby intervenes. An enraged Eric attacks again, intent on killing Jessica for ruining his plans and his life. Jessica loads a blunderbuss using her mother's bracelet and shoots down a balloon attached to a tank of gas, causing an explosion that engulfs the sheriff.
Jessica reunites with Gaby and Scuba while Bobby is taken to the hospital. Authorities are unable to find Eric's body and believe he was incinerated in the blast. Reunited with her boyfriend Ryan, Jessica has a nightmare in which she is attacked by a flaming Eric.
Additionally, Jordan Poole plays Jacob, Mika Amonsen plays Lonnie, Shailyn Griffin plays Amy,Amanda Barkerplays Lizzie,Chris Sandifordplays Doug, andLynne Griffinplays Grandma.Adam MacDonaldprovides the voice of John Carver.

TriStar Pictures, Inc.(spelled asTri-Staruntil 1991) is an Americanfilm studioandproduction companythat is a member of theSony Pictures Motion Picture Group,[1]part of the multinational conglomerateSony Group Corporation. It is a corporate sibling of fellow Sony studio,Columbia Pictures.
TriStar Pictures was established on March 2, 1982, founded by Victor Kaufman as Nova Pictures, changed a year later to Tri-Star to avoid confusion with thePBSseriesNova.[3]Its most notable releases includeTerminator 2: Judgment Day,Basic Instinct,Rambo: First Blood Part IIand Hollywood’s first everGodzilla.
Originally a joint venture between Columbia Pictures,CBS, andHBO, whose individual video units handled video, broadcast, and pay cable rights to its products,[4]the company scored a number of box-office hits with modestly budgeted fare in the 1980s, as well as fortuitous distribution deals with theProducers Sales Organization,[5]Carolco Pictures[6]and theTaft Entertainment Group.[7]It also expanded ambitiously throughout the decade with the acquisition ofLoews Theatresand the formation ofits own television arm. Among the various hits TriStar scored on its own during the decade wereAbout Last Night,The Muppets Take Manhattan,Real Genius,Nothing in Common,Peggy Sue Got Married,The Principal,Look Who's TalkingandSteel Magnolias.
On November 15, 1985, CBS dropped out of the joint venture, selling its stake to Columbia Pictures.[8]HBO sold its shares to the same studio in 1986 in order to formHBO Pictures.[9]On December 21, 1987, Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. followingThe Coca-Cola Company's merger of Tri-Star and Columbia to become "Columbia/Tri-Star", of which it owned 80% of its stock.[10]In January 1988, CPE's stocks somewhat fell, and Coca-Cola decreased its shares in CPE to 49%. On April 13, 1988, the name of the company reverted to Tri-Star Pictures, Inc.[11]On November 8, 1989, theSony Corporation of Japanacquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment for $3.4 billion. On August 7, 1991, under Sony Pictures Entertainment, the hyphen was officially removed from the name of the studio. TriStar became the first new Americanmajor film studiosinceRKO Pictures, which was founded in 1928.
During the 1990s, TriStar operated autonomously from Columbia. Although its products were mostly indistinguishable from that of its sister studio, it soon scored a string of hits at the box office with such films asSleepless in Seattle,Philadelphia,The Mirror Has Two Faces,Jerry Maguire,As Good as It Gets,BugsyandJumanji, and it also scored a major video hit withDanny DeVito'sMatilda.[12]However, in 1998, the company fell on hard times following the box-office disappointment of its remake of theJapanesemonster filmGodzilla, and Sony quickly responded by merging the studio with Columbia to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Pictures Group.[13]The TriStar name was subsequently used by Sony on a very limited basis until 2004, when the company decided to turn the studio into a genre label that specialized in acquisitions.[14]In 2015, Sony formedTriStar Productionsas a vehicle for film and television productions.[15]TriStar Pictures is currently being used as a vehicle for distribution of products from that new entity and other items from Sony Pictures, including titles fromSony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions.[16]
TriStar Pictures is a member of theMotion Picture Association(MPA).[17]
The concept for Tri-Star Pictures can be traced to Victor Kaufman, a senior executive ofColumbia Pictures(then a subsidiary ofthe Coca-Cola Company),[18]who convinced Columbia,HBO, andCBSto share resources and split the ever-growing costs of making movies, leading to the creation of a new joint venture on March 2, 1982. On May 16, 1983, it was given the name Tri-Star Pictures (when the new company was formed and did not have an official name, the press used the code-name "Nova", but the name could not be obtained as it was being used as the title for thePBSscience series).[3][19]Tri-Star embarked on a 12 to 18 feature film slate per year, with a combined budget of $70 to $80 million and signed producer Walter Colbenz as vice president of the Tri-Star feature film studio, and signed initial development deals with directorJohn Schlesingerand producers Jeffrey Walker and Michael Walker.[20]Tri-Star's first project to roll out wasThe Muppets Take Manhattan.[21]
On May 11, 1984, Tri-Star's first produced film was released,The NaturalstarringRobert Redford. Tri-Star's first release, however, was the film,Where the Boys Are '84; a 1984remakeof the 1960Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) picture,Where the Boys Arethat was co-distributed on behalf ofITC EntertainmentafterUniversalrejected it; the film was a commercial flop.[22]
Many of Tri-Star's productions were released on VHS byRCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video,HBO/Cannon Video, orCBS/Fox Video. In addition, HBO owned exclusive cable distribution rights to the films, with broadcast television licenses going to CBS.[4]
On May 8, 1984, Tri-Star Pictures secured North American distribution rights for the filmSupergirlfromWarner Bros., which enabled the film to be ready for distribution by Christmas 1984.[23]On May 15, 1984, the studio hit big through its association withCarolco Pictures, with the release ofRambo: First Blood Part II, which eventually became a smash hit for the studio the following year.[6][24]The company also partnered withProducers Sales Organizationto handle theatrical distribution of the PSO titles,[5]while both Tri-Star and Columbia struck a deal for film financing with Delphi Film Associates.[25]
CBS dropped out of the Tri-Star venture in November 1985.[8]HBO also dropped out of the venture and sold half of its shares to Columbia Pictures following a month.[9][26]Despite the changes in majority ownership, Tri-Star continued ambition-laden expansion plans. Chief among these plans was an expansion of their successful relationship with Carolco; a new extension of their pre-existing deal included Tri-Star gaining theatrical distribution rights to various Carolco projects, includingRambo IIIandAir America;Carolco retained all foreign, cable, television and videocassette rights.[27]Taft/Barish Productions, a joint venture ofTaft BroadcastingandKeith Barish Productions, signed a $200 million domestic distribution deal with Tri-Star (much like Carolco, Taft/Barish retained non-theatrical and ancillary distribution rights). Of the four films to emerge from this pact, onlyThe Running Manwould become a major success.[7]
Another avenue of expansion was acquiring the storiedLoews Theaterschain of cineplexes in October 1986 for $300 million, after a deal to purchaseUnited Artists TheatersfromTele-Communications, Inc.did not come to fruition. At the time, Loews had 260 theaters in six states.[28][29][30]
1987 was another ambitious year for Tri-Star; plans were in place to take Tri-Star from a relatively new, untested film company into a major film studio. Components of these plans included the formation ofTriStar Television, and joining forces withStephen J. CannellProductions andWitt/Thomas/HarrisProductions to create a television distribution company known as TeleVentures; they also proposed forming their own home video label, Tri-Star Video, taking over from the trio of distributors (RCA/Columbia, CBS/Fox and HBO/Cannon).[31][32]A full-on international distribution arm was also in the planning stages.[33]Another distribution deal was signed by Tri-Star andHemdale Film Corporationin September 1987, but only one film,High Tide, would result from that deal.[34]
However, Tri-Star's ambitions were curtailed by yet more change in ownership.The Coca-Cola Companyboosted its stake in Tri-Star to 29.3% that September.[35]That December, following several high-profile flops (includingIshtar), Coca-Cola began a plan to get out of the media industry; Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc., and Coca-Cola sold its entertainment business to Tri-Star for $3.1 billion. Coca-Cola would then gradually reduce their holdings in the new company to 49%. Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names; a new Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. entity was created in April 1988.[10][11]
As a result, Tri-Star's television division was consolidated into a single operating entity withColumbia/EmbassyTelevision and Coca-Cola Television to form a new incarnation ofColumbia Pictures Television.Merv Griffin Enterpriseswould continue to operate separately.[36][37]Similarly, Tri-Star's nascent video division was absorbed into RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video.[38]
In 1989, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. was acquired by Japanese conglomerateSony Corporation, which merged Columbia and Tri-Star, but continued to use the separate labels. On July 11, 1990, Tri-Star Pictures dissolved and sold its venture in TeleVentures to Stephen J. Cannell Productions and TeleVentures became Cannell Distribution Co. Most of the series and the Tri-Star film packages that were distributed by TeleVentures were transferred to Columbia Pictures Television Distribution.[39]Sony Pictures Entertainment later revived TriStar Television as a television production banner in 1991 (by way of acquiring rights to shows fromNew World Television) and merged with its sister television studioColumbia Pictures Television(CPT) to formColumbia TriStar Television(CTT) on February 21, 1994.[40][41]Both studios continued to operate separately under the CTT umbrella until TriStar Television folded in 1999 and CPT folded in 2001.
In addition to its own slate, TriStar Pictures was the theatrical distributor for many films produced byCarolco Pictures(the rights to only one of its films,Cliffhanger, has been retained by TriStar). TriStar Pictures also theatrically distributed someFilmDistrictfilms. In 1992, TriStar Pictures, along withJapan Satellite Broadcastingsigned an agreement withThe IndieProd Companyto distribute movies produced by IndieProd in order to fill the void left by Carolco, whose deal with TriStar Pictures was on the verge of expiring amid financial troubles.[42]
Around summer 1998, SPE merged Columbia and TriStar to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group, but just like Columbia Pictures Entertainment, both divisions continued producing and distributing films under their own names. Some of the movies slated to be released by TriStar Pictures, includingStepmomwould go to Sony's flagship labelColumbia Picturesfollowing the merger.[13]
TriStar was relaunched on May 13, 2004, as a marketing and acquisitions unit that had a "particular emphasis on genre films".[14]Screen Gems' executive vice president Valerie Van Galder was tapped to run the revived studio after being dormant.[43]However, the release of its 2013 filmElysiumrepresented the label's first big-budget release sinceThe Mask of Zorroin 1998.
The same year, former20th Century Foxco-chairmanTom Rothmanjoined Sony Pictures and createdTriStar Productionsas a joint venture with existing Sony Pictures executives. The new TriStar would develop, finance and produce up to four films per year, as well as television programming and acquisitions, starting on September 1.[15][44][45]Sony's TriStarPicturesunit is currently being retained for "other product, including titles fromSony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions", and is distributing product from TriStar Productions.[16]
TriStar's logo features the winged horsePegasus(either stationary or flying across the screen). The idea came from executive Victor Kaufman and his family's interest in riding horses. The original logo was created with the assistance ofSydney Pollack, who was an adviser at Tri-Star. The horse in the original filmed logo was the same one used in Pollack's filmThe Electric Horseman.[46]

In December 2003, Spyglass ended its deal with Disney and agreed to a four-year first-look non-exclusive co-financing and production deal withDreamWorks. This deal was never finalized and the relationship was not working well. Thus on September 23, 2003, Spyglass instead made a similar deal withSony Pictures. Spyglass did not move to the Sony lot, but to Murdoch Plaza inWestwood, Los Angeles.[7]
By March 25, 2010, Spyglass was acquired byCerberus Capital Management.[13]

Spyglass's first greenlit film since its revival is a revival of theHellraiserfranchise announced on May 6, 2019.[20]With the company winning the rights toStephen King'sThe Institutebook in November 2019,Jack Benderand David E. Kelley were paired to development and produce the book as a mini-series. Also, Bender was signed by Spyglass to a television first-look deal.[21]
MGM President of Physical Production Peter Oillataguerre was appointed President of Production for Spyglass Media Group reporting to Barber. He left in September 2023 forAmazon MGM Studios.[22]

Roth began shooting films at the age of eight, after watchingRidley Scott'sAlien(1979).[8]He and his brothers, Adam and Gabriel,[9]made more than 100 short films before he graduated fromNewton South High Schooland attended film school (theTisch School of the Arts) atNew York University. To fund his films while in college, Roth claims to have worked as an onlinecybersexoperator forPenthouse Magazine, posing as a woman, as well as a production assistant on feature films.[10]Roth also ran the office of producerFrederick Zollo,[9]leaving after graduation to devote himself to writing full-time.

ActressCamryn Manheimgave Roth one of his first Hollywood jobs, as an extra onThe Practice, when he moved to Los Angeles. Roth would stay in Manheim's dressing room, working on his scripts, while she filmed the show. The two had become friends in New York, while Roth was working for Zollo.

A portion of Roth's work forThe Rotten Fruitwas done at the Snake Pit studios inBurbankwith miniature sets, posable clay, foam figures, two high-end digital still cameras, and a pair ofMacintoshcomputers. Noah Belson co-wroteThe Rotten Fruitalong with Roth.[21]Roth had co-writtenCabin Feverwith his college roommate Randy Pearlstein.

It opened No. 1 at the box office in January 2006, taking in $20 million its first weekend.[31][32]The film went on to gross $80 million worldwide in box office, and more than $180 million on DVD. Although the story is set inSlovakia, all the exteriors were shot in theCzech Republic. In the film, three friends are lured to visit a hostel where they think their sexual fantasies will come true. Instead, they fall into the clutches of an international syndicate that provides first-hand torture and killing experiences for rich, sadistic tourists. The film was rated No. 1 onBravo TV's30 Even Scarier Movie Moments,[33]andEmpire Magazinereaders votedHostelthe Best Horror Film of 2007.[34]
Roth reportedly turned down studio directing jobs to makeHostel. He took a directing salary of only $10,000 to keep the budget as low as possible, so there would be no limits set on its violence. In January 2006, film criticDavid EdelsteininNew Yorkmagazine credited Roth with creating the horror subgenre "torture porn", or "gorno", using excessive violence to excite audiences like a sexual act.[35]
In 2007, Roth directed and narrated the faux trailer segmentThanksgivingforGrindhouseand appeared inDeath Proof, Tarantino's segment of the film. Roth and co-writer Jeff Rendell won a 2007Spike TVScream Awardfor best "screamplay" for their work inGrindhouse,sharing the honor with Tarantino,Robert Rodriguez,Rob Zombie, andEdgar Wright.[36]In January 2023, it was announced Roth is developing a feature-length film version ofThanksgiving.[37]
Hostel: Part IIopened in sixth place in June 2007, with $8.2 million; it went on to gross $17.6 million in US theaters. The film, which cost $10.2 million, earned $35 million in theaters worldwide and $50 million on DVD and pay television.[38]Lionsgate attributed the lower grosses to the summer release, opposite blockbusters such asShrek the Third,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, andOcean's Thirteen, as well as the film's workprint having been leaked online before its release.[39]Close to two million illegal workprint downloads were tracked the dayHostel 2opened.[40]
I don't know if it was the most downloaded film of all time, but there are tracking services that track what movies are being downloaded. And a copy ofHostel 2leaked out before its release and they had it, it was like millions and millions of hits. Not only was it downloaded, but in the countries it was downloaded – like Mexico and Brazil – there were copies on the street for practically a penny. You could buyHostel 2for a quarter in Mexico City. As a result, in a lot of countries where the piracy was bad, they just didn't even release it.[41]
Hostel: Part IIwas nominated for six Spike TV Scream Awards, including best horror film and best director. It was onEntertainment Weekly's list of the 20 best horror films of the past 20 years.[42]In March 2006,Dimension Filmsbought the rights toCellbyStephen Kingand would produce a film to be directed by Roth.[43]In 2009, King finished the screenplay, and actorsJohn CusackandSamuel L.

According to Roth, Tarantino is involved as well. In an interview withCHUD, Roth said, "This movie will have everything martial-arts fans could want, combined with RZA's superb musical talent. This project has been his dream for years, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it. Fans should know that, yes, there will be blood ... This ain't no PG-13.[47][48]
Through his company, Arcade, with Eric Newman and Strike producer Marc Abraham,[49]Roth produced the horror filmThe Last Exorcism, (originally titledCotton) which was directed byDaniel Stamm.[50]Completed in December 2009 and retitled in February 2010,The Last Exorcism[51]cost $1.5 million to produce. It opened at more than $20 million in U.S. sales, and earned No. #1 opening spots in Canada and the UK. The film had paid for itself when rights in a few foreign territories were sold before shooting began. It earned over $40 million box office in the United States, and $70 million worldwide.[52]
In 2014, Roth produced the American supernatural horror filmClownand had the minor role of "Frowny the Clown."[53]He next helmedKnock Knock(2015), a remake of the 1974-shot horror filmDeath Game, about two women who seduce a married man and then do unspeakable things to him.Keanu Reevesstarred and executive produced.[54]
I can't say anything without giving anything away! ... I sawTransformersandCloverfieldand thought, 'I have an idea for a mass destruction movie.' But it's going to be very different from those films. And it's science fiction, but a little more grounded than that.[55]
In a 2013 interview withThe Guardian, Roth indicated that he had suspended work onEndangered Speciesto focus on 2013'sThe Green Inferno.[56]Roth directed the cannibal horror filmThe Green Inferno(2013), which was inspired by his love ofMondo horror filmssuch as the infamousCannibal Holocaust.[57]The Green Infernowas criticized for its portrayal of indigenous people as cannibals, and it was described as a "new low in racist film making" byPeople's World.[58]In 2015, Roth was announced as the director of the adaptation of the best-selling shark novelMeg: A Novel of Deep Terror, eventually calledThe Meg.

Roth's 2018 remake of the filmDeath Wishopened to $13 million at the box office. The film is centered around a trauma surgeon who turns to vigilantism after his family is attacked. The film was panned by critics as "pro-gun propaganda" and ill-timed in the wake of theStoneman Douglas High School shooting.[70]Roth defended the film, stating that the film was not pro-gun and that he wanted the film to focus on family, protecting one's family, and seeking justice for one's family.[71]Also in 2018, he directed the fantasy comedy filmThe House with a Clock in Its Walls, his first PG-rated film and his highest domestic grosser to date.[72]

The three filmmakers—Lamb, Chris Strompolis, and Eric Zala (a formerActivisionemployee)—had not spoken to each other in years when Roth contacted them.[77][79]Roth, feeling that their film was so powerful he had to do whatever he could to make sure fans saw it, introduced it at its premiere atGrauman's Chinese Theatrein May 2008, five and a half years after he first gave the tape to Knowles.[80]Soon, the three reunited friends were touring the world, doing charity screenings.[81][82]
Roth has talked of doingTrailer Trash, another compilation of fake trailers. "Trailer Trashis not a horror film," he said; "it's a comedy. It will be very R-rated and completely insane, and I'm producing it withMike Fleiss".[83]Roth recorded anaudio commentaryforTroma's 1997 DVD release ofBlood Sucking Freaksfour years before directing his first film, billed as a "Blood and Guts Expert".[84]Roth is a frequent contributor to DVD "extras" content (liner notes, video commentary) for horror film distributorsGrindhouse Releasing/Box Office Spectaculars, particularly for two of his favorite filmsJuan Piquer Simón'sPiecesand the North American DVD release ofLucio Fulci'sCat in the Brain.[85][86][87]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
