The Blackeningis a 2022 Americanblack horrorcomedydirected byTim Storyand written byTracy OliverandDewayne Perkins, based on the 2018 short film of the same name by thecomedy troupe3Peat. It stars Dewayne Perkins,Grace Byers,Jermaine Fowler,Melvin Gregg,X Mayo,Antoinette Robertson,Sinqua Walls,Jay Pharoah, andYvonne Orji. The film, set onJuneteenth, follows a group of black friends targeted by a masked killer while staying at a cabin in the woods.
The Blackeningpremiered at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 16, 2022, and was theatrically released on June 16, 2023, byLionsgatein United States and on August 23, 2023 byUniversal PicturesinUnited Kingdom. The film grossed $18 million and received generally positive reviews, with critics noting the satire ofhorror film tropesandethnic stereotypes.
Morgan and Shawn arrive to a cabin in the woods where they plan on celebratingJuneteenthwith their group of friends. In the game room, the couple discovers a board game called "The Blackening", which features a racistLittle Black Sambocaricature.
Suddenly, the lights go out and a mysterious voice demands that the couple play. Shawn answers a question incorrectly and is promptly killed with an arrow to the neck. Morgan attempts to escape but is captured.
The next day, Lisa, Allison, and Dewayne make their way to the cabin and discuss King bringing Lisa's unfaithful ex-boyfriend Nnamdi for the weekend's festivities. On her way to the cabin, Shanika runs into a former schoolmate named Clifton at the gas station, who reveals he is also joining the group.
Before leaving, Shanika is unnerved by the facially disfigured clerk who stands by her menacingly. Once the group is all together, they find Ranger White not allowing them entry. After settling the dispute, the friends begin to set up for a night of partying.
After drinks, drugs, and games ensue, the group questions who specifically invited Clifton. After the lights go out again, the friends go to find a power box, only to come across The Blackening with game pieces correlating to their personalities. The voice speaks to them, revealing that he is keeping Morgan prisoner.
The voice forces the friends to play the game to save Morgan, and begins by asking trivia questions aboutAfrican-American culture. Unfortunately, the friends fail to sufficiently answer a question about all the black actors that guest-starred onFriendsand Morgan is attacked.
They are ordered to sacrifice one of their own based on whom they deem to be "the blackest"; the most black person will be sacrificed. Each of them comes up with their own defense of why it cannot be them, and after Clifton admits he voted forDonald Trumpin both elections everyone chooses him out of spite.
Clifton goes outside and is shot in the chest with an arrow by the killer. When the friends are freed from the room, they attempt to go look for Morgan and find help. Despite knowing better, they agree with Allison's idea to split up.
She goes off with King and Shanika, while Dewayne has to go with Lisa and Nnamdi. The latter three end up running into Ranger White, who is willing to help them until the killer shoots him in the neck with an arrow.
Allison, King, and Shanika encounter the killer, and the trio manage to overpower and kill him. They unmask him to find that it's the clerk that Shanika saw at the gas station. Lisa, Nnamdi, and Dewayne then encounter a second killer before Lisa bashes his brains in. They look through his pockets to see that he is the first killer's twin brother, and they deduce someone hired them to be there.
The friends go into another room, where they find Ranger White's and Clifton's bodies, only for the latter to spring awake and reveal himself as the mastermind. He blames the group for always doubting his level of "blackness" when they knew each other at college, with this doubt leading to an incident where he drank heavily and ended up killing a woman when driving on the road.
After serving four years in prison for the DUI, he organized the entire night as revenge and prepares to kill the others before dropping them down a well where he dumped Shawn's and Morgan's corpses. The friends fight back before kicking him down the well to his apparent death. Clifton's laugh can be heard as they leave.
As the morning arrives, the friends are skeptical of calling the police for help. On the advice of Dewayne, they call the fire department instead, only for them to be sprayed with a hose.
The film was announced in January 2020, withTracy OliverandDewayne Perkinswriting the script, based on Perkins' 2018 short.[5]Tim Storywas later hired to direct, and filming took place inBrentwood, California in late 2021.[6]Much of the film's dialogue was improvised by the cast.[7]

Fischerrejected Ariel and Bobo's bid, saying, "Plaintiffs present little to no detail regarding either the game or the screenplay, and there is no reason to believe that the expression of ideas in either has been copied in the making of the film."[12]
The Blackeningwas released ondigital downloadon July 7, 2023, and was released onUltra HD Blu-ray,Blu-rayandDVDon August 22, 2023.[13]
In the United States and Canada,The Blackeningwas released alongsideElementalandThe Flash, and was projected to gross $7–8 million from 1,775 theaters in its opening weekend.[14][2]The film made $2.5 million on its first day, including $900,000 from Thursday night previews.[15][16]The film went to debut on $6 million in its opening weekend (an average of $3,380), finishing sixth at the box office.[17]The film made $3 million in its second weekend, finishing seventh.[18]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 87% of 146 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7/10. The website's consensus reads: "While it could stand to be a little funnier and quite a bit scarier,The Blackeningis a thoughtful satire that skewers horror tropes and racial stereotypes."[19]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 67 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[20]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakreported 81% of filmgoers gave it a positive score, with 64% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[16]
Joe Lipsett ofBloody Disgustingrated the film four out of five, writing that "[w]hile the kills inThe Blackeningare decent and the killer's choice of weapon (a crossbow) is novel, it's the comedy and camaraderie between the friends that make the film stand out. Not only do these characters fight and support each other as real friends do, but Perkins and Oliver's script is also filled to the brim with smart, savvy jokes. The film is legitimately hilarious, tackling everything from obvious stereotypes to ingrained cultural prejudice within the group."[21]
ForIndieWire, Rafael Motamayor gave the film a grade of "B", calling it "the first great horror parody of the post-Get Outera" and writing that "every slasher movie needs a good villain and here the killer wears a blackface leather mask. It's on the nose, but this parody has about as much subtext asScary Movieand that's part of the fun. There is no toning down Blackness or explaining things toWhiteaudiences. If you don't know how to playSpadesor what theBlack anthemis, ask a friend."[22]
In November 2023,Varietyreported that MRC and Lionsgate were in talks with writers Dewayne Perkins, Tracy Oliver and producer E. Brian Dobbins to return for a sequel.[23]Perkins had previously expressed to the magazine that he envisioned a franchise akin to a "Scary Movie-esque series versus theKnives Outstyle with a new cast for each mystery".[24]

Timothy Kevin Storyis anAmericanfilm director.[2][3]He is best known forBarbershop(2002),Fantastic Four(2005), and theRide Alongfranchise. He has been nominated for twoNAACP Image Awardsfor Outstanding Directing in a Feature Film/Television Movie in2006and 2013.
He is the founder of The Story Company, a production company co-founded with his future wife Vicky in 1996. He is the first African-American film director to have grossed over US$1 billion at the box office.[4]
Story was born in Los Angeles on March 13, 1970. From a young age, he made home movies with an 8mm movie camera when his brother became bored using it.[5]Story attended LA'sWestchester High School, withjazzpianistEric Reedand actressesRegina KingandNia Long. He was senior class president at Westchester High. He graduated from theUSC School of Cinematic Artsin 1991.[1]
While in high school, Story briefly attempted a career in music. He was part ofIce-T's Rhyme Syndicate and even appeared as a member of the group T.D.F. on the song "T.D.F. Connection" from the 1988 compilation albumRhyme Syndicate Comin' Through.[6]A group member was shot and killed prior to them being signed toWarner Bros. Records.[7]Story later turned his attention to directing feature films.[8]
Story made his feature debut withOne of Us Tripped(1997), where he followed the model detailed byKevin Smithin how he had madeClerks(1994) on a modest budget; the resulting movie, made for $30,000 on 16 mm with a crew of one, the movie made its money back mostly on a distribution deal. His second movieThe Firing Squad(1999) went from a budget of $60,000 to $200,000 and sent him into debt that he had to solve by doing music videos. The experience filming the videos would serve him well withBarbershop, with the resulting success making him a mainstream director, which continued withTaxi(2004). The early cut of the film, impressed 20th Century Fox enough to offer him the chance to directFantastic Four; he was also a fan of the comics.[9][10][11]At the time, the film would be the highest-grossing superhero movie by anAfrican-Americandirector. He reflected on the experience making them as one with multiple lessons: "With those types of big movies, you’re directing three movies. There’s the movie you’re shooting, there’s the second-unit action stuff, and there’s the visual effects movie. You’ve got to learn how to deal with all of them. The other thing I learned from those two Fantastic Four movies, is that sometimes you can be too lax on how much control you give to the visual effects team, or the production design team, or whoever. If you end up in situations and you’re not happy with certain things, it’s because you didn’t stay on top of them.”[12]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
