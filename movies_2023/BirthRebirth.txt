Birth/Rebirthis a 2023 Americanpsychological horror filmdirected byLaura Mossin theirfeature directorial debut, from a screenplay by Moss and Brendan J. O'Brien and starringMarin Ireland,Judy Reyes, A.J. Lister,Breeda Wool, andLaChanze.
Inspired by the 1818 novelFrankensteinbyMary Shelley, the film follows a morgue technician (Ireland) who, after successfully reanimating the body of a young girl (Lister), works together with the girl's mother (Reyes) to keep her alive.
Birth/Rebirthpremiered at theSundance Film Festivalon January 20, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 18, 2023, to positive reviews from critics.
Dr. Rose Casper is a hospital pathologist who prefers the company of cadavers to social interaction. She finds the idea of female biological reproduction distasteful, but is obsessed with its clinical processes, gestating materials in her own body in order to discover a way to bring the dead back to life.
Celie Morales is a maternity nurse and single mother whose life revolves around her precocious five-year-old daughter, Lila. Efficient and empathetic, she is passionate about helping women give birth in an environment where they feel empowered and listened to.
The worlds of these two women collide when Lila dies suddenly and ends up on Rose's autopsy table. The circumstances of the little girl's death make her the perfect human candidate for Rose's next experiment.
When Lila's body disappears from the hospital, Celie begins to suspect that Rose is to blame. She forces her way into Rose's Co-op City apartment and discovers her daughter, reanimated in a home lab but just barely clinging to life. Rose's experiment has worked. She's brought Lila back from the dead. The treatment however, is highly experimental, and the little girl's continued recovery is anything but certain.
Both women realize they will need to draw on each other's very different expertise in order to keep Lila alive.
Laura Moss devised a story concept based on their obsession withMary Shelley'sFrankensteinin the early 2000s. Moss began a first draft of 60 pages consisting of mainly imagery and story ideas. Brendan J. O'Brien, their long-time writing partner then outlined the plot and wrote the second draft. Moss explained toFilmmaker, "That tends to be how we work: his drafts are too long, my drafts are too short. We bat scenes back and forth, and by the end of the process, we don't even remember who touched what. We're very much married by the end of it".[3]In 2018,Cinestatebecame briefly involved with the project, but the sides would spilt due to creative differences. In 2020, the script was selected to participate in theSundance InstituteScreenwriters Lab. That same year, Moss met with Emily Gotto ofShudder, who Moss has credited with having "really championed the film" and securingfinancing. Soon afterMarin Irelandwas cast as the lead, Rose, who Moss believed "catapulted the project forward".[3]The project was green lit in March 2020 but all work halted by the onset of theCOVID-19 pandemic.
The film was reported byDeadlineto be in production by September 2022, with Moss set to make their directorial feature debut.[4]Principal photographytook place in New Jersey and theCo-op Cityarea of New York City from August to late September 2022.[3][5]The cartoonRescue Birds, which appears on screen several times was created specifically for the film. The filmmakers had wanted to use the popular children's cartoonWonder Pets!instead, but no permission was granted with Moss saying, "We wanted a real TV series,Wonder Pets!and the good folks atWonder Pets!never called us back, because they wanted nothing to do with this movie..."[6]
Birth/Rebirthpremiered at the2023 Sundance Film Festivalon January 20, 2023, and was screened at theFantasia International Film Festivalon July 31, 2023.[5][7]The film was released in theaters in the United States byIFC Filmson August 18, 2023, and began streaming onShudderon November 10, 2023.[8][9]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 96% of 96 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Firmly rooted in classic horror,Birth/Rebirthuses a familiar framework to tease at fundamental fears from a chillingly relatable angle."[10]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[11]
Jessica Kiang fromVarietycalled it "a clever, provocative new take on a horror classic" and said "Ireland and Reyes breathe new life into a literary touchstone in director Laura Moss' drolly disturbing biological horror".[12]Jordan Mintzer writing forThe Hollywood Reportergave the film a positive review saying, "Not for the fainthearted, this twisted if not exactly terrifying feature takes some cues fromStuart Gordon's 1985 cult flickRe-Animator, as well as from classics likeDraculaandFrankenstein, in its grisly portrayal of two women resurrecting a little girl's dead corpse in the name of science and love".  He also compared the story's concept toDavid Cronenberg'sCrimes of the Futureand theAlienfilms but elaborated, "Moss tackles the idea from a more intimate andfeministperspective, questioning how far mothers are willing to go for their children, or simply to become mothers at all".[5]
IndieWire'sDavid Ehrlich gave the film a poor rating of a "C-". He also compared the film to Cronenberg's work but stated that Moss missed the "detail and commitment that allows those films to sink into your skin".[13]The New York Times'sJeannette Catsoulis named it a "Critic's Pick" writing, "Motherhood is both mad and monstrous inBirth/Rebirth, Laura Moss's ultrasmart, ferociously feminist take on the Frankenstein myth...as the women's behavior grows ever more shocking Moss offers no rebuke to their heedless amorality. There is only the audience to judge."[14]
On December 5, 2023, the film was nominated for threeIndependent Spirit Awards, includingBest Lead Performancefor Reyes andBest Screenplay.[15]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
