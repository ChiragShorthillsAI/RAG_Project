A Little White Lieis a 2022 Americanindependentcomedy filmwritten and directed byMichael Marenand based on the 2014 novelShriverby Chris Belden. It starsMichael Shannon,Kate Hudson,Don Johnson, andZach Braff. The film is about a handyman with the same name as a famous writer who is mistakenly invited to a literary festival and is welcomed by fans and writers, but is exposed as an impostor when the real Shriver arrives.
Production was initially set to begin in 2017 but was postponed to 2020. With a new cast, filming began in February 2020 and was one week shy of wrapping before the COVID-19 pandemic halted production until over a year later. It was released in theaters and video on demand on March 3, 2023.
A famous writer named Shriver is invited to attend a college's literary festival, but the invitation is mistakenly sent to a "down-on-his-luck" handyman with the same name. Despite this, he accepts the invitation and travels to the college, where he is welcomed by fans and other writers, and even begins a romance with an English professor. Eventually, the real Shriver arrives and exposes the handyman as an impostor.  But he turns out to be an impostor as he is chased by the police.  He is exposed as a serial impostor.  The film ends with Shriver asking the English professor if they can start over, leaving his identity as nebulous.
In April 2017, it was reported thatToni ColletteandThomas Haden Churchhad been cast in the originally titled film,Shriver, withMichael Marenwriting and directing based on Chris Belden's 2013 novel of the same name.[3]That following month,Whoopi GoldbergandGiancarlo Espositojoined the cast.[4]In 2019,Michael Shannonjoined the cast as the lead Shriver and afterwards the production was put on hold while Maren received cancer treatment.[5]Shannon got on board after Maren attended Shannon's play at theA Red Orchid Theatreand pitched the role over dinner.[6]Maren hadPhilip Seymour Hoffmanin mind to play Shriver before even writing the screenplay and before Hoffman's death.[7]Kate Hudsonsigned on to star in the film later that year.Da'Vine Joy Randolph,Jimmi Simpson,Zach Braff,Mark Boone Junior,Aja Naomi King,Adhir Kalyan, andBenjamin Kingjoined the cast in 2020, replacing Collette, Church, Goldberg, and Esposito.[8]
The film was originally scheduled to be shot inCanadain 2017, but there were issues with assembling a crew and the production was moved to West Virginia, where it encountered financial difficulties.[5]In early 2020, while Maren was prepping forprincipal photographyto begin in New Orleans, new producers were brought in who quickly changed the location to Los Angeles.[7]With a new crew andcinematographer, Maren said in an interview, "The DP that I had actually storyboarded the entire film with was suddenly not available and didn't want to do a film that we only had two weeks to prep. So there were days on the film at the beginning where we would shoot a 12-hour day and then I would go out with my [assistant director] and we would be scouting that night. The hotel where we shot, we didn't lock that location down until Saturday and we were shooting on Monday, so the production designers had one day to try to prepare those sets".[7]Filming commenced in February 2020 and was thensuspended due to COVID-19three weeks into filming and one week before completion. After being halted for 400 days, filming completed after a six-day shoot.[9][7]
A Little White Liepremiered at theNewport Beach Film Festivalon October 14, 2022.[10]Saban Filmsreleased the film on March 3, 2023 in limited theaters andParamount Picturesreleased it on digital platforms.[11][12]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 35% of 37 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5/10.[13]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 42 out of 100, based on eight critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[14]
Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film a positive review, calling it "whimsical and sharply written and beautifully performed" and praising Shannon's performance as Shriver.[15]Mick LaSallewriting for theSan Francisco Chroniclesaid the performances, characters and script was "a little better than it had to be". He called Maren's direction "tonally right, full of warmth and touches of humor; he makes it an inviting film to watch" and noted his surprise to find out the film was "interrupted more than halfway in by a 400-day pause due to the COVID pandemic."[16]Variety'sRene Rodriguez praised Shannon's performance and the film's exploration of the themes of deception and self-discovery, but criticized the pacing and the "lack of wit or sophistication."[12]
Brett Buckalew ofThe A.V. Clubgave a mixed review, writing "The execution of the simultaneous mistaken identity and fish-out-of-water shenanigans that ensue is oddly muted; you keep waiting for Maren to amp up the comic energy and narrative complications, but it isn't until the satisfyingly madcap climax that he really does."[17]Jeannette Catsoulis ofThe New York Timeswrote negatively, saying "Hobbled by a lack of visual oomph or verbal sparkle,A Little White Liepokes feebly at impostor syndrome and writerly insecurity. Maren settles for a muddled mystery and a limp love connection. Shannon and Hudson never look half as happy together as Don Johnson looks on the back of that horse."[18]

In 2012, he wrote and directed his first feature film, the award-winningA Short History of Decay. His latest feature film,A Little White Lie, was released in March 2023.
Maren grew up inAndover, Massachusetts and graduated fromNorthfield Mt. Hermonin 1973. As an undergraduate he attendedHartwick CollegeinOneonta,New York. In 1984, Maren earned his master's degree fromColumbia University'sSchool of International and Public Affairs.[8]

During his time at Columbia, Maren worked for Africa Report Magazine as a contributing editor.[12]Later, he went on to publish articles inThe Nation,The New York Times,Harper's,The Village Voice, and other publications. Much of this work centered on war and famine and the culpability of aid organizations (Private Voluntary Organizations, or PVOs); he wrote inHarper's Magazine:
Because reporters are as dependent on aid organizations as the organizations are on them. It would have been impossible, for example, for the press to cover Somalia without the assistance of PVOs. There's no Hertz counter at the Mogadishu airport, and no road maps available at gas stations. If a journalist arrives in Africa from Europe or the United States and needs to get to the interior of the country, PVOs are the only ticket. journalists sleep and eat with PVO workers. When they want history and facts and figures, they turn to the PVOs.[13]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
