Boston Strangleris a 2023 Americantrue crimefilm written and directed by Matt Ruskin. It is based on the true story of theBoston Strangler, who, in the 1960sBoston, killed 13 women. The film starsKeira KnightleyasLoretta McLaughlin, the reporter who broke the news for theBoston Record American, withCarrie Coon,Alessandro Nivola,Chris Cooper,David Dastmalchian, andMorgan Spector.
Boston Stranglerwas released in the United States on March 17, 2023, byHulu. It received positive reviews from critics.
In 1962,Boston Record Americanreporter Loretta McLaughlin investigates three cases of older women who were raped and murdered by strangulation in the Boston area. She confirms the victims all had stockings tied around their necks in a bow, probably connecting the crimes to aserial killer. The story angers Boston law enforcement as well as Loretta's boss, who plans to kill the report to protect the company.
When a fourth victim is found, Loretta and fellow reporter Jean Cole decide to continue the investigation. The two women endure rampantsexismin their workplace and society. Loretta's marriage is strained by her long hours and her family is harassed. While writing the articles, Loretta coins the name "the Boston Strangler".
A year later, a seventh woman named Sophie Clark is murdered. A neighbor encountered a man who could be the killer and she provides a vague description. Sophie was much younger than previous victims, which breaks the Strangler's pattern. Loretta and Jean later discover that theBoston Police Departmentis botching the investigation and not sharing information with other cities. Similar murders, like one committed inNew York Cityby a man named Paul Dempsey, have been overlooked.
Albert DeSalvo, a suspect in the investigation, is taken into custody. Sophie's neighbor is asked to identify him in a line-up but she picks a different man,George Nassar. Despite this, in 1964, DeSalvo confesses to all 13 murders. Police do not have enough evidence to tie him to the murders, so he is instead convicted for earlier crimes of robbery and sexual offenses and sentenced to life imprisonment.
By 1965, Loretta learns from a police detective inAnn Arbor, Michigan, that there have been six murders there that are identical to the Boston Strangler's work. She travels to Ann Arbor and learns the most likely suspect is Daniel Marsh, an ex-boyfriend of a Strangler victim. Marsh is later arrested but refuses to cooperate with police. In 1973, DeSalvo calls Loretta and tells her to come to visiting hours the next day to hear his side of the story. Before Loretta can meet with him, he is stabbed to death by another prisoner.
Following an anonymous tip, Loretta meets with Harrison, a former patient atBridgewater State Hospital. He reveals that DeSalvo, Marsh, and Nassar were all held in the same ward at the same time. Harrison also claims DeSalvo's confession was coached by Marsh and Nassar. Loretta visits Nassar in prison. He denies that he and Marsh coached DeSalvo but admits he hoped to claim the reward. He accuses Loretta and the media of creating a sensation around the Strangler and insinuates that there is more than one murderer but that the public does not want to come to terms with it.
Loretta and Jean create a theory that Paul Dempsey killed the first six older women in Boston before he moved to New York. Once Dempsey left Boston,copycat murdersarose, resulting in the later victims being much younger. DeSalvo confessed to all 13 murders so Nassar could collect a $10,000 reward per victim. In return, Nassar arranged for DeSalvo to be represented by a high-profile lawyerF. Lee Bailey. DeSalvo was also deceived into believing he would get a million-dollar book deal that could support his family. TheRecord Americanpublishes Loretta and Jean's theory.
An epilogue tells of Loretta becoming an award-winning medical reporter atThe Boston Globe. Jean continued working as an investigative reporter for 30 years. She and Loretta remained close friends. Marsh was never charged with murder. Nassar never received a reward and is incorrectly said to still be in prison as of 2023.[a]In 2013,DNA evidencelinked DeSalvo to the 13th murder but not the other 12.

Ben Kutchinsserved as the film's cinematographer.[13]Filming began on December 6, 2021. A house inBelmont, Massachusetts, stood in for the home of reporter Loretta McLaughlin.[14][15][16]That same day, the Winn Brook Elementary School was transformed into the Cambridge Police Department forsecond unitfilming. The school was paid $5,000 to be in the film.[14][15][17]Several private driveways on Statler and Waterhouse Roads were rented to park 1960s vehicles.[14]For the next two days, filming took place in theSouth End; scenes were shot on Dwight Street betweenTremont Streetand Shawmut Avenue.[15]
On December 9, theBenjamin Franklin Institute of Technologywas temporarily turned into a police headquarters for the film.[18][19]Between January 26 and 27, 2022, the former Josephine M. Foster Elementary School inBraintreewas used as a set.[20]Filming also took place inJamaica Plain,Lowell,Lynn,Malden,Roxbury, andWellesley, Massachusetts.[15][21]Several health procedures had to be followed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic. The entire crew was vaccinated and tested for the virus three times a week until production concluded.[14]Filming wrapped in March 2022.[22]During post-production,Paul Leonard-Morgancomposed the musical score.[23]
The film was released on March 17, 2023, byHulu.[24][2]
Nielsen Media Research, which records streaming viewership on U.S. television screens, estimated thatBoston Stranglerwas watched for 206 million minutes from March 13-19, 2023.[25]Whip Media, which tracks viewership data for the more than 21 million worldwide users of itsTV Timeapp, calculated thatBoston Stranglerwas the third most-streamed in the U.S. during the week of March 19, 2023.[26][27]The streaming aggregator Reelgood, which monitors real-time data from 5 million users in the U.S. for original and acquired streaming programs and movies across subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) and ad-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) services, reported thatBoston Stranglerwas the eighth most-streamed program during the week of March 23, 2023.[28][29]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 68% of 140 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's consensus reads: "Boston Strangleris nowhere near as gripping as it should be, but the worthy story and strong cast are often adequate compensation."[30]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 58 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[31]
Kevin Slane writing forBoston.compraised Keira Knightley's performance, asserting, "Knightley is perfect in the role of McLaughlin, able to convey her dogged determination with a single steely glance."[32]Nick Allen ofRogerEbert.comgaveBoston Stranglera grade of two and a half out of four stars, saying, "Boston Stranglerreaches a point in which it is totally controlled by the wild course of events it is recreating, and it does make for decent, unsettling twists in a third act based on truth. But the emotional resonance is scant, even for howBoston Stranglercasts another spotlight on game-changing Boston journalism. By the end, even Knightley only has so much space to construct a distinct arc from a dedication that lasted years and altered Loretta's personal life. Ruskin succeeds in paying tribute to Loretta McLaughlin and Jean Cole's hard work, but it's less successful in filling in the larger story."[33]
Several reviewers made unfavorable comparisons to the earlierThe Boston Strangler(1968) orDavid Fincher'sSeven(1995) andZodiac(2007).Peter BradshawofThe Guardiangave the film a grade of two out of five stars, writing, "A director likeJonathan Demmeor David Fincher would have gone for the jugular on this kind of material, but writer-director Matt Ruskin seems a little squeamish and keeps everything on the right side of contemporary taste. The chill of fear is missing."[34]Jeannette Catsoulis ofThe New York Timesstated, "Despite the film's flaccid gestures toward the sexism of the period—to boost sales, the women's pictures are added to their bylines—"Boston Strangler" is a dreary, painfully stylized slog."[35]
Boston Stranglerwas nominated forOutstanding Cinematography for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movieat the75th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.[36][37]It won Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Limited or Anthology Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television at the2023 American Society of Cinematographers Awards.[38][39]
The storyBoston Stranglerpresents is largely historically accurate, including the details of the crimes and investigation, the names of the victims, the sexism Loretta and Jean faced, and the fact that Loretta and Jean coined the name Boston Strangler.[40][41][42]However, authorities, authors and others still disagree about whether DeSalvo was the sole killer or whether the murders could have been the work of multiple individuals,[43]as posited by the film.
Director Matt Ruskin interviewed the children of Loretta and Jean as well as their former colleagues to learn more about them and their work.[44]In addition, Ruskin read all of Loretta and Jean's articles and "some of the headlines were pulled right from the paper. Keira has some voiceover in the film, where you hear what she's actually writing, and some of that was pulled directly from their stories, too".[44]
Several historical inaccuracies stem from condensing the timeline. For example, in the film Loretta begins investigating after three murders, while in real life she did so after four; Sophie Clark is murdered on New Year's Eve in the film but in reality, she was discovered on December 5; in the film, the copycat murders in Michigan occur in 1965 but they actually occurred between 1967 and 1969; and the film shows DeSalvo's death as occurring shortly after his conviction, in reality, the Boston Strangler's final murder was in 1964, DeSalvo was convicted in 1967, and he was killed in 1973.[45][46]

It was launched on October 29, 2007, initially as ajoint venturebetweenNews Corporation(later21st Century Fox) andNBC Universal, which was laterbought byComcast. Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initiallybrandedas "Hulu Plus," which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and un-delayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—anover-the-topstreaming television service offering access tobroadcast televisionchannels.
In 2011, Hulu launchedits services in Japan, marking its first and only international expansion. Three years later in 2014, Hulu Japan was acquired byNippon TVand spun off from its American counterpart.[2]Since February 2021, Hulu's original content has since been distributed outside of the U.S. viaDisney+under theStarbrand. In 2019, Disney acquired a majority stake in Hulu as part of itsacquisition of 21st Century Fox, and subsequently acquired the remaining stakes held by AT&T and Comcast in 2019 and 2023, respectively, giving it full ownership. After the acquisition, Disneysoft launchedan integration of Hulu into Disney+ as a content hub in December 2023, allowing subscribers of both services to access Hulu content from within the Disney+ app. Hulu is one of the three streaming services in the Disney Bundle, alongside Disney+ andESPN+.
On January 6, 2025, Disney began its acquisition of a 70% stake inFuboTV, with the latter merging with Hulu's Live TV service. The combined company will remain publicly traded on theNew York Stock Exchange, but will be controlled by Disney executives. As part of the deal, Fubo settled a lawsuit againstESPN Inc.(majority-owned by Disney),Fox Corporation(21CF's successor), andWarner Bros. Discovery(WarnerMedia's successor after its merger withDiscovery, Inc.) over a joint venture known asVenu Sports, with Fubo being granted a preliminary injection to stop its launch in August 2024. The merger will take 12 to 18 months according to Disney and Fubo. Venu Sports was discontinued a few days later.
The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

In July 2007,Providence Equity, the owner ofNewport Television, became one of the earliest "outside" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 millionequity investment,[17]before the company was known as "Hulu."[18]With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an "independent voice on the board."[18]In April 2009,the Walt Disney Companyjoined the Hulu consortium as a stakeholder, with plans to offer content fromABC,ESPNandDisney Channel.[19][20][21][22]
Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

Comcast, the only other shareholder, announced on May 14, 2019, that it had agreed to cede its control to Disney, and reached an agreement for Disney to purchase its 33% stake in the company as early as 2024.[38]
On May 14, 2019, Comcast relinquished its control in Hulu to Disney effective immediately. As a result, the streaming service became a division ofWalt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International(DTCI) with Comcast effectively becoming asilent partner. Under the agreement, Comcast's 33% stake can be sold to Disney atfair market valueas early as 2024.

However, Comcast had not offered reasonable terms for an early buyout[54]and had instead expressed interest in buying Hulu themselves if it were for sale.[53]
On May 18, it was announced that Disney+ and Hulu would remove nearly 60 original films and series on May 26 in order to "cut costs." The news sparked some backlash, mostly towards the initial decision to removeHoward, the documentary on the life of lyricistHoward Ashman, on the eve ofPride Monthand the release of thelive-action adaptationofThe Little Mermaid.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
