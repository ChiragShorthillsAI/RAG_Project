Priscillais a 2023 Americanbiographicaldrama filmwritten, directed, and produced bySofia Coppola, based on the 1985 memoirElvis and MebyPriscilla Presley(who serves as an executive producer) and Sandra Harmon. It follows the life of Priscilla (Cailee Spaeny) and her complicated romantic relationship withElvis Presley(Jacob Elordi).
Priscillapremiered at the80th Venice International Film Festivalon September 4, 2023, where Spaeny won theVolpi Cup for Best Actress. It was released in the United States byA24in select theaters on October 27, 2023, before expanding wide on November 3, 2023.[5]It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $33 million worldwide. In addition to her award from Venice, Spaeny received aBest Actressnomination at theGolden Globe Awardsfor her performance.
Two months before renowned 24-year-old singerElvis Presleyleaves Germany in March 1960, 14-year-oldPriscilla Beaulieuresides with her family inBad Nauheim,West Germany, where her father is stationed in theU.S. military. At a base party, she meets Elvis, who was drafted in 1958, at the peak of his fame. Elvis quickly shows interest in Priscilla, and they start dating casually, despite her parents' concerns about their age difference and his celebrity status. Elvis eventually returns to the U.S. after his service, losing contact with Priscilla and leaving her crestfallen.
In June 1962, Elvis reconnects with Priscilla and invites her to visit him inMemphis, Tennessee, for a vacation. Before taking her toLas Vegas, he leaves pre-written postcards for her parents, to be mailed by his assistant. They enjoy Vegas and she returns to Germany. In 1963, professing his love, Elvis asks her parents if Priscilla can live with his father, Vernon, and stepmother, Dee, in Memphis and attend a private Catholic girls' school. Her parents agree and Priscilla moves to finish her senior year of high school.
While her time spent with Elvis atGracelandis pleasant, Priscilla is lonely while Elvis is away filming in Los Angeles, but is friendly with his paternal grandmother, Dodger, and house staff. After graduating, she visits Elvis and confronts him on the highly publicized rumors of his alleged infidelities with co-starAnn-Margret, which he says only serve as publicity for the filmViva Las Vegas. She continues to live at Graceland until he proposes in 1966. Priscilla witnesses bouts of Elvis' explosive temper, followed by remorse and excuses. Over the years, Priscilla tries to entice him into sex, but he states she is too young, eventually conceding to "do other things" sexually.
In May 1967, the two marry in Las Vegas, and Priscilla quickly becomes pregnant, delighting Elvis, though she is concerned how soon they will become parents and asks Elvis about their plans for just the two of them to travel, which he says they can do later. Elvis's ongoing prescription drug abuse, physical absence and frequent affairs further causes strain on their marriage. Elvis unexpectedly suggests they momentarily separate and Priscilla replies indifferently to his surprise. In February 1968, Priscilla gives birth to their daughter,Lisa Marie, as Elvis is preparing for hisNBC 1968 comeback special. He grows increasingly distant and the two eventually begin leading separate lives.
While visiting Elvis in his hotel room after a performance in 1973, Priscilla sees him in a mild haze of drug abuse. He attempts to seduce her, but does so in a way she finds undesirable and uncharacteristic of himself. Hearing her plans for divorce, Elvis asks if she is leaving him for another man, but she says she seeks an independent life. After a visit to Graceland to say goodbye to Elvis's housekeepers and grandmother, Priscilla drives away, as a number of Elvis' fans loiter outside the property gates.
On September 12, 2022, it was announcedSofia Coppolawould direct an adaptation ofPriscilla Presley's memoirElvis and Me, starringJacob ElordiasElvis PresleyandCailee Spaenyas Priscilla.[7]When asked what made her want to adapt Priscilla's memoir for her next feature film, Coppola responded in an interview, "I've had her memoir for years and remember reading it a long time ago. A friend of mine was talking about her recently, and we got around to discussing the book. I read it again and was really moved by her story. I was supposed to start this bigEdith Whartonproject that was gonna take five months to shoot and felt really daunting. I came up against a few hurdles, so I just decided to pivot to making one film with one idea. I was just so interested in Priscilla's story and her perspective on what it all felt like to grow up as a teenager inGraceland. She was going through all the stages of young womanhood in such an amplified world—kinda similar toMarie Antoinette."[8][9]
When asked what made Spaeny the right choice to play Priscilla, Coppola stated, "The character goes from the age of 15 to 27 over the course of the film, so she had to be able to act and age across a big span of time. It was really important for me to have the same actress playing Priscilla at those different stages of her life, and I think Cailee can pull it off. She's such a strong actress, and she also looks very young."[8]Of Elordi's casting as Elvis, Coppola stated, "I thought nobody was gonna look quite like Elvis, but Jacob has that same type of magnetism. He's so charismatic, and girls go crazy around him, so I knew he could pull off playing this type of romantic icon. But we're talking before we've even started filming, so I can't get too deep into it."[8][10]
Coppola also revealed in an interview that Priscilla Presley is an executive producer ofPriscilla.[8]
In emails exchanged with Coppola on September 2, 2022, and later obtained byVariety,Lisa Marie Presley, who died in January 2023, criticised the film's script for its portrayal of her father. In one message, she stated, "My father only comes across as a predator and manipulative. As his daughter, I don't read this and see any of my father in this character. I don't read this and see my mother's perspective of my father. I read this and see your shockingly vengeful and contemptuous perspective and I don't understand why?"[11][12]
Principal photography forPriscillabegan inTorontoon October 24, 2022.[13]Filming wrapped in early December, 2022.[14]
Priscilladoes not have Elvis Presley's music on its soundtrack. Coppola's husband,Thomas Mars, and his band,Phoenix, scored the film.[15]Sons of Raphaelwrote original music for the film.[16]
The soundtrack features 17 of the 51 musical selections used in the film. "My Elixir", a cover song bySons of Raphaelof a track of a track from Phoenix's 2022 studio albumAlpha Zulu,was released as the lead single. The soundtrack was published under theA24 MusicandABKCO Recordslabels on November 2, 2023. Critics praised theanachronisticsoundtrack choices as well as Phoenix's score.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 84% of 299 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's consensus reads: "With Cailee Spaeny's performance in the title role leading the way,Priscillasees Sofia Coppola taking a tender yet clear-eyed look at the often toxic blend created by mixing first love and fame."[33]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 79 out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[34]Audiences polled byPostTrakgave it a 71% overall positive score, with 50% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[28]
Positive reviews praised the casting of Spaeny and Elordi, with some commenting that the actors highlight the vast power disparity between Priscilla and Elvis.[35][36][37]Ben Kenigsberg ofThe New York Timesdescribed Spaeny’s performance as "sensitive" and "protean,"[36]while Marlow Stern ofRolling Stonewrote, "Spaeny, who is 25 but makes for a convincing teenager, is an absolute marvel, nailing Priscilla's complicated mélange of emotions — the wide-eyed wonderment and youthful desire, the apprehension and fear — while Elordi’s Elvis feels more grounded in reality thanAustin Butler's pouty hip-shaker."[38]Critics also commended the film for its exploration of themes present in Coppola's previous films, such as the isolation of fame, femininity, and "privilege without power".[39][36][37]
Stern added, "You couldn’t ask for a better person to handle this material than Coppola, who's no stranger to depicting young female protagonists and the powerful men who enjoy keeping them locked in gilded cages, whether it be the Park Hyatt Tokyo, the Chateau Marmont, the Palace of Versailles or Graceland. As the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola, she’slivedit, and is uniquely equipped to show what it's like to put a big, flawed man on a pedestal only to see that pedestal crack."[38]Stern concluded that the film is "a transportive, heartbreaking journey into the dark heart of celebrity, and [is Coppola's] finest film sinceLost in Translation".[38]
Alison Willmore ofVulturewrote, "The marvel ofPriscillais in its dual awareness, how it’s able to immerse us in the bubble-bath-balmy perspective of a teenager experiencing an astonishing bout of wish fulfillment and, at the same time, always allow us to appreciate how disturbing what’s happening actually is."[39]Willmore’s review noted, "Priscillais a teenage fantasy and wouldn’t work without acknowledging the headiness of being romanced by the most famous man in the country, though it’s telling that the film feels thinner and more rushed as its main character tires of her husband’s acting out and compartmentalizing of her within his life and realizes she can push back".[39]
In his review forThe New Yorker,Anthony Lanewrote, "To point out thatPriscillais superficial, even more so than Coppola’s other films, is no derogation, because surfaces are her subject. She examines the skin of the observable world without presuming to seek the flesh beneath, and this latest work is an agglomeration ofthings—purchases, ornaments, and textures. We see an array of outfits, chosen by Elvis for his wife, each one lovingly accessorized with a handgun. Closeups tell the tale: bare toes, at the start, sinking deep into the nap of a carpet; false eyelashes and china knickknacks; a single pill (the first of many) that Elvis lays on Priscilla’s palm, as if it were a Communion wafer; and a mini-sphinx, gilded and ridiculous, that we glimpse as she eventually flees from Graceland. If she stays there any longer, being Mrs. Presley, she, too, will shrink into a thing."[35]
Justin Changof theLos Angeles Timesreviewed the film positively, writing, "There is much more to Priscilla Presley's story left untold here: motherhood (Lisa Marie appears briefly here, at different ages), her own infidelity, her future romances, her friendship with Elvis until his death in 1977, her film career,The Naked Gunmovies...But with piercing matter-of-factness, Coppola ends this movie, her strongest in more than a decade, at just the right moment: when a dream finally dies, and the thrill is well and truly gone."[37]
BBC Culture's Nicholas Barber found it an "understated, non-judgemental portrait" of Priscilla, which was in stark contrast to the tone ofBaz Luhrmann's telling of Elvis's story inElvis(2022).[40]Commenting onPriscillaand Luhrmann's film, Lane said, "We need both movies, I would argue: last year’s frenzied act of worship and now this irreverent response, all the more potent for being so still and small."[35]
FilmmakerJane Campionpraised the film, saying "Don't be fooled by the apparent softness of Sofia Coppola's vision or the gentle sensitivity of her gaze, it's just that Sofia plays soft to deliver tough. There is so much dare, risk and rigor in Sofia's filmmaking, so much radical trust that it scares the pants off lesser filmmakers."[41]

In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

She haswonanAcademy Award, aGolden Globe Award, aGolden Lion,[a]and aCannes Film Festival Award.[b][2]She was also nominated for threeBAFTA Awards, as well as aPrimetime Emmy Award.[3][4]
Her parents are filmmakersEleanorandFrancis Ford Coppola, and she made her acting debut as an infant in her father's acclaimed crime dramaThe Godfather(1972). Coppola later appeared in several music videos and had a supporting role in the fantasy comedy filmPeggy Sue Got Married(1986). She then portrayedMary Corleone, the daughter ofMichael Corleone, in the sequelThe Godfather Part III(1990).
Coppola transitioned into filmmaking with her feature-length directorial debut in the coming-of-age dramaThe Virgin Suicides(1999). It was the first of her collaborations with actressKirsten Dunst. Her films often deal with themes ofloneliness, wealth,privilege,isolation,youth,femininity, andadolescencein America. Coppola received theAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplayfor the comedy-dramaLost in Translation(2003), and was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Director,[c]becoming the third woman to do so. She has since directed the historical dramaMarie Antoinette(2006), the family dramaSomewhere(2010), the satirical crime dramaThe Bling Ring(2013), thesouthern gothicthrillerThe Beguiled(2017), the comedyOn the Rocks(2020), and the biographical dramaPriscilla(2023).[5][6]
In 2015, Coppola released theNetflixChristmas musical comedy specialA Very Murray Christmas, which earned her a nomination for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie.[7]
Coppola was born in New York City on May 14, 1971,[8]the youngest child of documentarianEleanor(néeNeil) and filmmakerFrancis Ford Coppola. She is of Italian descent (Lucanian[9]andNeapolitan[10]) on her father's side[11]and was raised on her parents' farm inRutherford, California.[12]At 15, Coppola interned withChanel.[13]Coppola graduated fromSt. Helena High Schoolin 1989.[14]She first studied atMills Collegeand transferred to theCalifornia Institute of the Artsfrom 1993 to 1994 to focus on painting.[15]Thereafter, she attendedArt Center College of Design, where she was mentored byPaul Jasmin. After dropping out of college, Coppola started a clothing line called Milkfed, which is now sold exclusively in Japan.[16]
Coppola had many varying interests growing up, including fashion, photography, music, and design, and did not initially intend to become a filmmaker. However, after making her first short filmLick the Starin 1998, she realized it "brought together all the things [she] loved", and decided to continue her directing pursuits.[17]
Coppola's acting career, marked by frequent criticisms ofnepotismand negative reviews,[18][19]began while she was an infant, as she made background appearances in eight of her father's films. The best known of these is her appearance inThe Godfatheras the infant Michael Francis Rizzi, in the baptism scene.[20][21]Coppola also acted in her father's filmsThe Outsiders(1983), in a scene whereMatt Dillon,Tommy Howell, andRalph Macchioare eating at aDairy Queen;Rumble Fish(1983);The Cotton Club(1984); andPeggy Sue Got Married(1986), in which she portrayedKathleen Turner's sister Nancy.[22]Frankenweenie(1984) was the first film Coppola performed in that was not associated with her father, however, it often goes unnoticed due to her stage name "Domino", which she adopted at the time because she thought it was glamorous.[23]A short film entitledLife Without Zoe(1989), released as part of atripartiteanthology filmNew York Stories, was co-written by a teenage Coppola and her father; her father also directed the film.[24]
Coppola returned to her father'sGodfathertrilogy in both the second and thirdGodfatherfilms, playing an immigrant child inThe Godfather Part IIand playing Michael Corleone's daughter inThe Godfather Part IIIafter the originally cast actress,Winona Ryder, dropped out of the film at the last minute due tonervous exhaustion.[25][26][27][22]It has been suggested that Coppola's performance inThe Godfather Part IIIdamaged Francis Ford Coppola's career and ruined Sofia's before it had even begun.[28]Coppola has said that she never really wanted to act and only did it to help out when her father asked her to.[29]It has also been suggested that Sofia's role in the film may have affected its box office performance, which started strongly and then went into decline. Coppola herself worried that she had only been given the role because she was the director's daughter, and the role placed a strain on her during the time of shooting that her mother observed in a series of diaries she wrote forVogueduring the filming.[28]Coppola later stated that she was not hurt by the criticism from her work in the film because she never especially wanted an acting career.[30]
After she was critically panned for her performance inThe Godfather Part III(for which she was named "Worst Supporting Actress" and "Worst New Star" at the1990 Golden Raspberry Awards), Coppola largely ended her acting career. However, she did appear in the independent filmInside Monkey Zetterland(1992), as well as in the backgrounds of films by her friends and family (for example, she appeared asSaché, one of QueenPadmé Amidala's five handmaidens, inGeorge Lucas' 1999 filmStar Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace).[27]
Coppola also appeared in several 1990s music videos:the Black Crowes' "Sometimes Salvation";Sonic Youth's "Mildred Pierce";Madonna's "Deeper and Deeper";the Chemical Brothers' "Elektrobank", which was directed by her then-husbandSpike Jonze; and laterPhoenix's "Funky Squaredance".[31]
The Virgin Suicides(1999)
Coppola's first short film wasLick the Star(1998). It played many times on theIndependent Film Channel. She made her feature film directing debut withThe Virgin Suicides(1999); the film adaptation of the novelThe Virgin SuicidesbyJeffrey Eugenides. It received critical acclaim upon its premiere in North America at the 2000Sundance Film Festivaland was released later that year. Coppola was first drawn to the story after reading the book byJeffrey Eugenidesin 1995, at the recommendation of musicianThurston Moore. Coppola said she felt the novel's author understood the teenage experience. She has also said that if not for the book, she may not have had a career in film. Specifically, Coppola has highlighted the representation of teenagers "lazing around", a situation she connected with but felt was not seen very much in films in any relatable way. The story's theme of loss was a personal connection for Coppola in light of the 1986 death of her oldest brother in a boating accident, though she stated that she did not immediately realize this connection.[17]Coppola secured the rights to the novel and adapted the screenplay herself.[29]The low-budget film drew praise from critics[17]and represented the point at which Coppola became a filmmaker independent of her family connections.[29]She credits the start of her career to theCannesfestival after the film premiered there.[17]The film stars actorsDanny DeVito,Kirsten Dunst,Scott Glenn,Josh Hartnett,Michael Paré,Jonathan Tucker,Kathleen Turner, andJames Woods.[32]
Coppola's second featureLost in Translation(2003) won her theAcademy Awardfor best original screenplay and threeGolden Globe Awardsincluding Best Picture Musical or Comedy. AfterLina WertmüllerandJane Campion, Coppola became the third female director to be nominated for an Academy Award for Directing and the second to win the Original Screenplay award, after Campion in 1994 (Wertmüller was also nominated). Her win for the best original screenplay in 2003 made her a third-generation Oscar winner. Coppola was the second woman, afterEdith Head, to be nominated for three Oscars in one night. In 2004, Coppola was invited to join theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[33]Coppola shotLost in Translationin 27 days,[34]with a small crew, working without permits. Scenes were filmed impromptu on the street, while scenes shot at thePark Hyatt Hotelallowed the crew to use its corridors between two and three in the morning without disturbing guests.[35]
The film received positive reception and acclaim, though also generated controversy due the film's usage "of Japan as an exotic and bizarre landscape for its American protagonists". The group Asian Mediawatch lobbied against the film's Academy Award nominations, stating "The film has no meaningful Japanese roles, nor is there any significant dialogue between the main characters and the Japanese. Such portrayals perpetuate negative stereotypes and attitudes that are harmful to Asian Americans in the US, where a significant minority of Americans already have negative attitudes towards Asians."[36]Coppola responded to these allegations in an interview forThe Independent, "I can see why people might think that, but I know I'm not racist. I think if everything's based on truth, you can make fun, have a little laugh, but also be respectful of a culture. I just love Tokyo, and I'm not mean-spirited...Even on our daily call sheets, they would mix up the 'rs' and the 'ls' – all that was from experience, it's not made up. I guess someone has misunderstood my intentions. It bugs me, because I know I'm not racist."[37]
Her third film was thebiopicMarie Antoinette(2006), adapted from the biography by British historianAntonia Fraser.Kirsten Dunstplays the titular character andJason Schwartzman, Coppola's cousin, playsKing Louis XVI. The film debuted at the2006 Cannes Film Festival[38]where, despite boos in the audience, it received a standing ovation.[39]Though critics were divided at the time of its release, it has since received a cult following and more critical acclaim in the years that followed.[40]Peter Bradshaw ofThe Guardiandeclared, "Sofia Coppola's presentation of Marie's life has a sisterly, unjudging intimacy, and the director has carried off pert inventions and provocations with some style, combining dazzling visual tableaux and formal set-pieces in strict period, with new wave chart hits from the 1970s and 80s: these musical anachronisms lending ironic torsion to the overall effect."[41]
Marie Antoinettewas shot on location at theChâteau de Versailles. Coppola herself has claimed that she was initially drawn towards the character ofMarie Antoinetteas an innocent and caring character who found herself in a situation outside of her control, and that rather than creating a historical representation, she wanted to create a more intimate look into the world of the heroine.[42]Coppola was interested in making an emotional connection to the young royalty whose "coming-of-age took place under conditions familiar to a pampered zoo animal".[43]The film's style is not that of a traditionalbiopic, and instead utilizes "hit songs and incongruous dialogue".[44]The film received theAcademy Award for Best Costume Designas well as threeBAFTA Awardsnominations.
Coppola's fourth film wasSomewhere(2010), filmed atChateau Marmont. The plot focuses on a "bad boy" actor Marco (portrayed byStephen Dorff) who is forced to reevaluate his life when his daughter Cleo (played byElle Fanning) arrives unexpectedly.[45]The relationship between Marco and Cleo was loosely based on Coppola's own relationship with her father.[46]The film won the prestigiousGolden Lionat theVenice Film Festival. In November 2010, Coppola was interviewed byJoel Coen, who professed his admiration of her work, at the DGA screening ofSomewherein New York City.[47]
Somewheredepicts a newly famous actor (Stephen Dorff) recuperating from a minor injury whose wealth, fame, and professional experiences cannot alleviate the existential crisis he is experiencing, as he is forced to care for his 11-year-old daughter in the absence of his wife. The film premiered at the67th Venice International Film Festival, and opened in the rest of Italy, on September 3, 2010. The festival jury unanimously awarded the film theGolden Lionprize for the best overall film.Quentin Tarantino, president of the jury, said the film "grew and grew in our hearts, in our minds, in our affections" after the first screening. The film continued to receive critical acclaim, especially from notable film criticRoger Ebertof theChicago Sun-Timeswho praised the detail in the portrait of Johnny Marco, writing, "Coppola is a fascinating director. She sees, and we see exactly what she sees. There is little attempt here to observe a plot. All the attention is on the handful of characters, on Johnny."[48]
Coppola's next film,The Bling Ring(2013), was based on actual events centered around theBling Ring, a group of California teenagers who burgled the homes of several celebrities over 2008 and 2009, stealing around $3 million in cash and belongings.[49]Emma Watson,[50]Taissa Farmiga,[51]Leslie Mann,Israel Broussard,[52]Katie Chang, and Claire Julien starred in the film, which premiered at the2013 Cannes Film Festival, opening theUn Certain Regardsection.[53][54]It was inspired by aVanity Fairfeature on thereal-life criminalsdepicted in the film,[55]whom Coppola described as "products of our growing reality TV culture".[56]The film received generally positive reviews, with many praising its style and performances. While some felt that the film glamorized the crimes in the story and failed to make an assertive message about them through the narrative; "Coppola neither makes a case for her characters nor places them inside of some kind of moral or critical framework; they simply pass through the frame, listing off name brands and staring at their phones".[57]
Coppola collaborated again with herLost in TranslationstarBill MurrayonA Very Murray Christmas, which stars Murray and was co-written by herself, Murray andMitch Glazer. The film, an homage to classicChristmas-themedvariety shows, was released in December 2015 onNetflix.[58]
Coppola directedThe Beguiled(2017), a remake of the 1971eponymous Southern Gothic film, starringNicole Kidman,Elle Fanning, andKirsten Dunst.[59]The film premiered at the2017 Cannes Film Festival, where Coppola became the second woman (and the first American woman) to win theBest Director award.[2][3]The film is based on the 1966 book of the same name by authorThomas P. Cullinanabout a woundedUnionsoldier in a Mississippiseminaryduring theAmerican Civil War,[60]and was made for under $10 million.[61]The film exhibited elements of thethrillergenre, another departure for Coppola.[60]
Coppola cited her intrigue with theSouthas part of the story's appeal. Coppola has said that she "wanted the film to represent an exaggerated version of all the ways women were traditionally raised there just to be lovely and cater to men—the manners of that whole world, and how they change when the men go away". Coppola has citedGone with the Windas her inspiration for creating a film that was relatable despite its position within a different era.[60]The film faced a wave of controversy and division, including accusations of 'whitewashing' the original story after Coppola removed the supporting role of a black female slave from the film, as well as choseKirsten Dunstto portray a character who was biracial in the original novel. Coppola also faced criticism for minimizing the story of the people experiencing actual hardship in favor of depicting, albeit authentically, the lavish lifestyle of her protagonists, thus minimizing the importance of a weighty topic. Coppola responded to these allegations by citing the presence of young girls among her movie-going audience.The Beguiledis not the only of Coppola's films to be accused of exposing the socio-cultural affordances of her own childhood.[60]
Coppola described her version of the film as a reinterpretation, rather than a remake, ofDon Siegel's1971 adaptionof the same book.[60]Coppola wanted to tell the story of the male soldier entering into a classically southern and female environment from the point of view of the women and represent what that was like for them.[60][29]Coppola thought that the earlier version made the characters out to be crazy caricatures and did not allow the viewer to know them.[60]While some critics claim that Coppola intendedThe Beguiledas a feminist work, Coppola explained that she is not in favor of that labeling. Though she has said she is happy if others see the film in this way, she sees it as a film, rather, that possesses a female perspective—an important distinction.The Beguiledwas also made as a contrast toThe Bling Ring, and Coppola has explained that
she needed to correct that film's harshLos Angelesaesthetic with something more beautiful and poetic.[60]
Coppola's film,On the Rocks,[62][63]tells the story of a daughter and father, played byRashida JonesandBill Murrayrespectively, as they explore New York together in an attempt to mend their fractured relationship.[64][65]It was released in alimited theatrical releaseon October 2, 2020, byA24and was released for digital streaming on October 23, 2020, byApple TV+.[66]
The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised Coppola's screenplay and direction, and noted it as lighter than her previous films.[67]Some critics stated that the film "isn't destined to achieve the same kind of iconic status as some of Coppola's previous work".[68]
An announcement in mid-December 2013 stated thatAmerican Zoetropehad successfully attained the screen rights for the memoirFairyland: A Memoir of My Fatherand that Coppola would adapt the book with Andrew Durham. Coppola would also produce the film with her brother Roman.[69]Coppola would later drop out of directing duties while remaining herself as a producer, as Durham took over as the sole director and writer for the film.[70]
The film, titledFairylandand starringEmilia JonesandScoot McNairy, premiered at the 2023Sundance Film Festival[71]to positive reviews.
Coppola's next film,Priscilla(2023), her eighth as a director, is based on the life ofPriscilla Presleyand her 1985 memoirElvis and Me. It starsCailee Spaenyas Priscilla andJacob ElordiasElvis Presley. The film is distributed byA24and premiered at the80th Venice International Film Festivalin September 2023.[72]
The film dives into the life ofPriscilla Presley, allowing viewers to take a look into Priscilla's relationship withElvis Presley. Unlike the filmElvis(2022) byBaz Luhrmann, the film does not portray Elvis positively or much of his successful career. Instead, it portrays Elvis' "darker, domestic side".[73]Coppola was more interested in showing Priscilla's side of their relationship, highlighting the terror of Elvis' physical and emotional abuse towards Priscilla.[74]
The film received positive reviews, withRolling Stonedeclaring the film to be her best sinceLost in Translation.[75]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote, "Coppola has always been a filmmaker who coaxes out feelings rather than blasts them with emphatic declarations, and the nuanced restraint of her writing and direction here are very much points in Priscilla's favor."[76]
Coppola stated that she used her teenage years growing up in the Bay Area to inform her position in this role. She stated specifically about her time as a teenager, "I just remember everything being epic and important and with a lot of feeling and driving around and listening to music. Your senses are more heightened or something."[77]
In the mid-1990s, Coppola and her best friendZoe Cassaveteshelmed the short-livedComedy CentralseriesHi Octane, which spotlit performers inunderground music. The show was cancelled after four episodes.[78]
In December 2008, Coppola's first commercial premiered during an episode ofGossip Girl. The advertisement she directed for theChristian DiorfragranceMiss Dior Chérie, shot in France with modelMaryna Linchuk, was very well received and continues to be popular onYouTube.[79]

In 1994,[83]she co-founded the clothing lineMilk Fedin Japan, with her friend Stephanie Hayman in cooperation withSonic Youth'sKim Gordon. In 2001,[84]the fashion designerMarc Jacobschose the actress/director to be the "face" of his house's fragrance, Daisy. The campaign photographs of Coppola were shot by photographerJürgen Teller. The July 2013 issue ofEllefeatured photographs shot by Coppola ofParis Hiltonat Hilton'sBeverly Hillsmansion (Both model and house appear inThe Bling Ring).[85][86]
In 2017, before Coppola started pre-production onThe Beguiled, she was asked by Italian state broadcaster Rai Com from All'Opera to direct their latest production ofLa Traviata.La Traviatais a three act opera byGiuseppe Verdiset to an Italian libretto byFrancesca Maria Piave. This Coppola-directed production was filmed for broadcast in Germany and France by Arte/ZDF, using multiple state-of-the art 4k cameras and up to 100 microphones.[87]Coppola said in an interview she "could not turn down the project" with designer and fashion iconValentino Garavanidesigning the costumes for this 15 show run ofLa Traviata(2017).[88]Discussing her modern take on this classic story Coppola says "I wanted to bring out the personal side of the French courtesan, the party girl used to the social scene. It's a very feminine world that I love".[89]
This was the first stage production Coppola directed.[88]Coppola discusses how Valentino "really motivated me to take a chance and do something that was scary for me and very unfamiliar," and promised a "traditional" production that could nevertheless be appreciated by those who are not opera connoisseurs. Rome Opera House Director Carlo Fuortes said in an interview ticket sales had exceeded 1.2 million euros (1.35 million dollars), a record for the establishment.[90]
All fifteen shows nearly sold out before opening night.[89]It was the biggest box office success since theTeatro dell'Opera Di Romaopened in 1880.[89]

In 1992, Coppola met directorSpike Jonze; they married in 1999 and divorced in 2003. In an official statement, Coppola's publicist explained that the divorce decision was reached "with sadness". It is widely believed that the main character's husband inLost in Translationis based on Jonze, as Coppola stated after the film's release, "There are elements of Spike there, elements of experiences."[93][94]
From 2003 to 2005 Coppola dated filmmakerQuentin Tarantino. They have remained friends since their separation.[95]
Coppola married musicianThomas Marson August 27, 2011, atPalazzo Margheritain Bernalda, Italy.

Coppola and her family lived inParisfor several years before moving toNew York Cityin 2010.[100]
Coppola has maintained a low public profile for her family, aiming for her daughters' lives to be unaffected by her career and travel. When asked if her choices as a parent to keep her children out of the spotlight is a result of her own upbringing, Coppola has explained that she never wants her children to be jaded.[60]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
