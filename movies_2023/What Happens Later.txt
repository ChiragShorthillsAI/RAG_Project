What Happens Lateris a 2023 Americanromantic comedyfilm directed byMeg Ryan, written by Ryan,Steven DietzandKirk Lynn, and starring Ryan andDavid Duchovny. The film follows two exes who, after bumping into each other when their flights get delayed due to a snowstorm, spend the night at the airport reliving their past.[5]
The film was released byBleecker Streeton November 3, 2023. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $3 million.
At a regional airport onLeap Day, ex-lovers Wilhelmina "Willa" Davis and William "Bill" Davis run into each other and make small talk during their layovers.
Willa and Bill are about to get on their respective flights; Willa is on her way to Boston, and Bill is on his way to Austin. However, a storm, later identified as a bomb cyclone, causes flights at the airport to be delayed, leaving Willa and Bill to reconnect. Bill is married to his wife Beth-Anne, and together they have a 15-year-old daughter, Rose, but Bill says that he and Beth-Anne are “going through a thing.” Rose also wishes to be a dancer, which worries Bill. Meanwhile, Willa plans to visit her friend Ginny, who is splitting up with her husband.
While Willa and Bill reminisce about their past relationship, it is revealed that Willa suffered a miscarriage while she was with Bill. After Bill left, Willa had a little girl with a man who left as soon as he found out she was pregnant. Willa later gave her daughter up for adoption; she was able to find the perfect parents, but Willa does not know where her daughter is now.
Bill mentions that he saw Willa a year prior while she was changing planes in Dallas, but Bill did not say anything to her, stating that she looked lost. Bill obtains a hotel voucher but is unable to reserve a room. It is announced that Willa's flight to Boston is now boarding, but she ends up giving up her seat for a family. Willa tries to give Bill her ticket after upgrading to first class so he will not miss Rose's recital, as both Bill and Willa are “W. Davis”. Bill refuses. Willa mentions that Beth-Anne called earlier, while Bill was grabbing coffee, to say that Rose does not want to stay with him but with Beth-Anne instead for a few weeks. Bill then takes the ticket only for all flights to be suspended suddenly.
Rose calls Bill, and Bill encourages her to try her best at dancing; earlier, Bill told Willa that he had told Rose that she would not make it as a professional dancer, making her sad. Willa tells Bill that she is actually going to Boston to meet her daughter; Maggie, who just turned 20, called Willa and told her that she would like to meet. Earlier, Willa, using Bill's phone, texted Maggie, saying that she was not going to come. Maggie then replied, telling Willa to just try. Initially, this was seen as Willa texting Ginny.
The next day, all outbound flights are then announced to be departing shortly. Willa gifts Bill with her rainstick, and Bill gives Willa an old card, saying that he will write his number on the back. They then exchange a kiss before leaving to board their flights. Willa turns Bill's card over to discover that he only wrote "just try." Willa and Bill exchange final gestures through the windows of their planes, which are parked next to each other. Bill tries to sign his phone number to Willa, only for their flights to depart as the contrails from the planes form a heart.

Steven Dietz(born June 23, 1958) is an American playwright, theatre director, and teacher.  Called "the most ubiquitous American playwright whose name you may never have heard",[1]Dietz has long been one of America's most prolific and widely produced playwrights.[2]In 2024, Dietz was again named one of the 20 most-produced playwrights in America by American Theatre Magazine.[3]
Though several of his plays have been seen Off-Broadway (including "Fiction", "Lonely Planet", "God's Country"), the vast majority of Dietz's plays are produced in American regional theaters.[4]Seattle WA and Chicago IL are among the cities that have proved to be enduring homes for his work.[5][2]Seattle's ACT Theatre has produced 12 plays by Dietz, including 7 world premieres.  This includes a recent new variation on his own adaptation of "Dracula" (the most widely produced adaptation of that title in the U.S.) entitled "Dracula: Mina's Quest".[6][7]Dietz's psychological thriller, "How a Boy Falls", premiered at Northlight Theatre, Chicago, in early 2020.[8]It received a Joseph Jefferson Award nomination for Best New Work.[9]
Productions of two new adaptations are scheduled for the 2022–2023 season:  "Gaslight" (the first authorized stage adaptation of the Patrick Hamilton thriller, "Gas Light") and "Murder on the Links" (from the novel byAgatha Christie).[10][11]
Dietz's widely produced play, "Shooting Star", has been adapted by Dietz,Kirk Lynn, andMeg Ryanfor the film, "What Happens Later", directed by Ryan. The movie stars Ryan andDavid Duchovny.[12]
Dietz's overview of the current new play field, and his long-standing place in it, was recently published as an article entitled "Why New Plays Now? A Case for Supporting the Unimaginable", American Theatre Magazine, December, 2022.[13]
An excerpt from Dietz's forthcoming book ("Doom Eager: Notes on Making Plays") was recently published under the title "Some Hard and Beautiful Truths about Making Plays" by American Theatre Magazine, September, 2023.[14]
Recent plays include the dark, two-character mystery "Mirror Lake";[15]a ghost-like valentine to working in the theatre, "Haunted Play [A Tale of the Naive and Macabre]";[16]and the "micro intimacy" thriller, "The Shimmering".
During the 2018–19 season, Dietz premiered two interlocking plays for adult and youth audiences, entitled "The Great Beyond" and "The Ghost of Splinter Cove."[17]
During the 2015–16 season, Dietz premiered three new plays:  "Bloomsday" (American Theatre Critics Association Steinberg New Play Award Citation),[18]"This Random World" (Humana Festival of New American Plays),[19][20]and the thriller "On Clover Road" (National New Play Network rolling world premiere).[21][22][23][24][25]
Dietz's plays have been seen atSteppenwolf Theatre(Chicago IL),Old Globe Theatre(San Diego CA),Actor's Theatre of Louisville(KY),Seattle Repertory Theatre(WA),Berkeley Repertory Theatre(CA),Oregon Shakespeare Festival(Ashland),McCarter Theatre Center(Princeton, NJ),Alliance Theatre(Atlanta GA),Trinity Repertory Company(RI), theDallas Theater Center(TX), and theDenver Center Theatre Company, among others.  In 2010, Dietz was named one of the most produced playwrights in America (excluding Shakespeare), placing eighth on the list, tied with Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee for number of productions.[26]Dietz's plays have been produced internationally in over twenty countries, and translated into a dozen languages.
Dietz's work as a director has been seen Off-Broadway (Westside Arts), at major regional theaters (Actor's Theatre of Louisville, Seattle Repertory Theatre,ACT Theatre- Seattle, Northlight Theater - Chicago, Denver Center Theatre Company, Los Angeles Theatre Center,Merrimack Repertory Theatre- Lowell MA, City Theatre - Pittsburgh), as well as at theSundance Instituteand thePlaywrights' Center- Minneapolis.
Dietz taught in the MFA Playwriting and Directing programs at the University of Texas at Austin from 2006 to 2018,.[27][28]At UT/Austin, Dietz created an annual new play showcase (UTNT - UT New Theatre),[29]as well as a newly re-imagined MFA Directing program.  Notable former students include playwrightsGeorge Brant, Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig, Jenny Connell Davis,Martin Zimmerman, Kimber Lee, Meghan Kennedy, Andrew Hinderaker, Abe Koogler, Diana Grisanti, Gabriel Jason Dean, Sarah Saltwick, Kimberly Belflower;  and directors Halena Kays, Luke Leonard, Courtney Sale, Will Davis, Cara Phipps, and Hannah Wolf.  Dietz continues to conduct master classes in playwriting, story-making and collaboration around the United States.  He also teaches nationally as a Dramatists' Guild "Traveling Master."
Born and raised inDenver,Colorado, Dietz graduated in 1980 with a B.A. in Theatre Arts from theUniversity of Northern Colorado,[30]after which he moved toMinneapolisand began his career as a director of new plays atThe Playwrights' Centerand other local theaters.  During these years he also formed a small theatre company (Quicksilver Stage) and began to write plays of his own.  A commission fromACT Theatreto write "God's Country" brought him toSeattle, Washingtonin 1988, and he lived and worked in Seattle from 1991 to 2006.  In 2006 he accepted a professorship at theUniversity of Texas at Austin.  Since 2006, he and his family have divided their time between Austin and Seattle.
He is the recipient of thePENU.S.A. Award in Drama (forLonely Planet, perhaps his most widely performed work);[31]the Kennedy Center Fund for New American Plays Award (FictionandStill Life With Iris); the Lila Wallace/Reader's DigestAward (The Rememberer); theYomiuri ShimbunAward for his adaptation ofShusaku Endo's Silence; and the 2007Edgar Allan Poe Awardfor Best Mystery for his adaptation ofWilliam Gillette's andArthur Conan Doyle's 1899 playSherlock Holmes: The Final Adventure.   Dietz is also a two-time finalist for the prestigious Steinberg New Play Award (for "Last of the Boys" and "Becky's New Car"), given by the American Theatre Critics Association.  He was awarded the 2016 Steinberg New Play Award Citation for "Bloomsday."
Dietz's plays range from the political ("Last of the Boys", "God's Country", "Halcyon Days", "Lonely Planet") to the comedic ("Becky's New Car", "More Fun than Bowling", "Over the Moon"). Many of them, (e.g. "Trust", "Private Eyes", "Fiction", "Rancho Mirage") have as a central theme the effects of personal betrayal and deception.  A recent obsession of Dietz's seems to be the return of the "thriller" to the contemporary theatre canon.[32]Examples include the conspiracy thriller, "Yankee Tavern";  the classic single-set thriller, "On Clover Road";  the intimate thriller, "The Shimmering";   and the psychological thriller, "How a Boy Falls."  The majority of the plays are published (in acting editions) by either Dramatists Play Service (New York), or Samuel French, Inc., (New York).  An anthology of Dietz's work for young audiences was published by UT Press in 2015.[33]Many of the short plays are also anthologized.
Dietz's work as a director has been seen at many of America's leading regional theatres. He has directed premiere productions of new plays atActors Theatre of Louisville'sHumana Festival,Seattle Repertory Theatre, Denver Center Theatre Company, Northlight Theatre (Chicago),ACT Theatre(Seattle),San Jose Repertory Theatre,City Theatre(Pittsburgh), Westside Arts (Off-Broadway), and theSundance Institute, among many others. He was a resident director for ten years at the Playwrights' Center in Minneapolis, where he also served as artistic director of Midwest PlayLabs.

... my father being a Russian Jew ....
My relatives are Scottish, so I think my Scottish audience is important. Some are in Glasgow, but my mum's from Aberdeen. I hear it's grey there—like my mum. The name's Russian, but New York is my home. That's where I'm from.
I like that I look like my father and mother put together—that's aRussian Jewand aScottishLutheran, and I like that it all looks mixed up. ... I'm sure my nose wasn't an asset until I was David Duchovny. Before that, it was, like, "Yeah, that kind of Jewish-looking guy with the kind of big nose."

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
