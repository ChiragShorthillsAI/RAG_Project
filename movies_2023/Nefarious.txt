Nefariousis a 2023 AmericanindependentChristianhorror-thriller filmwritten and directed by Cary Solomon and Chuck Konzelman, based onSteve Deace's 2016 novelA Nefarious Plot. It starsJordan Belfias a psychiatrist who must determine if a convicteddeath rowinmate (Sean Patrick Flanery) is faking his allegeddemonic possession. The film was released on April 14, 2023, to mostly negative reviews from critics. The film holds a 35% rotten rating from critics onRotten Tomatoes.[3]
At a state penitentiary, psychiatrist Dr. James Martin arrives to evaluate a notorious serial killer named Edward Wayne Brady, who is currently a death-row inmate. The prison Warden Tom Moss warns Dr. Martin, who has just replaced Dr. Alan Fischer who committed suicide after previously interviewing the inmate, that Edward is an expert manipulator who can "get inside your head". Edward is scheduled to be put to death by electrocution at 11:00 that night, and Dr. Martin is tasked with determining whether the killer is legally sane or if he is mentally ill and incompetent of the crimes he has committed. Moss hopes that Martin will disagree with Dr. Fischer who was ready to declare Edward insane.
In their first discussion Edward inexplicably details various aspects of Dr. Martin's personal and professional life, and insists that he is a demon named Nefariamus who will answer to "Nefarious" inhabiting Edward's body. Nefarious states that he was able topossessEdward as he was notbaptizedand had committed sins in his childhood, such as stealing. He further details that, despite the doctor's initial assumption, he is not trying to escape punishment, and wants the body of his host to be executed. Nefarious tells Dr. Martin that before the day is over, he will also have committed three murders though the doctor states that this is impossible.
Nefarious accuses Martin ofeuthanizinghis terminally-ill mother, as a means to acquire his inheritance from her. The doctor becomes defensive, stating that the decision was made after meticulous examination and angrily threatens to end their interview. Suspecting that Edward suffers fromdissociative identity disorderwith Nefarious being analter personality, Martin tries to speak directly with Edward, but only with limited success. Nefarious periodically allows his timid, beaten-down host to communicate as seen fit, while Dr. Martin then draws out the role of demons in the world through his discussions with Nefarious. Expressing his own personal beliefs asatheistic, Martin declares that Edward has an insane belief system, and resolves to certify the prisoner to be unfit to be executed for the murders. As the doctor is leaving however, Nefarious begins to talk about the doctor's troubled relationship with his pregnant girlfriend and claims that at that very moment she is at an abortion clinic, mistakenly determined to rid the couple's relationship of what she sees as the reason he might leave her. The demon likens the practice of abortion to ancientpaganisticchild sacrifices toMolech, and in counting down gleefully exclaims "all hell is rejoicing". Dr. Martin rushes to call his girlfriend only to find that the abortion has already taken place.
Upon returning to further evaluate Edward, the demonic personality continues to cause Dr. Martin to question his prognosis when the prisoner speaks in Latin. Nefarious tells the doctor, that he wants him to serve as the author of an already-written Satanic book titledThe Dark Gospel, and offers to give him everything he wants from hismasteras was once offered to acarpenter in biblical times(Jesus), who declined. Explaining that he has chosen Dr. Martin to bring forth this work to deceive and mislead all ofGod's created human race, comparing the purpose of the book as the opposite of theGospelin theNew Testament. Nefarious claims to have known and been with Dr. Martin since he was a child. When the doctor is called away by Warden Moss, it is revealed that a scrapbook of Martin's life and the manuscript forThe Dark Gospelhave been found in the prisoner's cell.
Determining that the prisoner was intending to have Dr. Martin as his next victim, they confront Edward about what has been found. Nefarious causes the prisoner to dislocate digits on his hand, escaping his handcuffs and begins to strangle the doctor. Threatening to kill him unless he begs for his life, Martin concedes and tells him that he doesn't want to die. Releasing Dr. Martin, the prison guards forcefully apprehend the killer while Martin signs a document that declares Edward Wayne Brady as sane enough to be executed. In so doing, Nefarious declares that the doctor has committed three murders: his mother, his unborn child, and the prisoner.
Leading to the execution, a terrified Edward begins to plead for his life and continues to state that the murders were not his own actions. In his final moments while sitting in the electric chair, Nefarious again takes control and asks Martin whether he accepts the offer that was made earlier in exchange for publishing the devil's gospel, to which Martin shakes his head "no". Edward suffers a painful and prolonged death by electrocution. The disembodied demonic Nefarious takes the chance to speak to the doctor stating that he should have taken the offer, before possessing Martin and forcing him to hold up a gun to those in attendance and then attempt suicide. Martin spontaneously asks God for help, and the gun he is using misfires.
One year later, a visibly changed Martin is in a TV studio promoting a novel he wrote titledA Nefarious Plot, explaining he has written it as a warning against the reality of the demonic forces tempting all of us. In the discussion during the interview, Dr. James Martin concedes that he experienced amiracleas the firearm had been attempted three times while he was possessed and it did not work, as the gun when tested by forensics it functioned properly. Concluding that he isagnosticin his approach to what happened, he expressed interest in learning more aboutGod and Christianity. Upon leaving the studio he encounters a homeless woman, who ominously addresses him by name and asks if Dr. Martin missed her — evidently now the possessed host of Nefarious. In a post-credits audio, the voice of Nefariamus is heard to say in Latin, "You have been weighed in the balance and found wanting, but you are stupid that you do not understand. It is to be continued!"[a]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 35% of 21 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Nefariousis well-mounted and boasts some solid performances, but it's hard to look past the story's heavy-handed proselytizing."[10]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled byPostTrakgave it a 69% positive score, with 61% saying they would definitely recommend it.[7]

Conversely, Bill Newcott ofThe Saturday Evening Postsaid of the film, "Nefariousmay not be great filmmaking, but it is confident filmmaking, and sometimes that can get you exactly where you want to go."[13]Michael John Petty ofColliderfavorably compared the movie and its source material, to the 1998 filmFallen,The Conjuringseries, and to a greater extentThe Screwtape LettersbyC. S. Lewis, and states that "Nefariousrises above the general clichés associated with faith-based productions and stands out as something increasingly more interesting than its religious contemporaries."[14]
Adam R. Holz ofPlugged Instated that "Nefariousis not your average thriller", further calling it "a provocative film".[15]In the same vein, K.V. Turley of theNational Catholic Registersaid that "Nefarious is an excellent movie. The acting is uniformly good; the direction assured; the plotting pitch-perfect. The story — essentially a two-hander — is an interesting-premise-turned-into-a-suspense-filled drama, with an ending that can never be taken for granted."[16]
In 2023, the film was nominated by theGolden Trailer AwardsforBest Independent Trailer.[17]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
