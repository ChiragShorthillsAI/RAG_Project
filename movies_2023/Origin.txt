Originis a 2023 Americanbiographicaldrama filmwritten and directed byAva DuVernay. It is based on the life ofIsabel Wilkerson, played byAunjanue Ellis-Taylor, as she writes the bookCaste: The Origins of Our Discontents. Over the course of the film, Wilkerson travels throughoutGermany,India, and theUnited Statesto research thecastesystems in each country's history.
Originpremiered in competition at the80th Venice International Film Festivalon September 6, 2023, and began alimited theatrical releaseon January 19, 2024, byNeon. Although the film was a box office bomb,[5]it received positive reviews from critics.
Grappling with tremendous personal tragedy, writer Isabel Wilkerson sets herself on a path of global investigation and discovery as she writesCaste: The Origins of Our Discontents.
Wilkerson is consulted for her opinion after thekilling of Trayvon Martin. She explores the idea of how race may not be the only determining factor in bigotry, since, e.g., in India, everyone may be of the same "race", but bigotry still occurs by caste. Similarly, although Jews of European descent may have been considered "white" in some parts of the world, in Nazi Germany they were defined as an inferior race to be exterminated. Wilkerson visits Germany and debates friends about how slavery compared with the Holocaust, "subjugation" versus "extermination".
Wilkerson chats at a cocktail party with two white women who are friendly, but do not fully understand her ideas of how different types of bigotry interrelate. Later, she works with one of the women on her book.
Intertwined with her ideas and discoveries, Wilkerson suffers the loss of her husband Brett, a white man; her elderly mother Ruby; and her cousin Marion. She often imagines herself speaking to those who have passed away, such asAl Bright, a black boy who was on a winning Little League team, but when the team was invited to a public swimming pool after their win, he was not allowed to enter the water.
Wilkerson looks in German archives and discovers that the Nazis used some of America's racistJim Crow lawsto develop some of their own racist laws; Hitler said he used theAmericans' genocide of Native Americansas a guide for his own"Final Solution" extermination of Jewish people. The history of a couple in Nazi Germany is related, a male Gentile Nazi-party member who falls in love with a Jewish woman. They try to escape Germany, but she is caught and sent to a camp.
Also told is the story of married black researchersAllison Davisand Elizabeth Stubbs Davis, who work with a white couple,Burleighand Mary R. Gardner, in an undercover project to better understand segregation in America, resulting in the 1941 bookDeep South: A Social Anthropological Study of Caste and Class in a Southern City. The lynching of a black man is shown, with a white audience watching, some of them treating it as a show.
Wilkerson eventually decides to write a book about caste, a concept which solves some of the intellectual problems which mere consideration of race does not. She visits India andthe home, now a historical site, ofDr. Ambedkar, who championed the rights of theDalit("untouchable") peoples, who are at the bottom of thecaste system in India. Eventually, she speaks about her new bookCasteon stage, and how it makes it easier to understand and fight bigotry.
Finally, an onscreen monologue details thatCastebecame a number oneNew York Timesnonfiction best-seller around the time of the November 2020 U.S. presidential election, and spent ample time on the best-sellers list.
In October 2020, it was announced thatAva DuVernaywould direct, write, and produce a film adaption ofCaste: The Origins of Our DiscontentsforNetflix.[8]After Netflix was no longer attached and other studios passed, DuVernay turned to financing fromFord Foundation,Emerson Collectiveand Pivotal Ventures, among others.[9]In January 2023,Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor,Niecy Nash-Betts,Jon Bernthal,Vera Farmiga,Jasmine Cephas Jones,Nick OffermanandConnie Nielsenjoined the cast of the film.[10][11]In February 2023,Audra McDonald,Myles Frost,Blair Underwood,Victoria Pedretti, Isha Blaaker,Finn Wittrock,Leonardo NamandDonna Millsjoined the cast of the film.[12][13]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 82% of 193 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "A moving drama that's unafraid to ask big questions,Originhonors its source material with powerful performances in service of a deeply emotional story."[27]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 75 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[28]Test audiences gave the film a 91% overall positive score, with 81% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[29]
Critics widely regardedOriginas "ambitious".[30][31][32][33][34][35][36]Varietydescribed the film as "a swirling tornado of ideas"[32]and "a masterpiece",[37]whileRogerEbert.comconsidered the film to be "a dense, forceful masterwork."[31]Reviews forAunjanue Ellis-Taylor's performance were very positive,  described as "virtuoso",[35]"moving",[34]and "stunning".[30]Several critics directed particular praise to the scene where Isabel meets Miss Hale (played byAudra McDonald), whichRichard BrodyofThe New Yorkerdescribed as "powerful"[38]andAnn HornadayofThe Washington Postas the film's "most heartbreaking passage".[30]
DuVernay's choice to filmOriginwith16mm filmwas praised byRogerEbert.com, noting that the corresponding consistent visual look of the film emphasized the connectedness of Wilkerson's ideas.[31]Manohla DargisofThe New York Timesfound the 911 calls byGeorge Zimmerman(who shot and killedTrayvon Martin) in the film "excruciating", but noted that they intensify an urgency in the film "that feels very much like the sounding of an alarm."[34]Varietypraised the choice for the narrative to include moments where Isabel deals with personal adversity, noting that these details make Isabel's character "richer and more relatable" and share similarities with films byAgnès Varda.[32]
The film's use of different styles divided critics. Brody considered the films "fusion of history and subjectivity" to be an achievement,[38]and thought the film's creative freedom was reminiscent to themodernist filmsofIngmar BergmanandAlain Resnais.[38]Hornaday thought that the film "seems to create a new cinematic language",[30]andThe A.V. Clubthought that the film's experimentation with styles was admirable and demonstrated DuVernay's "visual dexterity".[35]Writers atThe GuardianandPolygon, however, thought the film would have been more effective as a documentary.[22][36]The scene with the plumber wearing the MAGA hat also led to a difference in critical opinions;[22][35]Hornaday for example though the scene was "a master class in unspoken expression"[30]whileRogerEbert.comconsidered it "too on the nose".[31]
African-American film critic Candice Frederick ofThe Huffington Postwrote a less than enthusiastic review as she criticized the film for having no actual story, lack of subtlety in its message and, just like criticism of the book, pointed out already-understood issues without moving the conversation forward.[39]

NEON Rated, LLC,doing business asNeon(stylized inall caps), is an Americanindependent filmproductionanddistributioncompany founded in 2017 by CEO Tom Quinn andTim League, who also was the co-founder of theAlamo Drafthouse Cinemachain.[1]As of 2019, League is no longer involved with daily operations for the company.[6]
Its first film,Colossal, was released in 2017.[7]The company became known for distributing such notable films asI, Tonya(2017),Parasite(2019),Portrait of a Lady on Fire(2019),Palm Springs(2020),Flee(2021),Spencer(2021),The Worst Person in the World(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023),Anora(2024),Longlegs(2024),The Seed of the Sacred Fig(2024), andThe Monkey(2025).[8][9]
Parasitewent on to become Neon's highest-grossing film at the worldwidebox officewith $262 million and the first non-English-language film to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture.[10]In 2024,Longlegshad a domestic box office gross of $58.6 million, becoming the distributor's highest-grossing film ever in North America.[11]Anorabecame the company's second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[12]Neon has also worked with several high-profile filmmakers, which includesSean Baker,[13]Bong Joon Ho,Julia Ducournau,Craig Gillespie,Pablo Larraín, andCéline Sciamma.[14]
During the 4th Annual Zurich Summit, Tom Quinn commented on Neon's intent to release titles that appeal to audiences who "skew under 45, that have no aversion to violence, no aversion to foreign language and to non-fiction".[15]Explaining the success of the company in 2024, Quinn stated: "We were very much a startup, with everyone functioning as this sophisticated amoeba. We very quickly found ourselves that year inTorontowith a great slate [...] That work enabled us to sit at the table in Toronto that year and buyI, Tonya. Before the ink was even dry on the deal, we were planning itsOscar campaign. It's a testament to how quickly we can make decisions because we're not this big studio. We've always used that to our advantage."[16]
In September 2017, the company partnered withBlumhouse Productionsto manage BH Tilt.[17]In 2018, a majority stake of Neon was sold to30West, the media venture arm of "The Friedkin Group".[4][18]In February 2021,Bleecker Streetpartnered with Neon to launch the joint home entertainment distribution companyDecal, which is a standalone full-service operation that handlesdistribution dealson the home entertainment rights to both Neon and Bleecker Street's features. The first film to be distributed through Decal was the Bleecker Street releaseSupernovain winter 2021.[5]Additionally, Decal acquired North American distribution rights to the South Africanhorror filmGaiafor a summertheatrical release, marking their first ever acquisition.[19]
Andrew Brown (Co-President of Decal) oversaw the launch of Neon's home entertainment division. In 2022, Brown was promoted to "President of Digital Distribution". The exec, who has served as "SVP of Digital Strategy, Marketing, and Distribution" for Neon since 2017, also manages Neon's library, and oversees the annualFYC DVD Box Setanddirect-to-consumerdigital portal "Neon Cinema".[20]Prior to the joint-venture,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, as well asThe Criterion CollectionandWell Go USA Entertainment(for the filmPossessorwhich Neon and Well Go co-distributed), distributed several Neon films onhome video.[21][22][23]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, Neon was approved to continue promotional activities for its films since the company does not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP) nor had encountered any issue in receivingSAG-AFTRAinterim agreements.[24][25][26]
In August 2023, Neon hired formerA24employees Alexandra Altschuler as "VP Media" and Don Wilcox as "VP Marketing".[27]That same month, Neon hired former Sierra/Affinity employee Kristen Figeroid as "President of International Sales and Distribution", Laurel Charnetsky as "VP International Acquisitions & Operations", and Dan Stadnicki as "Manager, International Sales & Distribution".[28]In May 2024, Neon hired Joey Monteiro as "EVP, International Marketing" and Ashley Hirsch as "Manager of International Sales and Marketing".[29]That same month, Neon promoted Elissa Federoff from "President of Distribution" to "Chief Distribution Officer" and Ryan Friscia from "EVP, Finance and Business Development" to "Chief Financial Officer".[30]Furthermore, Jeff Deutchman, who joined Neon when it was launched, serves as "President of Acquisitions and Production".[31]
Additionally, Neon has acquired the distribution rights to fivePalme d'Orwinners at theCannes Film Festival:Parasite(2019),Titane(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023), andAnora(2024); all five won consecutively.[31][32][33]The company's strategy to acquire such titles at Cannes is to eschew "the lazy approach", said Deutchman. "The only real way to do Cannes is to go see as many movies as you can, because you never know where the nextDogtoothorBorderorHungerorForce Majeureis going to come from", he added, citing several modern Cannes standouts championed by arthouse buyers.[31]After acquiringParasitein 2018, Neon financed and distributed the film the following year in U.S. territories.[34]"From the very beginning, Tom Quinn sawParasiteas a universal film and refused to put it in a box as a foreign-language or international film", saidParasitedirectorBong Joon Ho. "He saw the heart of the film and understood that it was about all of us living in our modern class-based society. I was always grateful for that."[16]Neon spent $20 million promoting, distributing, and campaigning for the film's awards.[3]The film subsequently became Neon's highest-grossing film with more than $200 million at the worldwidebox officeand won fourAcademy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Director. Similarly, Neon spent $18 million promotingAnora, three times the film's original budget.[3]Anoraultimately won the two aforementioned Academy Awards whileAnatomy of a FallandTriangle of Sadnesswere nominated for the same two categories, among others. As of March 2025, Neon has garnered 39 Academy Award nominations, winning 11 overall.[10][12][35]
In 2023, Quinn commented on the company's success at Cannes, saying: "We've seen over the years that each of these films, because of their credibility and success, the Palme d'Or has come to mean something quite impactful for a very young group ofcinephiles. And the reason why we know this is we've tested all these movies and dating back toParasite, probably I think, the fifth reason why people came to see the film, in itstest screeninginSherman Oaks, was the fact that it won the Palme d'Or, and each subsequent year that went up. And this year, the number one reason why people came to see the film [Anatomy of a Fall], at a test screening inBurbank, was the fact that it had won the Palme d'Or."[36]In 2024, Quinn stated: "The award means a lot. To audiences here who are looking for the absolute most adventurous, forward-looking cinema available, that award represents it because these films have delivered, and they've been major Oscar contenders."[16]
In July 2024, Neon received its biggest opening weekend at the box office with the horror thriller filmLonglegs, after scoring $22.6 million from 2,510 theaters (a figure that includes $2.5–3 million in Thursday previews) and only behindUniversal/Illumination's second weekend ofDespicable Me 4. Initially projected to gross $7–9 million, the opening marked the biggest total for an original horror film of 2024, one of the top 20 weekends for an independent film and the best opening ever for an independent horror film.[37][38][39]To promote the film, Neon utilizedguerrilla marketingtactics similar to those that led to the box office success ofThe Blair Witch Project(1999).[40]DirectorOz Perkinscredited Neon for the film's marketing, stating the studio "really responded strongly to the movie, the raw materials of the movie really excited them, the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it sounds. They asked me early on, 'Do we have your permission to kind of go nuts?' And I said, 'What else are we doing here? Go for it. Do your thing.'"[41]The film's total marketing budget was under $10 million, focusing ondigital contentand not havingtelevision ads.[37]During its third weekend,Longlegsbecame the company's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office, earning $58.6 million, surpassing whatParasiteearned with $53.3 million in 2020.[11]Furthermore, it became the top grossing R-rated horror film of 2024 and the highest-grossing indie horror film of the last decade, topping A24'sTalk to Me(2022),Insidious: Chapter 3(2015) fromFocus Features, and A24'sHereditary(2018).[11]Afterward, furthering their marketing campaign, from August 1 to 4, Neon (partnering withAtom Tickets) offered free tickets to anyone who has a birthday that falls on the 14th of any given month. To get the tickets, those who registered and purchased tickets through Atom Tickets received a special promo code after verifying their date of birth and were able to get one free ticket per customer, while supplies lasted.[42]

The film toured the festival circuit and was broadcast on February 6, 2007, as part ofShowtime'sBlack Filmmaker Showcase.[citation needed]
DuVernay next explored making documentaries, because they can be done on a smaller budget than fiction films, and she could learn the trade while doing so.[31]In 2007, she directed the shortCompton in C Minor,for which she "challenged herself to captureComptonin only two hours and present whatever she found." The following year, she made her feature directorial debut with thealternative hip hopdocumentaryThis Is the Life,a history of LA'sGood Life Cafe's arts movement, in which she participated as part of the duoFigures of Speech.This is the Lifewon audience awards at the ReelWorld Film Festival in Toronto, the Los Angeles Pan-African Film Festival, the Hollywood Black Film Festival, and the Langston Hughes African American Film Festival in Seattle.[32]

I Will Follow
In 2011, DuVernay's first narrative feature film,I Will Follow, a drama starringSalli Richardson-Whitfield, was released theatrically. DuVernay's aunt Denise Sexton was the inspiration for the film.[citation needed]In an interview, DuVernay talked about how her real life experiences differed from the film: "I was a caregiver for my aunt, Denise Sexton, in the last year and a half of her life. She was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer. She was a fighter and was active in her treatment to the end, which was different than the character in the film who wants to fight in a different way."[32]The film cost DuVernay $50,000 and was made in 14 days.[23]Roger Ebertcalled it "one of the best films I've seen about coming to terms with the death of a loved one."[36][37]I Will Followwas an official selection ofAFI Fest,Pan-African Film Festival, Urbanworld andChicago International Film Festival.
It wasn't until afterI Will Followthat DuVernay fully left her job in publicity. DuVernay stated: "I knew that as a Black woman in this industry, I wouldn't have people knocking down my door to give me money for my projects, so I was happy to make them on the side while working my day job."[20]
Middle of Nowhere
In the summer of 2011, DuVernay began production on her second narrative feature film,Middle of Nowhere, from a script she had written in 2003 but was unable to finance.[30]The film drew from her own experiences growing up in Compton and Inglewood.[38]The story focuses on the wife of an incarcerated man who is serving a 10-year sentence. She drops out of medical school in order to have more time and emotional energy to give to her incarcerated spouse. The film explores how the families of the incarcerated are also victims of the system and shows how commonly this burden of incarceration falls upon women of color. In an interview with theLA Times, DuVernay touched on her inspiration for the film, "The idea of looking at the victims of incarceration – the mothers, sisters and daughters -- really came out of knowing women who were going through it."[38]
The film had its world premiere on January 20 at the2012 Sundance Film Festival, where it played in U.S. dramatic competition.[39]It garnered the U.S. Directing Award: Dramatic for DuVernay. She was the first African-American woman to win the prize. DuVernay also won the2012Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Awardfor her work on the film.[40]
DuVernay was commissioned by theSmithsonian'sNational Museum of African American History and Cultureto create a film aboutAfrican-American history. HerAugust 28: A Day in the Life of a Peopleexplores six historical events that happened on the same date, August 28, in different years. It debuted at the museum's opening on September 24, 2016. The 22-minute film starsLupita Nyong'o,Don Cheadle,Regina King,David Oyelowo,Angela Bassett,Michael Ealy,Gugu Mbatha-Raw,André HollandandGlynn Turman. Events depicted includeWilliam IV'sroyal assentto theUK Slavery Abolition Actin 1833, the 1955 lynching of 14-year-oldEmmett TillinMississippi, the release ofMotown's first number-one song, "Please Mr. Postman" byThe Marvellettes, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963I Have a Dreamspeech, the landfall ofHurricane Katrinain 2005, and the night SenatorBarack Obamaaccepted the Democratic nomination for president at the2008 Democratic National Convention.[41]
Michael T. Martin says, "DuVernay is among the vanguard of a new generation of Black filmmakers who are the busily undeterred catalyst for what may very well be a Black film renaissance in the making."[32]He further speaks of DuVernay's mission and "call to action" which constitutes a strategy "to further and foster the Black cinematic image in an organized and consistent way, and to not have to defer and ask permission to traffic our films: to be self-determining."[32]
The "DuVernay test" is the racial equivalent of theBechdel test(for women in movies), as first suggested byGuardianwriters Nadia and Leila Latif[42]and then byThe New York Timesfilm criticManohla Dargisin January 2016, asking whether "blacks and other minorities have fully realized lives rather than serve as scenery in white stories."[43]It aims to point out the lack of people of color inHollywoodmovies, through a measure of their importance to a particular movie or the lack of a gratuitous link to white actors.[44]
In 2013, DuVernay partnered withMiu Miuas part of theirWomen's Talesfilm series.[45]Her short filmThe Doorstarred actressGabrielle Unionand reunited DuVernay with herMiddle of NowherestarEmayatzy Corinealdi.

She made uncredited re-writes of most of the original screenplay by Paul Webb in order to emphasize King and the people of Selma as central figures.[54][55]In an October 2020 interview onThe Carlos Watson Show, DuVernay claimed that she, not Webb, was the principal writer, saying that the biggest mistake of her career was allowing Webb "to take credit for writingSelmawhen I wrote it.[56]In response to criticism by some historians and media sources who accused her of irresponsibly rewriting history to portray her own agenda, DuVernay said that the film is "not a documentary.

AfterSelma, DuVernay was approached by executives to direct Marvel's first film about a superhero of color,Black Panther, but she passed. In an interview withEssenceDuVernay provided insight on why she passed on the project: "I think I'll just say we had different ideas about what the story would be. Marvel has a certain way of doing things and I think they're fantastic and a lot of people love what they do. I loved that they reached out to me."[62]She also expressed her support for the project moving forward, "I love the character of Black Panther, the nation of Wakanda and all that that could be visually. I wish them well and will be first in line to see it."[62]

The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron.
