It follows Rachel, a global intelligence operative embarking on a dangerous mission to protect a mysteriousAIsystem known as "The Heart". She is tasked by the peacekeeping operation known as Charter to keep the object safe from falling into enemy hands.[5]
Development began in December 2020, when Gadot signed on to star. Harper andNetflixwere confirmed to serve as director and distributor respectively the following month, with the rest of the cast being confirmed in early 2022. Filming took place in Europe from January to July of that year. With a reported production budget of $150 million, it is one of Netflix's most expensive original films.[3]
Heart of Stonewas released on August 11, 2023, by Netflix. The film received mixed reviews from critics and emerged as Netflix's second-most-watched film in the second half of 2023 with nearly 110 million views.[6]
In theItalian Alpsat a ski resort/casino,MI6field agents Parker, Yang, and Bailey, supported by technician Rachel Stone, are tasked with capturing Mulvaney, an arms dealer who is there gambling on a US Navy SEAL combat operation being livestreamed. When Yang is caught trying to sedate Mulvaney, a gunfight breaks out. Parker manages to extract Mulvaney to a cable car while the team heads down the mountain to confront Mulvaney's security.
Stone feigns injury to stay back and contact a mysterious agent named Jack feeding her probability information about how to safely get down the mountain and neutralize the incoming security. She manages to avoid contact with her team, who do not know she is undercover for a different organization; while extracting Mulvaney, he apparently takes cyanide to commit suicide.
In London, Stone is reprimanded for risking her cover by Nomad, her superior. Stone is concerned by the presence of a hacker she saw in the Alps, whom she discovers she is Keya Dhawan, an orphan with links to Indian criminal syndicates. Stone's organization, "the Charter" (which Bailey suspects exists), leaks Keya's location to MI6, which sends them to track her down with Stone still undercover.
Upon arrival, they are ambushed by a squad of mercenaries. Jack orders Stone to evacuate, but she refuses, going back to save the team at the expense of her cover. After they escape, Stone is forced to reveal she is a Charter agent.
Parker murders Yang and Bailey, revealing himself as a double agent working with Keya. He admits to covertly murdering Mulvaney as part of his mission to find The Heart, a quantum computer used to guide the Charter's missions. Parker paralyzes Stone with poison before planting a device in her to act as a trojan horse to infiltrate Charter systems. Once she is recovered and taken to Charter HQ, the device begins breaching security. Stone cuts out the device, but the hackers learn the Heart's location and Nomad (King of Hearts) suspends Stone.
Nomad meets with the other three Kings running the charter, who reveal that Parker was an MI6 agent left for dead during an operation the Charter botched in Chechnya eight years ago. Having learned from the hack that The Heart's command system is located in anairshipover Africa, Parker and Keya fly to the ship. Stone intercepts them, but is unable to stop them from seizing The Heart and destroying the ship. She cuts the rope ladder to their helicopter, forcing her and Keya to parachute into the desert.
Keya informs Stone that she biometrically encrypted the Heart, making it useless without her. A passing jeep picks them up, taking them to a village, which turns out to be a setup by Parker. Keya rejoins Parker while Stone escapes, eventually being rescued by another Charter operative. Stone goes to Iceland, where Parker is using a university supercomputer to exploit the Heart.
Parker uses the Heart to kill two of the four Charter Kings and their operatives as well as trap Nomad and her team in their bunker without an air supply; Keya becomes disillusioned with him as she only intended to use the Heart to expose evil people, not kill in revenge. She helps Stone avoid an explosion set in the decoy location and reroutes her to Parker and the Heart's true location.
Parker realizes Keya has betrayed him, so tries to force her to unencrypt the Heart. Stone arrives in time to rescue her, and manages to kill Parker. Keya uses the Heart to restore oxygen to the bunker, then turns the Heart back over to the Charter.
Four weeks later, Stone visits Keya in prison and offers her a job in the Charter. They then take on another mission as a new team, Stone, Jack, and Keya.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 30% of 135 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Gal Gadot remains an entertaining action star, but she's no match forHeart of Stone'sthinly written characters, generic plot, and rote set pieces."[21]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 44 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[22]
Time'sStephanie Zachareksaid the film "occupies that vast middle zone of small-screen movies that easily fill the void of a few empty hours, if you happen to have any to spare, though it's nothing you'd carve out time in your schedule to watch."[23]Brian Lowry ofCNNsaid it "capitalizes on Gadot's inherent likability – a ruthless agent burdened by, yes, a heart – without bringing enough distinctive elements to this exercise to make it feel like much more than aMissionwannabe."[24]The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey gave it two out of five stars, writing, "Heart of Stone is an ideological mess. AI is great until it's not, and then it's fine because Gal Gadot can just kick someone in the face. It's conflicted without embracing that conflict, resulting in a film that's really about nothing at all."[25]
Wendy Ide ofThe Observergave it three out of five stars, calling the screenplay "a rudimentary thing – scaffolding to support the set pieces – that starts to creak whenever it attempts any depth of character", but praising the action as "terrific, with a screaming, tyre-shredding extended car chase around Lisbon's tight, cobbled alleys a breathless and exhilarating highlight."[26]Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave it three out of four stars, writing, "Heart of Stoneis clearly intended to jump-start an action franchise for Gadot, and it's off to a promising start."[27]
Heart of Stoneappeared on the  "Worst Films of 2023" lists: inVariety's year-end list, criticOwen Gleibermanranked "Heart of Stone" as the 5th worst film of the year. His review pointed to weak storytelling and lackluster performances, highlighting how the film missed the mark in an increasingly competitive genre.[28]Irish critics Donald Clarke and Tara Brady fromThe Irish Timesplaced the film at 9th on their "Worst of the Year" list, adding their voices to the growing disappointment from both American and European reviewers. Their critique echoed sentiments that the movie failed to stand out despite its high-stakes narrative and action sequences.[29]AtScreenCrush, Matt Singer ranked "Heart of Stone" in 6th place, indicating his disapproval of its predictable plot and formulaic approach.[30]Marlow Stern from Rolling Stone placed it in the 8th spot, further reflecting the film's overall failure to resonate with audiences and critics alike.[31]
Other reviewers, such as Chris Evangelista from/Film, Dominic Griffin fromBaltimore Beat, and Meghan Cook fromInsider, included the film on their lists as well, cementing "Heart of Stone" as one of the year's most criticized releases. Their shared criticisms point to an overall consensus that the film did not meet the expectations set by its promotional hype, ultimately making it a major disappointment for 2023.[32][33][34]

Beyond acting, Gadot and her husband have co-founded a film production company, launched a food brand, and invested in Israeli startups.  She is widely celebrated in Israel as a national icon and ambassador. However, her strong support for the Israeli military has sparked both praise and criticism.
Gal Gadot was born on 30 April 1985[2]inPetah Tikva,[note 1]where she initially lived.[9]She was born to Jewish parents ofAshkenazidescent;[7]her mother's roots areCzechandPolish, while  her father's areAustrian,Russian, andGerman.[10]Her parents, Michael, an engineer, and Irit, a physical education teacher,[11][12]hebraized their surnamefrom "Greenstein" to "Gadot" before her birth.[13]In Hebrew, her first name means "wave," and her surname translates to "riverbanks."[6]She has a younger sister, Dana.[14]
Her father is a sixth-generationSabra,[15]and one of his ancestors was the firstchemistatShaare Zedek Hospitalin Jerusalem,[16]while her mother is a first-generation Sabra and the daughter ofHolocaust survivors.[14][5]Her maternal grandfather,[5]Abraham Weiss,[17]was born as Adolf Weiss,[18]in the village ofMunkács,[19]Czechoslovakiain 1928. At 13, whenNazi Germany invaded, his father died in the army. He, his mother, and his brother were sent toAuschwitz, where the latter two perished in thegas chamber. He was the sole survivor of his family. Her maternal grandmother, however, managed to escape Europe beforeWorld War II.[20][15][17]Abraham immigrated alone toJaffa, where he built a family and "a successful business". He later served in theGolani Brigade, and in his later years, he joinedIsrael Defense Forces(IDF) expeditions to share his firsthandHolocaust testimony.[21]
Gadot grew up in the Givat Tal neighborhood ofRosh HaAyin,[8][22][23][15]in what she described as a "very Jewish, Israeli family environment".[14]At 11, she visitedHolocaust memorial sitesin Poland to learn about Auschwitz andMajdanek. Reflecting on the experience, she recalled: "I, an entitled child, felt the suffering theMuselmannexperienced back then."[23]Encouraged by her mother to be active from a young age, Gadot took up swimming at four and later played tennis.[15]She joined the local volleyball and basketball teams,[24]soccer-teamcheerleader,[19]and trained in ballet, hip-hop, and jazz for 12 years, at one point considering a career as a choreographer.[14]
As a child, she struggled with a weak voice and attendedspeech therapy, where she learned properbreathing techniques.[25]At 12, she was invited to enter theGirl of the Year[he](Hebrew:נערת השנה‎) competition but declined, saying, "Ugh, modeling? I'm much smarter and deeper. I won't make a living from posing for the camera." However, reflecting on that decision later, she acknowledged, "when I grew up, I realized that it's a job and that it's also fun—you make great money, meet fascinating people, and visit interesting places."[24]
Although Gadot’s native language isHebrew, she started taking English lessons inthird gradeand became fluent when she decided she wanted to watchSeinfeldandFriends.[26]She later attended Begin High School, where she majored in biology.[23]After graduating, she had a few months before beginning her mandatory two-year service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). During this time, she received modeling offers but instead chose to work atBurger King, saying, "I was like, posing for money? Ugh, it’s not for me." Meanwhile, her mother and a friend submitted an application on her behalf for the Miss Israel pageant.[15]Before enlisting, she also worked as acaregiverfor eight-month-old twins.[23]
"It wasn't my love for fashion or glamour that led me there. My enlistment [in the army] had been postponed by six months, and all my friends were already in uniform. My mother suggested I try out, so I went through the selection process, met wonderful girls, and thought, 'Why not? It will be fun, and I'll get one last trip abroad before the army.' I figured it would make for a good story to tell my future grandchildren."
In 2004, the 54thMiss Israelbeauty pageant took place at theHaifaCongress Center,[27]where an 18-year-old Gal Gadot participated with little expectation of winning. However, the 5'10" Gadot,[23]was crowned Miss Israel bySivan Klein, andYona Yahav,[28]and received aCitroën C3supermini car.[29]Following her win, Gadot represented Israel in theMiss Universe 2004pageant in Ecuador but admitted she intentionally "rebelled" to avoid winning, arriving late to events and refusing to wear an evening gown.[30]Before parting ways with the crown, Gadot emphasized the importance of serving in the Israeli army, saying, "Serving in the army is an integral part of the lives of the youth here [Israel]. Beyond my contribution, I believe that this period will contribute greatly to me as well."[31]In 2005, a week after passing on the crown,[32]Gadot, at 20,[33]was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces. After excelling in a three-month boot camp,[34]she served as a combat trainer, teaching soldiers gymnastics andcalisthenics.[35]Reporting daily at 5 a.m., she led soldiers through a form of boot camp.[15]Gadot became so passionate about the techniques she learned that she eventually trainedsergeantsand high-rankingcommanders.[36]Gadot also practicedKrav Maga,[37]gaining proficiency in handling weapons and preparing for combat.[36]She completed hermandatory two-year service, of which only 20 days were in uniform.[38]Reflecting on her military experience in a 2016 interview withFashion, Gadot said, “It was demanding because you give up your freedom for two years, but there is something special in giving back to your community.”[36]

My job is to take pictures in a bathing suit. There’s nothing provocative about that."[42]After the issue was released in July 2007,[42]the shoot significantly boosted her public profile,[43][44]and as a result, she landed an international campaign for "Prada Ellis" perfume.[31]

Gadot shared that the casting director helped her, and she went through several callbacks.[46]Throughout the experience, although she lost the role toOlga Kurylenko,[34]Gadot found the experience "interesting" and told her agents to let her know if any other opportunities came up that might be a better fit for her.[46]She dropped out of IDC Herzliya[47]and, two months later, made her acting debut in the Israeli dramaBubot.[46]She recalled that on the first day of classes, she received a call informing her that she had landed the lead role of Miriam.[24]She later performed inFestigal Underwater, an annual Israeli musical show for kids duringHanukkah, where she performed as amermaid, acting, singing, and dancing.[48][49]

I think Justin really liked that I had served in the Israeli military and wanted to incorporate my knowledge of weapons into the role".[42]Later that year, she appeared on an episode ofAsfur.[59]In 2012, she starred the Israeli drama,Kathmandu, set in Nepal, the series follows aChabadcouple running asanctuaryfor Jewish travelers.

In her January 2018, article forThe Forward, Jenny Singer critiques how Gadot is portrayed in the media, particularly on the cover ofVanity Fair. Despite Gadot's "success as an actress, activist, and athlete," Singer argues that she is often reduced to asex object, with her talents overshadowed by her physical appearance. Singer suggests that Gadot's background, including her modeling past and accent, may contribute to the media's focus on her looks rather than her accomplishments.[158]That year,Timemagazine named Gadot one of the100 most influential people in the world,[159]andForbesranked her as the tenth highest-paid actress in the world, with annual earnings of $10 million.[160]In 2020,Forbesranked Gadot as the third highest-paid actress in the world, with annual earnings of $31.5 million.[161]In 2022, Variety reported that Gadot earned $5 million for her role in Death on the Nile.

Gadot has been compared toBar Refaeli, who faced backlash for not serving in the military. Gadot is admired for her military service, which has endeared her to Israelis. Her image as a "good Israeli" and her inspiring presence in Wonder Woman have made her a source of "national Israeli pride," with fans cheering and even crying at her appearances.[165]
Isabel Feinstein ofThe Jerusalem Postpraised Gadot as a powerful example of "soft power" for Israel, highlighting how her rise to global fame offers the "Jewish state" a unique opportunity for positive international exposure. Feinstein highlighted that Gadot's Google search results (20.7 million) surpass those of Israel's prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu(16.1 million), emphasizing her global influence.[166]She also noted that Gadot's appearances on Western talk shows likeJimmy Fallonand TheEllen Showhave helped humanize the stereotype of the "brutal Israeli soldier," making her relatable to a worldwide audience. Feinstein went on to describe Gadot as "a living contradiction", claiming that "the association of an Israeli actress with a progressive agenda helps those who unfairly condemn all citizens of a nation for the actions of their government see that Israelis are complex and open-minded humans with a wide range of opinions".[166]In a 2019 article byThe Australian Jewish News, it is highlighted that Gadot is often seen as a more effective ambassador for Israel than its diplomats, given her global fame. Ari Ingel of theCreative Community for Peacebelieves her interactions with prominent Hollywood figures can positively influence Israel's image. However, Shayna Weiss ofBrandeis Universityviews this as a "soft power" issue—using culture to sway opinions—and questions whether such influence has measurable or lasting effects, saying, "I don’t think Gal Gadot harms Israel, but do I think Gal Gadot helps Israel much? Not so sure."[167]
The release of the film sparked a debate about Gadot'sJewish identityand her portrayal as awoman of color.[168]Some argued that as anIsraeli Jew, Gadot should be seen through the lens of racial complexity, in the claims that Hollywood has historically limited representation of diverse identities.[169]Critics argued Wonder Woman was a breakthrough forwhite womenbut lacked representation for women of color.[170]In contrast, others viewed Gadot's role as a positive step toward broader representation, especially for Jewish women, Israeli heritage, distinct accent, and strength as a heroic figure.[168]Tamar Hermannreflected on Gadot's portrayal, noting that Jewish women are often underrepresented or stereotyped in Hollywood. For many, Gadot's role offered a rare and empowering representation of Jewish women, highlighting her Israeli heritage, distinct accent, and strength as a heroic figure.[171]Some argued that Black women's support for the film ignored Gadot's ties to theIDFand her stance onPalestinian oppressionwarning it could complicate issues ofWhite feminism,anti-Black racism, andracial capitalism, calling for a more nuanced view of the film'scultural significance.[172]

Her comments sparked mixed reactions, with some praising her stance and others urging a clearer political position.[195]
During the2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, Gadot called for peace in a statement that sparked widespread backlash. While expressing support for Israel, she referred to Palestinians as "neighbors" rather than naming them directly, which many saw as downplaying their suffering.[196][197][198]Yair Netanyahu, son of the Israeli prime minister, criticized her neutrality, arguing that, as Israel’s most known figure, she should have taken a stronger stance. He compared her toBellaandGigi Hadid, who are vocal in theirpro-Palestiniansupport, saying Gadot acted "as if she was from Switzerland" instead of strongly supporting Israel.[199]Israeli nationalistsalso expressed disappointment, believing she should have used her global influence to defend Israel more strongly.[199]
In 2022, following theBnei BrakandTel Aviv shootingattacks, Gadot remained silent, which led to criticism from her Israeli fans.[200]However, her mother, Irit Gadot, addressed the matter publicly, defending her daughter.

When I look back 15 years, when I was starting out, being Israeli was something that people admired and were excited about—Israeli women, their strength, and all that. I’m not saying it’s no longer the case, but now it’s complicated. The conversation has changed. It’s different. And I find myself, time and again, having to engage in very complex and often uncomfortable discussions with people who have opinions about what’s happening, trying to give them the full picture of what’s really going on.
In January 2025, Gadot participated inNoa Tishby’s "#BringOnTheLight" campaign, celebrating Jewish resilience and joy duringHanukkah. The campaign featured other celebrities who lit the menorah on different nights.[213]Late that month, she faced backlash after attending the 2025 Golden Globes without wearing a yellow ribbon pin, a symbol of support forhostages held by Hamas.

She reinforced her anti-war stance, saying that "I know it sounds cliché, but just as they are teaching us to hate, by increasing antisemitism, we can also teach them to love. I want to believe that love is the force that moves the world. War is a defeat for everyone. Hate is horrible. It is toxic for the outside world and for the hater."[217]
In March 2020, Gadot and a number of other celebrities, including herWonder Woman 1984co-starKristen Wiig, performedan online versionof the song "Imagine" byJohn Lennon, intended to raise morale during theCOVID-19 pandemic.[218]The video received backlash with critics dismissing it as an ineffective response to the pandemic; Jon Caramanica ofThe New York Timescalled it "an empty and profoundly awkward gesture".[219][220][221][222][223]Gadot later acknowledged the video did not garner the positive reaction that had been intended, but was unapologetic in explaining the thinking behind it.[83]In a 2022 interview withInStylemagazine, Gadot admitted that the video was done in "poor taste", but still maintained that it had "pure intentions".[224]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
