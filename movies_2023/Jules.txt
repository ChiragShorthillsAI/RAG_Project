Marc Jay Turtletaub(born January 30, 1946)[1]is an Americanfilm producerand former president andCEOofthe Money Store.
Born inLakewood, New Jersey,[2]he grew up inPerth Amboy, New Jersey[3]and the adjoining township ofWoodbridge.[4]He attendedRutgers Preparatory School, graduating in the class of 1963. The captain andcenteron the basketball team, he made All-State in his senior year and was inducted into the Rutgers Prep Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993. At the time of his induction, he was called a "class individual" by the former basketball coach.[5]He was a political science major[6]at theWharton Schoolof theUniversity of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1967.  He was a reporter and then managing editor of the campus newspaper,The Daily Pennsylvanian.[7][8]He received a "Men's Senior Honor Award" for "outstanding service to the University community"[9]and was selected to be a member of the prestigiousSphinx Senior Society.[10]He attendedNew York University School of Law, graduating in 1970.  He was admitted to theCalifornia Bar, becoming inactive in 2013.[11]He was a journalist for six years after finishing school, but always felt he was a storyteller.[2]
Turtletaub spent 20 years working forThe Money Store, a business that his father, Alan Turtletaub, founded in 1967.[12]The Money Store was a pioneer in thesubprime lendingindustry, makinghome equity-securedsecond mortgagesand other loans to people withblemished credit.  Turtletaub succeeded his father as CEO and president in 1989,[13]and took thecompany publicin 1991, and then sold it in June 1998 toFirst Union Bankfor $2.1 billion.[14]During his tenure the advertising-driven lending company's growth was phenomenal, and "had been quite profitable for the Turtletaub family."[15][16]At the time of the sale, revenue was $831 million/year,loan originationswere more than $1 billion a quarter, there were 172 branches and 5000 employees; it was the nation's 5th-largest subprime lender, and the leadinghome equityandSmall Business Administrationlender.[17][18]Turtletaub had built the 400,000-square-foot (37,000 m2)Zigguratshaped headquarter inWest Sacramento, triggering a rebirth in the area.[19]He subscribed to the ancient principles offeng shui, a Chinese geometric practice; with architect Ed Kado, he incorporated these features into the design of this "unique landmark."[20][21]The need for a "deep pocket" led to themergerwith First Union;bond ratingagencies had downgraded The Money Store tojunk bondstatus.  Within a day of the merger it had a solid rating.  "We will now benefit from the rating of the parent company. We are going to be in the driver's seat," Turtletaub said.[22]First Unionhad trouble integrating acquisitions,[23]and The Money Store did not prosper after the merger. At the time of the severeliquidity crisisofAugust 1998, the subprime industry imploded. The main source of funds to replenish capital and torefinance new loans,securitization, dried up. Also, the parent company revamped many of the advertising programs that had made the company so previously successful; the Money Store was soon described as barely existing in the form that it was bought in.[24]Turtletaub resigned as president and CEO in May, 1999.  By October, 1999, the deal was called a "disaster" for First Union.[25]First Union, preparing for a Wachovia merger, split The Money Store into four divisions, and transferred First Union's bad home equity loans into The Money Store'shome equitydivision.[18][26]The student loan division, Educaid, and the SBA loan division were retained by First Union.[19]
Turtletaub was a "generous donator" to federally elected officials; a friend of PresidentBill Clinton(FOB), he got to sleep in theLincoln bedroom,[27]and had a private "coffee visit" with President Clinton and SenatorChris Dodd, then chairman of theSenate Banking Committee.[28]The Money Store's use of political donations and lobbyists was described as the "classic example of the interaction of money, politics and regulation."  Competitors felt that The Money Store was treated more favorably because of its political clout, with accusations that federal rulings in its favor were "politically fixed."[29]
The Money Store was closed in July, 2000, at a loss of $1.7 billion to First Union Bank Corp.[23]
With a profit of $700 million from selling The Money Store, Turtletaub, decided to go into the film business.[30][14]He describes himself as a child of thecounter-cultureand only wants to make films he is passionate about and that have redemption, something more than entertainment. He wants to touch and change people and use his money, through film, to do good.[3]He looks forscreenplaysthat have something to say, are one of a kind,[31]touch his heart,[32]have a powerful voice, illuminate the human condition and emotional connections,[33]and are either life-affirming in some way, or life-revealing.[34]He prefersscript writersanddirectorswho are doing their first films, as he is looking for a fresh perspective.[35][36]Turtletaub's approach tofilmmakinghas been described as always "more idealistic than opportunistic."[37]Before entering the film world, Turtletaub spent almost a year meeting people in thefilm industry. He commented that he used the instincts he developed as a reporter to ask questions and learn the craft of filmmaking.[38]In 2000 he teamed withproducerDavid Friendly, formingDeep River Productions.  The original plan was to use Turtletaub's resources to buy material todevelop, then taking the properties to the studios for production. This modus operandi has been called "a recipe for disaster" and by 2005 he had scaled back and moved away from this strategy after an initial spending spree.[39]Several movies were produced by Deep River, most notablyLittle Miss Sunshine, a 2006Academy Awardnominee for best picture.  Turtletaub originally boughtMichael Arndt's repeatedly rejected script[40]for $250,000, repurchased it two years later for $400,000 and then paid the $8 million costs of production.[41]The film was a box-office success[42]andcritically acclaimed. Friendly and Turtletaub split after a six-year run.[43]
He joined withPeter Sarafin 2004 to formBig Beach Films, with Turtletaub realizing the "need to specialize."[44]He describes himself and Saraf as creative producers, involved in every stage of the filmmaking, from the original idea through the editing process.[35]They have produced over 20 movies, and, are best known forlower budgetcomedy-dramafilms,[45]such asLittle Miss SunshineandSafety Not Guaranteed.Safety Not Guaranteedhas been called "one of the most influential films of the last decade." Made in 2012 with a first-time director and writer and costing less than a million dollars, this character drivenindiecaught the eye ofNetflix, foreshadowing the role ofstreamingin film creation anddistribution.[46]Turtletaub produced the 2019SundancebreakoutThe FarewellstarringAwkwafina.[47]Critically and financially successful,[48][49]The Farewellhas been called a groundbreaking work for bringing a broad based Asian-American narrative to Hollywood, allowing members of the community "to see their own experiences and their own stories on the screen."[50]Another 2019 release wasMarielle Heller's biographical filmA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,[51]with Tom Hanks portraying Mr. Rogers.[52]The scripted drama premiered at the 2019Toronto International Film Festival; it had made the 2013Black Listof the best unproduced screenplays.[53]The story about a man dedicated to radical kindness has been viewed as a politically trenchant movie of the Trump era.[54]These two 2019 releases have been described as humanistic and life affirming.The Farewellwon the 2019Spirit Awardfor best independent feature;[55]and, the two films were nominated for a total of threeGolden Globeawards and oneAcademy Award. Turtletaub commented: "We have specific taste. People want to see stories that touch their heart. That's hard to define."[56]Documentary productions includeSeed: The Untold Story, earning him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Nature Documentary;[57][58]Sheila NevinsandDavy Rothbart's17 Blocks, the winner of multiple film festival awards;[59][60]and, an as yet untitledLed Zeppelinfeature, told in their own voices for the first time.[61]
In 2014 Turtletaub started a TV division,Big Beach TV,[62][63]which works closely with his L.A. affiliate,Beachside,[64]focusing on micro-budget features and digital content.[65]Through Big Beach TV, Turtletaub has produced theStarzdramaVidaandElizabeth Olsen's "engrossing"Sorry for Your Loss.[66][67]Vidahas been described as groundbreaking; it has the first all-Latinxwriters room on TV, with severalqueerwriters and all but one writer identifying as female.[68]It has created "a safe space for stories regarding Latinx and freedom of sexual identity." A critical and ratings success,[69]it has allowed theMexican-Americanand queer "communities to feel recognized in a way that the vast majority of television does not."[68]In 2021 Vida received anImagennomination for Best Primetime Program – Comedy.[70]Turtletaub was executive producer of the filmed version of theObieandNew York Drama Critics' Circleaward-winning Broadway playWhat the Constitution Means to Me, starringHeidi Schreck.[71]It began streaming on Amazon Prime October 16, 2020.

In February, 2022, Big Beach moved its headquarters to Los Angeles and laid off an unknown number of staff. Saraf had "quietly" left in 2021. The cuts have been described as a sign of the difficulty facing indie filmmakers, "even those with awards pedigree and decades of survival."[74]Big Beach announced in 2024 that they had fully relocated to Los Angeles, and that their filmsOut of My Mind (film)andWinner (2024 film)would premiere at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.[75]

"It’s a story about a woman who’s a mother and a wife living in suburban Connecticut, doting on her husband and her sons. And I knew that woman–it was my mother. I grew up in suburban New Jersey, and she doted on my dad and me. When I read [the screenplay], I felt like it was a story I could tell."[88]

Kingsley's performance is powerful without being loud or histrionic; he is almost always quiet, observant, and soft-spoken on the screen, and yet his performance comes across with such might that we realize, afterward, that the sheer moral force of Gandhi must have been behind the words."[28]Kingsley went on to win numerous accolades for his performance including theAcademy Award for Best Actor, theBAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Dramafor his performance.[22]The following year he acted in the British drama filmBetrayal(1983), an adaptation of the1978 play of the same titlebyHarold Pinter.

The film was based on the1975 novel of the same titleand was adapted for the screen byHarold Pinter. Sheila Benson ofThe Los Angeles Timespraised their performances writing, "No filmic cliches, no swelling musical score; these are no "littul peeple" who melt into each other's arms, but blessedly real people, who get exhausted and don't talk all the time."[31]He acted in theMerchant-Ivorycostume dramaMaurice(1987). The film was adapted from the1971 novel of the same titlebyE. M. Forster. Kingsley acted alongsideHugh Grant,Rupert Graves,Simon Callow, andDenholm Elliott.[32]He played the Russian composerDmitri ShostakovichinTestimony, and the main character of Basil Pascali inPascali's Island(1988), and went on to portrayDr. John WatsonalongsideMichael Caine'sSherlock HolmesinWithout a Cluethat year.

The film was a critical and commercial success, and Kingsley received a nomination forBAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Todd McCarthy ofVarietywrote of his performance, "Kingsley must act within much more rigid constraints as his trusted accountant Stern, a man who feels he must never make a misstep. Role is reminiscent ofAlec Guinness' deluded Col. Nicholson inThe Bridge on the River Kwai; in his compulsion to do a perfect job for Schindler, he often seems to forget that he's working for the enemy."[33]Further roles include theBBCadaptation ofSilas Marner(1985) as the titular character. Kingsley starred alongsideSigourney WeaverinRoman Polanski'sDeath and the Maiden(1994), having previously acted with her inDave.

In 1998, he was the head of the jury at the48th Berlin International Film Festivaland starred in the family filmSpooky House, saying he had chosen a role in a lighter film after acting in roles that left him feeling traumatised.[35][36]
Kingsley took on the role of Don Logan, a violent psychopath and recruiter for London's underworld, inJonathan Glazer'sSexy Beast(2000), apsychologicalblack comedycrime filmacting withRay WinstoneandIan McShane.[37]CriticPeter BradshawofThe Guardianpraised his performance writing, "The role of Don Logan is perfectly suited to Ben Kingsley's gifts for control and stillness. There is something a little baroque and stylised about his approach – it is arguably a little actorly and unlike the behaviour of any real villain. But it is a very funny, intelligent performance nonetheless, beautifully scripted and acted, and Kingsley tops it off with a bravura show of pure sociopathic cunning".[38]Kingsley's role as Logan earned him another Academy Award nomination forBest Supporting Actor. A year later, he won aCrystal Globeaward for having an outstanding artistic contribution toworld cinemaat theKarlovy Vary International Film Festival.[39]In 2003 he portrayed Colonel Massoud Amir Behrani in theVadim PerelmandirectedHouse of Sand and Fogacting oppositeJennifer ConnellyandShohreh Aghdashloo.

He starred alongsidePenélope Cruz,Peter Sarsgaard,Patricia Clarkson, andDennis Hopper.[44]CriticRoger Ebertwrote of the film and his performance, "Ben Kingsley, who can play just about any role, seems to be especially effective playing slimy intellectuals. "Elegy" is a film that could have been made for him, although by the time it's over, Penélope Cruz has slipped away with it, and transformed Kingsley's character in the process. It's nicely done."[45]Kingsley received a nomination for theLondon Film Critics Circle Awardfor Best British Actor of the Year.[46]

First coming to prominence as an original cast member on the hit TV comedy seriesSaturday Night Livein 1975, she went on to win back-to-backEmmy Awardsfor Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series on the 1980s sitcomKate & Allieportraying the role of Allison "Allie" Lowell. Curtin later starred in the hit series3rd Rock from the Sun(1996–2001), playing the role ofDr. Mary Albright.
Curtin has also appeared in many movie roles, includingCharleneinThe Librarianseries of movies (2004–2008). She reprised one of herSaturday Night Livecharacters, Prymaat (Clorhone) Conehead, in the 1993 filmConeheads. She is sometimes referred to as the "Queen ofDeadpan".[2]The Philadelphia Inquireronce called her a "refreshing drop of acid".[3]She was included on a 1986 list of the "Top Prime Time Actors and Actresses of All Time".[4]
Jane Therese Curtin was born inCambridge, Massachusetts,[5]one of four  children born to Mary Constance (née Farrell) and John Joseph Curtin, who owned an insurance agency.[6]Her maternal ancestry is Irish,[7]and her paternal, Curtin, ancestry is also Irish, originally from Newmarket-on-Fergus,County Clare. Curtin has one younger brother, Larry Curtin, who lives in South Florida;[8]and an older brother, John J. "Jack" Curtin (d.2008).[9]Her younger sister, Virginia (Ginny), died in 2001. Curtin is a cousin of actress and writerValerie Curtin. Her uncle was the radio personality Joseph Curtin.
She was raised Roman Catholic, and grew up inWellesley, Massachusetts. She graduated fromNewton Country Day School of the Sacred HeartinNewtonin 1965. Curtin earned an associate degree fromElizabeth Seton Junior Collegein New York City, class of 1967.[10]She then attendedNortheastern Universityfrom 1967 to 1968 before dropping out of college to pursue a career in comedy.[5]
She has served as a U.S. Committee National Ambassador forUNICEF. In 1968, Curtin decided to pursue comedy as a career and dropped out of college. She joined a comedy group, The Proposition, and performed with them until 1972. She starred inPretzels, an off-Broadway play written by Curtin,John Forster,Judith Kahan, andFred Grandy, in 1974.
One of the originalNot Ready For Prime Time PlayersofNBC'sSaturday Night Live(1975), Curtin remained on the show through the 1979–1980 season. Guest hostEric Idlesaid that Curtin was "very much a 'Let's come in, let's know our lines, let's do it properly, and go' ... She was very sensible, very focused", and disliked the drug culture in which many of the cast participated. Show writerAl Frankenstated that she "was so steady. Had a really strong moral center, and as such was disgusted by much of the show and the people around it".[11]
On the show, and mirroring her own low-key real life, she frequently playedstraight-womancharacters, often as afoiltoJohn BelushiandGilda Radner. Curtin anchoredSNL's "Weekend Update" segment from 1976 to 1977, paired withDan Aykroydfrom 1977 to 1978 andBill Murrayfrom 1978 to 1980. On occasional "Weekend Update" segments, her newscaster character served as a foil to Belushi, who often gave a rambling and out-of-control "commentary" on events of the day. During these sketches, she timidly tried to get Belushi to come to the point, which would only make him angrier. Curtin's newscaster also introduced baseball expertChico Escuela(Garrett Morris), a heavily accentedDominican, who started his sketches by saying, "Thank you,Hane", before repeating his famous catchphrase, "Baseball been bery, bery good to me!" She also introducedRoseanne Roseannadanna(Radner) and would listen in exasperated silence at Roseannadanna's disjointed commentary before ultimately cutting her off.  In addition, she sang in the "Chevy's Girls" sketch in season two, episode two, alongsideLaraine Newmanand Radner, and sang again with Newman and Radner as a trio backing up Morris as he sang the song Three Little Words for the cold opening of the Season 4 premier episode.
In a parody of the "Point-Counterpoint" segment of the news program60 Minutes, Curtin delivered a controlled liberal viewpoint (à laShana Alexander) vs. Aykroyd, who (in the manner ofJames J. Kilpatrick) epitomized theright-wingview, albeit with an over-the-top "attack" journalist slant. Curtin presented theliberal"Point" portion first. Then Aykroyd presented the "Counterpoint" portion, sometimes beginning with the statement, "Jane, you ignorantslut," to which she replied, "Dan, you pompous ass." The recurring segment has been discussed in an article on "How to Respectfully Disagree" inThe Chronicle of Higher Education.[12]
Curtin is also well known for her role in theConeheadsketches as Prymaat (wife/mother of the Conehead family), and as Enid Loopner (in sketches with Radner and Murray). She is one of many cast members who appear in the retrospective compilation DVDThe Women of SNL(2010, 97 minutes).[13]

Later, she was part of the cast of3rd Rock from the Sun(1996–2001) playing a human,Dr. Mary Albright, opposite the alien family composed ofJohn Lithgow,Kristen Johnston,French Stewart, andJoseph Gordon-Levitt. As withSNL, her mostly strait-laced character was often confounded by the zany and whimsical antics of the Solomon family.
In 1997, Curtin narrated two episodes of the documentary television seriesUnderstanding,[14]and she has done voice work forRecessandCyberchase. She guest starred onSesame Streetin 1985.
Curtin also starred withFred Savagein theABCsitcomCrumbs, which debuted in January 2006 and was cancelled in May of that year. She also guest-starred onGary Unmarriedas Connie, Allison's mother.[15]In 2012, she joinedUnforgettableas Dr. Joanne Webster, a gifted but crustymedical examiner; in 2014, she occasionally reprised her role as the first Guardian onThe Librarians. In 2020, she had a co-starring role as a quirky mother-in-law on the ABC sitcomUnited We Fall.
In 1980, Curtin starred with Susan Saint James and Jessica Lange in the moderate hitHow to Beat the High Cost of Living. In 1993, Curtin and Dan Aykroyd were reunited inConeheads, a full-length motion picture based on their popularSNLcharacters.

People do find Felicia evil. I think she's just determined. She's a zealot pursuing an objective that no-one wants her to pursue. And it makes her really eccentric. And even though a man she's pursuing is the one who committed murder, he's only considered creepy by people and Felicia is always considered evil. I think that's so interesting because he's really the bad person. She's just trying to get him caught. But she is extreme. I think she doesn't stop when others would. She keeps on, she keeps pursuing and I think that is a scary thing. She just keeps scraping away until she eventually gets what she wants. And if she doesn't get it one way, she'll go around and do it another way. She's completely unapologetic about it. She doesn't care what anybody else thinks.[10]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
