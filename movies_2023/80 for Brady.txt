Elderly best friends Lou, Trish, Maura, and Betty are massive fans of theNew England Patriots, particularly the team's starquarterbackTom Brady, having become fans in 2001 while celebrating Lou's successful completion ofchemotherapy. 15 years later, the four women are celebrating the Patriots' victory over thePittsburgh Steelersin theAFC Championship Gameand make plans for theSuper Bowl LIwatch party.
The friends enter a competition for free tickets to the Super Bowl inHoustonby sharing the stories of their Patriots fandom; Lou later announces their win and they prepare for their trip. On the day of their flight, the others break a sleeping Maura out of her retirement home (she had accidentally taken the wrong medication) with help from her fellow resident, Mickey.
In Houston, they go to theSuper Bowl Experience, where Betty wins a chicken wing eating contest hosted byGuy Fieri, but loses the tickets. Trish meets former NFL player Dan O'Callahan and they are mutually attracted, but she is uncertain as she has not had a very successful love life. He invites her to a party, and the women decide to go upon learning about the loss of the tickets, as Fieri will also be there.
At the party, the women are givencannabis edibleswhich severely disorient them. Maura joins in on a game of poker in order to potentially buy new tickets, only to learn that the game is for charity; she gives her winnings to the charity of her top competitor, Gugu. Unable to find Fieri, the foursome return to their hotel.
The next day, the women go back to the Super Bowl Experience but find it has closed down. They then go to thetailgate partiesaroundNRG Stadiumto see if they can buy scalped tickets, but cannot afford them. Trish finds the radio hosts they won the tickets from and brings up the situation to them, but they are confused as they gave their tickets to a different group.
Betty finds Fieri at the tailgate and recovers the bag with the tickets but when the women attempt to enter the stadium, the security guards reveal that the tickets are fake. Lou confesses that she bought the "tickets" online for an exorbitant price, as she wanted to have one last fun memory with her friends as she fears that her cancer may have returned.
The other women console her and agree that even if they could not make it into the game, they are satisfied with all of their other memories. They run into Gugu, who sneaks them in under the guise of being backup dancers forLady Gaga's halftime performance out of gratitude for Maura's actions the previous night.
They then run into Dan who invites them into his box suite as his guests. Concerned as they watch theAtlanta Falconsbuild a 28–3 lead over the Patriots, they sneak into the Patriots coordinators' booth. Betty hijacks the defensive coordinator's headset and gives him a playcall which leads to asack, while Lou talks to Brady and gives him an inspirational message.
The four return to their box suite and watch as Brady leads the Patriots to a victory. Maura reveals she made back the money Lou spent on the fake tickets by making a bet on the Patriots winning with the suite owner. The women are approached by security and escorted to the Patriots' locker room, and then thanked by the players for their dedication.

Sarah Haskins(born August 3, 1979) is an American comedian known for her satire about gender stereotypes in the media.
A native ofChicago, Illinois, Haskins attendedFrancis W. Parker Schoolin Chicago'sLincoln Park.[1]A 2001 graduate ofHarvard College, she was also a member of the improv comedy troupeThe Immediate Gratification Players.[2]
Once, when I was about eleven and my sister was eight, we were going on a camping trip. The day of the trip, in the car, on the way, I got scared and started trying to back out of the trip saying I don't want to go. And my Mom, turned around in her seat and yelled "YOU'RE GOING! YOU COME FROM A LINE OF STRONG WOMEN!" And I think that attitude's infected me. There are also strong women in the industry, and a lot of them have been very helpful to me – so, I have a positive attitude right now. I want to do stuff, and I don't want anyone to stop me.[3]
When asked if she is a feminist: "Yes, I’m a feminist. It is an extension of my lifelong war against pantyhose. To me it means that as women we are individuals before we are gendered people and that we’re not defined by our gender except in the ways we chose to appropriate that definition. We’re in a weird generation, right? Our moms were forced to grapple with that definition more immediately, and I think it’s changed as we’ve grown up. The core issue 'how do I fight bias against me because of my gender' is still there but has gotten more complicated and wrapped into all kinds of identity issues about how you present yourself as a woman and I pretty much think it's your choice. And fuck pantyhose."[4]
A self-described liberal and feminist,[4]she has spoken in interviews about the many traditional and new roles that women of the modern world are expected to fulfill: taking on new roles as career women and as financially independent individuals while still adhering to antiquated stereotypes about an ideal woman and her role in a traditional society.[5]
Haskins majored in American history and literature at Harvard University. While at Harvard she began improvising with a group called IGP or "the Immediate Gratification Players." This inspired her interest in comedy. "Freshman year of college I saw a show at Second City calledThe Psychopath Not Taken. I loved it—I was doing improv at the time at school with a great group called IGP—and Psychopath expanded my sense of what comedy could do. It was funny, smart, and important.”[4]
Haskins was an improvisational and sketch comedy performer at I.O. (ImprovOlympic) Chicago as well as with theSecond CityNational Touring Company for six years before moving to California.[6]She lists her influences and heroes as "Chicago,Katharine Graham,Tina Fey, improvisation,Francis Parker".[6]
In October 2007, she relocated to Los Angeles, where she currently resides.[2]She worked as a full-time writer forCurrent TVand a regular contributor to the weekly seriesInfoManiaon Current, a network co-founded by former Vice PresidentAl Gore. Haskins wrote and starred in the InfoMania segment "Target Women" in which she commented on products, advertising, and media aimed at women. Segment topics have included: wedding shows, jewelry, cleaning supplies,Sarah Palinand the "lady vote",Twilight, cars andThe View. The show’s first episode, "Target Women: Yogurt", was an online hit.
Her comedy led to interviews with The Rumpus,[7]Mother Jones,[8]Jezebel,[3]and The Paper Machete.[9]Utne Reader named her one of "50 Visionaries Who Are Changing The World".[10]
In January 2010, Haskins parted ways with Current TV, leaving her central role in the Target Women segment behind.[3]After InfoMania, Haskins andEmily Halpernco-wrote the short filmDILF.[11][12]Haskins also co-starred in the short filmsThe Cat Whisperer[13]andHow To Be Sexy.[14]
Despite positive reviews by critics,[15]Haskins' sitcom projectTrophy Wifeaired for one season on ABC before being canceled.[16][17]Haskins and Emily Halpern co-wrote the 2019 filmBooksmart.
Haskins married writer Geoffrey Edwards, son ofBlake Edwardsand stepson ofJulie Andrews, on August 6, 2010,[18]and gave birth to a child in December 2010.[19][20]

Tomlin characters
In 1969, after a stint as a hostess on theABCseriesMusic Scene,[13]Tomlin joined NBC'ssketch comedyshowRowan and Martin's Laugh-In.  Signed as a replacement for the departingJudy Carne, Tomlin was an instant success on the already established program, in which in addition to appearing in general sketches and delivering comic gags, she began appearing as the regular characters she created; they became well known and she portrayed them outside of the show in later recordings and television specials:
Tomlin was one of the first female comedians to break out in male drag with her characters Tommy Velour and Rick. In 1982, but later popularized by aSaturday Night Liveappearance on January 22, 1983, she premieredPurvis Hawkins, a black rhythm-and-blues soul singer (patterned afterLuther Vandross), with a mustache, beard, and close-croppedafrohairstyle, dressed in a three-piece suit. Tomlin used very little, if any, skin-darkening cosmetics as part of the character, instead depending on stage lighting to create the effect.
In 1970,AT&Toffered Tomlin $500,000 to play her character Ernestine in a commercial, but she declined, saying it would compromise her artistic integrity.[15][16]In 1976, she appeared onSaturday Night Live[17]as Ernestine in aMa Belladvertisement parody in which she proclaimed, "We don't care, we don't have to...we're the phone company." The character later made a guest appearance atThe Superhighway SummitatUCLAon January 11, 1994, interrupting a speech being given on theinformation superhighwayby then-Vice PresidentAl Gore. She appeared as three of her minor characters in a 1998 ad campaign forFidelity Investmentsthat did not include Ernestine or Edith Ann.[16]In 2003, she made two commercials as an "updated" Ernestine forWebEx.[18]Tomlin brought Edith Ann to the forefront again in the 1990s with three animated prime-time television specials.

When theMiami New Timesasked Tomlin about the videos, she responded, "I love David. There was a lot of pressure in making the movie—even the way it came out you could see it was a very free-associative, crazy movie, and David was under a tremendous amount of pressure. And he's a very free-form kind of guy anyway."[22]

I certainly never called a press conference or anything like that. [Back in the 1970s,] people didn't write about it. Even if they knew, they would [refer to Jane as] "Lily's collaborator", things like that. Some journalists are just motivated by their own sense of what they want to say or what they feel comfortable saying or writing about. In '77, I was on the cover ofTime. The same week I had a big story inNewsweek. In one of the magazines it says I live alone, and the other magazine said I live with Jane Wagner. Unless you were so really adamantly out, and had made some declaration at some press conference, people back then didn't write about your relationship. In '75 I was making theModern Screamalbum and Jane and I were in the studio. My publicist called me and said, "Timewill give you the cover if you'll come out." I was more offended than anything that they thought we'd make a deal. But that was '75—it would have been a hard thing to do at that time.[32]
Tomlin stated in 2008, "Everybody in the industry was certainly aware of my sexuality and of Jane ... in interviews, I always reference Jane and talk about Jane, but they don't always write about it."[33]In 2015, Tomlin said, "I wasn't totally forthcoming. Everybody in the business knew I was gay, and certainly everybody I worked with and everything like that." Tomlin has been generally quiet about her sexuality.[34]On December 31, 2013, Tomlin and Wagner married in a private ceremony in Los Angeles after 42 years together.[35][36]
Tomlin has been involved in a number offeministand gay-friendly film productions, and on her 1975 albumModern Screamshe pokes fun atstraightactors who make a point of distancing themselves from their gay and lesbian characters—answering the pseudo-interview question, she replies: "How did it feel to play a heterosexual? I've seen these women all my life, I know how they walk, I know how they talk ..."[10]In 2013, Tomlin and Wagner worked together on the filmAn Apology to Elephants, which Wagner wrote and Tomlin narrated.[37]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
