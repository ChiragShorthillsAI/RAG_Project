Brian Godlock is an electrician living a happy life in the fictional town of Las Palomas,Texaswith his wife Saya and young son Taylor Michael. OnChristmas Evein 2021, Brian and Taylor are using a new bicycle on their front lawn. They are caught in the crossfire of adrive-by shootingin the middle of a gang war and Taylor is killed. Brian immediately tries to catch and kill the gangsters only for Playa, the leader of one of the gangs, to shoot him in the throat and leave him for dead. Brian survives, but hisvocal cordshave been severely damaged. Brian and Saya grieve over Taylor's death and Saya tries to be emotionally supportive to Brian during his physical recovery, but Brian becomes cold and distant, focused only on pursuing revenge for Taylor.
Saya becomes emotionally overwhelmed and leaves Brian, who plans to kill all the gang members involved in Taylor's death on Christmas Eve in 2022. Over the course of the next year, Brian engages in bodybuilding, familiarizing himself with deadly weaponry and self-defense training. At one point, Brian appears to attempt to visit Detective Dennis Vassel, who offered to help in his son's case. Brian instead uses this opportunity to gather information on Playa's gang and begins reconnaissance on them, collecting evidence that will help put them away. Saya attempts to contact Brian, expressing that she and his parents are worried about him, but he continues to ignore her text messages. Brian attacks and abducts a member of Playa's gang, threatening him in an attempt to provide written information on the gang's activity.
The thug briefly manages to escape only for Brian to subdue him in a fight. Brian delivers the bound thug to Vassel's house, along with a Christmas card, containing his intent to kill Playa and his gang, and athumb drivewith the evidence he has collected, along with the thug's written contributions to his information. He also sends two of the thug's amputated fingers to Playa, intimidating him. Brian spends the entire night of Christmas Eve 2022 killing the members of Playa's gang one by one, often interrupting their crimes in the process. After stealing a cell phone from a thug and using it to record a video of him being killed and sending it to Playa, the gang leader sends a group text for his soldiers to meet him at his place. Brian takes the opportunity to trap and kill them all there.
After a massive gunfight and fistfight bloodbath as he fights his way to Playa, Brian finds himself confronted by Vassel. Initially pointing their guns at one another, both silently put them down and agree to work as a team to finish off Playa. Playa's drug-addicted girlfriend manages to get the drop on them, shooting them both, only for Brian to sneak around and hold her at gunpoint. She drops her gun and feigns surrender. When Brian hesitates to kill her, Playa's girlfriend unveils a hidden sidearm and attacks him with it. Brian manages to kill her and confronts Playa. In the shootout between them, Playa manages to get the upper hand and is about to fatally shoot Brian, but Vassel shoots Playa, allowing Brian to finish him off.
Brian and Vassel fall to the floor bleeding, looking up at the ceiling and Christmas decorations. Brian sees reflections of his memories of his time with Taylor and hallucinates analternate future, where he and Taylor are both still alive. Saya opens a letter that Brian wrote to her, where Brian apologizes for how cold he has become in their marriage and thanks her for loving him. Brian further admits that he knows no one can make Taylor's death right, but that he is willing to die trying. Saya takes the letter to Taylor's grave, where Brian had earlier brought his previously unopened Christmas present (a toy train set) that he built and set up around his grave.
In October 2021,Silent Nightwas first announced as anaction filmwithout spoken dialogue, withJohn Wooas director andJoel Kinnamanas lead star.[4][5]In March 2022, a special effects assistant was injured during pre-production in a stunt trial run inMexico City. The crew member was hit by a car, breaking his femur and dislocating his shoulder.[6]In April 2022,Kid Cudi,Harold Torres, andCatalina Sandino Morenowere added to the cast.[7]Principal photographybegan in April 2022 in Mexico City.[7]Filming wrapped on May 17, 2022.[8][9]Marco Beltramicomposed the film's score.[10]
"The whole movie is without dialogue. It allowed me to use visuals to tell the story, to tell how the character feels. We are using music instead of language. And the movie is all about sight and sound. The budget was a little tight, and the schedule was tight, but it made me change my working style. Usually, for a big movie, a studio movie, we shoot a lot of coverage, then leave it to the cutting room. But in this movie, I tried to combine things without doing any coverage shots. I had to force myself to use a new kind of technique. Some scenes were about two or three pages, but I did it all in one shot".
In March 2023, producer Erica Lee confirmed the film features no dialogue, explaining "It really has no dialogue. It was another spec script that I was given and read, and I was like, 'This is either going to be a genius move or a disaster, there's no in between.' It's execution dependent for sure. I mean, John Woo kills it. Joel Kinnaman is the star and really delivers. I mean, there's some ambient noise and background and chatter like radio and stuff like that. But, yeah, it's awesome. I can't wait for you to see it."[12]
Woo decided to film the action in a more realistic manner that supports the emotional drama instead of having the action itself being the entertaining aspect, which was signature of his previous films.[13]For the film, Kinnaman decided to try method acting for the first time and stop speaking for the entirety of the shoot. The lack of communication left the actor feeling lonely, and after multiple start attempts, he decided that the silent car ride to his first day on set was long enough to get him excited for the film.[14]
In September 2023, it was announced thatLionsgatehad acquired the distribution rights for the film. The film was theatrically released on December 1, 2023.[15]
Silent Nightwas released for digital platforms on December 19, 2023, followed by aBlu-ray,DVDand4K UHDrelease on January 30, 2024.[16]
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongsideRenaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,Godzilla Minus One, andThe Shift, and was originally projected to gross $6–8 million from 1,870 theatres in its opening weekend.[17]After making $1 million on its first day (including $250,000 from Thursday night previews), estimates were lowered to $2–3 million. It went on to debut to $3 million, finishing ninth.[18]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 59% of 120 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's consensus reads: "Silent Nightreaffirms that an action movie doesn't need much dialogue if the set pieces are solid enough—and that even second-tier John Woo can be worth the price of admission."[19]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 53 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[20]Audiences surveyed byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "C" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled byPostTrakgave it a 67% overall positive score, with 38% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[18]
David Ehrlich ofIndieWirepanned the film, grading it a "D" and stating that "the kindest thing I can say about [John Woo's] latest film[...] is that its worst moments don't resemble the cinema of John Woo at all".[21]Kyle Smith ofThe Wall Street Journalcriticized the decision to have no dialogue in the film, stating that the result is "surprisingly dull".[22]
Peter Debruge ofVarietywrote, "Silly as it might be,Silent Nightgives audiences reason to get excited about the Hong Kong innovator once again, ranking as one of the few bloody ChristmascounterprogrammerssinceDie Hardthat feels worthy of repeat viewing down the road".[23]Frank ScheckofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote, "It's to Woo's and screenwriter Robert Lynn's credit, as well the fiercely commanding, intensely physical performance by Kinnaman, that the film's lack of dialogue proves not a gimmick but an asset. Norma Desmond would surely have approved". He noted the film's highlight was "not one of many lavishly staged gun battles, but an intensely brutal, lengthy hand-to-hand combat between Brian and one of Playa's minions that makes the classic fight scene in Hitchcock'sTorn Curtainseem like a schoolyard tussle".[24]
Glenn KennyofThe New York Timespraised the film for its well-crafted and brutal action scenes, stating that "there’s a lot of sound and fury and it works: This is suspenseful and cathartic, and even the schmaltzy stuff is so distinctly John Woo that it’s welcome."[25]Matt Zoller SeitzofRogerEbert.comgave the film a score of four out of four stars, considering it to be among the best films directed by Woo and "one of the most deliriously cinematic movies of the year". He emphasized that with Woo's bold yet elegant editing style, "[t]he cliches of the action/revenge movie ultimately stop seeming merely familiar and begin to feel ritualistic", and stated, "Movies like this don't work unless the people who made them aren't afraid to risk going too far[....] Sometimes, if they keep pushing and pushing, they overcome any supposed rational objections the viewer might have, and there's a breakthrough. The floodgates open, and the feeling that pours forth is magnificent, rare, and sublime".[26]
In 2024, film critic Scout Tafoya, a colleague of Seitz on RogerEbert.com, includedSilent Nightin his video series "The Unloved", where he expressed disappointment in how "very few people seemed willing to engage with the visual language of the movie." He reasoned that "Woo relied purely on his chops as an imagemaker to tell the story ofSilent Night, an admittedly simplistic, perhaps too contemporary story of revenge modelled on the more popular, retrograde version of action cinema from the last 20 years." Tafoya summarized that "As a work of incredibly intelligent visuals, of storytelling without a spoken word, this is a triumph. And as a John Woo film it's an instant classic to rank among his best..."[27]

John Woo Yu-senSBS(Chinese:吳宇森; born 22 September 1946)[1]is aHong Kongfilm director known as a highly influential figure in theaction filmgenre.[2]The recipient of various accolades, including aHong Kong Film AwardforBest Picture,Best Director, andBest Editing, as well as aGolden Horse Award, anAsia Pacific Screen Awardand aSaturn Award, he is regarded as a pioneer ofheroic bloodshedfilms and thegun fugenre inHong Kong action cinema. He is known for his highly chaotic "bullet ballet"[3][4]action sequences, stylized imagery,Mexican standoffs, frequent use ofslow motionand allusions towuxia,film noirandWesterncinema.[5]
Considered one of the major figures ofHong Kong cinema, Woo has directed several notableaction films. He is known for his collaborations with actorChow Yun-fatin five Hong Kong action films:A Better Tomorrow(1986), which made Chow a box-office superstar in Asia,[6]A Better Tomorrow II(1987),The Killer(1989),Once a Thief(1991), andHard Boiled(1992). He has also directedmartial arts filmssuch asThe Dragon Tamers(1975),Hand of Death(1976), andLast Hurrah for Chivalry(1979), and action comedies such asFollow the Star(1978),From Riches to Rags(1980),Run, Tiger, Run(1984), andOnce a Thief(1991).
Hard Target(1993), starringJean-Claude Van Damme, was his American directorial debut, and the first major Hollywood film made by a Chinese director. His other Hollywood films includeBroken Arrow(1996),Face/Off(1997) andMission: Impossible 2(2000).[5]He made his Canadian debut with the action comedy filmOnce a Thief(1996), which is a remake of Woo's 1991 film of the same name. He continued to be active in Hong Kong cinema, directing films such as the two-part historical epicThe Crossing(2014). His first Chinese-language feature sinceHard Boiled(1992) was the internationally co-producedRed Cliff(2008-2009),[5][7]which broke theChinese box office recordpreviously held byTitanicin mainland China.[8]
Woo is the creator of the comic seriesSeven Brothers, published byVirgin Comics. He is the founder and chairman of the production companyLion Rock Productions.[9]
Woo was born as Wu Yu-seng (Ng Yu-sum in Cantonese) on 22 September 1946, inGuangzhou, China, amidst the chaoticChinese Civil War. Due to school age restrictions, his mother changed his birth date to 22 September 1948, which is what remains on his passport. The Woo family, who wereProtestant Christians, faced persecution duringMao Zedong's early anti-bourgeois purges after thecommunist revolution in China, and fled toHong Kongwhen he was five.[1][10]: xv, 3
Impoverished, the Woo family lived in the slums atShek Kip Mei. His father was a teacher, though rendered unable to work bytuberculosis, and his mother was a manual laborer on construction sites.[11]The family was rendered homeless by theShek Kip Mei Fireof 1953.[10]Charitable donations from disaster relief efforts enabled the family to relocate; however, violent crime had by then become commonplace in Hong Kong housing projects. At age three he was diagnosed with a serious medical condition. Following surgery on his spine, he was unable to walk correctly until eight years old, and as a result his right leg is shorter than his left leg.[12]
His Christian upbringing shows influences in his films.[13]As a young boy, Woo had wanted to be a Christian minister. He later found a passion for movies influenced by theFrench New WaveespeciallyJean-Pierre Melville. Woo has said he was shy and had difficulty speaking, but found making movies a way to explore his feelings and thinking and would "use movies as a language".[5]
Woo found respite inBob Dylanand in AmericanWesterns.[14]He has stated the final scene ofButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kidmade a particular impression on him in his youth: the device of two comrades, each of whom fire pistols from each hand, is a recurrent spectacle later found in his own work.[15]
In 1969, Woo was hired as a script supervisor atCathay Studios. In 1971, he became anassistant directoratShaw Studios.[16]The same year, he watchedBruce Lee'sThe Big Boss, which left a strong impression on him due to how different it was from earliermartial arts films. Lee's films inspired Woo to direct his ownaction films.[16]Woo worked as assistant director for some films directed by Chang Cheh during the 1970s, and took inspiration from Cheh's work.[17]His directorial debut in 1974 was the feature filmThe Young Dragons(鐵漢柔情,Tiě hàn róu qíng).[18]In thekung fu filmgenre, it was choreographed byJackie Chan.[19]The film was picked up byGolden Harvest Studio, where he went on to direct more martial arts films. He later had success as a comedy director withMoney Crazy(發錢寒,Fā qián hàn) (1977), starring Hong Kong comedianRicky HuiandRichard Ng.[20]
By the mid-1980s, Woo was experiencingoccupational burnout. Several of his films were commercial disappointments, and he felt a distinct lack of creative control. It was during this period of self-imposed exile that director/producerTsui Harkprovided the funding for Woo to film a longtime pet project,A Better Tomorrow(1986). The story of two brothers—one a law enforcement officer, the other a criminal—was a financialblockbuster.A Better Tomorrowbecame a defining achievement inHong Kong action cinema[21]
John Woo: Interviewsincludes a 36-page interview with Woo by editorRobert K. Elder, which documents the years 1968 to 1990. It includes Woo's early career in working on comedies, his work on kung fu films (during which time he gaveJackie Chanone of his first major film roles), and more recently, his gunpowder morality plays in Hong Kong.[22]
An émigré in 1993, the director experienced difficulty in cultural adjustment while contracted withUniversal Studiosto directJean-Claude Van DammeinHard Target. Like other foreign national film directors confronted with the Hollywood environment, Woo was unaccustomed to pervasive management concerns over matters such as limitations on violence and completion schedules. When initial cuts failed to yield an"R" rated film, the studio assumed control of the project and edited footage to produce a cut "suitable for American audiences".
A three-year hiatus saw Woo next directJohn TravoltaandChristian SlaterinBroken Arrow.A frenetic chase-themed film, the director once again found himself hampered by studio management and editorial concerns. Despite a larger budget than his previousHard Target,the final feature lacked the trademark Woo style. Public reception saw modest financial success.
Reluctant to pursue projects which would necessarily entail front-office controls, the director cautiously rejected the script forFace/Offseveral times until it was rewritten to suit him. (The futuristic setting was changed to a contemporary one.)Paramount Picturesalso offered the director significantly more freedom to exercise his speciality: emotional characterisation and elaborate action. A complex story of adversaries—each of whom surgically alters their identity—law enforcement agentJohn Travoltaand terroristNicolas Cageplay a cat-and-mouse game, trapped in each other's outward appearance.Face/Offopened in 1997 to critical acclaim and strong attendance. Grosses in the United States exceeded $100 million.Face/Offwas also nominated for anAcademy Awardin the categorySound Effects Editing(Mark Stoeckinger) at the70th Academy Awards.
Around this period, Woo would also produce and direct several film and TV projects. In 1996, Woo produced and directedOnce a Thief, a Canadianmade-for-televisionremake of Woo's 1991 caper film. The teleplay subsequently spawned atelevision seriesof the same name, which Woo executive produced.  In 1998, Woo directedBlackjack, which featuredDolph Lundgrenas aleukophobicbodyguard who hunts down an assassin. The film was intended as abackdoor pilotfor a television series, but was not picked up. That same year, Woo served as executive producer and action choreographer onAntoine Fuqua's directorial debutThe Replacement Killers, which featuredChow Yun-Fat's first international starring role.
Later, Woo directedMission: Impossible 2, the second entry in theTom Cruise-ledaction film series. Despite receiving mixed reviews,Mission: Impossible 2grossed over $549 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2000,[23]as well as of Woo's career.[24]
Woo made two additional films in Hollywood:Windtalkers(2002) andPaycheck(2003), both of which fared poorly at the box office and were summarily dismissed by critics. Also in 2003, Woo directed a television pilot entitledThe Robinsons: Lost in Spacefor The WB Television Network, based on the 1960s television seriesLost in Space. The pilot was not purchased.
Woo also directed and produced the 2007 video gameStranglehold, which is a sequel to his 1992 film,Hard Boiled. The game features Woo as a multiplayer playable character. That same year he produced theanimemovie,Appleseed: Ex Machina, the sequel toShinji Aramaki's2004 filmAppleseed.[25]
In 2008, Woo returned to Asian cinema with the completion of the two-partepicwar filmRed Cliff, based on a historical battle fromRecords of the Three Kingdoms. Produced on a grand scale, it is his first film in China since he emigrated from Hong Kong to the United States in 1993. Part 1 of the film was released throughout Asia in July 2008, to generally favourable reviews and strong attendance. Part 2 was released in China in January 2009.
John Woo was presented with aGolden Lionaward for lifetime achievement at theVenice Film Festivalin 2010.[26]At this time, Woo also served as co-director and producer of the 2010wuxiafilmReign of Assassins, starringMichelle Yeoh.
He followedRed Cliffwith another two-part film,The Crossing, in 2014 and 2015. Featuring an all-star cast, the four-hour epic tells the parallel stories of several characters who all ultimately find themselves passengers on the doomedTaipingsteamer, which sank in 1949 en route from mainland China to Taiwan and has been described as "China'sTitanic".
Following the box-office disappointment ofThe Crossing, Woo and producerTerence ChangdisbandedLion Rock Productions.[27]
Woo followed upThe CrossingwithManhunt, a remake of the 1976 Japanese crime thrillerof the same name. Production started onManhuntin June 2016 inOsaka[28]and later reported to be finished filming by the end of November.[28][29]The film, co-led by Chinese actorZhang Hanyuand Japanese actorMasaharu Fukuyama, features a large Japanese cast includingYasuaki Kurata,Jun Kunimura,Hiroyuki Ikeuchi,Nanami Sakuraba,Naoto TakenakaandTao Okamoto.[28]In addition, Chinese actressQi Wei, Korean actressHa Ji-wonand Woo's daughter Angeles were cast in key roles in the film.[28]The film was released in China on 24 November 2017.[30][31][28]
Following another hiatus, Woo returned to Hollywood to direct the action thrillerSilent Night, where a normal father heads into the underworld to avenge his young son's death. Produced byBasil Iwanyk, the film starredJoel Kinnamanand was told entirely without dialogue.[32]It was Woo's first American feature film sincePaycheck(2003).[33]
Woo commented in 2015 that he would remakeThe Killerfor American audiences. Initially, actressLupita Nyong'ohad been cast for the lead role,[34]however by March 2023,Nathalie Emmanuelwas cast instead,[35]withOmar Syjoining the film as the cop character.[36]The film was directed by Woo, produced byUniversal Studiosand released exclusively onPeacock.[37]
In September 2024, Woo's official Instagram account and the social media accounts of the duoSparksall posted a photo of Woo with membersRonandRussell Mael,[38]strongly hinting at collaborating on a "new project" which would not be an action film.[39]The hashtag #xcrucior points to a musical Sparks have been developing withFocus Featuresas their follow-up toAnnetteand sought a director for. Woo has previously tried to get musical projects in production,[40]and shares a love of French cinema andJaques Demy'sThe Umbrellas of Cherbourgwith the Mael brothers.[41]He later confirmed it to be a "half-musical".[42]
In May 2008, Woo announced in Cannes that his next movie would be1949, an epic love story set between the end of World War II andChinese Civil Wartothe founding of the People's Republic of China, the shooting of which would take place in China and Taiwan. Its production was due to begin by the end of 2008, with a theatrical release planned in December 2009. However, in early April 2009, the film was cancelled due to script right issues. Reports indicated that Woo might be working on another World War II film, this time about theAmerican Volunteer Group, or theFlying Tigers. The movie was tentatively titled "Flying Tiger Heroes" and Woo is reported as saying it will feature "The most spectacular aerial battle scenes ever seen in Chinese cinema." It was not clear whether Woo would not be directing the earlier war film, or whether it was put on the back burner. Woo has stated that Flying Tiger Heroes would be an "extremely important production" and will "emphasise US-Chinese friendship and the contributions of the Flying Tigers and the Yunnan people during the war of resistance."[43]Woo has announced he will be usingIMAXcameras to film theFlying Tigersproject. "It has always been a dream of mine to explore shooting with IMAX cameras and to work in the IMAX format, and the strong visual element of this film is incredibly well-suited to the tastes of cinemagoers today [...] Using IMAX for Flying Tigers would create a new experience for the audience, and I think it would be another breakthrough for Chinese movies".[44]
Woo has been married to Annie Woo Ngau Chun-lung since 1976. They have two daughters,  Kimberley Woo, Angeles Woo, and a son Frank Woo.[10]He is aChristianand toldBBCin an interview that he believes in God and has utmost admiration forJesus, whom he calls a "great philosopher".[5]
His three favorite films areDavid Lean'sLawrence of Arabia,Akira Kurosawa'sSeven SamuraiandJean-Pierre Melville'sLe Samouraï.[5]A complete list of his 48 inspirational films was published in May 2018.[41]As of July 2024, Woo is the only filmmaker who has listedThe Bridge on the River KwaibyDavid LeanandZorba the GreekbyMichael Cacoyannisas favorites on LaCinetek, a French website that collects and publishes lists from film directors.[45]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
