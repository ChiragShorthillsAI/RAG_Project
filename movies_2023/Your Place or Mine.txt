After graduating, McKenna moved to New York City to seek a job inpublishing. While there, she did some freelance writing work.[4]
A script she wrote during a six-week course inscreenwritingatNew York Universityhelped her get anagent, and, in 1991, she moved to Los Angeles.[4]By age 26, she had sold a comedy feature and a television pilot, and continued to write a number of feature and television scripts.[5]She also wrote an episode ofMargaret Cho's sitcomAll American Girl.[6]
However, it would be eight years until her first movie, 1999'sMatthew Perry-Neve Campbellromantic comedyThree to Tango, was produced.[4]
In 2004, she wroteLaws of Attraction, starringPierce BrosnanandJulianne Moore.[6]
She adaptedLauren Weisberger’s novelThe Devil Wears Pradainto the2006 film of the same name, directed byDavid Frankeland starringMeryl Streep,Anne HathawayandEmily Blunt.[6]Though her first two produced features were both romantic comedies, McKenna has reiterated thatThe Devil Wears Pradais not, and has instead described it as 'competence porn', noting: 'The real love story is, she ends up with that newspaper, having understood the world better and having understood her naiveté better'.[6]The film earned McKenna aBAFTAnomination forBest Adapted Screenplay.[7]
McKenna explored the nuances of the characters of Miranda (Meryl Streep's character) and Andy (Anne Hathaway's character) inThe Devil Wears Pradain a 2006 interview with Jan Huttner:
"I wanted to make sure the audience understood why she had so much power in her world; and then understand that there was a cost for her, because we wanted Andy to walk away from a life as opposed to walking away from a person. She sees how much Miranda has sacrificed in her personal life, and that’s just not what Andy wants to do. Miranda’s held to a different standard than male executives might be held to, and she lives under a microscope."[8]
She wrote27 DressesstarringKatherine Heiglin 2008.[6]The film took its place quickly as a classic romantic comedy, telling the story of a bridesmaid of twenty-seven weddings finding her own love.[9]
Her next produced movie was 2010'sMorning Glory, starringRachel McAdams,Harrison FordandDiane Keaton, followed shortly after by 2011's adaptationI Don't Know How She Does It, withSarah Jessica ParkerandPierce Brosnan.[10]McKenna has jokingly referred toThe Devil Wears Prada,Morning GloryandI Don't Know How She Does Itas 'The Blackberry 3', a thematically-linked trio of films featuring women who see theirBlackberriesmore than they see their own families.[5][11]In an interview forThe Ringer, McKenna compared that lifestyle to her own as a showrunner: "Striving for perfection, you can easily end up having it fill all the gaps in your life because that’s the kind of job, like being a showrunner, that you’re never done, you’re never finished, you could always be doing something else."[12]
In the same year, McKenna wroteCameron Crowe'sWe Bought a Zoo, an adaptation of thenovel of the same nameby Benjamin Mee.[13]The film received positive reviews overall, with aLondon Evening Standardcritic commenting, "You have to admire the thoroughness with whichWe Bought a Zoo--which is the film Disney would make if they still knew how--caters to the whole family."[14]
In 2014, she wrote the musical comedy-dramaAnnie, directed byWill Gluckand withQuvenzhané Wallisin the title role. The film was a contemporary adaptation of the 1977Broadway musical of the same name.[10]
McKenna returned to television in 2015, when she teamed up with singer and comedianRachel Bloomto create the romantic musical comedy-dramaCrazy Ex-Girlfriend. The show was originally developed forShowtime, with a half hour pilot produced. When Showtime opted not to proceed, McKenna and Bloom reworked the series forThe CW, including expanding it into an hour-long format.[15]The CW renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on October 21, 2016,[16]and a third season, which premiered on October 13, 2017.[17]McKenna is the series' showrunner and an executive producer.[6]
In a 2018 interview forDeadline, when asked aboutCrazy Ex-Girlfriend's commentary on gender, she said:
I mean it’s so fun to poke fun at. There are also still lots of things that haven’t been talked about. You still have to fight to get the word clitoris on the air and people still freak out when you talk about periods. We’re taking on some other gynecology because it’s always fun for us and threatening to the patriarchy.[18]
In March 2017, McKenna inked a two-year overall deal withCBS Television Studios, the studio behindCrazy Ex-Girlfriend, to develop new projects for network and cable through her production company Lean Machine.[19]The following October, she teamed up withRene Gube, a producer and recurring guest star onCrazy Ex-Girlfriend, for a single-camera comedy calledBig Menthat has been set up atCBS.[20]

McKenna was the first ever guest on the screenwriting podcastScriptnotes, hosted byJohn AugustandCraig Mazin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
