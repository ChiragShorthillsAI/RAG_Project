Zoey Miller's love life is turned upside-down when Zach MacLaren, the school's soccer star, getsamnesiaand mistakes her for his girlfriend, who is coincidentally named Zoey as well.
It was released in limited theaters on October 20, 2023 and onAmazon Prime Videoboth instreaming mediaformat and asvideo on demand.
Zoey Miller, a highly intelligentcomputer majorjunior, atQueens University of Charlottedoes not believe in the traditional concept of romantic love, but rather that having similar ways of thinking is the key. On Valentine's Day she speaks up against fellow student Becca's presentation on Saint Valentine in a history class, saying that the holiday is a capitalist creation. She has designed an app that will effectively match people based on algorithms.
As Zoey is crossing campus with her roommate and friend Elle, the school's soccer star Zach MacLaren accidentally kicks a ball into her head. He rushes over to apologise. Elle finds it romantic, but Zoey shrugs it off. In a subsequent class, another student has an almost identical view to Zoey when love is discussed, but disappears before she can tell him so.
Zach comes into the campus bookstore where Zoey works. He forgets his credit card after ordering a book. Zoey runs after him to give it back as he speeds off on his bike, and he crashes into a reversing car. Zoey is the first person he sees when he comes to, and as he hears her name, he mistakes her for his girlfriend, who is coincidentally also named Zoey.
Zoey accompanies Zach to the hospital, where she bumps into his parents. They also confuse her for his girlfriend, but as he hasamnesiano one realizes the error. The doctor tells Zoey to avoid upsetting Zach until he recovers, so his parents have her to dinner. She meets Zach's younger sister Avery and his cousin Miles, who is the student she had seen with similar views to her from the lecture. She continues to discover things she has in common with him. They invite her along for a family ski weekend, so she cancels her flight to visit Paula to join them.
As Zach has to stay in the rented house to rest, Zoey goes to the slopes where Miles teaches her to snowboard. They are mutually attracted so, that night in the hot tub as they are alone briefly, they kiss. In the morning when Zach mentions Miles' girlfriend, she confronts him, but he explains they are polyamorous.
Disappointed, Zoey chooses to spend the next day keeping Zach company. They play games and cook food. By the end of the day, Zoey feels a bond with him, saying that she hopes he remembers how nice this day was once his amnesia is gone.
Riding back to the MacLarens', the soccer-playing Zoey arrives, accusing Zoey of identity theft. She is able to explain the circumstances, and apologizes for deceiving them. As Zoey leaves, Avery blurts out that she prefers her to soccer Zoey.
Back in class, outlandish rumors circulate about Zoey, and she falls out with Elle, upset that she had convinced her to lie, though they later make up. Then Becca proposes she help them promote the upcoming Jam Fest to recover her image by creating a web page for the event.
Successfully getting the website up and running after an all-night effort, Zoey plans on watching from home. However, Elle drags her to the Jam Fest before it finishes, as Zach is there and is likely available. She stops the music to find him. Once she does, Zoey confesses her feelings, Zach admits he broke up with soccer Zoey because of his feelings and they kiss.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
