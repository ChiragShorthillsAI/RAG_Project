InHaiti, photographer Victor Fielding and his pregnant wife Sorenne are on their honeymoon when amassive earthquakeensues. Sorenne is gravely injured, and paramedics tell Victor he must choose to save either his wife or child.
Thirteen years later, Victor has lost faith in God since Sorenne's death, and raises his daughter Angela by himself inGeorgia. One day after school, Angela ventures into the woods with herBaptistbest friend Katherine West to perform aséance, attempting to contact Angela's mother. The girls go missing and a three-day manhunt ensues.
The girls are found in a barn on the third day; though traumatized, they seem relatively normal, having suffered only burns to their feet. As their conditions rapidly deteriorate, Victor admits Angela into the hospital where their nurse neighbor Ann attends to her. Ann, convinced that Angela is possessed after she reveals her knowledge of Ann's experience in thenovitiateas a prospectivenunand her secret abortion, gives Victor a memoir written by Chris MacNeil, who experienced a similar situation with her daughterRegan50 years ago.[a]Chris has spent her life researching exorcisms in every culture, becoming world-renowned for her studies. Regan became distant from her mother due to the memoir's success and has not seen her since. Victor meets with Chris, who visits Angela. Visiting Katherine's home, Chris performs adeliverance ritualon Katherine, who stabs Chris in the eyes with a cross, blinding her.
Victor, Ann, and Katherine's parents Tony and Miranda, reach out to the Church for anexorcism. Chris advises Victor to use methods from all different cultures, and the group seeks the help of Father Maddox, a local priest; Don Revans, the West family's Baptist pastor; Stuart, aPentecostalpreacher; and Dr. Beehibe, arootwork healer. The group plans anecumenicalexorcism, but the localCatholicdioceseforbids Maddox from participating as they feel the children are suffering from a psychiatric disorder.
As the group proceeds with the exorcism, the demon reveals that Victor did not choose to keep Angela thirteen years ago; he chose Sorenne but she died from her injuries. The demon says they need to choose which of the girls gets to live and which one will die, and if a choice is not made, it will kill them both. While Miranda and Victor both refuse to forsake each other's child, Maddox, who has a change of heart, rejoins the group. Maddox reads from theRoman Ritual, only for the demon totelekineticallysnap his neck and kill him. Victor regains his faith and begins to pray theLord's Prayer, which he learned as a child. As Victor apologizes to Angela and uses Sorenne's scarf to attempt to strengthen her against the demon, Tony yells that he chooses to save Katherine, and Angela flatlines. The demon then reveals that the one that was chosen would be the one who died. Katherine screams for her parents as the demon drags her to Hell, while Angela revives and reunites with Victor.
In the aftermath, Angela returns to school, Miranda and Tony mourn, and Victor visits Sorenne's grave. In the hospital, Chris is reunited with Regan, who forgives her mother.

In August 2020, it was reported thatMorgan Creek Entertainmentwould be producing a new installment inThe Exorcistfranchise.[5]A tentative theatrical release window of 2021 was planned by the studio.[6][7]Ben Pearson of/Filmnoted that the studio had previously stated that it would "never attempt to remakeThe Exorcist", but that it would also obtain the "blessings of their library titles' original creators before they move forward with new entries".[8]
In December 2020, it was clarified that the project in development would be a sequel to the original film, withDavid Gordon Greenin early negotiations to serve as director.Jason Blum, David Robinson and James Robinson serve as producers.[9][10][11]In July 2021, it was reported that a trilogy of sequels were concurrently in development with Green hired to direct the first of the new installments, from a script he co-wrote with Peter Sattler,[12][13]from an original story he co-wrote withScott TeemsandDanny McBride.[14]The film is a direct sequel toThe Exorcist[15]and the story does not acknowledge the event of the other four films in the franchise.[16]
Green, McBride, Couper Samuelson, andStephanie Allainserve as executive producers.[17][18]Prior to acquiring the series' rights from Morgan Creek Entertainment, the writing team and Blum spent early 2020 devising the story overZoom.[19]
The projects are joint-venture productions betweenBlumhouse Productionsand Morgan Creek Entertainment withUniversal Picturesdistributing. Universal collaborated withPeacockto purchase distribution rights for $400 million total. Parts two and three of the trilogy were optioned as potentialPeacock exclusive films.[12][13]By October 2021, Green expressed his intentions to direct all three films, with script outlines completed for the latter two films that he co-wrote with Sattler.[20][21][22]
Ellen Burstynreprised her role as Chris MacNeil from the original film, withLeslie Odom Jr.co-starring as a father who tracks down Chris to help his possessed child.[12]Ann Dowd, Lidya Jewett, Olivia Marcum andOkwui Okpokwasiliwere also cast.[23][24][25][26]Raphael Sbargejoined the cast as a pastor.[27]Jennifer Nettleshas a "primary role" in the film.[28]Helen Leaheywas cast as the main voice of the demon.[29]
Linda Blair's cameo was filmed in secret and not in the script. The scene shows the first time Blair and Burstyn have communicated in years. Green stated: "I told Ellen that Linda had agreed to do this, and they were going to be reunited. It was just something that felt right, and Linda felt comfortable. She walked in, and the moment was shared by the dropped jaws of the crew. The camera operator was crying, didn't know what was happening! The moment that you see Linda take a knee and take her hand is the first time they'd communicated in many, many years. It was the first take".[30]
In February 2022, Burstyn stated that she had completed production for her part in the film.[31]Though Green had previously stated that he would begin work on the sequel after completingHalloween Ends(2022), given the actress' age and the risks of theCOVID-19 pandemic, the production team worked with Burstyn to make sure they had her part completed for the film.[31][32]Linda Blair, who portrayedRegan MacNeilin the first film, was an "advisor" on set. Green stated toTotal Filmthat "I was really lucky to have [Blair] read the script, but she was not interested in a significant role and stepping back into that. We brought her in as an advisor because we're dealing with young people, and we want to take them to dangerous places safely".[33]
On a production budget of $30 million,[2]principal photographybegan in November 2022, inAtlantaandSavannah, Georgia.[34]Burstyn was brought in that month forreshoots.[35]In mid-December, production was shut down early for the holidays after Odom had an "unspecified health issue".[36]Filming concluded in early March 2023.[18]
The Exorcist: Believerwas released byUniversal Picturesin the United States on October 6, 2023.[37]It was previously set for October 13,[12][13]before being moved up a week earlier to avoid competition with theconcert filmTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour.[37]
The film was released ondigital platformsbyUniversal Pictures Home Entertainmenton October 24, 2023;[38]it also began streaming exclusively onPeacockin the United States on December 1, 2023.[39]It was later followed by aBlu-ray,DVD, and4K UHDrelease on December 19, 2023.[40]
In 2025, a haunted house attraction calledUniversal Horror Unleashedwill feature characters from the film.[41]
The Exorcist: Believergrossed $65.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $71.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $137 million.[3][4]
In the United States and Canada,The Exorcist: Believerwas projected to gross $30–36 million from 3,663 theaters in its opening weekend.[42]The film made $11.8 million on its first day, including $2.9 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $26.5 million, topping the box office and being the best of the franchise, but was noted as disappointing given mid-$30 million projections and the $400 million Universal spent to acquire the rights.[43]The film made $11 million in its second weekend, finishing second behind newcomerTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour.[44]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 22% of 250 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "The Exorcist: Believerearns points for trying to take the franchise back to its terrifying roots, but a lack of new ideas – and scares – make this an inauspicious start to a planned new trilogy."[45]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 39 out of 100, based on 54 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[46]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "C" on an A+ to F scale, the same asThe Exorcist IIIandExorcist: The Beginning, while those polled byPostTrakgave it a 61% positive score.[43][47]
Owen Gleiberman, writing forVariety, said in his review: "The Exorcist: Believer, in its superficially competent and poshly mounted way, feels about as dangerous as a crucifix dipped in a bottle of designer water".[48]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reportersaid: "Unlike Green'sHalloweentrilogy, which served up diminishing returns with each new installment,Believercondenses that downward trajectory into the first chapter" and called the film "hella disappointing".[49]InPlugged In, Paul Asay praised the film for its theme of emphasizing the importance of faith and community in rescuing the oppressed.[50]John Mulderig in theCatholic Reviewnoted: "William Friedkin['s] Watergate-era picture ... was a fairly straightforward confrontation between Regan's tormentor and two Catholic priests...[D]riving away of the devil here, by contrast, takes on the qualities of a circus...thus promot[ing] a syncretist, humanistic and even vaguely anti-Catholic outlook that could be spiritually dangerous for anyone inclined to take it seriously. On the whole, however, this half-a-century-later follow-up is best dismissed as a bit of chaotic schlock."[51]David Fear ofRolling Stonewrote, "There are moments in this borderline incoherent mess of a movie in which fans may be convinced that its sole purpose is to try making the original follow-up, 1977's legendarily godawfulExorcist II: The Heretic,look positively genius by comparison."[52]
USA Today'sBrian Truitt gave the film a score of three out of four. He noted Burstyn's limited screen time, writing: "Odom gets a meatier character arc than Burstyn did back in the day, and while her return isn't as integral to the story asJamie Lee Curtis' was to the rebootedHalloween, Chris' appearance adds needed weight to theBelievernarrative. [...] With a formidableBelieverand two moreExorcistmovies in the pipeline, though, at least this franchise still has a prayer".[53]Olly Richards ofEmpirefelt differently about Burstyn's role: "The role feels gimmicky rather than essential and sets the film on a cheesier path of call-backs, winks, and attempts to one-up the original. It becomes a tribute act, its own personality shrinking in the shadow of a classic".[54]
Stephanie Zacharek, inTime, notes, "As for Green'sExorcist: Believer, which starts out strong—evoking all the reasons demons in search of a body to possess can't resist the hormonal lightning rod of adolescent girls—and ends in a dumb jumble of generic-looking zombie-girl Blumhouse special effects: I've already forgotten it. Odom is a terrific actor[:] But poor Ellen Burstyn. Long after refusing to appear inExorcist II, she agrees to show up in this thing—as the older version of Chris, now the ultimate coastal grandma, dressed in floaty, flattering white scarves and ropes of crystal beads—only to get about 10 minutes of screen time, during which her character suffers a needless and stupid indignity. Though it's not something she could have known some 47 years ago, Burstyn said yes to the wrongExorcistsequel. If only she'd chosen the one with poetry in its soul."[55]
In July 2021, two sequels were confirmed to be in development with the same creative team of Green, McBride, Sattler and Teems on board.[20][21][22]The first of these sequels,The Exorcist: Deceiver, was originally scheduled to be released in theaters on April 18, 2025.[58]After the poor reception ofBeliever, sources fromThe Hollywood Reporterclaimed there would almost certainly be some degree of creative re-think for the next two films, and that Green had recently expressed some doubt about his participation.[59]In January 2024, Green stepped down fromDeceiver, and the film was removed from the release schedule shortly after.[60]By May 2024,Mike Flanaganwas in talks to write, direct and produce the nextExorcistfilm.[61]He was officially confirmed to be helming a newExorcistfilm later that month while it was also revealed thatThe Exorcist: Deceiverand the planned trilogy had been officially canceled with the franchise being rebooted.[62][63][64]The film is slated for release on March 13, 2026.[65]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
