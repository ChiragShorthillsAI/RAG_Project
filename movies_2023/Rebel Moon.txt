The film is set in a fictional galaxy ruled by the imperialistic Motherworld, whose military, the Imperium, threatens a village on the moon Veldt. Kora, a former Imperium soldier, ventures on a quest to recruit warriors from across the galaxy to make a stand against the Imperium before they return to Veldt.
Following alimited theatrical releaseon December 15, 2023,Rebel Moonwas released byNetflixon December 22. It received generally negative reviews from critics. A sequel,Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver, released on April 19, 2024. AnR-rateddirector's cut, titledRebel Moon – Chapter One: Chalice of Blood, was released on August 2, 2024.[3][4]
Atticus Noble, the sadistic admiral of themilitaristicImperium, arrives at a village on the moon Veldt on behalf of the Motherworld, a galactic empire in pursuit of conquest, fueled by centuries of conquest and war. He explains that his troops are hunting for a band of rebels led by siblings Devra and Darrian Bloodaxe, and offers to buy the village's surplus grain. The village's leader, Sindri, declines, claiming that the villagers barely have enough to survive. A farmer, Gunnar, ignoring earlier warnings from Sindri and Kora, another farmer, indicates that the villagers might have a higher amount. Noble kills Sindri and orders Gunnar to prepare grain for them in ten weeks, which would not leave the villagers with enough to survive. Noble departs, leaving several soldiers and a "Jimmy" robot to oversee the harvest. After being harassed by a soldier, Jimmy befriends a villager named Sam and starts to defect. Kora finds most of the soldiers preparing to rape Sam and kills the soldiers with help from Aris, a soldier disgusted by his own comrades' actions; Jimmy intervenes and defects, saving Sam. Kora warns the villagers to mount a defense, knowing that Noble will kill them once he returns.
Kora and Gunnar depart for the port town of Providence, intending to recruit warriors for the village's defense, including Titus, a disgraced Imperium general. During their journey, she reveals to Gunnar that she once served the Imperium as a soldier, having been adopted and named Arthelais by Balisarius, an Imperium commander, after he eradicated her home planet's population, including her family. She was assigned as the bodyguard to Motherworld princess Issa, who was expected to usher in an end to the Imperium's conquests. Issa and her parents were assassinated, with Balisarius subsequently declaring himselfregentand continuing the Imperium's conquests.
Arriving at Providence, the pair meets smuggler and criminal Kai, who agrees to take them to Titus. He takes them to recruit Tarak, an ex-criminal who frees himself from slavery by bonding with a bennu, and Nemesis, a cyborg swordswoman. The group arrives at a gladiator arena on a moon, finding Titus in a drunken stupor. Titus initially refuses to join, but agrees to do so after Kora suggests that he avenge his deceased soldiers. Using Gunnar's previous dealing with the Bloodaxes, the group then arrives at the planet Sharaan to meet them. Darrian agrees to defend the village and brings several rebels, including one named Milius, while Devra, unconvinced that a victory against Noble's dreadnought is possible, declines. After they depart, Noble arrives on Sharaan and eradicates its population as punishment for assisting the rebels.
Kai tells Kora that he has been moved by her quest to abandon his life as a smuggler and that he has one last shipment to drop off. He takes the group to an unregistered trade depot, at which Noble's personal craft has arrived, and restrains and betrays them to Noble, revealing he had always intended to do so for the bounties on their heads. Noble identifies Kora and Titus as deserters, Tarak as a former prince, and Nemesis as the assassin of sixteen Imperial officers and their security details in revenge for her murdered children. Kai demands that Gunnar paralyze Kora; Gunnar instead frees her and kills Kai. In the ensuing battle, the other warriors are freed, and casualties include Darrian and Noble; the latter at Kora's hands. Afterwards, Kora and Gunnar return with the surviving warriors to Veldt, with Jimmy watching them on their way to the village.
Noble's corpse is recovered by Motherworld forces, and he is resurrected after having spoken on anastral planewith Balisarius,[5]who demands that Noble end the insurgency and bring Kora to him alive so he can execute her himself.
Rebel Moonis inspired by theworksofAkira Kurosawa, theStar WarsfilmsandHeavy Metalmagazines; its logo is an homage to the latter.[10]Snyder initially conceived the idea for the film in college,[11]before discussing it with Johnstad in 1997.[12]Johnstad mentioned that there were rough ideas discussed “We started working on character, scene structure, and action sequences maybe five years later. We started roughing things out.”[13]
Snyder thenpitchedit as aStar Warsfilm toLucasfilm, shortly after its sale toThe Walt Disney Companyin 2012.[14]He also pitched his idea as both a video game and a film toWarner Bros. Pictures"a couple of times".[15]The project was at one point planned as an original television series by Snyder and producerEric Newman, before pitching it as a film toNetflix.[16]
Following concerns fromNetflix FilmschairmanScott Stuberthat the project would underperform due to its length, Snyder, unwilling to "lose all the character", decided to split the film intotwo parts.[2]
Sofia Boutella's casting in the lead role was announced in November 2021.[17]Charlie Hunnam,Djimon Hounsou,Ray Fisher,Jena Malone,Staz Nair,Bae Doona,Stuart Martin, andRupert Friendjoined the project in February 2022.[18][19]Fisher first became aware of the project around 2019 or 2020 back when Snyder planned it to be a TV show, being shown whiteboards and showing his interest when Snyder explained that those were for a "little space thing" he was working on.[20]Cary Elwes,Corey Stoll,Michiel HuismanandAlfonso Herrerajoined the cast in April 2022.[21]On May 16, 2022, it was announced thatEd Skreinhad replaced Friend as the film's main antagonist due to scheduling conflicts, withCleopatra Coleman,Fra Feeand Rhian Rees joining the project.[22]On June 8, 2022, it was announced thatAnthony Hopkinshad joined the cast as the voice of Jimmy, a sentient JC1435 mechanized battle robot and one-time defender of the slain king.[23]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 22% of 182 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The website's consensus reads: "Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fireproves Zack Snyder hasn't lost his visual flair, but eye candy isn't enough to offset a storyline made up of various sci-fi/fantasy tropes."[44]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 31 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[45]
VarietywriterOwen Gleibermancommented, "while eminently watchable, [Rebel Moon] is a movie built so entirely out of spare parts that it may, in the end, be for Snyder cultists only."[46]Clarisse Loughrey ofThe Independentgave the film 1/5 stars, calling it "a film populated by some of theZack Snyder's Justice Leaguefilmmaker's worst impulses: a mess of imagery, some of it attempting to shock, congregated largely around the idea of what might look good in a trailer."[47]The Guardian's Charles Bramesco also gave the film 1/5 stars, writing, "the finished product has only the vaguest contours of ambition, diminished by a half-assedness dinkifying the latestCGI-jammed saga to decide the fate of the universe."[48]RogerEbert.com's Simon Abrams gave the film 1 star out of 4 and characterized it as too similar toStar WarsandSeven Samurai, containing an over-reliance of visual spectacle with clichéd characters and themes.[49]
Robbie CollinofThe Daily Telegraphgave the film 2/5 stars, noting its similarities toStar Warsand saying that "this first half of Snyder'sdiptych... is more of a loosely doodled mood board than a functioning film – a series of pulpy tableaux that mostly sound fun in isolation, but become numbingly dull when run side by side."[50]The Messenger's Jordan Hoffman gave it a score of 4/10, writing, "As a space opera, it has none of the weight ofDune, none of the characterizations ofGuardians of the Galaxy, none of the madness ofJupiter AscendingorThe Fifth Elementand none of the pep ofStar Wars."[51]Writing forThe A.V. Club, Lauren Coates said, "while Snyder may do his best to invent a dark, gripping universe to engross viewers,Rebel Moonis a limp, soulless regurgitation of tropes stolen from much more formidable films" and gave the film a D– grade.[52]
Fred Topel ofUnited Press Internationalwas more positive, calling the film "an entertaining filtering of science fiction and general storytelling tropes through the lens of creator/director Zack Snyder."[53]TheSouth China Morning Post's Daniel Eagan gave it 3.5/5 stars, writing, "What Snyder brings to the project is a sensational world-building vision and a muscular filmmaking style that can pummel viewers into submission."[54]Adam Graham ofThe Detroit Newsgave it a B- grade, saying, "To its credit, it borrows from a solid slate of sources, and while it's highly derivative, it's also highly watchable. Its referential nature helps it clip along at an expedient pace, and while it never feels like you're watching something new, it at least feels like you're watching something familiar."[55]
Reviewing the director's cut, Chase Hutchinson ofCollidersaid it "lacks anything approaching depth or well-constructed action, failing to offer anything worth revisiting despite adding another nearly two hours".[56]Conversely, Zosha Millman ofPolygonconsideredChalice of Bloodan improvement overA Child of Fire, saying, "UltimatelyChalice of Bloodends with a stronger promise for future installments thanCurse of Forgivenessdelivers, but even with lengthy runtimes and ample side quests, it never feels like Snyder is biting off more than he can chew here."[57]
After premiering December 22 on Netflix, the film garnered 23.9 million views in three days, making it the #1 most viewed English-language film on the service from December 18 to 24,[58]the second consecutive Netflix #1 for Snyder, starting withArmy of the Dead;[59]it was the ninth best 2023 debut for a Netflix original film.[60]The film stayed in first place with 34M views in its first full week of availability, following its debut weekend.[61]The week after that, the film slipped to second place with 11.1M views.[62]In its fourth week, it had dropped to eighth place while earning 3.9M views, as the film also earned an overall worldwide total of 72.9M views.[63]In 2024, for the week of April 15 to April 21, the film re-entered charts at number five, bringing in 5.5M views.[64]The film jumped to fourth place on the top ten chart for the week of April 22 to April 28, adding 6M views.[65]According to Netflix's second and third editions of “What We Watched: A Netflix Engagement Report",Rebel Moongenerated 57.8 million views from December 21 to December 31, 2023,[66]and 54.2 million views from January 1 to June 30, 2024.[67]

Algeria is a country that is dear to me, because it's where I'm from, where my family is from, it's my home. That will never leave me. I feel very worldly. But leaving a place like that when you're so young doesn't come without missing a sense of identity and belonging to one place. I think I've been blessed with the ability to travel, because I'm fearless to go anywhere, but I miss a sense of home, which was originally Algeria. But I feel Algerian, I'm proud to be Algerian and I carry that with me wherever I go.[14]

But to me, those experiences probably had the opposite effect. On the contrary, because I saw many great actors working with my mother, I thought this was a job only people with extraordinary talent could do."[6]

When they contacted me to participate inCloud Atlas, I couldn't believe it. We first met on Skype and I made a demo tape that I sent them. They gave me an important role despite my lack of English proficiency. I believe that a certain understanding developed between us at that time, which pushed me to follow them onSense8.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
