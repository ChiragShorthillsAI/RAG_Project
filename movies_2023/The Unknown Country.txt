Richard Ray Whitman(born 1949) is aYuchi-Muscogeemultidisciplinary visual artist, poet, and actor. He is enrolled in theMuscogee Nationand lives inOklahoma.[1][2]
Whitman was born inClaremore, Oklahoma, in 1949.[3]His maternal grandmother was Polly Long.[1]Like many Yuchis, Whitman is enrolled in theMuscogee Nation.[4]He grew up inGypsy, Oklahoma, and attended Bristow High School. He also attended theInstitute of American Indian Arts, theCalifornia Institute of the Arts, and the Oklahoma School of Photography inOklahoma City.[1]
Whitman began his art career as a painter and expanded to photography, installation, and video art.[4]In 1973, he participated in the 71-dayoccupation of Wounded Kneeand created art during the occupation.
Whitman is known for his black-and-white photography portraying contemporary Native realities, especially his "Street Chiefs Series" from the 1970s and 1980s. "Street Chiefs" features images of homeless Native men, primarily in downtown Oklahoma City. "The contemporary Indian in the isolation of the city canyons and rural reservations is avoided. The boredom, pain, frustration, poverty of the reality-counterbalance of our lives is harsh, unattractive, and unmarketable."[2]His photographic portraits are compassionate and empathetic to the lives of homeless natives and places them in the larger context ofIndian Removal, which forced tribes from all over the country toIndian Territory.[4]
From the 1980s onward, Whitman has incorporated text and computer graphics in his photography to create collage or mixed media. His socio-politically informed work often deals with the issues of homeland and dispossession.[4]
Collaborating with Yuchi poet and brother Joe Dale Tate Nevaquaya, Whitman created video to document theYuchi language. Together they worked with French filmmaker Pierre Lobstein in the 1990s. Whitman read T.C. Cannon's poetry in the video "Mazerunner: The Life and Art of T.C. Cannon" which was directed and edited by Phillip Albert. This work was subsequently screened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (3/19/1994) and was presented on the Bravo Cable Channel and the Independent Film Channel from May, 1995 through June, 1996.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
