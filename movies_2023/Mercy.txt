Two years ago, Michelle Miller's husband Jeffrey died in a bomb explosion in front of her while serving in Afghanistan. She now works as a casualty surgeon at Mercy Hospital, and lives with her son Bobby.
Meanwhile, FBI agents McBride and Ellis have arrested Ryan Quinn, a member of the Irish mob theQuinn Gang Brotherhood. His brother Sean and father Patrick "Paddy" and family are responsible for committing a series of crimes in the United States.
While bringing Ryan into custody, Sean and his henchmen – Johnno, Danny, and Mick – ambush the convoy, killing most of the agents and wounding McBride. Sean shoots Ryan twice at close range. Ellis escapes and brings McBride and Ryan to the hospital.
The Quinns go to the hospital to get Ryan out. As they arrive, they kill the receptionist and take the visitors and staff hostage, while Michelle hides Bobby inside her locker. Ellis manages to hide Ryan in the upper floor of the building. While searching for Ryan, Sean kills McBride by disconnecting his ventilator.
The police arrive at the scene but Sean threatens to kill every hostage if they attempt to storm the hospital. Using her combat skills, Michelle kills Mick after a struggle. Bobby is found and is taken hostage. Paddy calls Michelle to exchange Ryan for Bobby. Sean puts a bomb vest on Michelle's friend Dr. Terrance and relays the message to the police not to intervene before Sean activates the bomb, killing Dr. Terrance.
Paddy confronts Sean for jeopardizing the job. So he reveals to his father that Ryan has tipped off their illegal business to the FBI, hence he's going after Ryan. Michelle finds Danny making a bomb and, after a struggle, kills him.
Michelle exchanges Ryan for Bobby in the morgue, soon having Bobby back in her arms. Ryan reveals to Paddy that Sean shot him point blank. Their father confronts Sean about it, stating that he will never forgive him. Then Sean blames him for his mother's death, which was due to his negligence. Paddy attacks Sean, who shoots his father in the abdomen. Before losing consciousness, Paddy repents failing Sean as a father. The police storm the building, kill the remaining henchmen and rescue the hostages.
Ellis kills Johnno after the latter attempts to catch Bobby, who escapes into the tunnel. Sean shoots Michelle, knocking her unconscious momentarily, before activating the timed bomb and escaping. Recovering, she defuses it before heading to the tunnel where Sean has taken Bobby hostage. Bobby stomps on Sean's feet and runs, allowing Michelle to kill him.
Ryan and Paddy are taken to another hospital, and Ellis commends Michelle for her bravery before she heads home with Bobby.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
