A sequel based onSunrise on the Reapingis set to be released November 20, 2026.[6]
In war-ravagedPanem,Coriolanus Snowis one of twenty-four Academy students selected to mentor a 10th Annual Hunger Games tribute. Coriolanus hopes to win the Plinth Prize scholarship to restore his family's prosperity, which was lost after his father's death.
Coriolanus is assigned District 12's female tribute,Lucy Gray Baird. During the reaping ceremony, she engages the Capitol audience by slipping a snake down the dress of Mayor Lipp's daughter, Mayfair, then defiantly sings to the crowd. Coriolanus earns Lucy Gray's trust while accompanying her to theCapitol Zoo, where tributes are publicly caged. While a few mentors visit the tributes at the zoo, fellow mentor Arachne Crane is killed by her tribute, Brandy, who is immediately shot and killed by Peacekeepers.
While touring the game arena, rebel bombs explode, killing several tributes and mentors, and fatally wounding the President's son, Felix. After Lucy Gray saves Coriolanus from falling debris, he gives her rat poison as a weapon and says the bombings have opened tunnels in the arena, providing additional hiding places during the Games.
The Games commence the next morning, with Lucy Gray surviving the initial bloodbath and reuniting with Jessup, District 12's male tribute. Jessup, weakened by rabies, later succumbs to a fall. During the Games' last round, genetically modified, venomous snakes are dropped into the arena to avenge Felix's death. With Coriolanus's help, Lucy Gray avoids being bitten and wins the Games. Afterwards, Dean Casca Highbottom accuses Coriolanus of cheating, showing a handkerchief dropped into the snake tank to recognize Lucy Gray's scent and his mother's compact filled with the poison Lucy used. Consequently, Highbottom sentences Coriolanus to 20 years as a Peacekeeper. Coriolanus bribes an officer to transfer him to District 12. Fellow Academy student Sejanus Plinth, who has grown disillusioned with the Capitol's ideals after seeing his tribute, Marcus, die, volunteers to join him.
In District 12, Coriolanus and Lucy Gray reunite. Shortly after witnessing a rebel's execution, Coriolanus is to transfer for officer training in District 2. Coriolanus later finds Sejanus meeting with rebels Spruce, Billy Taupe (Lucy Gray's former love interest), and Mayfair. In the ensuing confrontation, Coriolanus fatally shoots Mayfair and Spruce kills Billy. Coriolanus allows a jabberjay to hear Sejanus' plans. Spruce hides the guns, but he and Sejanus are later hanged fortreason.
Lucy Gray and Coriolanus flee north. At a small cabin, Coriolanus finds the hidden weapons tying him to Mayfair's murder. Lucy Gray, distrusting Coriolanus, disappears into the woods. After he is bitten by a snake and unsuccessfully tries to shoot Lucy Gray, Coriolanus dumps the guns into the lake near the cabin. With no remaining witnesses, he returns to District 12.
Coriolanus is sent to the Capitol, where Head Gamemaker Dr. Volumnia Gaul reveals she procured his pardon and scholarship to the Capitol University. Sejanus' parents, unaware Coriolanus caused their son's death, make him their heir. Dean Highbottom tells Coriolanus that he conceived the Hunger Games while he was drunk and has been traumatized ever since. Coriolanus poisons Dean Highbottom's drug stash, killing the latter and beginning his rise to power, while Lucy Gray's fate is left unknown.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
