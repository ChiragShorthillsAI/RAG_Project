Eileenis a 2023psychological thrillerfilm directed by William Oldroyd, based on the2015 novelbyOttessa Moshfegh, who co-wrote the screenplay with her husband, Luke Goebel. A co-production between the United States and the United Kingdom, the film starsThomasin McKenzie,Shea Whigham,Marin Ireland,Owen Teague, andAnne Hathaway. Set in 1960s Massachusetts, the story trails the relationship between two women working at a juvenile detention facility.
Eileenpremiered at theSundance Film Festivalon January 21, 2023, and was released inselect theatersin the United States on December 1, 2023, byNeon, before expanding wide on December 8, 2023. It received positive reviews from critics.
In 1960s Massachusetts, Eileen Dunlop works as a secretary at acorrections facility for teenage boys. At work, she is shunned by her colleagues and fantasizes about a guard named Randy. At home, she lives with her widowed and alcoholic father, Jim, a former chief of police who suffers from paranoia and is emotionally abusive towards her. Eileen frequently daydreams about killing herself and her father.
A new psychologist, Rebecca Saint John, joins the prison staff. Eileen is immediately drawn to Rebecca's intellectual conversation and glamorous appearance. Rebecca begins working with an inmate, Lee Polk, who was imprisoned for stabbing his father to death. Rebecca invites Lee's mother, Anne, to speak with her and Lee, but Anne soon leaves distraught after Lee refuses to speak with her. That evening, Rebecca invites Eileen to a local bar. Following a night of drinking and dancing, Rebecca kisses Eileen before leaving.
The next morning, Eileen wakes in her car to find that Jim has locked her out of the house. As she cleans her vomit from the seat of her car, a local policeman arrives to inform her that the neighbors have raised complaints about Jim's violent and erratic behavior. As a consequence, Jim has agreed to relinquish his gun to Eileen's care. At work, Eileen is upset to learn that Rebecca has already left for the Christmas holiday. Eileen spends the day sleeping at Rebecca's desk.
On Christmas Eve, Eileen receives a call from Rebecca, inviting her to her house for drinks. When Eileen arrives, they share a drink, but a panicked Rebecca eventually reveals they are actually in the Polks' house. Rebecca, suspecting that Lee wassexually abusedby his father, had arrived to question Anne. The conversation became heated, and following a scuffle during which they fell into the basement, Rebecca tied Anne up and drugged her. She now plans to coerce Anne into admitting involvement in her son's abuse, with Eileen as a witness. Eileen reluctantly agrees to help, retrieving her father's gun from her car.
In the basement, Anne breaks down after being threatened by Eileen. She admits that, although initially oblivious to her husband's abuse of Lee, she eventually became aware after walking in on her husband in Lee's room. Feeling powerless to stop the abuse and enjoying her husband's renewed interest in her, Anne instead enabled her husband by giving Lee anenemaand bathing him before he went to bed.
As Anne finishes her story, Eileen shoots her in the shoulder; Eileen and Rebecca drug Anne into unconsciousness. Amid Rebecca's unease, Eileen suggests framing Jim for the shooting and running away together, confessing her love for Rebecca. The two load Anne into Eileen's car and agree to meet at Eileen's house. Rebecca does not show up, and as dawn breaks, Eileen drives to a remote forest and leaves the still-drugged Anne in her car,which fills with engine smoke. Eileen then returns to the main road and hitches a ride, smiling to herself as she leaves the town.
In August 2016, it was revealed thatErin Cressida Wilsonwas adapting the novelEileenbyOttessa MoshfeghforFox Searchlightand producerScott Rudin.[5]The novel was ultimately adapted by Moshfegh and her husband Luke Goebel,[6]with Fox Searchlight no longer involved. The mayor ofMetuchen, New Jersey, Jonathan Busch, first confirmed thatAnne Hathaway,Thomasin McKenzie, andShea Whighamwould have roles in the film.[7][8][9]Filming commenced in late 2021 in Metuchen with filming locations also includingSouth Amboy, New Jersey.[10][11][12][13]It was one of a succession of productions that Hathaway was filming in New Jersey in 2021 and 2022.[14][15][16]
Principal photography on the production was completed in February 2022. It was confirmed thatOwen TeagueandMarin Irelandhad been added to the cast and that Endeavor Content and WME Independent were selling distribution rights.[17]Author of the novel and the screenplay Moshfegh was quoted as saying it was "a very faithful adaptation of the tone" of her original work.[18]In June 2022, she confirmed the edit was locked-in and said that McKenzie as Eileen was "amazing. It's like she was born to play that role, she's just so exciting to watch. And Anne Hathaway plays Rebecca, the sort of femme fatale character. I mean, we're watching it again today and the first cut of it, I was like, 'This is so much better than my book.' So the movie is really satisfying, I'm excited about that."[19]Moshfegh said bringing her writer husband Luke Goebel into the script writing process made the script better because he was able to add another perspective to the story. They began writing drafts during the height of theCOVID-19lockdown in 2020 and avoiding seasonal wildfires from Oregon to Pasadena to Palm Springs, with Moshfegh saying toVanity Fair, "There was a sense of looming danger haunting us, which actually really helped the writing process." Hathaway described the project as "CarolmeetsReservoir Dogs".[20]
Richard Reed ParryofArcade Firecomposed the film's score.[21]The film's soundtrack was released throughMilan Recordson December 1, 2023.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 82% of 204 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Anne Hathaway and Thomasin McKenzie prove a well-matched duo inEileen, which honors its source material with a twisty tale of obsession."[26]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 72 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[27]
Following its premiere at Sundance, David Rooney ofThe Hollywood ReportercalledEileen"a film both malevolent and playful, morbidly funny and disturbing", commending the screenplay, direction, cinematography and cast performances.[28]In his review forIndieWire, Ryan Lattanzio called it a "perversefolie à deux" and lauded the "immensely detailed" direction and cinematography, as well as the "career-best" performances of the leads.[29]InVariety, Jessica Kiang called the film "wildly audacious, wondrously twisted" and "deliciously deranged", stating: "The moviemaking terminology is apt, because this is a film that is practically drunk on the possibilities of cinema, pumping a recklessly modern energy through a plethora of classical Hollywood genres […] It moves, sometimes sinuously, sometimes with lurching abruptness, fromSirkianromantic melodrama to film noir into black-comedy horror, coming to rest somewhere in the realms of one of the more effed-up Hitchcock thrillers."[30]
InRolling Stone, K. Austin Collins observed that "Eileenis quick enough on its feet that there's more pleasure than impatience to watching it spin its web somewhere in the direction of the obvious" and praised Oldroyd's direction in contrast toTodd Haynes' similar filmCarol.[31]In her review forVox, Alissa Wilkinson remarked: "Eileenis the kind of drama that feels like it’s got dirt beneath its fingernails […] [It] is dank and disturbing and, when you’re in the mood for something that will mess you up, exactly right".[32]Conversely, Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardianadmired Hathaway's "pitch-perfect" performance, but revealed that he found himself "craving a little bit more oddity from a film, and characters, that hinted at a more daring and depraved destination".[33]

NEON Rated, LLC,doing business asNeon(stylized inall caps), is an Americanindependent filmproductionanddistributioncompany founded in 2017 by CEO Tom Quinn andTim League, who also was the co-founder of theAlamo Drafthouse Cinemachain.[1]As of 2019, League is no longer involved with daily operations for the company.[6]
Its first film,Colossal, was released in 2017.[7]The company became known for distributing such notable films asI, Tonya(2017),Parasite(2019),Portrait of a Lady on Fire(2019),Palm Springs(2020),Flee(2021),Spencer(2021),The Worst Person in the World(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023),Anora(2024),Longlegs(2024),The Seed of the Sacred Fig(2024), andThe Monkey(2025).[8][9]
Parasitewent on to become Neon's highest-grossing film at the worldwidebox officewith $262 million and the first non-English-language film to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture.[10]In 2024,Longlegshad a domestic box office gross of $58.6 million, becoming the distributor's highest-grossing film ever in North America.[11]Anorabecame the company's second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[12]Neon has also worked with several high-profile filmmakers, which includesSean Baker,[13]Bong Joon Ho,Julia Ducournau,Craig Gillespie,Pablo Larraín, andCéline Sciamma.[14]
During the 4th Annual Zurich Summit, Tom Quinn commented on Neon's intent to release titles that appeal to audiences who "skew under 45, that have no aversion to violence, no aversion to foreign language and to non-fiction".[15]Explaining the success of the company in 2024, Quinn stated: "We were very much a startup, with everyone functioning as this sophisticated amoeba. We very quickly found ourselves that year inTorontowith a great slate [...] That work enabled us to sit at the table in Toronto that year and buyI, Tonya. Before the ink was even dry on the deal, we were planning itsOscar campaign. It's a testament to how quickly we can make decisions because we're not this big studio. We've always used that to our advantage."[16]
In September 2017, the company partnered withBlumhouse Productionsto manage BH Tilt.[17]In 2018, a majority stake of Neon was sold to30West, the media venture arm of "The Friedkin Group".[4][18]In February 2021,Bleecker Streetpartnered with Neon to launch the joint home entertainment distribution companyDecal, which is a standalone full-service operation that handlesdistribution dealson the home entertainment rights to both Neon and Bleecker Street's features. The first film to be distributed through Decal was the Bleecker Street releaseSupernovain winter 2021.[5]Additionally, Decal acquired North American distribution rights to the South Africanhorror filmGaiafor a summertheatrical release, marking their first ever acquisition.[19]
Andrew Brown (Co-President of Decal) oversaw the launch of Neon's home entertainment division. In 2022, Brown was promoted to "President of Digital Distribution". The exec, who has served as "SVP of Digital Strategy, Marketing, and Distribution" for Neon since 2017, also manages Neon's library, and oversees the annualFYC DVD Box Setanddirect-to-consumerdigital portal "Neon Cinema".[20]Prior to the joint-venture,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, as well asThe Criterion CollectionandWell Go USA Entertainment(for the filmPossessorwhich Neon and Well Go co-distributed), distributed several Neon films onhome video.[21][22][23]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, Neon was approved to continue promotional activities for its films since the company does not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP) nor had encountered any issue in receivingSAG-AFTRAinterim agreements.[24][25][26]
In August 2023, Neon hired formerA24employees Alexandra Altschuler as "VP Media" and Don Wilcox as "VP Marketing".[27]That same month, Neon hired former Sierra/Affinity employee Kristen Figeroid as "President of International Sales and Distribution", Laurel Charnetsky as "VP International Acquisitions & Operations", and Dan Stadnicki as "Manager, International Sales & Distribution".[28]In May 2024, Neon hired Joey Monteiro as "EVP, International Marketing" and Ashley Hirsch as "Manager of International Sales and Marketing".[29]That same month, Neon promoted Elissa Federoff from "President of Distribution" to "Chief Distribution Officer" and Ryan Friscia from "EVP, Finance and Business Development" to "Chief Financial Officer".[30]Furthermore, Jeff Deutchman, who joined Neon when it was launched, serves as "President of Acquisitions and Production".[31]
Additionally, Neon has acquired the distribution rights to fivePalme d'Orwinners at theCannes Film Festival:Parasite(2019),Titane(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023), andAnora(2024); all five won consecutively.[31][32][33]The company's strategy to acquire such titles at Cannes is to eschew "the lazy approach", said Deutchman. "The only real way to do Cannes is to go see as many movies as you can, because you never know where the nextDogtoothorBorderorHungerorForce Majeureis going to come from", he added, citing several modern Cannes standouts championed by arthouse buyers.[31]After acquiringParasitein 2018, Neon financed and distributed the film the following year in U.S. territories.[34]"From the very beginning, Tom Quinn sawParasiteas a universal film and refused to put it in a box as a foreign-language or international film", saidParasitedirectorBong Joon Ho. "He saw the heart of the film and understood that it was about all of us living in our modern class-based society. I was always grateful for that."[16]Neon spent $20 million promoting, distributing, and campaigning for the film's awards.[3]The film subsequently became Neon's highest-grossing film with more than $200 million at the worldwidebox officeand won fourAcademy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Director. Similarly, Neon spent $18 million promotingAnora, three times the film's original budget.[3]Anoraultimately won the two aforementioned Academy Awards whileAnatomy of a FallandTriangle of Sadnesswere nominated for the same two categories, among others. As of March 2025, Neon has garnered 39 Academy Award nominations, winning 11 overall.[10][12][35]
In 2023, Quinn commented on the company's success at Cannes, saying: "We've seen over the years that each of these films, because of their credibility and success, the Palme d'Or has come to mean something quite impactful for a very young group ofcinephiles. And the reason why we know this is we've tested all these movies and dating back toParasite, probably I think, the fifth reason why people came to see the film, in itstest screeninginSherman Oaks, was the fact that it won the Palme d'Or, and each subsequent year that went up. And this year, the number one reason why people came to see the film [Anatomy of a Fall], at a test screening inBurbank, was the fact that it had won the Palme d'Or."[36]In 2024, Quinn stated: "The award means a lot. To audiences here who are looking for the absolute most adventurous, forward-looking cinema available, that award represents it because these films have delivered, and they've been major Oscar contenders."[16]
In July 2024, Neon received its biggest opening weekend at the box office with the horror thriller filmLonglegs, after scoring $22.6 million from 2,510 theaters (a figure that includes $2.5–3 million in Thursday previews) and only behindUniversal/Illumination's second weekend ofDespicable Me 4. Initially projected to gross $7–9 million, the opening marked the biggest total for an original horror film of 2024, one of the top 20 weekends for an independent film and the best opening ever for an independent horror film.[37][38][39]To promote the film, Neon utilizedguerrilla marketingtactics similar to those that led to the box office success ofThe Blair Witch Project(1999).[40]DirectorOz Perkinscredited Neon for the film's marketing, stating the studio "really responded strongly to the movie, the raw materials of the movie really excited them, the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it sounds. They asked me early on, 'Do we have your permission to kind of go nuts?' And I said, 'What else are we doing here? Go for it. Do your thing.'"[41]The film's total marketing budget was under $10 million, focusing ondigital contentand not havingtelevision ads.[37]During its third weekend,Longlegsbecame the company's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office, earning $58.6 million, surpassing whatParasiteearned with $53.3 million in 2020.[11]Furthermore, it became the top grossing R-rated horror film of 2024 and the highest-grossing indie horror film of the last decade, topping A24'sTalk to Me(2022),Insidious: Chapter 3(2015) fromFocus Features, and A24'sHereditary(2018).[11]Afterward, furthering their marketing campaign, from August 1 to 4, Neon (partnering withAtom Tickets) offered free tickets to anyone who has a birthday that falls on the 14th of any given month. To get the tickets, those who registered and purchased tickets through Atom Tickets received a special promo code after verifying their date of birth and were able to get one free ticket per customer, while supplies lasted.[42]

The company's first production wasWalter, directed byStephen Frears, which was released in 1982. It is especially known for its gritty,kitchen sink-style films andperiod dramas.
In 1981, producerDavid Roseleft theBBCfor Channel 4 where he was appointed the Commissioning Editor for Fiction byJeremy Isaacs, the channel's founding Chief Executive but became mostly identified with theFilm on Fourstrand. With an initial overall budget of £6 million a year,Channel Four Filmswas to invest in twenty films annually for Film on Four.[1]The first film backed wasNeil Jordan's debut filmAngel(1982).[2]The first film shown as part of Film on Four wasStephen Frears'sWalterwhich was screened on 2 November 1982, the launch date of Channel 4.P'tang, Yang, Kipperbangscreened the following day was also an early highlight.[3]Originally, the company's films were intended for television screenings alone; the "holdback" system prevented investment in theatrical films by television companies because of the length of time (then three years) before broadcasters could screen them. An agreement soon concluded with the Cinema Exhibitors Association allowed a brief period of cinema exhibition if the budget of the films was below £1.25 million.[3]Channel Four Films struck several deals with other film production companies including theBFI Production Board,Goldcrest FilmsandMerchant Ivory.[3]By 1984, Channel Four Films were investing in a third of the feature films made in the UK.[4]
Channel Four's Business Development Department was formed in 1983 for TV and film sales[5]and they also invested in foreign films includingWim Wenders'Paris, Texas(1984) andJan Svankmajer'sAlice(1988).[3]In 1985FilmFour Internationalwas created as a separate international film sales arm and to invest in foreign film, includingAndrei Tarkovsky'sThe Sacrifice(1986).[5][2][3]
Channel Four Film's first big hit was Frears' third feature film for the cinema,My Beautiful Laundrette, in 1985.[6]Originally shot in16mmfor Channel 4 it was met with such critical acclaim at theEdinburgh Film Festivalthat it was acquired byOrion Classicsand distributed to cinemas and became an international success.[7][8][2]

Rose and Channel Four Films are credited by many as being a significant figure in the regeneration of British cinema and particularly remembered for films such asWish You Were Here,Dance With a Stranger,Mona Lisa, andLetter to Brezhnev. Channel Four Films also invested in earlyWorking Title Filmsas well as most of the films of Frears,Ken LoachandMike Leigh.[2]Leigh told writerHannah Rothschildaround 2008 that Film on Four had saved the British film industry: "This is a non-negotiable, historical fact of life and anybody who suggests that this isn't the case is simply either suffering from some kind of ignorance or has got some terrible chip."[1]
Rose remained in his post as Commissioning Editor until March 1990.[6]During his tenure at Channel 4, Rose approved the making of 136 films, half of which received cinema screenings.[11]Of the films Rose backed, 20 were from overseas sources, including work by directorsTheo Angelopoulos,Andrei TarkovskyandWim Wenders.[12]The company also helped British minority filmmakers includingPo-Chih Leong(Ping Pong(1986));Horace Ové(Playing Away(1986)) andHanif Kureishi(My Beautiful Laundrette;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid(1987)). This continued after Rose's departure with films directed byGurinder Chadha(Bhaji on the Beach(1993)) andSteve McQueen(Hunger(2008)).[13]
David Aukinjoined as head of drama in October 1990 and took over responsibility for Film on Four.[6]He changed his title to head of film in 1997 which he remained until 1998.[2]
The company had another big international success with Jordan'sThe Crying Gamein 1992.[2]In addition it was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Pictureas wasHowards Endthe same year.Damagealso received an Academy Award nomination that year.[6]Later in 1993, Leigh'sNakedand Loach'sRaining Stoneswere entered into competition at the1993 Cannes Film Festival.[6]
The following year,Mike Newell'sFour Weddings and a Funeralbecame thehighest-grossing UK film of all timeandDanny Boyle'sTrainspotting(1996) was also very successful.[2]
In the 1990s, Channel Four partnered withThe Samuel Goldwyn Companyto create a distribution company to release Channel Four films and Goldwyn films in the UK but Goldwyn pulled out late on and in August 1995,Film Four Distributorswas formed.[14]Its first release wasBlue Juice(1995) and its first major successes wereSecrets & LiesandBrassed Offin 1996.[15][16][2]
In 1998, the company was re-branded asFilmFourwith an annual budget of £32 million for 8 to 10 films.[6]East Is East(1999) becomes their biggest self-funded film.[6]In 2000, the company signed a three-year deal withWarner Bros.to make seven films with budgets of more than £13 million but their first,Charlotte Gray(2001) was not the success they hoped for.[6]
The company cut its budget and staff significantly in 2002, due to mounting losses, and was reintegrated into the drama department of Channel 4. The name "Film4 Productions" was introduced in 2006 to tie in with the relaunch of the FilmFour broadcast channel asFilm4.[citation needed]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
