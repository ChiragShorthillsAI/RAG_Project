May Decemberis a 2023 Americanblackcomedy drama[4][5][6][7]film directed byTodd Haynesfrom a screenplay bySamy Burch, based on a story by Burch andAlex Mechanik. It starsNatalie Portmanas an actress who travels to meet and study the life of Gracie (Julianne Moore), the controversial woman she is set to play in a film—a woman infamous for the 24-year-long relationship with her husband Joe (Charles Melton), which began when he was 13 years old and she was 36.[8]
The film was announced in June 2021, with Portman and Moore joining the cast. Filmed in 23 days in mid-2022 inSavannah, Georgia, it premiered at the76th Cannes Film Festivalon May 20, 2023, whereNetflixacquired the North American distribution rights.
May Decemberwas released inselect theatersin the United States on November 17, 2023, before streaming on Netflix on December 1, 2023. It received critical acclaim and various accolades, including four nominations at the81st Golden Globe Awardsand aBest Original Screenplaynomination at the96th Academy Awards, and was chosen by theAmerican Film Instituteas one of the top ten films of 2023.
In 2015, actress Elizabeth Berry arrives inSavannah,Georgia, to research her upcoming role in anindependent film. Elizabeth will be playing Gracie Atherton-Yoo, who, in 1992 at the age of 36, was caughtraping13-year-old Joe Yoo, a schoolmate of her son Georgie, at the pet store where they both worked. During a prison sentence, Gracie gave birth to Joe's child. Twenty-three years later, Gracie and Joe are married with three children: Honor, who is at college, and twins Charlie and Mary, who are about to graduate from high school.
Elizabeth interviews Gracie and Joe about their relationship. Visiting the pet store where the couple met, Elizabeth sees the stock room where Gracie and Joe were caught having sex and reenacts the scene alone. She speaks with Tom, Gracie's first husband, and Georgie, who is now a musician, and Gracie's defense lawyer. They view Gracie in varying ways, depicting her as naïve and passive, but also show how destructive her actions were.
Joe engages in a private text conversation with an unnamed friend who shares his hobby ofrearing monarch butterflies. At one point, he proposes they take a vacation together, but she rebuffs him by reminding him he is married. At the accommodation she is staying in, Elizabeth talks with the film's director and suggests the film cast a "sexier" actor for the 13-year-old character of Joe after she views auditions of prospective co-stars.
Elizabeth participates in a Q&A at the twins' high school and discusses the intimacy actors and crew members feel when shooting asex scene. When Elizabeth says she enjoys playing morally ambiguous characters, Mary is visibly offended.
At home, Charlie shares acannabisjoint with Joe, who reveals to his son that he has never tried cannabis before. High, Joe has a breakdown and weeps in Charlie's arms.
The family, accompanied by Elizabeth, celebrate the twins' graduation at a restaurant, where they have an awkward encounter with Tom, Georgie, and the rest of Gracie's old family. Georgie proposes that Elizabeth get him a job as a music supervisor on the film in exchange for details about Gracie's life; he claims he read Gracie's diary and discovered that her older brothers sexually abused her. Georgie also threatens that if not given the job, he will disparage the film to the press when it is released. Elizabeth gets a ride home from Joe.
Elizabeth invites Joe to her accommodation, where he gives her a letter Gracie wrote him early in their relationship. The two have sex, and Elizabeth tells Joe that he still has time to start a new life. Joe leaves once she refers to his experiences as a "story," saying that story is "his life." After he leaves, Elizabeth reads aloud the letter Joe gave her, adapting Gracie's mannerisms and lisps as she does so. Joe tearfully confronts Gracie about the start of their relationship, wondering whether he was "too young." Gracie insists he seduced her, and repeatedly asks who was really in control.
The morning of graduation, one of Joe's butterflies emerges from itschrysalis. Later, the whole family watches Charlie and Mary graduate while Joe weeps alone in the crowd. As Elizabeth prepares to leave, Gracie tells her Georgie fabricated the story of abuse by her brothers.
On set of the film, which is at this point revealed to be a low-budget and fairly low-quality production, Elizabeth films multiple takes of a scene depicting Gracie seducing Joe at the pet store. While the director is satisfied, she asks to film another take, insisting that the scene is "getting more real".
ScreenwriterSamy Burchoutlined the script with her husband, Alex Mechanik, and completed the screenplay onMemorial Day, 2019. ProducerJessica Elbaumcame onboard after reading the screenplay.[9]In June 2021, it was announced that Portman and Moore were cast in the film.[10]Portman recruitedTodd Haynesto direct.[9]In September 2022, Melton joined the cast.[11]In January 2023, it was reported thatPiper Curda, Elizabeth Yu, and Gabriel Chung had joined the cast.[12]
Principal photographytook place inSavannah, Georgia,[13]and wrapped after 23 days in November 2022.[14][15]Haynes's longtime collaboratorEdward Lachmanwas initially going to serve as cinematographer, but was replaced byChristopher Blauveltafter injuring his hip.[14][13]The script, which is set in Savannah, was originally set inCamden, Maine.[16]
Haynes said the film is partly inspired by theIngmar BergmanfilmsPersona(1966) andWinter Light(1963).[17]While not a direct adaptation, he also stated that theMary Kay Letourneauscandal "became very, very helpful to get very specific about the research, and we learned things from that relationship".[18][19]
Marcelo Zarvos's score for the film is an adaptation and reorchestration ofMichel Legrand's music forThe Go-Between.[17]Haynes originally played Legrand's score on set and during editing for inspiration until eventually the team "ended up embracing so many aspects of the original score that Marcelo adapted and added original music to it and then re-orchestrated it."[20]Legrand was credited along with Zarvos.
In February 2023,Sky Cinemaacquired the UK distribution rights.[21]The film was selected to compete for thePalme d'Orat the76th Cannes Film Festival,[22]where it premiered on May 20, 2023.[23][24]In May 2023,Netflixacquired the North American distribution rights at theMarché du Filmfor $11 million.[25]The film also screened as the "Opening Night Film" at the2023 New York Film Festivalon September 29.[26]

May Decemberreceived critical acclaim.[a]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 91% of 322 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's consensus reads: "Swaddling its difficult fact-based story in a blanket of campy humor,May Decemberis a seductively discomfiting watch."[41]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 86 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[42]
In his review following its Cannes premiere, Peter Debruge ofVarietycalledMay Decemberan "endlessly fascinating movie" and added, "As layered and infinitely open-to-interpretation as any of [Haynes's] films, it's also the most generous and direct [...] The potential for passion, transformation and subversion hangs heavy in the air".[43]David Ehrlich ofIndieWirecalled the film "a heartbreakingly sincere piece of high camp that teases real human drama from the stuff of tabloid sensationalism", and praised Melton's "well-modulated and eventually rather moving performance" and Moore's "predictably sensational, soft-hard performance".[44]The Guardian'sPeter Bradshawfound the film "amusing and elegant [...] delivered with a cool, shrewd precision by Todd Haynes" and described Portman and Moore's performances as containing "a potent frenmity".[45]
Bilge Ebiri ofVulturecalledMay December"very funny and light on its feet, but also a deeply uncomfortable movie", writing that Haynes "uses the trappings of camp to draw attention to the disconnect between what's happening onscreen and our response to it", and concluding: "It feels at times like the director himself [is] looking for the right tone with which to tell this story. He doesn't know exactly how to feel about all this. So he feels all the things, and makes sure we do, too."[46]
Rolling Stone's CT Jones praised Melton's performance, noting his skill and physicality in the role. "It's an inscrutable well of interpersonal grievances, power imbalances, and history, a perfect breeding ground for sharp work from screen icons Portman and Moore, the latter in her fifth film with Haynes," they wrote. "But while the two are competing to see how much cringe and humor one can conceivably fit into a movie about sexual assault and grooming, there's Melton off to the side, quietly stealing the show."[47]
Carlos BoyeroofEl Paíswrote that Todd Haynes's approach to telling the story "makes it petty, and pointlessly pretentious".[48]
FilmmakersRobert Eggers,Kitty Green,Bill Hader,Don Hertzfeldt,Laurel ParmetandJeff RowecitedMay Decemberas among their favorite films of 2023.[49]
May Decemberwas ranked tenth inSight and Sound's list of the 50 best films of 2023, out of 363 films nominated by 106 British and international participants.[50]In France,Cahiers du Cinémaplaced it second on their top 10 films of 2024.[51]Some critics opined that there was an omission of acting nominations for Portman, Melton and Moore at the96th Academy Awards,[52][53][54]despite being nominated at other major awards associations.[55][56]EJ Dickson ofRolling Stonecitedthe Academy's pattern to exclude actors of Asian descent and their lack of acknowledgement to performers under the age of 40 as the reasons Melton was not nominated.[57]

Todd Haynes(/heɪnz/; born January 2, 1961) is an American film director,  screenwriter, and producer. His films span four decades with themes examining the personalities of well-known musicians, dysfunctional and dystopian societies, and blurred gender roles.
Haynes first gained public attention with his controversial short filmSuperstar: The Karen Carpenter Story(1987), which chronicles singerKaren Carpenter's life and death using Barbie dolls as actors.[a]Superstarbecame acult classic.[1][2]His feature directorial debut,Poison(1991), a provocative exploration of AIDS-era perceptions and subversions, established him as a figure of a new transgressive cinema.Poisonwon theSundance Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize.
Haynes received further acclaim for his second feature film,Safe(1995), a symbolic portrait of a housewife who developsmultiple chemical sensitivity.Safewas later voted the best film of the 1990s byThe Village VoiceFilm Poll. His next feature,Velvet Goldmine(1998), is a tribute to the 1970sglam rockera. The film received the Special Jury Prize for Best Artistic Contribution at the1998 Cannes Film Festival.
Haynes gained acclaim and a measure of mainstream success withFar from Heaven(2002), receiving his firstAcademy Awardnomination forBest Original Screenplay. He continued to direct critically lauded films such asI'm Not There(2007),Carol(2015),Wonderstruck(2017),Dark Waters(2019), andMay December(2023), as well as the documentary filmThe Velvet Underground(2021). Haynes also directed and co-wrote theHBOmini-seriesMildred Pierce(2011), for which he received threePrimetime Emmy Awardnominations.
Haynes was born January 2, 1961, inLos Angeles, and grew up in the city'sEncinoneighborhood.[3][4]His father, Allen E. Haynes, was a cosmetics importer, and his mother, Sherry Lynne (née Semler), studied acting. Haynes is Jewish on his mother's side.[5][6]His younger sister is Gwynneth Haynes of the bandSophe Lux.[7]
Haynes developed an interest in film at an early age, and produced a short film,The Suicide(1978), while still in high school. He studied art andsemioticsatBrown University, where he directed his first short filmAssassins: A Film Concerning Rimbaud(1985), inspired by the French poetArthur Rimbaud(a personality Haynes would later reference in his filmI'm Not There). At Brown, he metChristine Vachon, who would go on to produce all of his feature films. After graduating from Brown, Haynes moved toNew York Cityand became involved in the independent film scene, launching Apparatus Productions, a non-profit organization for the support of independent film.[1]
According toCinematic/Sexual: An Interview with Todd Haynes, in response to whether his academic background affected his film-making practice, Haynes stated that his high school teacher taught him a valuable lesson: "Reality can't be a criterion for judging the success or failure of a film, or its effect on you. It was a simple, but eye-opening, way of approaching film."[8]
In 1987, while an MFA student atBard College, Haynes made a short,Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story, which chronicles the life of American pop singerKaren Carpenter, using Barbie dolls as actors.[1]The film presents Carpenter's struggle with anorexia and bulimia, featuring several close-ups ofIpecac(the nonprescription drug Carpenter was reputed to have used to make herself vomit during her illness). Carpenter's chronic weight loss was portrayed by using a "Karen" Barbie doll with the face and body whittled away with a knife, leaving the doll looking skeletonized.
Superstarfeatured extensive use of Carpenter songs, showcasing Haynes's love of popular music (which would be a recurring feature of later films). Haynes failed to obtain proper licensing to use the music, prompting a lawsuit from Karen's brotherRichardfor copyright infringement. Carpenter was reportedly also offended by Haynes's unflattering portrayal of him as a narcissistic bully, along with several broadly dropped suggestions that he was gay andin the closet. Carpenter won his lawsuit, andSuperstarwas removed from public distribution; to date, it may not be viewed publicly.[1]Bootlegged versions of the film are still circulated, and the film is sporadically made available on YouTube.[9][10]
Haynes's 1991 feature film debut,Poison, garnered him further acclaim and controversy.[1]Drawing on the writings of gay writerJean Genet, the film is a triptych ofqueer-themed narratives, each adopting a different cinematic genre: vox-pop documentary ("Hero"), 50s sci-fi horror ("Horror") and gay prisoner romantic drama ("Homo"). The film explores traditional perceptions of homosexuality as an unnatural and deviant force, and presents Genet's vision ofsado-masochisticgay relations as a subversion of heterosexual norms, culminating with a marriage ceremony between two gay male convicts.Poisonmarked Haynes's first collaboration with his longtime producerChristine Vachon.
Poisonwas partially funded with a grant from theNational Endowment for the Arts(NEA),[1]"at a time when the agency was under attack from conservative groups for using public funds to support sexually explicit works".[11]This, along with the film's sexual themes, was a source of controversy.[11][1]The film subsequently became the center of a public attack byReverend Donald Wildmon, head of theAmerican Family Association, who criticized the NEA for fundingPoisonand other works by gay and lesbian artists and filmmakers. Wildmon, who had not viewed the film before making his comments publicly,[12]condemned the film's "explicit porno scenes of homosexuals involved in anal sex", despite no such scenes appearing in the film.[13]Poisonwent on to win the 1991Sundance Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize, establishing Haynes as an emerging talent and the voice of a new transgressive generation.[1][14][15]The film writerB. Ruby RichcitedPoisonas one of the defining films of the emergingNew Queer Cinemamovement, with its focus on maverick sexuality as an anti-establishment social force.[16][17]
Haynes's next short film,Dottie Gets Spanked(1993), explored the experiences of a quiet and gentle six-year-old boy in the early 1960s who has various indirect encounters with spanking, most significantly involving his idol, a TV sitcom star named Dottie. The film was aired onPBS.[1]
Haynes's second feature film,Safe(1995), was a critically acclaimed portrait of Carol White, a San Fernando Valley housewife (played byJulianne Moore) who develops violent allergies to her middle-class suburban existence.[1]After a series of extreme allergic reactions and hospitalization, Carol diagnoses herself with acute environmental illness, and moves to aNew Agecommune in theNew Mexicodesert run by anHIV positive"guru" who preaches both that the real world is toxic and unsafe for Carol, and that she is responsible for her illness and recovery. The film ends with Carol retreating to her antiseptic, prison-like "safe room", looking at herself in the mirror and whispering "I love you" to her reflection.
The film is notable for its critical (though not entirely unsympathetic) treatment of its main character. Julie Grossman argues in her article "The Trouble With Carol" that Haynes concludes the film as a challenge to traditional Hollywood film narratives of the heroine taking charge of her life, and that Haynes sets Carol up as the victim both of a repressive male-dominated society, and also of an equally debilitatingself-helpculture that encourages patients to take sole responsibility for their illness and recovery.[18]Carol's illness, although unidentified, has been read as an analogy for the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s, as a similarly uncomfortable and largely unspoken "threat" in 1980s Reaganist America.[1][19]Safewas critically acclaimed, giving Moore her first leading role in a feature film, and gave Haynes a measure of mainstream critical recognition.[1]It was voted the best film of the 1990s by the Village Voice's Critic Poll.[20]The film historianDavid Thomsonlater described it as "one of the most arresting, original and accomplished films of the 1990s".[21]
Haynes took a radical shift in direction for his next feature,Velvet Goldmine(1998), starringChristian Bale,Ewan McGregor,Jonathan Rhys-MeyersandToni Collette. The film's title takes its name fromDavid Bowie's song "Velvet Goldmine".[22]Filmed and set mostly in England, the film was an intentionally chaotic tribute to the 1970s glam rock era, drawing heavily on the rock histories and mythologies of glam rockersDavid Bowie,Iggy PopandLou Reed. Starting withOscar Wildeas the spiritual godfather of glam rock, the film revels in the gender and identity experimentation and fashionable bisexuality of the era, and acknowledges the transformative power of glam rock as an escape and a form of self-expression for gay teenagers.[citation needed]
The film follows the character of Arthur (Bale) an English journalist once enraptured by glam rock as a 1970s teenager, who returns a decade later to hunt down his former heroes: Brian Slade (Rhys Meyers), a feather boa-wearingandrogynewith an alter ego, "Maxwell Demon", who resembles Bowie in hisZiggy Stardustincarnation, and Curt Wild (McGregor), an Iggy Pop-style rocker. The narrative playfully rewrites glam rock myths which in some cases sail unnervingly close to the truth.[citation needed]Slade flirts with bisexuality and decadence before staging his own death in a live performance and disappearing from the scene, echoing Bowie's own disavowal of glam rock in the late 1970s and his subsequent re-creation as an avowedly heterosexual pop star. The film features a love affair between Slade and Wild's characters, recalling rumors about Bowie and Reed's supposed sexual relationship. Curt Wild's character has a flashback to enforcedelectric shock treatmentas a teenager to attempt to cure his homosexuality, echoing Reed's teenage experiences as a victim of the homophobic medical profession.
Haynes was keen to use original music from the glam rock period, and (learning his lesson fromSuperstar)[citation needed]approached David Bowie before making the film for permission to use his music in the soundtrack. Bowie declined, leaving Haynes to use a combination of original songs from other artists and glam-rock inspired music written by contemporary rock bands for the film, includingSuede.[citation needed]Velvet Goldminepremiered in main competition at the1998 Cannes Film Festival, winning a special jury award for Best Artistic Contribution.[23]Despite the initial critical praise, the film received mixed reviews from critics.[citation needed]Costume designerSandy Powellreceived anAcademy Awardnomination for her costume design and won the Oscar in the same year for her work onShakespeare In Love.[24]
Haynes achieved his greatest critical and commercial success to date withFar from Heaven(2002), a 1950s-set drama inspired by the films ofDouglas Sirkabout a Connecticut housewife Cathy Whittaker (Julianne Moore) who discovers that her husband (Dennis Quaid) is secretly gay, and subsequently falls in love with Raymond, her African-American gardener (Dennis Haysbert). The film works as a mostly reverential and unironic tribute to Sirk's filmmaking, lovingly re-creating the stylizedmise-en-scene, colors, costumes, cinematography and lighting of Sirkianmelodrama. Cathy and Raymond's relationship resemblesJane WymanandRock Hudson's inter-class love affair inAll That Heaven Allows,and Cathy's relationship with Sybil, her African-American housekeeper (Viola Davis) recallsLana TurnerandJuanita Moore's friendship inImitation of Life. While staying within the cinematic language of the period, Haynes updates the sexual and racial politics, showing scenarios (an inter-racial love affair and gay relationships) that would not have been permissible in Sirk's era. Haynes also resists a Sirkian happy ending, allowing the film to finish on a melancholy note closer in tone to the "weepy" melodramas of the 1940s and 1950s cinema such asMildred Pierce.
Far from Heavendebuted at theVenice Film Festivalto widespread critical acclaim and garnered a slew of film awards, including theVolpi Cupfor Moore, and four Academy Award nominations: lead actress for Moore, Haynes's original screenplay,Elmer Bernstein's score, andEdward Lachman's cinematography.Far from Heavenlost in all four categories, but the film's success was hailed as a breakthrough for independent film achieving mainstream recognition and brought Haynes to the attention of a wider mainstream audience.[1]
In another radical shift in direction, Haynes's next filmI'm Not There(2007) returned to the mythology of popular music, portraying the life and legend ofBob Dylanthrough seven fictional characters played by six actors:Richard Gere,Cate Blanchett,Marcus Carl Franklin,Heath Ledger,Ben WhishawandChristian Bale. Haynes obtained Dylan's approval to proceed with the film, and the rights to use his music in the soundtrack, after presenting a one-page summary of the film's concept to Jeff Rosen, Dylan's long-time manager.[25]I'm Not Therepremiered at theVenice Film Festivalto critical acclaim, where Haynes won theGrand Jury Prizeand Blanchett won the Volpi Cup, eventually receiving an Academy Award nomination forBest Supporting Actress.[26][27]
Haynes's next project wasMildred Pierce, a five-hour miniseries forHBObased on the novel byJames M. Cainand the 1945 film starringJoan Crawford. The series starredKate Winsletin the title role and featuredGuy Pearce,Evan Rachel Wood,Melissa Leo,James LeGrosandHope Davis. Filming was completed in mid-2010 and the series began airing on HBO on 27 March 2011. It received 21Primetime Emmy Awardnominations, winning five, and Winslet won aGolden Globe Awardfor her performance.[28][29]
Haynes's sixth feature film,Carol, is an adaptation of the 1952 novelThe Price of SaltbyPatricia Highsmith. The cast featuresCate Blanchett,Rooney Mara,Sarah PaulsonandKyle Chandler. The film premiered in competition at the2015 Cannes Film Festival, where it won theQueer Palmand a shared Best Actress prize for Mara.[30][31]Carolreceived critical acclaim[32]and was nominated for 6 Academy Awards, 5 Golden Globe Awards, 9BAFTA Awards, and 6Independent Spirit Awards.[33][34][35][36]Geoffrey McNab ofThe Independentpraised the film praising Haynes writing "In sly and subversive fashion, Haynes is laying bare the tensions in a society that refuses to acknowledge "difference" of any sort". McNabb added, "They are both helped that in Todd Haynes, they have a director who is sensitive to every last nuance in their performances".[37]
On October 20, 2017, Haynes'sWonderstruckwas released, having premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2017. The film is an adaptation ofBrian Selznick's children's bookof the same name.WonderstruckstarsJulianne Mooreand is produced by Haynes's collaboratorChristine VachonandAmazon Studios, which is also distributing the film.[38][39]The movie describes two deaf children, one in 1927 and the other in 1977, who embark on separate quests to find themselves. When asked why he'd made a children's movie, in his October 15, 2017, NPR interview, Haynes explained, "I felt like it spoke to something indomitable about the nature of kids and the ability for kids to be confronted with challenges and the unknown and to keep muscling through those challenges."[40]The film received mixed reviews but earned praise forEdward Lachman'sblack-and-whitecinematography.
Haynes directed a film titledDark WatersforParticipant Media.[41][42]The film is based onNathaniel Rich'sNew York Times Magazinearticle “The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare,” which is about corporate defense attorneyRobert Bilottand his environmental lawsuit against the American conglomerateDuPont.[43]Mark RuffaloandAnne Hathawaystar,[44]and principal photography began in January 2019, inCincinnati.[45]The film was released on November 22, 2019.[46]
Haynes's premiered his first documentary feature,The Velvet Underground, at theCannes Film Festivalon July 7, 2021, and it went on to be released on October 15, 2021, in theaters and onApple TV+, to critical acclaim. The film rejects documentary biopic tropes, evoking a place and time through extensive use of montage. “What montage can do is always more sophisticated than we give it credit for,” Haynes says. “I wanted the audience to fill in the holes themselves and make their own discoveries and feel like these ideas are alive again, because they’re coming through you, and they’re not just being told to us like in a lecture.”[47]Haynes was nominated for theCritics' Choice Documentary Award for Best First Documentary Feature.[48]
Haynes's latest film,May December, reunites him with frequent collaborator Julianne Moore and co-starsNatalie PortmanandCharles Melton. The film, loosely based aroundMary Kay Letourneau, revolves around a married couple whose relationship is put through a test after an actress arrives to do research for a film about their past. The script was written bySamy Burch, with a story by Burch andAlex Mechanik.[49][50]The film was shot in Savannah, Georgia, and wrapped filming in December 2022.[51]The film received positive reviews[52]with Peter Debruge ofVarietywriting, "Todd Haynes unpacks America’s obsession with scandal and the impossibility of ever truly knowing what motivates others in this layered look at the actor’s process."[53]The film went on to receive nominations for fourGolden Globe AwardsincludingBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.[54]Haynes himself was nominated for theIndependent Spirit Award for Best Director.[55]
In 2023, Todd Haynes was given a Moving Image Award by theMuseum of the Moving Image(MOMI) in New York City. MOMI also curated a retrospective of his work, and published a book,Todd Haynes: Rapturous Process.[56]

In 2015 he was reported to be developing a TV series based on the 2012 documentaryThe Source FamilyforHBO.[38][59]

Haynes is reportedly set to direct the HBO seriesTrust,based on Hernan Diaz'snovel of the same name,  withKate Winsletas the lead after working together onMildred Pierce.[61][62]
AllMoviewrites that "Haynes is known for making provocative films that subvert narrative structure and resound with transgressive, complexeroticism. ... Although he doesn't characterize himself as a gay filmmaker who makes gay films … Haynes' name has become synonymous with theNew Queer Cinemamovement and its work to both explore and redefine the contours of queer culture in America and beyond."[63]
Haynes's work is preoccupied withpostmodernistideas of identity and sexuality as socially constructed concepts and personal identity as a fluid and changeable state. His protagonists are invariably social outsiders whose "subversive" identity and sexuality put them at odds with the received norms of their society. In the Haynes universe, sexuality (especially "deviant" or unconventional sexuality) is a subversive and dangerous force that disrupts social norms and is often repressed brutally by dominant power structures. Haynes presents artists as the ultimate subversive force since they must necessarily stand outside of societal norms, with an artist's creative output representing the greatest opportunity for personal and social freedom. Many of his films are unconventional portraits of popular artists and musicians (Karen CarpenterinSuperstar,David BowieinVelvet GoldmineandBob DylaninI'm Not There).[citation needed]
Haynes's films often feature formal cinematic or narrative devices that challenge received notions of identity and sexuality and remind the audience of the artificiality of film as a medium. Examples include usingBarbie dollsinstead of actors inSuperstaror having multiple actors portray the protagonist inI'm Not There. Stylistically, Haynes favors formalism over naturalism, often appropriating and reinventing cinematic styles, including the documentary form inPoison,Velvet GoldmineandI'm Not There, the reinvention of theDouglas SirkmelodramainFar from Heavenand extensive referencing of 1960s art cinema inI'm Not There.[citation needed]
Haynes is gay,[64][65][66]and identifies asirreligious.[67]After living in New York City for more than a decade, Haynes moved toPortland, Oregon, in 2002.[4][68]He has been in a relationship with Bryan O'Keefe, an archival producer, since 2002.[69]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
