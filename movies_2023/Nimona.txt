The citizens of a medieval-futuristic kingdom are protected by the Institute for Elite Knights, established by the legendary heroine Gloreth, who vanquished a "Great Black Monster" and enclosed the kingdom with a high wall one thousand years ago.
Ballister Boldheart is the firstcommonerto become a knight, as Queen Valerin is trying to change tradition so that "anyone can be a hero". During the ceremony, a laser shot from Ballister's sword kills Valerin. Ballister's boyfriend and fellow knight, Ambrosius Goldenloin, becomes distraught and disarms Ballister, dismembering Ballister's right arm in the process. Ballister becomes afugitive.
As Ballister crafts aprostheticreplacement arm, he is visited by Nimona, a teenage outcast who has faced persecution for hershapeshiftingabilities. Seeing a "villainous spirit" in Ballister, as he is facing similar treatment for his commoner origin and the murder of the Queen, Nimona declares herself to be hissidekick.
To clear Ballister's name, the duo kidnaps Diego, the squire who gave Ballister the sword. Diego gives them video evidence of the Director of the Institute swapping out Ballister's sword, revealing her to be the murderer. The duo confronts Ambrosius and the Director with the evidence, but the Director manipulates her knights into destroying it. Later, Ambrosius confronts the Director. She admits that she framed Ballister and murdered Valerin, as she objected to Valerin revising tradition by allowing commoners to become knights, fearing that doing so would lead to the kingdom's downfall. However, Ballister reveals that he has recorded the Director's confession, and "Ambrosius" turns out to be Nimona in disguise. When celebrating this in the hideout, Ballister posts it online, leading to public outcry.
The Director discovers that Nimona is the Great Black Monster defeated by Gloreth. She uses this information to convince the kingdom's citizens that Ballister used Nimona's powers to fake her confession. The real Ambrosius meets with Ballister and reveals Nimona's past, insisting that Nimona deliberately deceived Ballister. Shocked by the revelation, Ballister argues with Nimona and questions their friendship. Feeling betrayed, Nimona flees into the woods.
Stopping at an abandoned well, Nimona reminisces about her past: a thousand years ago, she wandered the world and transformed into other animals to try and fit in with the wildlife, but none of the creatures she encountered accepted her. After encountering Gloreth, who was a child at the time, Nimona transformed into a human. Gloreth and Nimona became friends, and Gloreth was accepting of Nimona's powers. However, the other citizens of Gloreth's village, including her parents, believed Nimona was a monster after discovering her abilities. The villagers attacked Nimona with torches, which accidentally set the village on fire. Gloreth, confused, turned hostile towards Nimona and drove her away.
With Ballister's abandonment and Gloreth's betrayal echoing in her head, Nimona transforms into the Great Black Monster.  She enters the city and decides to commitsuicideby killing herself on the sword of Gloreth's statue. However, before she can do so, Ballister stops her and apologizes. Nimona changes back to human form and embraces Ballister. The kingdom's citizens see this and are moved by it, but the Director orders a laser cannon to be fired from the wall to kill Nimona. Ambrosius protests, knowing that firing the laser into the city would kill everyone. The Director then turns on them using the same laser she used to kill the Queen and prepares to fire the cannon herself. To save the kingdom, Nimona assumes a giant, redphoenix-like form and flies into the cannon, resulting in her apparent death, as well as the death of the Director. The resulting explosion destroys part of the wall, revealing a beautiful, mountainous valley behind it.
Sometime later, the kingdom undergoes several changes: the breach in the wall has become a passageway through which citizens travel freely, Nimona and Ballister are honored as heroes, and Ballister's relationship with Ambrosius has been restored. Ballister visits his old hideout when he hears Nimona's voice, and joyfully realizes that she has survived.

On February 9, 2021, Disney announced it was closing down Blue Sky Studios, and that production of the film was cancelled.[28]Following the announcement, Stevenson said it was a "sad day" and that he wished the best for everyone who worked at Blue Sky Studios,[29]while Osborne said he was "truly heartbroken" that the studio was closing its doors.[30]Webcomics commenter Gary Tyrrell criticized the decision, saying, "Disneycouldhave allowed a very different kind of young heroine... I mourn for those who would have found a vision of themselves in an animated version".[31]Anonymous staffers at Blue Sky interviewed byBusiness Insiderbemoaned the cancellation of the film, calling it "heartbreaking", arguing that the film "didn't look like anything else in the animated world", and saying that they believe it will never "be completed and released."[32]The film was set to be the first use of Blue Sky's Conduit, a system that allowed artists to "find, track, version and quality control their work."[33]Had it been made, it would have been Blue Sky's first film withLGBTQrepresentation, as a few staffers confirmed toBuzzFeed Newsthat the film had an "I love you" scene between Ballister Blackheart and Ambrosius Goldenloin.[34]
One staffer stated that before being canceled, the film was "on track" to being finished by October 2021. A former animator at Blue Sky, Rich Fournier, stated that the studio was "very very close" to getting the film finished, but that they "found out it simply was not doable".[35]

Nimonawas Blue Sky's most complex film produced. The studio had previous experience with 2D-stylization withThe Peanuts Movie(2015). The film's design was influenced byEyvind EarleandCharley Harper, using both of their styles to combine medieval and the modern world so that it "mirrored the world we live in." The team chose their styles as Earle used more fluidity and Harper used a more geometric and simple shape base, and they had to convey "both sides of the spectrum and both sides of the character ideologies." They also had to incorporate the novel's style as well, including circles for the free-form Nimona, squares for the traditionalist Ballister, and diamonds for the rigid Institute. "In the case of the pink-colored Nimona, her shape-shifting (rhino, whale, cat, gorilla) translated into an explosion of emotions."[27]Aidan Sugano serves as production designer on the film, and described it as having elements of "sci-fi, medieval fantasy, knights, lasers, monsters, dragons, dramatic lighting, [and]... style".[45]Additionally, Goldenloin's ethnicity was changed to be Asian and Ballister's last name was changed from Blackheart to Boldheart, and they were both modeled after Lee Yang and Ahmed respectively.[46]
At the time of its initial cancellation, sources toldComic Book Resourcesthat the film was "75% complete".[47]Quane later clarified that the film was approximately "70% through layout": they had completed five fully animated sequences, along with character models, story reels, and locations at the time of Blue Sky's shutdown.[48]The finished footage was shown to various people in the animation business, and convincedMegan Ellisonat Annapurna Pictures to complete the project.[49]Much of what Blue Sky did remains intact, as Netflix and Annapurna did not start from scratch.[40]However, when DNEG's facilities inMontrealtook over animation, different pipelines had to be built from scratch, but fortunately, the team had a blueprint from Blue Sky, and they were able to translate it and apply it with DNEG's technology.[27]Storywise, about 90% of Blue Sky's version remained intact.[50]As a tribute to the previous team's work on the film, a section of the end credits is dedicated to listing the entire staff of Blue Sky Studios, and severalEaster eggspay homage to Blue Sky throughout the film.[51]Animation wrapped on October 1, 2022.[52]
In May 2023, it was confirmed thatChristophe Beckhad composed the film's score.[53]American singer and rapperK.Flayperformed the original song "T-Rex" as part of the single music in the film's soundtrack and released on June 23, the same day as the film's limited release date.[54]The film's score album was released on June 30 by Netflix Music.[55]

The film received critical acclaim.[a]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 92% of 103 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.9/10.

Reviewing the film following its premiere at Annecy forVariety, Peter Debruge calledNimona"such subversive fun", praising the "hip and impulsive" character of Nimona, "outside-the-box" animation, LGBTQ+ themes and vocal performances—particularly that of Moretz, which he remarked as a "delicious sense of anarchy".[71]Ben Travis ofEmpirecompared the film toShrek(2001) in their "satirical subversions of the fairytale formula" and wrote: "Both enthusiastically irreverent and deeply sincere,Nimonais a revisionist fairytale that forges its own path visually and narratively to beautiful effect".[72]InThe Hollywood Reporter, Frank Scheck called it "a consistent delight" and commended the screenplay, direction, animation, score, and lead performances.[73]
InScreen International, Wendy Ide called it a "slick, enjoyable package" with "a couple of distinctive selling points that should set it apart" and opined: "Whether or not they understand the film's subtext, younger audiences will no doubt relish the exuberant mischief and humour that Moretz brings to her voice performance—as well as Nimona's gleeful disregard for authority and her appetite for destruction".[74]Peter Bradshaw ofThe Guardiangave the film a score of 3 out of 5 stars and concluded: "Nimonais likable and engaging entertainment that finds its way through self-created chaos to some humane life-lessons".[75]Associated Presscritic Lindsay Bahr called it a "fantasy adventure withriot grrrlenergy" and praised the animation, soundtrack and lead performances.[76]
In February 2024, Quane expressed interest in making sequels and spin offs.[102]

Eugene Lee Yang(born January 18, 1986) is an American filmmaker, actor, author, activist, andinternet personality.  He is known for his work withBuzzFeed(2013–2018) and for being the co-founder of the comedy groupThe Try Guys(2014–2024)[1][2][3]and its company 2nd Try LLC.
Yang is also known for his work with various human rights andLGBTQ+ advocacycharities such asThe Trevor Project.
Yang, the only son of South Korean immigrants Min-yeong Lee (Korean:이민영) and Jae-hong Yang (Korean:양재홍), was born inWaco, Texas, and raised inPflugerville, Texas. He discovered he had some Chinese and Japanese ancestry in addition to his mostly Korean roots after taking a23andMeDNA test.[4]He has two sisters.[5]Growing up in Pflugerville, Yang's family was among few Asian Americans in their community. He struggled with body image issues and low self-esteem as, in his own words, no one looked like him, and suffered bullying due to his appearance.[6][7]
Early on, he lost hisTexan accentby the prodding of his sister, who told him he might face difficulties getting intoIvy Leagueschools.[8][5]Initially, he was skeptical about pursuing a career in film,[9]explaining that his doubts regarding gaining acceptance in mainstream media stemmed from the lack ofqueerand Asian American representation in films:[1]
I was a very insecure, self-conscious kid, and as an artist even more so. I always assumed that my otherness was a curse – that I would be held back by my Asian and queer identities. My time online has shown me that the viewers will respond most to authentic storytelling.[1]
At school, he engaged in artistic activities including visual arts, illustration, theater, choir, and dance.[10]However, a seventh-grade teacher recommended that he should consider studying filmmaking. He attended theUniversity of Southern California[1]and, during his studies, wrote and directed six short films discussing social and political topics, includingmental health care,gay marriage, andschool shootings.[11]He graduated with a B.A. in cinema production in 2008.[10]

A few of his works were centered on stereotypes, body issues, and Asian American identity,[1]producingIf Disney Princes Were Real,[12]which had earned over 70 million views, andWomen's Ideal Body Types Throughout History, which was viewed over 40 million times and remained one of the Buzzfeed's most watched, on YouTube. According to Glamour, "Yang's videos work because they're funny-with-a-message riffs on all-American cultural touchstones—like high school vs. college, awkward private moments, and, pet ownership. But he's also not afraid to tackle issues surrounding race—especially when it comes to the Asian American community."[13]
Reaction to some of his early works was positive particularly on their distinct candor and reliability, which led to more provocative sketches such as The Try Guys,[1]which was established at Buzzfeed in 2014[6]with co-starsNed Fulmer,Keith Habersberger, andZach Kornfeld. The show is a mix of social commentary and humor depicting scenarios such as men going through labor pains andprostate cancercheck at a doctor's office.[1]The cast initially were hesitant about stepping out from behind the camera as they had limited experience being talents, but they continued producing videos for the show after receiving positive feedback.[14]
Yang became a recognized name on social media, taking on challenges,[8]such as the first season's first episode, "Guys Try Ladies' Underwear For the First Time".[6]The New York Timesconsidered him as the breakout star of The Try Guys.[1]
On June 16, 2018, he and the rest of the cast of The Try Guys announced that they had left BuzzFeed and established 2nd Try LLC, a company that they own and manage.[15]The 2nd Try LLC gained all rights to The Try Guys brand.[15]Yang was the first of The Try Guys to leave Buzzfeed, as his contract was up before the other Try Guys.

The Buzzfeed video parody,Awkward Moments Only Asians Understand,[26]in which he starred, listed a slew ofracial stereotypesand dailymicroaggressions. Marcie Bianco wrote in her critique, "The microaggressions detailed in this BuzzFeed video don't have to do with the size of the Asian population, but rather highlight how stereotypes are perpetuated by generalizations. Perhaps sometimes useful shorthand, these generalizations turn into ugly and limiting stereotypes that foreclose the possibility of people knowing each other as individuals."[27]
In another related video,If Asians Said the Stuff White People Say,[28]in which he starred in together with Los Angeles-based writer and comedian Jenny Yang, featured Asian Americans asking questions and comments to white characters that were considered uncomfortable for Asian Americans.[29]In her review, Lauren Davidson wrote, "That's the first racist stereotype turned on its head in BuzzFeed Yellow's latest video, which shows, with that classic trick of role reversal, how ridiculous Asian typecasting has become."[30]

The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
