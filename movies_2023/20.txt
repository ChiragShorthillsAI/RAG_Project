The film is dedicated to Robertson.[13]
Development began in March 2016 when Imperative Entertainment won the adaptation rights to the book. Scorsese and DiCaprio were attached to the film in 2017, with production expected to begin in early 2018. Following several pushbacks and delays due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, production was scheduled to start in February 2021, withApple Studiosconfirmed to finance and distribute the film alongsideParamount Pictures.Principal photographyultimately took place between April and October 2021 inOsageandWashingtoncounties, Oklahoma. The film was produced by Scorsese'sSikelia Productionsand DiCaprio'sAppian Way Productions, with its $200–215 million budget reportedly the largest amount ever spent on a film shoot in Oklahoma.[14]

It was theatrically released in the United States on October 20, by Paramount Pictures, before streaming onApple TV+on January 12, 2024. The film grossed $158.8 million worldwide and received critical acclaim, with praise for Scorsese's direction, screenplay, production values, editing, cinematography, musical score, and cast performances, especially DiCaprio, Gladstone, and De Niro, although it received minor criticism for its runtime.

Osage Nationelders bury aceremonial pipe, mourning their descendants' assimilation intoWhite Americansociety. Wandering through theirOklahomareservation during the annual "flower moon" phenomenon of fields of blooms,[16]several Osage find oil gushing from the ground. The tribe becomes wealthy as it retainsmineral rights. However, the law requires court-appointed whitelegal guardiansto manage the money of full and half-blood members, assuming them "incompetent".[c]
In 1919,Ernest Burkhartreturns fromWorld War Ito live with his brother Byron and uncleWilliam King Haleon Hale's reservation ranch. Hale, a reserve deputy sheriff and cattle rancher, poses as a friendly benefactor to the Osage. Ernest and Byron commit armed robbery against the Osage. Ernest develops a romance withMollie Kyle, an Osage whose family owns oilheadrights. They marry in an Osage ceremony with Catholic elements and raise three children.
Hale contracts the killing of multiple wealthy Osage, explaining that Ernest will inherit more headrights the more of Mollie's family dies. Mollie isdiabetic, and her mother, Lizzie, is ill. After Mollie's sister Minnie dies of a mysterious illness, Hale orders Byron to kill another of Mollie's sisters, Anna. Lizzie and the Osage council blame the white residents and urge the tribe to fight back.
The 1921Tulsa race massacrecauses further concern amongst the Osage that they could suffer similarly. Lizzie's ancestors welcome her to the afterlife as she dies. Hale has Ernest arrange the murder of Mollie's first husband,Henry Roan, but Ernest's hitman neglects to make the murder look like a suicide as instructed. Even so, the sheriff and judges are in Hale's pocket, so there are no investigations. An Osage Nation representative seeking to lobbyCongressis murdered inWashington, D.C.Mollie hires private detectiveWilliam J. Burns, but he is run off the reservation by Ernest and Byron.
Again at Hale's behest, Ernest arranges the bombing of the home of Mollie's last surviving sister, Reta, and her husband, Bill. As the last surviving member of her family, Mollie inherits their headrights. She travels to Washington and asks PresidentCalvin Coolidgefor help. Hale orders Ernest to poison Mollie'sinsulinto "slow her down". Mollie's condition worsens, and Ernest exhibits similar symptoms after also ingesting the poison.
Bureau of InvestigationAgentThomas Bruce White Sr.and his assistants discover the truth. Hale tries to cover his tracks by murdering his hitmen, but White arrests Hale and Ernest. Two agents find Mollie near death and rush her to the hospital, where it is found that she has been repeatedly poisoned. She recovers.
White persuades Ernest to confess andturn state's evidenceagainst his uncle. Hale's attorney, W. S. Hamilton, tries to convince Ernest to claim he was tortured and recant. After his daughter dies ofwhooping cough, Ernest testifies, wanting to be around for his remaining family. Hale unsuccessfully tries to have Ernest murdered, and Mollie leaves Ernest after he refuses to admit to poisoning her.
A radio drama years later reveals the Shoun brothers were implicated in other "wasting deaths" but never prosecuted due to lack of evidence; Byron was tried as an accomplice to Anna's murder but served no prison time due to ahung jury.;[d]Hale and Ernest were sentenced to life imprisonment but later paroled despite Osage protests; and Mollie died of diabetes-related complications in 1937 at the age of 50, her obituary stating that she was buried with her parents, sisters, and daughter while making no mention of the Osage murders.
The film closes with an overhead view of a 21st-century Osagepowwowdancing circle.
The analysis of the themes in the book and film has centered on the difference betweenKillers of the Flower Moonand traditional Westerns in the old Hollywood tradition. Jorge Cotte ofThe Nationstated: "Unlike the visions of unbounded freedom found in traditional westerns, Martin Scorsese's new film is a study of a West bounded by the vertical geometry of oil rigs and the violent conspiracies of powerful men."[21]
Cotte then indicated the thematic differences between the book version and the film version of Scorsese's film, stating: "At the center of Grann's book is a set of unsolved crimes: a slew of unsolved murders, then called the 'Reign of Terror', that tormented the Osage from 1921 to 1926, and the corresponding emergence of a Bureau of Investigation (the eventual FBI) that finally arrives to determine who is doing the murdering. The book is meticulously researched and as diligent in setting the context for these shocking acts as it is in examining J. Edgar Hoover's role in shaping the bureau and using the murders as a showcase for it... Scorsese's retelling ends up being narrower in focus. It does away with much of the original's sense of suspense and Hoover's role in the investigation, and instead focuses on how an individual descends, through greed, complicity, and cowardice, into unforgivable acts of despoliation and violence."[21]
Niles Schwartz's review focuses on the film's theological dimensions, as well as the overarching theme of human greed undermining our society's ideals.[22]
On March 10, 2016, Imperative Entertainment won the bidding war to make a film adaptation ofDavid Grann's nonfiction bookKillers of the Flower Moonand paid $5 million. The studio'sDan FriedkinandBradley Thomaswould produce the film.[23]In April 2017, it was revealed thatMartin Scorsese,Leonardo DiCaprio, andRobert De Nirowere considering involvement in the film, adapted byEric Roth.[24][10]BothDe NiroandDiCapriohad long histories of working with Scorsese, but the three had collaborated only once before in the short filmThe Audition(2015).[25]
In June 2019, it was announced thatParamount Pictureswould distribute the film.[26]Scorsese later reached out toNetflixandApple TV+to finance and distribute the film, as Paramount had concerns about the film's budget reaching $200 million. Paramount was still open to a deal to be involved with the film alongside an additional partner.[27]In May 2020, Apple TV+ was announced to co-finance and co-distribute the film, with Paramount remaining as distributor.[28]
The initial script focused on the perspective ofThomas Bruce White Sr.and theBureau of Investigationcoming into Oklahoma to investigate the murders of theOsage Nation, with DiCaprio originally cast to star as White. This version of the script would have been a more faithful adaptation of Grann's book and, at one point, was nearly two hundred pages in length. Scorsese compared the initial draft to apolice proceduraland said that he and Roth struggled to complete the script due to their unfamiliarity and discomfort with writing for that genre.[29]
Scorsese and Roth worked on the script for nearly two years before DiCaprio questioned Scorsese about where the heart of the story lay. After several meetings and dinners with members of the Osage, Scorsese realized that the real story came from their perspective. During those meetings, tribe members would constantly mention the marriage between the American war veteranErnest Burkhartand the Osage tribe memberMollie Kyleand that the couple were indeed in love. This intrigued Scorsese, who concluded the heart of the film lay in the love story between Ernest and Mollie, as well as Mollie's self-deception in staying with her husband despite his onerous dealings.[29]
DiCaprio then suggested changing his role from Tom White to Ernest Burkhart, to which Scorsese agreed. Scorsese and Roth would then overhaul the script to switch the film's main perspective to the Osage community's, and to place the story's emphasis on Burkhart and his torn loyalties between his wife and his uncleWilliam King Hale.[29]Paramount felt this character change resulted in the film turning into "a moody and less commercial character study," butLily Gladstonewould later say that the Osage Nation's input had positively affected the film, stating "the work is better when you let the world inform your work".[30][31]Scorsese would citeAri Asterand his films,Midsommar(2019) andBeau Is Afraid(2023), as inspirations for the "slower...quieter" pacing ofKillers of the Flower Moon.[32]
When writing the ending, Scorsese and Roth noted how previous adaptations hadreducedthe events to being "entertainment", and instead wanted their film to "take responsibility". They had conceived various versions of the ending, including the filming of a Hollywood movie similar to that ofThe FBI Story(1959), but changed to the filming of a radio drama adaptation as the script focused on Mollie and Ernest's relationship. Wanting to avoid chyrons, Roth wrote the final tribute to Mollie, which Scorsese himself would end up delivering in the film as he felt he could not direct another actor in doing so.[33]
In July 2019, it was reported that De Niro had joined the cast, with filming tentatively set to commence in the summer of 2020.[34]At the26th Screen Actors Guild Awardson January 19, 2020, DiCaprio confirmed that he and De Niro would star in the film.[35]DiCaprio was paid $30 million for his involvement.[36]In February 2021, Gladstone andJesse Plemonswere added to the cast.[37][38]Production wanted a Native American actress to portray Mollie Kyle. Casting directorEllen Lewisfirst tipped Scorsese off to Gladstone by showing himCertain Women(2016), where Gladstone's performance impressed Scorsese.[29]
Gladstone was selected for the role after aZoomcall with Scorsese, in which they discussed Catholicism.[39]DiCaprio also endorsed Gladstone after the two actors had their own conversation on Zoom, and soon the Osage Nation gave their own approval for Gladstone.[29]The role of Thomas White, the lead BOI agent, was initially written for DiCaprio, but after DiCaprio pushed to instead portray Ernest Burkhart, Plemons was cast as White.[40]
In March 2021,Tantoo Cardinal,Cara Jade Myers, JaNae Collins, and Jillian Dion were added to the cast.[41]William Belleau,Louis Cancelmi,Jason Isbell,Sturgill Simpson,Tatanka Means, Michael Abbott Jr.,Pat Healy, andScott Shepherdjoined the next month.[42][43]In June,Steve Eastin,Gary BasarabaandBarry Corbinwere added to the cast, whileBrendan FraserandJohn Lithgowwould join in August.[44][45][46][47][48]
Filming experienced several delays. In July 2017, production designerDante Ferrettisaid that filming would begin in early 2018, with Scorsese directing and DiCaprio starring.[49]Production stalled until October 2018, when it was announced that the film would be Scorsese's next effort after completingThe Irishman(2019). At that point, filming was due to begin in summer 2019.[50]In December 2019,Rodrigo Prieto, Scorsese's frequentcinematographersinceThe Wolf of Wall Street(2013), said that the film was expected to start principal photography in March 2020, adding that the "look and feel of the film" was still being figured out.[51]In April 2020, it was announced that the filming ofKillers of the Flower Moonhad been postponed indefinitely in response to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[52]Production was expected to resume in February 2021 inOklahoma.Jack Fisksigned on as production designer for the film, marking the first collaboration between him and Martin Scorsese.[2][53]
Killers of the Flower Moonbegan principal photography on April 19, 2021, with filming taking place inOsage County, Oklahomaand Washington County, namelyPawhuska,FairfaxandBartlesville.[54][55][56]There were over 50 production locations being used, including a combination of existing structures and built sets.[39]In a news release before the beginning of filming, Scorsese said: "We are thrilled to finally start production onKillers of the Flower Moonin Oklahoma. To be able to tell this story on the land where these events took place is incredibly important and critical to allowing us to portray an accurate depiction of the time and people. We're grateful to Apple, the Oklahoma Film and Music Office and The Osage Nation, especially all our Osage consultants and cultural advisors, as we prepare."[57]
Prieto shot most of the footage using film, except for some night scenes. When the film approaches the climax, Prieto uses a Technicolor process called ENR, which enhances color contrast and reduces saturation, saying that "Everybody suddenly has this harsh feel".[39]On May 13, De Niro suffered aquadriceps muscleinjury off-set and returned toNew York Cityfor medical attention. Production was completed on time, as De Niro's subsequent scenes were filmed in June 2021.[58]When filming the radio play scene, Scorsese's family members were there, and he felt he could confidently deliver his dialogue.[39]Principal photography wrapped on October 1, 2021.[59][failed verification]In March 2022, Osage Nation Principal ChiefGeoffrey Standing Bearstated that additional footage would be shot to film a traditional community dance in mid-May in Osage County.[60]
Scorsese sought to closely involve the Osage Nation in the film's production from the beginning.[39]During pre-production, Scorsese travelled to Pawhuska, Oklahoma, to meet with Principal ChiefGeoffrey Standing Bearand learn about the tribe during the "Reign of Terror", while also discussing how they could incorporate the tribe members on the film's set.[39][61]A consultation was held with around 200 Osage people to gauge Osage points of view regarding the production.[62]
Scorsese cast Osage actors in at least 40 roles, in addition to hundreds of tribe members being hired asbackground extras. He also employed several Osage members in both small and prominent production crew roles to ensure the accuracy of the tribe during the film's time period.[39]Osage language teacher and translator Christopher Cote taught the actors theOsage languageand gave coaching about how to use it. As Osage people in the 1920s extensively used the language, the film incorporated its use.[63]
Brandy Lemon, an Osage Nation Congress member, served as liaison between the film production and the Osage community.[64]Lemon was present during the film's production and consulted on several details of the film. For example, Lemon helped instruct Gladstone on how to hold her cup.[65]Lemon credited the production for their consultative approach, saying: "They listened, that was the biggest thing. They actually listened to us."[65]
Industrial Light & Magicandvisual effects supervisorPablo Helmanprovided the visual effects for the film after previously collaborating with Scorsese onSilence(2016) andThe Irishman(2019).[66]
Frequent Scorsese collaboratorRobbie Robertson, himself havingCayugaandMohawkancestry, composed the incidental score.[67]Critics have described it as "old-timey",[68]"bluesy",[67]and "percussive".[69]The film also features a soundtrack of popular music from the 1920s andNative American songs.[67]It was Robertson's final completed film score before he died in August 2023. The film is dedicated to his memory.[70]
Killers of the Flower Moonhad its world premiere at the76th Cannes Film Festivalon May 20, 2023,[71][72][73]where the film received a nine-minutestanding ovationat the end of its screening.[74]The film's United States premiere took place on September 27, 2023, atAlice Tully HallatLincoln CenterinNew York City, with none of the cast members in attendance due to the2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[75]The film was originally set to open inselect theaterson October 6, 2023, before going wide in the United States on October 20, 2023, byApple TV+, under theirApple Original Filmslabel, and Paramount Pictures.[76]The limited release was later scrapped, with the film receiving a global theatrical rollout on October 20.[77]
As reported byVariety, Italy'sRai Cinema, alongside Leone Film Group, had acquired the rights for local theatrical release over Paramount as they managed to secure the rights in the middle of the film's production progress.[78]Right before the film's second trailer premiered in July 2023, it was announced that the film would also be released inIMAXtheatres.[79][80]
A few cinemas in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, the Netherlands, and the United States inserted their ownintermissioninto the film. The theaters were considered to violate their contract by Paramount and Apple Original Films, who took action to have it stopped. The film has been criticized for its long running time,[81]which Scorsese and editorThelma Schoonmakerhave publicly defended.[82][83]The film debuted at the #2 position at the global box office followed byVijay's filmLeo.[84]The film was released onvideo on demand(VOD) platforms on December 5, 2023, and became available for streaming on Apple TV+ on January 12, 2024.[85][86]In March 2025 it was reported that Apple declined a request from theCriterion Collectionto release the film in physical formats.[87]
Killers of the Flower Moongrossed $68 million in the United States and Canada, and $90.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $158.8 million.[4][5]Varietynoted that under a traditional theatrical release, the film would need to gross $500–600 million worldwide tobreak even.[88]In February 2024,Deadline Hollywoodreported that the film fell about $20 million short of covering its marketing budget during its theatrical run, but made that up from home rentals, leaving a net loss equivalent to its $200 million production budget for Apple.[89]However, Apple insisted the film was profitable.[3]
In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $20–25 million from 3,621 theaters in its opening weekend.[84]The film made $9.4 million on its first day, including $2.6 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $23 million. The total was above the average Scorsese–DiCaprio collaboration ($19 million), the highest opening of Scorsese–De Niro collaborations, toppingCape Fear's $10.2 million in 1991, and the third-best of Scorsese's career. 61% of the audience was male, with "an amazing" 38% over 45 years old.[84][90]The film made $9 million in its second weekend, a drop of 61%,[91]then $7 million in its third, finishing in third place both times.[92]Following its 10 Oscar nominations, the film expanded from 16 theaters to 941 in its 15th week of release and made $220,000, an increase of 3,811% from the previous weekend.[93]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 93% of 474 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Enormous in runtime, theme, and achievement,Killers of the Flower Moonis a sobering appraisal of America's relationship with Indigenous peoples and yet another artistic zenith for Martin Scorsese and his collaborators."[94]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 89 out of 100, based on 63 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[95]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled byPostTrakgave it an 88% overall positive score, with 72% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[90]
Critic Brian Tallerico onRogerEbert.comgave the film 4 out of 4 stars, writing: "In the end,Killers of the Flower Moonis like a puzzle—each creative piece does its part to form the complete picture. When it's put together, it's depressingly easy to see the wolves. The question now is, what do we do when we find them?"[96]
In his review of the "meaty and demanding" film following its premiere at Cannes, Peter Debruge ofVarietycommended the story, characters and themes, but criticized the runtime: "In its present form, [Killers of the Flower Moon] is still a compelling true story... It's engrossing from the get-go, the palpable tension methodically echoed by Robbie Robertson's steady-heartbeat score. But it keeps going and going until everyone we care about is dead, dying or behind bars, with nearly an hour still in store".[81]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterargued that "the three-and-a-half-hour running time is fully justified in an escalating tragedy that never loosens its grip" and praised the screenplay, direction, cinematography, score, and cast performances (particularly that of Gladstone).[97]
InThe Guardian,Peter Bradshawcalled the film an "epic of creeping, existential horror about the birth of theAmerican century, a macabre tale of quasi-genocidal serial killings" and also lauded the "performance of tragic force" by Gladstone.[98]TheLos Angeles Times'Justin Changobserved that the film "is both like and unlike anything its director has ever done",[73]writing: "Scorsese doesn't just achieve a sense of place; he also pulls off, not for the first time, a passionate and meticulous feat of cultural anthropology. He brings an entire bygone era to rich, teeming life, just before he chokes it off with an all-consuming stench of death."[73][99]
The film's coda in particular drew acclaim for its acknowledgement of the historical silencing of crimes committed against Indigenous peoples, with Joel Robinson ofSlatewriting the scene "turns the camera both inward and onto the audience simultaneously",[100]andThe New Yorker'sRichard Brodynoting: "Scorsese's control of form and tone, and the bold yet subtle way that he marshals incident, signal that he is intent not merely on narrating history but on troubling the conscience of his (doubtless largely white) audience".[101][102]
Much praise was given to Gladstone's performance, withAnthony LaneofThe New Yorkerdescribing her as "unmistakably the movie's most compelling presence",[103]and Chang calling her "an actor who can set off more emotional reverberations with a barely cracked smile than some performers manage in an entire monologue".[99][101][102][104]Brody observed: "[Mollie] is not only the character on whose actions the drama pivots but also the one whose subjectivity, presented sparingly but suggested powerfully, gives the story a sense of inner life."[101]
FilmmakerAlfonso Cuarónpraised the film, stating: "Scorsese has chosen a distant and reflective stance, favoring atmosphere over narrative, denying us the easy satisfaction of moral superiority to the men on screen who managed to justify their hideous betrayals of their loved ones and still pretend to have a soul, and confronting audiences with the sin by omission that must rightfully haunt the American soul."[105]FilmmakersJoe Dante,Robert Eggers,Reinaldo Marcus GreenandMax Hechtman, as well as actorBill Hader, also cited it as among their favorite films of 2023.[106][107]
Some critics lamented the film's decision to focus its narrative on the characters of Ernest and Hale, opining that the character of Mollie felt underdeveloped.[101][103][104]Chang noted: "The movie seems curiously reluctant to penetrate the psychology of its Osage characters — a reluctance that feels like timidity, respect or maybe a mix of both."[99]Angelica Jade BastiénofVulturewrote: "Trapped by the gleam of reverence, [Scorsese] ends up returning to the sameracial stereotypeshe sought to avoid: The Osage people are noble and connected to the land, but their personalities, their desires, their joys, and, most crucially, their anger remain in the shadowed hallways of a history Scorsese is too timid to approach."[104]
Killers of the Flower Moonreceived 10 nominations at the96th Academy Awards:Best Picture,Best Director,Best Actress,Best Supporting Actor,Best Cinematography,Best Costume Design,Best Film Editing,Best Original Score,Best Original Song, andBest Production Design.[108][109]The film received zero awards at the 96th Academy Awards.[110]It was longlisted, along withBarbieandOppenheimer, in 15 categories at the77th British Academy Film Awards, equaling the BAFTA longlist record for most nominations set byEdward Berger's Germananti-war filmAll Quiet on the Western Front(2022).[111]
For her portrayal of Mollie Burkhart, Gladstone became the first Indigenous American actress to be nominated for an Academy Award.[112]At age 81, Scorsese earned his tenth nomination for Best Director,[f]garnering more Oscar nominations for that category (including one prior win) than anyone alive.[113]Scorsese also became the oldest Best Director nominee, eclipsingJohn Huston,[g]who was 79. Schoonmaker earned her ninth nomination for Best Editing, surpassing the record for most nominations in this category.[114]Robbie Robertson earned his first Academy Award nomination (for Best Original Score), becoming the 64th individual to earn aposthumous nominationfor acompetitive category.[115]
Gladstone's loss toEmma Stonefor Best Actress (forPoor Things) at the 96th Academy Awards stirred debate over what some deemed a "snub".[116]Some argued that awarding Stone was a missed opportunity for greater inclusivity to Native Americans, with others arguing that since Stone had already won Best Actress for her performance inLa La Land(2016), Gladstone was more deserving of the award.[117]Stone herself was surprised at her win, stating: "I think I blacked out. I was very shocked."[118]
In its summary of 2024 Oscar winners and losers,Billboardmagazine classified the movie's lack of Academy Awards, despite 10 nominations, as a snub, noting: "OK, that happens at awards shows. But this was director Martin Scorsese's third film to go 0-10 on Oscar night, followingGangs of New York(2002) andThe Irishman(2019). Scorsese is universally acknowledged as one of the greatest directors of our time. For it to happen three times to the same director – a legend, no less – is hard to explain."[119]
Lindsey Bark of theCherokee Phoenixwrote that there was "hope that this film opens up more discussion among non-Native people about the real tragedies that have occurred to Native people throughout history".[120]However, Christopher Kuo ofThe New York Timeswrote that, despite broad agreement in Indigenous circles that the film accurately portrays the culture and language of the Osage people, there was a mixed overall reaction to the film among indigenous people.[62]
At the film's Los Angeles premiere, Christopher Cote, an Osage who was a language consultant for the film, said that he "really wanted this to be from the perspective of Mollie and what her family experienced".[121]Slate's Joel Robinson, an Osage, expressed similar views, but still praised the film, concurring with former chief of the Osage Nation Jim Gray that he had "never seen a film immerse itself in a culture like this one did with ours". He added that he hoped that the success of the film would mean more opportunities for Indigenous filmmakers to tell stories from their own point of view.[100][122]
Maureen Lee Lenker noted inEntertainment Weeklythatfirst NationsactressDevery Jacobs(Elora Danan Postoak onReservation Dogs) shared her reaction to the film: "Being Native, watching this movie was f---ing hellfire ... Our pride, languages, cultures, joy & love are way more interesting & humanizing than showing the horrors white men inflicted on us." Jacobs did believe that Gladstone "carried Mollie [with] tremendous grace" and that no performances were weak, but still argued that "each of the Osage characters felt painfully underwritten, while the white men were given way more courtesy and depth".[123]Lindsey Bark quotedCherokee Nationcitizen Tim Landes as saying: "This movie is another example of why it's important our tribe continues to invest in our filmmakers, so we can share accurate stories that show our side. We can't trust other filmmakers to get it right, even if they are a legend like Martin Scorsese."[120]
Some were more positive. Indigenous commentator Kate Nelson wrote: "When it comes to Native representation, isKillers of the Flower Moonperfect? No. Is it progress? Yes. The film meaningfully moves the entertainment industry forward, making a strong statement that it's no longer acceptable to extract valuable assets from Indigenous communities – whether that be our stories or our natural resources – without our consent and input."[124]Gianna Sieke, an Osage princess from 2021 to 2023[125]who was present for the film's production,[65]toldToday: "It does tell our dark history but it's also including things that no one really knows, and it hasn't been expressed to Osage people and anyone because it's a dark history. People don't really talk about it that much. And because of that, (the movie) has made a really big impact. Families are learning to cope and understand."[65]
On November 9, 2023, the day that theSAG-AFTRA strikeended, Gladstone posted on social media encouraging Native people to "see it when and only if you feel ready, and see it with people you feel safe with. You'll likely have a lot ofgenerational griefto process".[126][127]
Lieutenant Governor of OklahomaMatt Pinnellnamed the film as a reason to increase subsidies for the film industry in Oklahoma. The Filmed in Oklahoma Act of 2021 allocated $30 million to film subsidies. Bills to increase the total available subsidies to $80 million in 2023 failed in theOklahoma Senateafter passing theOklahoma House of Representatives.[128]

Martin Charles Scorsese(/skɔːrˈsɛsi/skor-SESS-ee,[1][2]Italian:[skorˈseːze,-se]; born November17, 1942) is an American filmmaker. He emerged as one of the major figures of theNew Hollywoodera. He has receivedmany accolades, including anAcademy Award, fourBAFTA Awards, threeEmmy Awards, aGrammy Award, and threeGolden Globe Awards. He has been honored with theAFI Life Achievement Awardin 1997, theFilm Society of Lincoln Centertribute in 1998, theKennedy Center Honorin 2007, theCecil B. DeMille Awardin 2010, and theBAFTA Fellowshipin 2012. Four of his films have been inducted into theNational Film Registryby theLibrary of Congressas "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant".
Scorsese received a Master of Arts degree fromNew York University'sSteinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Developmentin 1968. His directorial debut,Who's That Knocking at My Door(1967), was accepted into theChicago Film Festival. In the 1970s and 1980s,Scorsese's films, much influenced by hisItalian-Americanbackground and upbringing in New York City, centered on macho-posturing men and explore crime, machismo,nihilismandCatholicconcepts of guilt and redemption.[3][4]His trademark styles include extensive use ofslow motionandfreeze frames, graphic depictions of extreme violence and liberal use ofprofanity.Mean Streets(1973) was a blueprint for his filmmaking styles.
Scorsese won thePalme d'OratCanneswithTaxi Driver(1976), which starredRobert De Niroas a disturbed Vietnam Veteran. De Niro becameassociated with Scorsese through eight more filmsincludingNew York, New York(1977),Raging Bull(1980),The King of Comedy(1982),Goodfellas(1990),Casino(1995) andThe Irishman(2019). In the following decades, he garnered box office success with aseries of collaborationswithLeonardo DiCaprio, includingGangs of New York(2002),The Aviator(2004),The Departed(2006),Shutter Island(2010), andThe Wolf of Wall Street(2013). He worked with both De Niro and DiCaprio onKillers of the Flower Moon(2023). He also directedAfter Hours(1985),The Color of Money(1986),The Last Temptation of Christ(1988),The Age of Innocence(1993),Kundun(1997),Hugo(2011), andSilence(2016).
On television, he has directed episodes for theHBOseriesBoardwalk Empire(2010–2014) andVinyl(2016), as well as the HBO documentaryPublic Speaking(2010) and theNetflixdocu-seriesPretend It's a City(2021). He has also directed several rock documentaries includingThe Last Waltz(1978),No Direction Home(2005), andShine a Light(2008). He has explored film history in the documentariesA Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies(1995) andMy Voyage to Italy(1999).[5]An advocate forfilm preservationandrestoration, he has founded three nonprofit organizations:The Film Foundationin 1990, theWorld Cinema Foundationin 2007 and the African Film Heritage Project in 2017.[6]
Martin Charles Scorsese[7][a]was born in theFlushingneighborhood of New York City's Queens borough on November 17, 1942.[9][10]He grew up in theLittle Italyneighborhood of the city's Manhattan borough.[11]Both of his parents,Catherine Scorsese(née Cappa) andCharles Scorsese, worked in theGarment District. Charles was a clothes presser and actor, while Catherine was a seamstress and an actress.[12]All four of Scorsese's grandparents were Italian immigrants fromSicily, hailing fromPolizzi Generosaon his father's side andCiminnaon his mother's side.[13][14]The original surname of the family was Scozzese, meaning "Scot" or "Scottish" in Italian, and was later changed to Scorsese because of a transcription error.[15][16][17]
Scorsese was raised in a predominantlyCatholicenvironment.[9]As a boy, he hadasthmaand could not play sports or take part in any activities with other children, so his parents and his older brother would often take him to movie theaters; it was at this stage in his life that he developed a passion for cinema. He has spoken of the influence ofPowell and Pressburger'sBlack Narcissus(1947) andThe Red Shoes(1948).[18]As a teenager inthe Bronx, he frequently rented Powell and Pressburger'sThe Tales of Hoffmann(1951) from a store that had one copy of the reel. He was one of only two people who regularly rented it; the other,George A. Romero, also became a director.[19]
Scorsese has namedSabuandVictor Matureas his favorite actors in his youth. He recalls his father taking him to seeJean Renoir'sThe River(1951) and being fascinated by its depiction ofIndia. He became "obsessed" with Renoir'sLa Grande Illusion(1937) when it was rereleased.[20]He namesJohn Ford'sThe Quiet Man(1952) andThe Searchers(1956) as formative influences.[21]In a documentary onItalian neorealism, he commented on howRoberto Rossellini'sRome, Open City(1945) andVittorio De Sica'sBicycle Thieves(1946) inspired him and influenced his view of his Sicilian roots. In his documentaryIl Mio Viaggio in Italia(My Voyage to Italy), Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of  Rossellini'sPaisà(1946), which he first saw on television with his relatives who were themselves Sicilian immigrants, had a significant impact on his life.[22]He remembers responding "very strongly" toAlfred Hitchcock'sVertigo(1958).[23]He acknowledges owing a great debt to theFrench New Waveand has stated that "the French New Wave has influenced all filmmakers who have worked since, whether they saw the films or not."[24]He has also cited the works ofSatyajit Ray,[22]Ingmar Bergman,[25][26]Andrzej Wajda,[27]Michelangelo Antonioni,[28]Federico Fellini,[29]Ishirō HondaandEiji Tsuburaya[30]as major influences on his career. Although there was no habit of reading at home, towards the end of the 1950s, Scorsese began to approach literature, being marked in particular byFyodor Dostoevsky'sNotes from Underground(1864),James Joyce'sA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man(1916) andGraham Greene'sThe Heart of the Matter(1948).[31]
Scorsese attended the all-boysCardinal Hayes High Schoolin the Bronx, graduating in 1960.[32]He had initially desired to become apriest, attending a preparatoryseminary, but failed after the first year and was unable to attendFordham University.[33][34]This gave way to cinema and consequently Scorsese enrolled inNew York University'sWashington Square College(now known as theCollege of Arts and Science), where he earned a bachelor's degree in English in 1964.[32][35]He went on to earn his Master of Arts from NYU's School of Education (now theSteinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development) in 1968,[36][37]a year after the school was founded.[38]
While attending the Tisch School of the Arts, Scorsese made the short filmsWhat's a Nice Girl like You Doing in a Place like This?(1963) andIt's Not Just You, Murray!(1964). His most famous short of the period is the darkly comicThe Big Shave(1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement inVietnam, suggested by its alternative titleViet '67.[39]Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by film professorHaig P. Manoogian.[40]Scorsese's first professional job was when he was at NYU he was the assistant cameraman to cinematographerBaird Bryanton theJohn G. Avildsendirected short filmSmiles(1964). Scorsese stated: "It was really important because they were filming on 35mm". He stated he was terrible at the job because he could not judge the distance of the focus. He also worked as agafferforAlbert and David Mayslesand as an editor forCBS News, the later of whom offered him a full time position, but Scorsese declined due to his pursuit in film.[41]
In 1967, Scorsese made his first feature-length film, the black and whiteI Call First, later retitledWho's That Knocking at My Door, with his fellow students actorHarvey Keiteland editorThelma Schoonmaker, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators.Roger Ebertsaw the film at the 1967Chicago International Film Festivaland wrote, in Scorsese's first published review: "it brings together two opposing worlds of American cinema. On the one hand, there have been traditional films likeMarty,View from the Bridge,On the WaterfrontandDavid and Lisa-- all sincere attempts to function at the level where real lives are led and all suffering to some degree from their makers' romantic and idealistic ideas, about such lives. On the other hand, there have been experimental films fromJonas Mekas,Shirley Clarkeand other pioneers of the New York underground. InThe Connection,ShadowsandGuns of the Trees, they used improvised dialog and scenes and hidden and hand-held cameras in an attempt to capture the freshness of a spontaneous experience ...I Call Firstbrings these two kinds of films together into a work that is absolutely genuine, artistically satisfying and technically comparable to the best films being made anywhere. I have no reservations in describing it as a great moment in American movies."[42]
Scorsese became friends with the influential "movie brats" of the 1970s:Brian De Palma,Francis Ford Coppola,George LucasandSteven Spielberg.[43][44]It was De Palma who introduced Scorsese toRobert De Niro.[43]During this period, Scorsese worked as the assistant director and one of the editors onMichael Wadleigh's documentaryWoodstock(1970) and met actor–directorJohn Cassavetes, who became a close friend and mentor.[45]
Scorsese metRoger Cormanafter coming to Hollywood to editMedicine Ball Caravanand Corman, who had seen and likedWho's That Knocking at My Door, asked Scorsese to make a sequel toBloody Mama(1970). This came to beBoxcar Bertha(1972).[46][45]It was Corman who taught Scorsese that entertaining films could be shot with very little money or time, preparing the young director well for the challenges to come. Following the film's release, Cassavetes encouraged Scorsese to make the films that he wanted to make, rather than someone else's projects.
Mean Streetswas a breakthrough for Scorsese, Keitel andRobert De Niro.Pauline Kaelwrote: "Martin Scorsese'sMean Streetsis a true original of our time, a triumph of personal filmmaking. It has its own hallucinatory look; the characters live in the darkness of bars, with lighting and color just this shade of lurid ... It's about American life here and now, and it doesn't look like an American movie, or feel like one. If it were subtitled, we could hail a new European or South American talent — a newBuñuelsteeped inVerdi, perhaps."[47]By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though the majority ofMean Streetswas shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing, and a soundtrack with contemporary music. Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style, and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to Cassavetes,Samuel Fullerand earlyJean-Luc Godard.[48]In 1974, actressEllen Burstynchose Scorsese to direct her inAlice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Although well regarded, the film remains an anomaly in Scorsese's early career as it focuses on a central female character. Returning to Little Italy to explore his ethnic roots, Scorsese directedItalianamerican(1974), a documentary featuring his parents Charles and Catherine Scorsese.
Scorsese followed withTaxi Driverin 1976, which depicted aVietnamveteran who takes the law into his own hands on New York's crime-ridden streets.[49]The film established him as an accomplished filmmaker and also brought attention to cinematographerMichael Chapman, whose style tends towards high contrasts, strong colors, and complex camera movements. The film starred De Niro as the angry and alienatedTravis Bickle, and co-starredJodie Fosterin a highly controversial role as an underage prostitute, with Harvey Keitel as her pimp.[50]Taxi Driveralso marked the start of a series of collaborations between Scorsese and writerPaul Schrader, whose influences included the diary of would-be assassinArthur Bremer,John Ford'sThe Searchers(1956), andRobert Bresson'sPickpocket(1959).[51]Already controversial upon its release,Taxi Driverhit the headlines again five years later, whenJohn Hinckley Jr.made an assassination attempt on then-presidentRonald Reagan. He subsequently blamed his act on his obsession with Jodie Foster'sTaxi Drivercharacter (in the film, De Niro's character, Travis Bickle, makes an assassination attempt on a senator).[52]
Taxi Driverwon thePalme d'Orat the 1976 Cannes Film Festival,[53]also receiving fourOscarnominations, includingBest Picture. The critical and financial success ofTaxi Driverencouraged Scorsese to move ahead with his first big-budget project: the highly stylized musicalNew York, New York. This tribute to Scorsese's home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure. The film was the director's third collaboration with De Niro, co-starring withLiza Minnelli. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized byFrank Sinatra. Although possessing Scorsese's usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work. Despite its weak reception, the film is regarded positively by some critics.Richard Brodywrote:
For Scorsese, a lifelong cinephile, the essence of New York could be found in its depiction in classic Hollywood movies. Remarkably, his backward-looking tribute to the golden age of musicals and noirish romantic melodramas turned out to be one of his most freewheeling and personal films.[54]
In 1977, he directed the Broadway musicalThe Act, starring Minnelli.[55]The disappointing reception ofNew York, New Yorkdrove Scorsese into depression. By this stage Scorsese had developed a seriouscocaineaddiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regardedThe Last Waltz, documenting the final concert byThe Band. It was held at theWinterland Ballroomin San Francisco onThanksgiving Day, 1976, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, includingBob Dylan,Neil Young,Ringo Starr,Muddy Waters,Joni Mitchell,Van Morrison,Paul Butterfield,Neil Diamond,Ronnie WoodandEric Clapton. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978. Another Scorsese-directed documentary, titledAmerican Boy, also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared inTaxi Driver. A period of wild partying followed, damaging Scorsese's already fragile health. Scorsese helped provide footage for the documentaryElvis on Tour.
By several accounts (Scorsese's included), De Niro saved Scorsese's life when he persuaded him to kick hiscocaineaddiction to make his highly regarded filmRaging Bull.Mark Singersummarized Scorsese's condition:
He (Scorsese) was more than mildly depressed. Drug abuse, and abuse of his body in general, culminated in a terrifying episode of internal bleeding. Robert De Niro came to see him in the hospital and asked, in so many words, whether he wanted to live or die. If you want to live, De Niro proposed, let's make this picture—referring toRaging Bull, an as-told-to book by Jake LaMotta, the former world middleweight boxing champion, that De Niro had given him to read years earlier.[56]
Convinced that he would never make another movie, he poured his energies into making the violent biopic of middleweight boxing championJake LaMotta, calling it akamikazemethod of film-making.[57]The film is widely viewed as a masterpiece and was voted the greatest film of the 1980s by Britain'sSight & Soundmagazine.[58][59]It received eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture,Best Actorfor De Niro,Best Supporting ActressforCathy Moriarty,Best Supporting ActorforJoe Pesciand Scorsese's first forBest Director. De Niro won, as did Thelma Schoonmaker for editing, but Best Director went toRobert RedfordforOrdinary People. From this work onwards, Scorsese's films are always labeled as "A Martin Scorsese Picture" on promotional material.Raging Bull, filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese's style reached its zenith:Taxi DriverandNew York, New Yorkhad used elements ofexpressionismto replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensiveslow-motion, complextracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight).[60]Thematically too, the concerns carried on fromMean StreetsandTaxi Driver: insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.
Although the screenplay forRaging Bullwas credited to Paul Schrader andMardik Martin(who earlier co-wroteMean Streets), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft. It was rewritten several times by various writers includingJay Cocks. The final draft was largely written by Scorsese and De Niro.[61]In 1997, theAmerican Film InstituterankedRaging Bullas the twenty-fourth greatest American film of all time on theirAFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movieslist. In 2007, they rankedRaging Bullas the fourth American greatest film on theirAFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)list.
Scorsese's next project was his fifth collaboration with De Niro,The King of Comedy(1982). It is asatireon the world of media and celebrity, whose central character is a troubledlonerwho ironically becomes famous through a criminal act (kidnapping).[62]The film was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with. Visually, it was far less kinetic than the style Scorsese had developed previously, often using a static camera and long takes.[63]Here the expressionism of his previous work gave way to moments of almost totalsurrealism. It still bore many of Scorsese's trademarks, however.TheKing of Comedyfailed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release. German directorWim Wendersnumbered it among his 15 favorite films.[64]In 1983, Scorsese made a briefcameo appearanceinAnna Pavlova(also known asA Woman for All Time), originally intended to be directed by one of his heroes,Michael Powell. This led to a more significant acting appearance inBertrand Tavernier'sjazzfilmRound Midnight. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode ofSteven Spielberg'sAmazing Stories.
WithAfter Hours(1985), for which he won aBest Director Awardat Cannes, Scorsese made an esthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost "underground" film-making style. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in theSoHoneighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor (Griffin Dunne) and features cameos by such disparate actors asTeri GarrandCheech & Chong. Along with the 1987Michael Jacksonmusic video "Bad", in 1986 Scorsese madeThe Color of Money, a sequel toRobert Rossen'sThe Hustler(1961) withPaul Newman, which co-starredTom Cruise. Although adhering to Scorsese's established style,The Color of Moneywas Scorsese's first official foray into mainstream film-making. The film finally won Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him:The Last Temptation of Christ.
In 1983, Scorsese began work on this long-cherished personal project.The Last Temptation of Christ, based on the1955 novelbyNikos Kazantzakis, retold the life ofChristin human rather than divine terms.Barbara Hersheyrecalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filmingBoxcar Bertha.[65]The film was slated to shoot under theParamount Picturesbanner, but shortly before principal photography was to start, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version,Aidan Quinnwas cast as Jesus, andStingwas cast asPontius Pilate. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played byWillem DafoeandDavid Bowierespectively.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project;Universal Picturesagreed to finance the film as Scorsese agreed to make a more mainstream film for the studio in the future (it eventually resulted inCape Fear).[66]Even prior to its 1988 release, the film (adapted byTaxi DriverandRaging Bullveteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceivedblasphemyeffectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation.[67]Most of the controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family withMary Magdalenein aSatan-inducedhallucinationwhile on the cross.
In 1986, Scorsese directed the 18-minute short filmBadfeaturingMichael JacksonandWesley Snipes(in his film debut). The short also serves as amusic videoand was shot in theHoyt–Schermerhorn Streets stationinBrooklynover a 6-week period during November and December 1986. Chapman was the film's cinematographer. The direction and choreography were heavily influenced byWest Side Story(1961). Scorsese also noted the influence ofTaxi DriverinSpike Lee's documentaryBad 25(2012).[68]The short has been praised by critics as one of the greatest and most iconic videos of all time.[69][70][71]That year, he had signed a deal with upstart majorThe Walt Disney Studiosto produce and direct features, following the success ofThe Color of Money.[72]
Looking past the controversy,The Last Temptation of Christgained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. He received his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing toBarry LevinsonforRain Man). Scorsese directed "Life Lessons", one of three segments in the anthology filmNew York Stories(1989). Ebert gave the film a mixed review, while praising Scorsese's short as "really successful".[73]
After a decade of films considered by critics to be mixed results, some considered Scorsese's gangster epicGoodfellas(1990) his return to directorial form, and his most confident and fully realized film sinceRaging Bull. De Niro andJoe Pescioffered a virtuoso display of Scorsese's bravura cinematic technique in the film and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released,Roger Ebert, a friend and supporter of Scorsese, namedGoodfellas"the best mob movie ever". It is ranked No. 1 on Ebert's movie list for 1990, along with those ofGene SiskelandPeter Travers', and is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements.[74][75][76]The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination but again lost to a first-time director,Kevin Costner(Dances with Wolves). Joe Pesci earned theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actorfor his performance. Scorsese and the film also won many other awards, including fiveBAFTAAwards, aSilver Lionand more. The American Film Institute placedGoodfellasat No. 94 on the AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. On the 2007 updated version, they movedGoodfellasup to No. 92 on the AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition) and putGoodfellasat No. 2 ontheir list of the top 10 gangster films(afterThe Godfather).
In 1990, he released his only short-form documentary:Made in Milanabout fashion designerGiorgio Armani. The following year broughtCape Fear, a remake of a cult1962 movieof the same name and the director's seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily fromAlfred HitchcockandCharles Laughton'sThe Night of the Hunter(1955).Cape Fearreceived a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depictingmisogynisticviolence. However, the lurid subject matter gave Scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it stood as Scorsese's most commercially successful release untilThe Aviator(2004), and thenThe Departed(2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.39:1.
In 1990, Scorsese acted in a small role asVincent van Goghin the filmDreamsby Japanese directorAkira Kurosawa. Scorsese's 1994 cameo appearance in theRobert RedfordfilmQuiz Showis remembered for the telling line: "You see, the audience didn't tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability. They just wanted to watch the money."
In 1994, Scorsese and producer Barbara De Fina formed the production company 
De Fina-Cappa.[77]In the early 1990s, Scorsese also expanded his role as a film producer. He produced a wide range of films, including major Hollywood studio productions (Mad Dog and Glory,Clockers), low-budget independent films (The Grifters,Naked in New York,Grace of My Heart,Search and Destroy,The Hi-Lo Country), and even the foreign film (Con gli occhi chiusi(With Closed Eyes)).
The Age of Innocence(1993) was a significant departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of theEdith Whartonnovelabout the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon its original release but was abox office bomb, making an overall loss. As noted inScorsese on Scorseseby editor–interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.
Scorsese was interested in doing a "romantic piece", and he was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text. Scorsese wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this end, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that had had an emotional impact on him. InScorsese on Scorsese, he documents influences from films such asLuchino Visconti'sSensoand hisIl Gattopardo(The Leopard) as well asOrson Welles'sThe Magnificent Ambersonsand also Roberto Rossellini'sLa prise de pouvoir par Louis XIV(The Taking of Power by Louis XIV). AlthoughThe Age of Innocencewas ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including Best Adapted Screenplay for Scorsese), winning the Costume Design Oscar. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award-winning actorDaniel Day-Lewis, with whom he would work again onGangs of New York. This was Scorsese's first film to be shot on Super 35 format.
Casino(1995), likeThe Age of Innocencebefore it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to the director's fans who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film.Casinowas a box office success,[78]and it received generally positive notices from critics. Comparisons were drawn to his earlier filmGoodfellas, and Scorsese admittedCasinobore a superficial resemblance to it, but he maintained that the story was significantly larger in scope.[79]Sharon Stonewas nominated for theBest Actress Academy Awardfor her performance. During the filming, Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.
Scorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995, titledA Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies, offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career. He said, "I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries." In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as (1) the director as storyteller; (2) the director as an illusionist: D. W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; (3) the director as a smuggler—filmmakers such asDouglas Sirk, Samuel Fuller, andVincente Minnelli, who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and (4) the director as iconoclast. In the preface to this documentary, Scorsese states his commitment to the "Director's Dilemma", in which a successful contemporary director must be pragmatic about the realities of getting financing for films of personal esthetic interest by accepting the need of "making one film for the studio, and (then) making one for oneself."
IfThe Age of Innocencealienated and confused some fans, thenKundun(1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life ofTenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, thePeople's Liberation Army's entry intoTibet, and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not only a departure in subject matter,Kundunsaw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaboratetableauof colorful visual images.[80]The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor,Buena Vista Pictures, which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurtingKundun's commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it appearsKundunhas been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour.Kundunwas Scorsese's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, followingThe Last Temptation of Christ.
Bringing Out the Dead(1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlierTaxi Driver.[81]Like earlier Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recall the films of Robert Bresson.[82](It is also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent ofAfter Hours.) It received generally positive reviews,[83]although not the universal critical acclaim of some of his other films. It starsNicolas Cage,Ving Rhames,John Goodman,Tom Sizemore, andPatricia Arquette.
On various occasions Scorsese has been asked to present theHonorary Academy Awardduring the Oscar telecast. In 1998, at the70th Academy Awards, Scorsese presented the award to film legendStanley Donen. When accepting the award Donen quipped, "Marty this is backwards, I should be giving this to you, believe me".[84]In 1999, at the71st Academy Awards, Scorsese and De Niro presented the award to film directorElia Kazan. This was a controversial pick for the academy due to Kazan's involvement with theHollywood blacklistin the 1950s.[85]Several members of the audience includingNick NolteandEd Harrisrefused to applaud Kazan when he received the award while others such asWarren Beatty,Meryl Streep,Kathy Bates, andKurt Russellgave him a standing ovation.[86][87]
In 1999, Scorsese directed a documentary on Italian filmmakers titledIl Mio Viaggio in Italia, also known asMy Voyage to Italy. The documentary foreshadowed Scorsese's next project, the epicGangs of New York(2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famousCinecittàfilm studios. With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million,Gangs of New Yorkwas Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. LikeThe Age of Innocence, it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actorLeonardo DiCaprio, who became a fixture in later Scorsese films. The production was highly troubled, with many rumors referring to the director's conflict withMiramax FilmsbossHarvey Weinstein.[88]Despite denials of artistic compromise, some felt that it was Scorsese's most conventional film, featuring standard film tropes that Scorsese had traditionally avoided, such as characters existing purely forexpositionpurposes and explanatoryflashbacks.[89][90][91]
The final cut of the movie ran to 168 minutes, while Scorsese's original cut was over 180 minutes long.[89]Even so, the film received generally positive reviews with the review aggregatorRotten Tomatoesreporting that 75 percent of the reviews for the film they tallied were positive and summarizing the critics writing, "Though flawed, the sprawling, messyGangs of New Yorkis redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis's electrifying performance."[92]The film's central themes are consistent with Scorsese's established concerns: New York, violence as culturally endemic, and subcultural divisions down ethnic lines. Originally filmed for a release in the winter of 2001 (to qualify for Academy Award nominations), Scorsese delayed the final production of the film until after the beginning of 2002; Miramax Films consequently delayed the film until its release in theOscar seasonof late 2002.[93]Gangs of New Yorkearned Scorsese his first Golden Globe for Best Director. In February 2003,Gangs of New Yorkreceived 10 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis; however, it did not win in any category.
The following year, Scorsese completed production ofThe Blues, an expansive seven-part documentary tracing the history of blues music from its African roots to the Mississippi Delta and beyond. Seven filmmakers including Wim Wenders,Clint Eastwood,Mike Figgis, and Scorsese himself each contributed a 90-minute film (Scorsese's entry was titledFeel Like Going Home). In the early 2000s, Scorsese produced several films for up-and-coming directors, such asYou Can Count on Me(directed byKenneth Lonergan),Rain(directed by Katherine Lindberg),Lymelife(directed byDerick Martini) andThe Young Victoria(directed byJean-Marc Vallée). At that time, he establishedSikelia Productions.[94]In 2003, producerEmma Tillinger Koskoffjoined the company.[95]Scorsese also produced several documentaries, such asThe Soul of a Man(directed by Wim Wenders) andLightning in a Bottle(directed byAntoine Fuqua).
Scorsese's filmThe Aviator(2004) is a lavish, large-scalebiopicof eccentric aviation pioneer and film mogulHoward Hughesand reunited Scorsese with actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The film received highly positive reviews.[96][97][98][99][100]The film was a widespread box office success and gained Academy recognition.The Aviatorwas nominated for sixGolden Globe Awards, includingBest Motion Picture-Drama,Best Director,Best Screenplay, andBest Actor-Motion Picture Dramafor Leonardo DiCaprio. It won three, including Best Motion Picture-Drama and Best Actor-Motion Picture Drama. In January 2005The Aviatorbecame the most-nominated film of the77th Academy Awardsnominations, nominated in 11 categories including Best Picture. The film also garnered nominations in nearly all the other major categories, including a fifth Best Director nomination for Scorsese. Despite having the most nominations, the film won only five Oscars. Scorsese lost again, this time to director Clint Eastwood forMillion Dollar Baby(which also won Best Picture).
No Direction Homeis a documentary film by Scorsese that tells of the life of Bob Dylan, and his impact on American popular music and the culture of the 20th century. The film does not cover Dylan's entire career; it focuses on his beginnings, his rise to fame in the 1960s, his then-controversial transformationfrom an acoustic guitar-based musician and performer to an electric guitar-influenced sound and his "retirement" from touring in 1966 following an infamous motorcycle accident. The film was first presented on television in both the United States (as part of thePBSAmerican Mastersseries) and the United Kingdom (as part of theBBC TwoArenaseries) on September 26 to 27, 2005. A DVD version of the film was released the same month. The film won aPeabody Awardand theGrammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video. In addition, Scorsese received aPrimetime Emmy Awardnomination forOutstanding Directing for a Documentary/Nonfiction Program, losing toBaghdad ER.
Scorsese returned to the crime genre with the Boston-set thrillerThe Departed, based on the Hong Kong police dramaInfernal Affairs(which is co-directed byAndrew LauandAlan Mak). The film continued Scorsese's collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio and was the first time he worked withMatt Damon,Jack Nicholson,Mark Wahlberg, andMartin Sheen.The Departedopened to widespread critical acclaim, with some proclaiming it as one of the best efforts Scorsese had brought to the screen since 1990'sGoodfellas,[101][102]and still others putting it at the same level as Scorsese's most celebrated classicsTaxi DriverandRaging Bull.[103][104]With domestic box office receipts surpassingUS$129.4million,The Departedwas Scorsese's highest-grossing film (not accounting for inflation) until 2010'sShutter Island.The Departedearned Scorsese a second Golden Globe for Best Director, as well as a Critics' Choice Award, his firstDirectors Guild of AmericaAward, and the Academy Award for Best Director. Presented with the latter, Scorsese poked fun at his track record of nominations, asking, "Could you double-check the envelope?"[105]The award was presented by his longtime friends and colleaguesFrancis Ford Coppola,George LucasandSteven Spielberg.The Departedalso received the Academy Award for the Best Motion Picture of 2006, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing by longtime Scorsese editor Thelma Schoonmaker, her third win for a Scorsese film.

In 2009, Scorsese signed a petition in support of directorRoman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown "freely and safely", and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door "for actions of which no-one can know the effects."[107][108]

Several recurring filmmaking techniques are identifiable in many of Scorsese's films. He has established a filmmaking history which involves repeat collaborations with actors, screenwriters, film editors, and cinematographers, sometimes extending over several decades, such as that with recurring cinematographersMichael Ballhaus,Robert Richardson, andRodrigo Prieto.
Scorsese is known for his frequent use ofslow motion, for example, inWho's That Knocking at My Door(1967) andMean Streets(1973).[178]He is also known for usingfreeze frames, such as: in the opening credits ofThe King of Comedy(1983), throughoutGoodfellas(1990),Casino(1995),The Departed(2006), and inThe Irishman(2019). His blonde leading ladies are usually seen through the eyes of the protagonist as angelic and ethereal; they wear white in their first scene and are photographed in slow motion—Cybill ShepherdinTaxi Driver;Cathy Moriarty's white bikini inRaging Bull; Sharon Stone's white minidress inCasino.[179]This may be a nod to director Alfred Hitchcock.[180]Scorsese often uses long tracking shots,[181]as seen inTaxi Driver,Goodfellas,Casino,Gangs of New York, andHugo.MOSsequences set to popular music or voice-over are regularly seen in his films, often involving aggressive camera movement or rapid editing.[182]Scorsese sometimes highlights characters in a scene with an iris, an homage to 1920ssilent filmcinema (as scenes at the time sometimes used this transition). This effect can be seen inCasino(it is used on Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci),Life Lessons,The Departed(on Matt Damon), andHugo. Some of his films include references/allusions to Westerns, particularlyRio Bravo,The Great Train Robbery,Shane,The Searchers, andThe Oklahoma Kid. Slow motion flashbulbs and accented camera/flash/shutter sounds are often used, as is the song "Gimme Shelter" by The Rolling Stones heard in several of Scorsese's films:Goodfellas,Casino, andThe Departed.
Scorsese usually has a quick cameo in his films (Who's That Knocking at My Door,Boxcar Bertha,Mean Streets,Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,Taxi Driver,The King of Comedy,After Hours,The Last Temptation of Christ(albeit hidden under a hood),The Age of Innocence,Gangs of New York,Hugo,Killers of the Flower Moon), he is also known to contribute his voice to a film without appearing on screen (e.g. as inThe AviatorandThe Wolf of Wall Street). InThe Age of Innocence, for example, he appears in the non-speaking role of alarge formatportrait photographer in one of the passing scenes of the film. He provides the opening voice-over narration inMean StreetsandThe Color of Money; plays the off-screen dressing room attendant in the final scene ofRaging Bull, and provides the voice of the unseen ambulance dispatcher inBringing Out the Dead.[183]He also appears as the director of fictional newly formed Vatican Television in the Italian comedyIn the Pope's Eye.
Guilt is a prominent theme in many of his films, as is the role ofCatholicismin creating and dealing withguilt(Who's That Knocking at My Door,Mean Streets,Raging Bull,Bringing Out the Dead,The Departed,Shutter Island, andThe Irishman). In a similar manner, Scorsese consideredSilencea "passion project": it had been in development since 1990, two years after the release of his filmThe Last Temptation of Christ, which also contained strongly religious themes.[184]When asked why he retained interest in a project dealing with strong theological themes for over 26 years, Scorsese said,
As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people in my life and my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there's got to be more ...Silenceis just something that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, it has to be done ... it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions.[185]
More recently, his films have featured corrupt authority figures, such as policemen inThe Departed[186]and politicians inGangs of New York[187]andThe Aviator.[188]He is also known for his liberal usage of profanity,dark humor, and violence.[189]
Scorsese's interest in political corruption as depicted in his films was expanded further in his 2019 filmThe Irishman.Richard Brodywriting forThe New Yorkerfound the main interpretation of the film to be a dark allegory of a realist reading of American politics and American society stating:
The real-life Hoffa... (was) a crucial player in both gangland politics and the actual practical politics of the day, and the movie's key through line is the inseparability of those two realms.The Irishmanis a sociopolitical horror story that views much of modern American history as a continuous crime in motion, in which every level of society—from domestic life through local business through big business through national and international politics—is poisoned by graft and bribery, shady deals and dirty money, threats of violence and its gruesome enactment, and the hard-baked impunity that keeps the entire system running.[190]
Scorsese often casts the same actors in his projects, particularly Robert De Niro, who has collaborated with Scorsese on ten feature films and one short film. Included are the three films (Taxi Driver,Raging Bull, andGoodfellas) that made AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. Scorsese has often said he thinks De Niro's best work under his direction was Rupert Pupkin inThe King of Comedy. After the turn of the century, Scorsese found a new muse with younger actor Leonardo DiCaprio, collaborating on six feature films and one short to date.[191]Several critics have compared Scorsese's new partnership with DiCaprio with his previous one with De Niro.[192][193]Frequent collaborators also include:Victor Argo(6), Harvey Keitel (6),Harry Northup(6),J. C. MacKenzie(5), Murray Moston (5),Illeana Douglas(4), Joe Pesci (4),Frank Vincent(3),Barry Primus(3), andVerna Bloom(3). Others who have appeared in multiple Scorsese projects include Daniel Day-Lewis, who had become very reclusive to the Hollywood scene,Alec Baldwin, Willem Dafoe, Ben Kingsley, Jude Law,Dick Miller, Liam Neeson, Emily Mortimer,Jesse Plemons,John C. Reilly,David Carradine, Barbara Hershey,Kevin Corrigan,Jake Hoffman,Frank Sivero,Ray WinstoneandNick Nolte. Before their deaths, Scorsese's parents, Charles Scorsese andCatherine Scorsese, appeared in bit parts, walk-ons or supporting roles, such as inGoodfellas.[194]
For his crew, Scorsese frequently worked with editorsMarcia Lucas[195]and Thelma Schoonmaker,[196]cinematographersMichael Ballhaus,[197]Robert Richardson, Michael Chapman andRodrigo Prieto, screenwriters Paul Schrader, Mardik Martin, Jay Cocks, Terrence Winter,John LoganandSteven Zaillian, costume designerSandy Powell, production designersDante Ferrettiand Bob Shaw, music producerRobbie Robertson, and composersHoward Shore[198]andElmer Bernstein.[199]Schoonmaker, Richardson, Powell, and Ferretti have each won Academy Awards in their respective categories on collaborations with Scorsese. Elaine andSaul Bass, the latter being Hitchcock's frequent title designer, designed the opening credits forGoodfellas,The Age of Innocence,CasinoandCape Fear.

Scorsese had been at the forefront infilm preservationand restoration ever since 1990, when he createdThe Film Foundation, anon-profitfilm organization which collaborates with film studios to restore prints of old or damaged films. Scorsese launched the organization withWoody Allen,Robert Altman,Francis Ford Coppola,Clint Eastwood,Stanley Kubrick,George Lucas,Sydney Pollack,Robert Redford, andSteven Spielberg, who all sat on the foundation's original board of directors.[216]In 2006,Paul Thomas Anderson,Wes Anderson,Curtis Hanson,Peter Jackson,Ang LeeandAlexander Paynejoined them.[217]In 2015,Christopher Nolanalso joined the board.[218]Recent members includeSpike Lee,Sofia Coppola,Guillermo del Toro,Barry Jenkins,Lynne Ramsay,Joanna HoggandKathryn Bigelow.[219]

In April 2007, Fraser and his wife sold their home inBeverly Hills, Californiafor $3 million;[71]in December of that year, Fraser's publicist announced that the couple had decided to divorce.[72][73]Fraser was ordered to make monthlyalimonypayments of $50,000 for ten years or until Smith remarried, whichever came first, and monthly child support payments of $25,000.[74]In early 2011, Fraser asked the court to reduce his alimony payments, asserting that he was unable to meet the annual obligation of $600,000; he did not contest the child support payments.[74]In late 2011, Smith accused Fraser of fraudulently failing to disclose some of his financial assets, including contracts for two films:Extraordinary MeasuresandFurry Vengeance.[74]In 2014, the court ruled against both Fraser's request for alimony reduction and Smith's fraud allegation.[74]Both parents received public praise for being actively engaged in their sons’ lives.[74]Smith has since turned from acting to book-writing and real estate.[75]
Since September 2022, Fraser has been in a relationship with makeup artist Jeanne Moore. The couple made their red-carpet debut at the 2022 Venice Film Festival, and Fraser expressed his gratitude to Moore during his acceptance speech for the Oscar for Best Actor at the95th Academy Awards.[76]

Fraser speaksFrench[77]and serves on the board of directors forFilmAid International.[78]He is an accomplished amateur photographer[12]and has used severalinstant camerasin movies and on TV shows, most notably in his guest roles onScrubs. In his first appearance, he used aPolaroid pack film, and in his second appearance, he used aHolgawith a Polaroid back, a Japanese-only model. The bookCollector's Guide to Instant Camerasincludes a dedication to Fraser.[79]He is also an accomplished amateur archer.[3][80]
In 2018, Fraser stated publicly that the physical demands of the stunts and maneuvers he had performed in his action- and comedy roles had required him to undergo several surgeries over a period of seven years, including a partialknee replacement, alaminectomy, andvocal-cordsurgery.[81]
In 2018, Fraser said publicly that, at a luncheon in 2003, he had been sexually assaulted byPhilip Berk, the then-president of theHollywood Foreign Press Association(HFPA), the nonprofit organization that votes for theGolden Globe Awards. Berk described Fraser's account as a "total fabrication", but in his 2014 memoir, he acknowledged having groped Fraser "in jest".[82][83][84]The stress he experienced from a succession of events, including his divorce, his health problems, the death of his mother, and making the alleged assault public, plunged Fraser into amajor depressionthat led to a break in his career.[3][4]
Several publications and social media users assumed that Fraser had beenblacklistedfromHollywoodbecause of his accusation against Berk.[85][86]In the 2018GQarticle in which Fraser first made his allegation public, he said, "The phone does stop ringing in your career, and you start asking yourself why. There's many reasons, but was [my allegation] one of them? I think it was."[3]However, in Fraser’s 2019 appearance on the radio showSway in the Morning, he expressed a different view, saying, "I don't think the HFPA really wield that much power."[87]In 2022, Fraser toldGQthat if the HFPA nominated him for a Golden Globe atthat yearfor his most recent film,The Whale, he would "not participate" because of his "history" with the organization.[86][88][89]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
