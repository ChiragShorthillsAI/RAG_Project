Airis a 2023 Americanbiographicalsports drama filmdirected byBen Affleckand written by Alex Convery. The film is based on true events about the origin ofAir Jordan, a basketball shoeline, of which aNikeemployee seeks to strike a business deal with rookie playerMichael Jordan. It starsMatt Damon, Ben Affleck,Jason Bateman,Marlon Wayans,Chris Messina,Chris Tucker, andViola Davis.
The project was announced in April 2022 with Affleck set to direct, as well as star and produce alongside Damon with their newly formed production companyArtists Equity.Principal photographytook place between June and July 2022 with Affleck reuniting with his frequent collaborators cinematographerRobert Richardsonand editorWilliam Goldenberg. While Michael Jordan was not involved with the production, he did meet with Affleck, offering several suggestions, including the casting of Davis as his mother. Originally set to premiere on the streaming serviceAmazon Prime Video, distributorAmazon Studiosopted to release the film theatrically first after positivetest screenings, making it the first Amazon title sinceLate Night(2019) to be released in theaters without also premiering on Prime Video.
Airhad its premiere atSouth by Southweston March 18, 2023, and was released theatrically in the United States on April 5. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed $90 million worldwide on a budget of $70–90 million.
In 1984, Oregon-basedNike, Inc.is on the verge of shutting its basketball shoe division down due to low sales. In response to this, Marketing VPRob Strasser, along with co-founder and CEOPhil Knight, task Nike's basketball talent scoutSonny Vaccaroto come up with a new spokesperson for Nike basketball shoes.
While considering the basketball players chosen in the1984 NBA draft, Nike's executives think third pickMichael Jordanis off limits, being both a fan ofAdidasand too expensive for the basketball division's meager budget. However, once he watches Jordan's highlights in conjunction with anArthur Ashecommercial for hisHeadrackets, Vaccaro becomes convinced that Nike should pursue who he considers a generational talent, with both brand and athlete building off each other.
Following dinner with his friendGeorge Raveling, who coached Jordan inthe Olympic tournament, and asking for his support in courting the star, Vaccaro travels toWilmington, North Carolina, where he convinces Michael's mother Deloris that Nike would give Jordan all the attention that he would not receive from his preferred brands Adidas andConverse.
After receiving a negative phone call from Jordan's agentDavid Falkregarding contacting his client's family, Vaccaro learns that the Jordans have scheduled a meeting at Nike'sBeaverton, Oregonheadquarters the following Monday. Vaccaro and Strasser start preparing their pitch while requesting shoe designerPeter Mooreto prepare a prototype, which Moore names "Air Jordan" after Nike's Air Sole technology. In the meantime, Knight agrees to assign the basketball division's entire $250,000 budget to sign Jordan.
After the meeting with Jordan and his parents is successful, Vaccaro learns that Adidas matched the offer while adding aMercedes Benz 380SL, and he thinks the deal will not go through. However, Vaccaro receives a call from Deloris, who states that Michael will sign with Nike on the condition he earns a percentage of every Air Jordan sold.
Even though Vaccaro thinks the company's higher-ups would not accept this bonus due to industry precedent, Knight goes with it, deeming necessary to ensure the endorsement. An epilogue reveals the Air Jordan exceeded Knight's expectations of $3 million in sales, earning $162 million[6][7][8]in one year and becoming a steady source of income for Nike.
In addition, Damian Young appears in a few scenes, speaking only three words ("BullsColors" when shown the prototype for the Air Jordan, and "Hello", heard over a telephone) and generally filmed from behind, asMichael Jordan.
The screenplay was written by Alex Convery between 2020 and 2021, appearing on 2021'sBlack Listunder the titleAir Jordan.[9][10]Convery had the idea for the film while watching a brief segment in the documentary miniseriesThe Last Danceabout howNikesigned basketball playerMichael Jordanand created theAir Jordan. He then researched the history further.[11]It was reported in April 2022 that the script had been bought byAmazon Studios, who were to produce withSkydance SportsandMandalay Pictures, withBen AffleckandMatt Damonteaming to star in the film, while Affleck would direct.[12][13]

Although not directly involved with the film, Jordan met with Affleck prior to the beginning of production and gave the project his blessing, asking for four changes to the script. Jordan asked for the inclusion ofGeorge Raveling, his assistant coach on the1984 United States men's Olympic basketball team, who was the first to recommend that he should sign with Nike.[11][22][23]Jordan also asked that Howard White, vice president of Nike's Jordan Brand and his personal friend, be included in the film. This directly led to Affleck casting Tucker, with whom he had long wanted to work and whom Jordan knew.[24]He also asked for the removal ofTinker Hatfieldas a character, as Hatfield, despite working at Nike at the time, was not involved with the creation of the Air Jordan.[10]Finally, Jordan asked the roles of his parents,James R. Jordan Sr.and Deloris Jordan, to be extended, and the casting of Davis to play his mother, who was instrumental in making his mind about meeting and signing a deal with Nike, was his idea.[24][25]Affleck and Damon did an uncredited script revision to accommodate Jordan's asks.[11]
Affleck curated a playlist titled1984onSpotify, having more than hundreds of popular hits from the 1980s.[26]He sent the playlist to music supervisor Andrea von Foerster, and instructed her to select the tracks that are apt for the film. Since she did not have a big-budget for the film's music, she asked artists and music publishers to trust the film's story and compile the soundtrack.[27][28]The soundtrack to the film featured 13 songs out of the 23 needle drops and 18 score cues as heard in the film, and released under theLegacy Recordingslabel on April 5, 2023.[29]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 93% of 343 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's consensus reads: "A fact-based drama that no one will dunk on,Airaims to dramatize events that changed the sports world forever—and hits almost nothing but net."[42]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[43]Audiences surveyed byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled byPostTrakgave it a 93% positive score, with 83% saying they would definitely recommend it.[13]
Chicago Sun-Times'sRichard Roepergave the film four out of four stars, writing "Thanks to Affleck's sure-handed, period-piece-perfect direction, a crackling good screenplay by Alex Convery and the lively, funny, warm, passionate performances from the A-list cast,Airis as entertaining and fast-paced as an NBA Finals game that is destined for overtime."[44]Peter Debruge, writing forVariety, gave the film a positive review and praised the performances, saying: "Airought to be taken as the ultimate example of the American dream, a funny, touching Cinderella story about how the third-place sneaker brand wished upon a star, and how that man—and his mother—were smart enough to know their value."[45]The Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye also gave the film a positive review and deemed that, "For most audiences,Airwill be worth seeing just for the starry cast—particularly the reunion between Damon and Affleck. Their scenes possess a kinetic and intimate dynamism that the rest of the film approaches but doesn't always match."[46]FilmmakersA. V. RockwellandReinaldo Marcus Greencited it as among their favorite films of 2023.[47]
Less flatteringly,NPR'sAisha Harrissummarily dismissed the film's "flimsy premise" as a "craven exercise in capitalist exaltation"; though she praised Davis and Messina's performances, Harris resented the overall inadequate character development and concluded with the impression that there was "something ultimately hollow about trying to extractFUBUmentality from what amounts to a two-hour ad for Nike and the uber-rich".[48]Similarly,Peter BradshawofThe Guardianadmonished the film for "looking like the most expensive in-house corporate promo in history: shallow, parochial and obtuse" and also bemoaned the underutilization of Davis, who he described as having "more charisma and force than the rest of the cast put together".[49]
In June 2023,Donald Trumpused the monologue from the film in a fundraising2024 presidential campaignvideo onTruth Social. Damon and Affleck's production companyArtists Equitycondemned the usage as unauthorized.[62]

And when you're in a privileged position to hire people... you learn about character and you learn about work habits, work ethics, and you start to understand. Because it's a very amorphous process, this sort of [expletive] that we do, you know, making up fake life. It's a weird thing, and it is a breeding ground for atypical behavior and certain people have certain processes."

I just let it go right here... forThe New York Times."[45]

The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
