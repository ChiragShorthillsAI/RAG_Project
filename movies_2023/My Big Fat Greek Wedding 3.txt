In the wake of Gus Portokalos and Ian's father Rodney's passing a year ago, the Portokalos family is grappling with grief. Nick, now separated, returns home, displaying immature behavior. Athena and her husband Yiannis are caring for Maria, who is battling dementia. Toula and Ian, though happily married, are facing the challenges of parenthood as their daughter Paris struggles with the responsibility of college, this is completely unbeknownst to them.
Victory, a distant relative and the mayor of Gus' hometown Vrisi, invites the family here for a supposed reunion. On the flight, Aunt Voula introduces her assistant Aristotle, Paris' college-mate, and Toula reveals she's bringing Gus' journal, containing his life story, to give to his three childhood friends in Greece as promised.
They arrive in Athens, where Victory greets them, and go sightseeing. In the nearly abandoned Vrisi, they find Gus' childhood home and meet Alexandra, Gus's old flame. There, Victory confesses there's no reunion, hoping the Portokaloses would revive the village. The family goes to a nearby town the following day, where Toula searches for Gus's friends without success and gets drunk on ouzo. Nick searches for the village's oldest tree and Ian befriends a monk, who possesses information about everyone's activities in the village. Meanwhile, Aristotle tries to communicate with Paris, who rebuffs his advances without explaining why.
At dinner, Toula and Ian meet Peter, Alexandra's son by Gus, whom the latter never knew about, as well as his son Christos, and Alexandra's assistant Qamar. Afterwards, Christos and Qamar take Aristotle and Paris to a club, where they reveal they are secretly betrothed. The next day, Toula informs her family about Peter, but struggles to locate Gus' friends. Fortunately, the monk gave Ian a list of those who left the village, pinpointing one who moved toSyros. Toula shares this with Nikki and Angelo, who head to Syros and return with them.
Meanwhile, Toula discovers Nick brought Gus's ashes to Greece, following his father's wish for them to be scattered by the oldest tree in Vrisi. Later that evening, the family learns about Christos and Qamar's engagement, coupled with the revelation of Paris being on academic probation. Peter and Alexandra express disapproval, prompting Ian to offer intervention for Paris. However, the younger generation rejects external interference, opting to address their issues independently.
The next day, Peter comes to terms with Christos and Qamar's relationship, with Alexandra eventually doing the same. Victory recognizes the potential of a wedding to revitalize the village and initiates plans. Toula and Ian receive encouragement to unwind and relish their vacation while the rest of the family collaborates in organizing the wedding, albeit with their assistance in the final stages.
In a joyous celebration, Qamar's family joins them for her wedding to Christos. Paris opens up about her split with Aristotle, citing struggles with independence, and they agree to take things slow, much to Aunt Voula's delight. Nikki and Angelo arrive with Gus' friends, and Toula presents them with his journal.
Later, Toula, Nick, and Peter privately scatter Gus' ashes around the tree, and Victory's mayorship receives praise. Toula and Nick decide to bring Peter with them to America, now as part of the family. The siblings, on the way, engage in a playful dispute over who should now lead the family, each citing their actions during the journey.

Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing.

HBO Films(formerly calledHBO Premiere FilmsandHBO Pictures) is an American production and distribution company, a division of thecable televisionnetworkHBOthat producesfeature filmsandminiseries. The division produces fiction and non-fiction works underHBO Documentary Films, primarily for distribution to their own customers, though recently the company has been funding theatrical releases.
HBO Films slates three or four films per year and develops most of them internally[1]with theatrical films being distributed byWarner Bros. Pictures.[2]
After or around 1978, HBO was involved into preproduction financing films for exclusive pay-TV rights, which was risky as the films could be unpopular while alienating movie studios.[3]The originalSilver Screen Partners, L.P. was organized by Roland W. Betts, New York film investment broker to fund movies forHBOin 1982. The limited partnership sold throughEF Huttonwere oversubscribed and raised $83 million. HBO made a 50% guarantee on their investment for exclusive cable rights.[4]HBO then joined withColumbia PicturesandCBSto formTriStar Pictures, which was expected to become amajor film studio, in 1983. HBO sold half of its ownership in TriStar in December 1985.[5]
HBO Premiere Filmsbegan in 1983 as a telefilm and miniseries production company with an "ambitious production schedule" for the HBO channel. With the high expense of theatrical film exclusive, those films appeared on multiple pay TV channels. Thus, the unit was started to give the channel some exclusives. The company's first head, Jane Deknatel (an English-born television veteran), projected the unit would do 24 projects in 1984 and 50 a few years later. HBO Premiere Films was funding the productions at 60% for just the pay TV rights. Their first film,The Terry Fox Story, shown in May 1983[6]was also the first feature film produced expressly for pay television.[7]Two more films were produced and shown in 1983.[6]
By the end of the first year the schedule was cut back and the unit moved into producing theatrical films. In January 1984, Donald March took over the company from Deknatel as senior vice president. He canceled a dozen projects in development and was reassessing star vehicle productions as being done as vanity projects. A production for each month from July to November was the new plan with a push for additional rights beyond pay TV rights, like foreign theatrical, home video and network television. In January 1984, a telefilm and HBO Premiere Films' first two mini-series,All the Rivers RunthenFar Pavilionswere cablecast.[6]HBO Pictures started winningEmmy Awardsin 1993 with two forBarbarians at the GateandStalin.[1]

The company formed its theatrical distribution division, HBO Films Domestic Theatrical Releasing, that month with a distribution label partnership pact withFine Line Featuresand the hiring of Dennis O’Connor,United Artistsmarketing vice-president, as division head. The pact negotiation was started due to a single distribution film deal between Fine Line and HBO Films forAmerican Splendor. HBO Films Domestic Theatrical Releasing's first release wasElephanton October 24, 2003.[1]In 2005, HBO Films Domestic Theatrical Releasing and Fine Line were effectively merged with Warner Bros. (WB) decided HBO andNew Line Cinemashould form a new smaller and niche films distribution arm,Picturehouse.[2]
Len Amato, producer and as the president of Spring Creek Productions, was appointed HBO Films senior vice president in March 2007.[11]In 2008, Picturehouse was discontinued with distribution being handled by WB's main distribution arm.[2]HBO Films exited the theatrical film market with Picturehouse's closure. With Callender leaving to form his own production company in late 2008, no division president is appointed with department heads becoming president of their departments, Kary Antholis at HBO Miniseries, and Amato at HBO Films. Both answered to president of programming group/West Coast operations, Michael Lombardo.[12]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
