In his desire to go back to his old home after recently moving into town with his family, Craig sets out on a journey to find the Wishmaker, a paper fortune teller that can grant any kid's wish hidden away in the nearby creek. He forms new friends with Kelsey and J.P., and the three are pursued by a fearsome band of pirates led by their captain, Serena, who seeks to use the Wishmaker to destroy the Creek itself.
Produced byCartoon Network Studios,Craig Before the Creekwas released on digital platforms on December 11, 2023, and debuted on Cartoon Network on January 13, 2024.
Craig Williams has just moved to Herkleton with his family and already feels displaced. After a rough night, Nicole tells Craig to take his younger sister Jessica to the playground. While playing on the swings, Jessica's stuffed toy, Small Uncle, accidentally gets flung into the Creek and Craig ventures in for the first time to get it. He encounters all the strange kids including trading kid Kit who just so happens to have it. The kids are attacked by a pirate crew led by Serena who intimidates Craig and takes Small Uncle. Craig is rescued by a fantasy obsessed girl named Kelsey, and her pet parakeet Mortimer, but after that, she demands to be paid, which Craig does so in Choco-rolls.
Later that night, Craig finds a diary in his room that belonged to the previous occupant Hannah, who reveals that she hid awish makersomewhere in the Creek to hide from people like Serena. Craig resolves to find it so that he can wish for his old life back. He recruits Kelsey who reluctantly comes along. The two get a raft from Kit and venture down the Creek before encountering Serena and her pirates who imprison them. They encounter a gawky boy named J.P. who is a "torturer" in that nobody wants to be around him as he is bad at being bad. Serena reveals that she wants the wish maker so that she can flood the Creek. With J.P. switching sides, he, Craig, and Kelsey stage an escape.
Serena convinces her crew to stay through the dinner horn while Craig, Kelsey, and J.P. hide in a tree stump and phone each other's parents to make it seem like they are having a sleepover. Kelsey and J.P. reveal that if they get to wish anything, they want people to understand them. As they sleep, Craig gets up and decides to continue his quest alone. Kelsey and J.P. wake up to discover Craig's deception, but are captured by Serena's crew. Craig finds the ancient playground and opens a hidden entrance to an underground temple-like area where he finds the wish maker. As he performs the commands to get a wish, he starts to reflect on his time with Kelsey and J.P. Just then, Serena arrives with her crew and takes the wish maker.
Serena's wish is granted as the Creek suddenly begins to flood, but her crew abandons her out of fear and she is washed away. Craig, Kelsey, and J.P. take Serena's ship and after a motivational speech from Craig, the group steer the ship and find the wish maker on a rock along with Serena. While Craig activates the wish maker, Kelsey battles Serena, but she grabs it just as Craig finishes. Craig and Serena are transported to inside the wish maker where they battle each other using other kids' wishes. Craig later finds Serena's true wish, which was to return to her oceanside town which she was forced to move away from. Realizing that they shared the same wish, Craig convinces her to move on. The two of them wish for the Creek to be saved.
The rains stop as the Creek returns to normal, but the wish maker is destroyed. The kids all return to playing at the Creek with Serena's former pirate crew now acting nicer to the other kids. Serena decides to continue exploring the Creek on her own as Craig finally returns Small Uncle to a thankful Jessica. He further writes a thank you letter to Hannah and mails her diary back to her. Craig, now with a new appreciation for the Creek and his friends, meets up with Kelsey and J.P. and suggests that they continue having adventures in the Creek so that they can draw a map of their own.
In January 2022, it was reported thatCartoon Networkhad green lit a fifth season of the television seriesCraig of the Creek. With it, the development of a film, then titledCraig of the Creek: The Movie,was also announced. It was said to be a prequel to the series.[1]In September 2023, it was confirmed that the film would release some time later that year.[2]In November 2023, the film's trailer, release date, and finalized title were revealed. Series co-creators Matt Burnett and Ben Levin were announced as directors and co-writers. Along with the returning cast members,Vico Ortizwas announced as the voice of the new character, Serena. Additionally, Byron Marc Newsome was confirmed to voice Duane Williams, reprising his role fromJessica's Big Little World.[3]
The film's plot is inspired by Levin's experiences moving toMarylandas a kid and discovering the nearby creek by his house. Burnett and Levin wanted the film to be stand-alone and understandable to those unfamiliar with the series while also being special for long-time viewers. Thus, an origin story for Craig, Kelsey, and J.P. was decided as the plot of the film.[4]On Phillip Solomon's performance in the film, Levin said, "He’s such an amazing actor. This was a chance for him to just really show his range. He gets extremely silly but also gets super heartfelt." As in the series, H. Michael Croner improvised a lot of his lines for the film.[4]
Saerom AnimationandWarner Bros. Animationdid additional work on the film.[4]Burnett, Levin, and co-director Naija Porter wanted a more cinematic look for the film as compared to the series. To achieve this, new tools likeQuantelwere brought into the production pipeline. In addition, more lighting and shadows were added to give the creek a "magical" feel.[4]The pirate ship is aCGmodel, and the crew had to get it to blend with theirtraditional animation. Artists from the series were brought on to work on backgrounds in the film, adding some "tweaks" for more detail. Porter then created a mock-up, and the artists used it as a reference for the backgrounds in the film, adding further steps to include all its detail.[4]Specific brushes were used to show further texture and paint. The crew, for example, sought to show leaves and trees with more detail instead of them just being shapes. They, however, also strived to make it achievable within their fast schedule.[4]
Jeff Rosenstock, who composed the music for the series,[5]composed the score and songs for the film.[6]The film's music was recorded byJack Shirleyat The Atomic Garden Recording Studios, and includes several guests.[7][8]In addition to some of the voice cast, performers include Rosenstock's band Death Rosenstock,Soul Glo's Pierce Jordan, Catbite’s Brittany Luna,Good Luck’s Ginger Alford,Rx Bandits’Matt Embree,Linqua Franqa, andThe Bruce Lee Band.[8]The soundtrack album was released on January 15, 2024 byWaterTower Music.[6]

Diondra Brown ofCommon Sense Mediagave the film a 3 out of 5 star rating. They found it entertaining due to its charm and songs but felt it lacked the diversity angle that made the series special.[11]Jon Mendelsohn ofComic Book Resourcesgave the film a 5 out of 10 rating and commended the animation and voice performances, but criticized the story and pacing. They concluded, "Craig Before the Creekis light and easy to digest, but anyone expecting a grand follow-up to the beloved Cartoon Network series may be disappointed."[12]Anime Superheropraised the film as a great set-up for the series and an introduction for new viewers. They wrote, "Overall, the movie is a pretty entertaining prologue to the main series. It doesn’t exactly add anything new (other than maybe Serena) but does develop the main characters a bit more, and in hindsight, adds a little more to their personalities."[13]

The company was founded in 1978 and launched in the United States with twenty films onBetamaxandVHSvideocassettes in late 1979. The company later expanded its line to include additional titles throughout 1979 and 1980.
Warner Bros. began to branch out into the videodisc market, licensing titles to MCADiscoVisionand RCA'sSelectaVisionvideodiscformats, allowing both companies to market and distribute the films under their labels.[4][5]By 1985, Warner was releasing material under their own label in both formats. Titles from Warner Home Video were and continue to be distributed and manufactured byRoadshow Home Videoworldwide except for Australia and New Zealand because of its film counterpart's films released byVillage Roadshow.[6]
Warner also experimented with the "rental-only" market for videos, a method also used by20th Century Foxfor their first release ofStar Warsin 1982. Two known films released in this manner wereSuperman IIandExcalibur. Other films released for rental use includeDirty Harry,The Enforcer,Prince of the City, andSharky's Machine. In 1990, Warner Home Video acquired the worldwide home video rights to theMGM/UAcatalog. The $125 million purchase was used to finance MGM/UA's acquisition by thePathé Communications Corporation.[7]The intended 12½-year-long deal was cut short in February 2000, with MGM paying Warner Home Video $225 million to regain video rights to a number of its films. In exchange, Warner Home Video gained full control over the video rights to MGM's pre-May 1986 library, an asset the studio had acquired outright fromTurner Entertainment Co., but due to a pre-existing licensing deal with MGM, was originally expected to expire in 2001.[8]
On December 20, 1996, Warner Home Video was one of the first major American distributors for the then-newDVDformat, by releasing the filmsAssassins,Blade Runner: Director's Cut,Eraser, andThe Fugitiveon DVD in Japan and on March 24, 1997, in the United States withBlade Runneralso being a launch title for the region there.[9]Warner Bros. executiveWarren Lieberfarbis often seen as "the father of DVD". Lieberfarb's successor, Warner Bros. executiveJames F. Cardwellwas recognized in paving the way for WHV's strategic positioning in next generation technologies such as High Definition DVD (HD DVD), electronic sell-through and portable video. In 2003, Warner Home Video became the first home video releasing company to release movies only on DVD with no VHS equivalent.
In 2009, Warner Home Video introduced theWarner Archive Collection, which allows the public to order custom-made DVDs of rarely seen films and TV series from the Warner and Turner libraries. The films are also available as digital downloads. Warner Archive DVDs and downloads can be ordered online on Warner's website, onAmazon.comor one-timeTurner Classic Movies-affiliated DVD website MoviesUnlimited.com.[10]
On June 30, 2020, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment regained the home video rights to theMGMcatalog after 21 years.
Starting in 2022, due to the finalization of the Warner Bros. Discovery merger, WBHE started distributing the television libraries of Discovery-owned networks including the flagshipDiscovery ChannelandAnimal Planet.
On January 14, 2020, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment andUniversal Pictures Home Entertainmentannounced that they would partner on a 10-year multinational joint-venture.

Cartoon Network Studios Inc.(abbreviated asCNS) is an Americananimation studioowned by theWarner Bros. Television Groupdivision ofWarner Bros. Entertainment, a subsidiary ofWarner Bros. Discovery. The studio is the production arm ofCartoon Network, and was founded in 1994 as a division ofHanna-Barbera.
The studio primarily produces and develops animated programs and shorts for Cartoon Network andCartoonito, and has also developed properties forAdult SwimandMax.

Let's Be Heroes,Craig of the Creek, andInfinity Train.
In 1996,Time Warner(now Warner Bros. Discovery) acquired Turner Broadcasting System, which owned Cartoon Network and Hanna-Barbera at that time. In 1997, Hanna-Barbera consolidated its operations with Warner Bros. Animation,[1]moving into their facilities in 1998, where Cartoon Network Studios also operated briefly. Hanna-Barbera closed permanently in 2001, and Warner Bros. Animation has managed its intellectual property to this day, occasionally using the Hanna-Barbera brand as a label.
In 1999, Cartoon Network acquired a large building inBurbank, California, to serve as the headquarters for Cartoon Network Studios after its effective separation from Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. Animation. This was due to the need for Cartoon Network Studios to become an independent entity dedicated to creating original series, while Warner Bros. Animation focused on existing IPs. The studio opened on May 22, 2000, and operated in those facilities for over 20 years.
In the 2020s, after multiple corporate mergers, the studio was consolidated into Warner Bros. Animation, and continued to operate as a separate division, although it was relocated to Second Century Development as the company's new headquarters on August 1, 2023.Sam Register, the president of both studios in Burbank, California, also leadsHanna-Barbera Studios Europe(formerly Cartoon Network Studios Europe) inLondon, England, alongside Vanessa Brookman.[2]

Other animation-heavy cable channels, includingNickelodeonandDisney Channel, founded their own in-house studios throughout the decade as well.[8][9]
Cartoon Network Studios originated in 1994 as a division of Hanna-Barbera that focused on producing original programming for Cartoon Network. Hanna-Barbera had been located onCahuenga BoulevardinLos Angelessince 1963, and housed the studio, its archives, and its extensive animation art collection.[10]Its first productions includedWhat a Cartoon!(1995), an anthology series of short subjects serving as pilots for new CN programs. The first of these,Dexter's Laboratory, launched in 1996 and was an immediate success. The same year,Turner Broadcasting Systemwas merged withTime Warner, and Hanna-Barbera closed its Cahuenga campus, relocating toSherman Oaks Galleriain nearbySherman Oaks, whereWarner Bros. Animationwas located.[11]Over the course of this transition, the Cartoon Network Studios branding was briefly phased out, with newer programs, includingJohnny Bravo(1997) andThe Powerpuff Girls(1998), opting for H-B branding.
On July 21, 1999, Cartoon Network officially started the studio to separate itself from the complete folding of Hanna-Barbera into WBA. Following the death of the studio's co-founderWilliam Hannain 2001, Cartoon Network Studios took over the animation function ofHanna-Barbera.[12]The network acquired a three-story 43,000-square-foot facility located at 300 N 3rd St. inBurbank, Californiato house its new offices, previously a commercial bakery, and prior to that, the location of aPacific Belltelephone exchange.[13][14]According to Cartoon Brew, the network spent around $1.2 million to renovate the building.[15]The network took counsel from its top cartoonists,Genndy TartakovskyandCraig McCracken, on the site of its new studio, as well as design proposals for its offices.[16]

Millerand Jennifer Pelphrey were hired to manage the studio.[18]Mike Lazzo, then head of programming and development,[19]designed a pirate flag, with a skull bearing the channel logo in its teeth, that flew over the building for several weeks before local police threatened action over its lack of permit.[20]Its artists quickly took to its stairwell with doodles and other graffiti that filled over its twenty-year history; it was also home to a mural by artist Ian Anderson titledMazeway to Heaven.[21]The first new productions at the new offices includedSamurai JackandTime Squad(both 2001).

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
