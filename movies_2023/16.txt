Charlotte and Rob Sanders, living modestly in a small apartment, feel overshadowed by the seemingly perfect life of Charlotte's college friend, Jackie Jennings. Jackie's annual Christmas letter, detailing her family's extraordinary achievements, incites envy and skepticism in Charlotte. She showcases her daughter's Beatrix extraordinary intelligence and her son's Daniel wishes to change the world as he travels.
Charlotte, feeling her own family is unremarkable, describes her daughter Dora's obsession with Marvel comics, her son Grant's attachment to a stuffed monkey, Rob's impractical dream of house flipping, and her own abandoned inventor dreams. When Grant, misunderstanding his mother's sarcasm, navigates the family to the Jennings' home for Christmas rather than her sister Stacy's as planned, they spend the night as it is very late.
Planning to head out early the next day, the Sanders get snowed in and forced to stay. After an outing to get a Christmas tree, Charlotte finds a letter addressed to Jackie from Rob and her suspicions of them increases, as they once dated.
Charlotte is also suspicious of Jackie's seemingly perfect family, especially after meeting Jackie's fit, husband Valentino. Her distrust leads her to leave everyone in the town square, where Valentino is running the town's Christmas pageant rehearsal, under the guise of getting a last-minute gift. Charlotte searches their house, trying to find a flaw.
Meanwhile, Grant and Beatrix, influenced by her skepticism of Santa's authenticity, embark on a misguided mission to expose a Santa, set up to see children in the square. Unable to get him to admit he is a fake, Grant uses his monkey to unmask the Santa, culminating in chaos.
While Charlotte is snooping at the Jenning's house, Valentino accidentally kicks her, thinking she is a thief. When Jackie confronts Charlotte about her behavior and Jackie's surprise prepared for her husband and daughter, as she rebuilt a dollhouse that his late mother was not able to do herself.
Charlotte accuses Jackie and Rob of having an affair, based on misinterpreted correspondence. This leads to Rob revealing he has been sending family Christmas letters for years. He kept them secret from her due to her known disdain for the practice. Charlotte accidentally causes the dollhouse to smash onto the floor, so everyone is disappointed in her.
Charlotte prepares their car to leave, as she believes her destroying the dollhouse was unforgivable. Jackie begs her to stay telling her it is okay to make mistakes, as friendship is more important than objects. Then, they go together to a bank downtown, where 10-year-old Beatrix helps Charlotte get a low, fixed interest rate for Rob's dream house. Soon after, Charlotte's company implodes due to a faulty vacuum cleaner they put on the market, against her warnings.
As Charlotte is on a drive to cancel the mortgage, the car slips off the road. Before she gets back on track, she encounters Jackie's friend Rose, who thanks her for spending the holidays with the Jennings, as this time of the year is very difficult for them.
Charlotte soon sees a billboard for the Daniel Jennings Memorial Foundation, so she realizes Daniel actually died. Returning to the house, she enters his locked bedroom. Jackie follows her and explains what happened to Daniel, telling her she created the foundation to keep his memory alive and help her family pull through the tragedy.
As a tribute to her late son Jackie worked with Rose, also from the aviation company she pre-retired from, to design the first-ever solar-powered hot air balloon. She put the North Star on its side that lights up to fly it by the Christmas pageant spectacle, making Daniel a part of it.
When Jackie has a technical problem Charlotte, an engineer, helps solve it. Charlotte hitches a ride on the botton of the rope ladder towards the pageant. Flying too low, it catches on the Santa's sleigh decoration from the Jennings' roof and accidentally attaches to the balloon. As they approach the show, the kids' belief in Santa is restored.
In the epilogue, the Sanders and Jennings families collaborate on a joint Christmas letter. Charlotte boasts about her new invention, while the Jennings promote theirNGOthrough solar-powered hot air balloon travel.

Mary Lambert Gary(born October 13, 1951) is an Americandirector.  She has directed music videos, television episodes and feature films, mainly in the horror genre.[1]
Lambert was born inHelena, Arkansas, the daughter of Martha Kelly and Jordan Bennett Lambert III, a rice and cotton farmer.[2]Her younger sister is formerU.S. SenatorBlanche LincolnofArkansas. Lambert graduated from theRhode Island School of Designwith aB.F.A.
Lambert directedChris Isaak‘s first music video, “Dancin’,” which earned two nominations at the 1985MTV Music Video AwardsforMost Experimental VideoandBest Direction. That same year, she received a third nomination for directingLone Justice‘s “Ways to Be Wicked,” also in the Most Experimental Video category. Lambert was the only woman nominated at the ceremony and accounted for half of the nominations in that category.
Mary Lambert directed several ofMadonna's most iconic music videos during the 1980s, contributing significantly to the singer's visual identity and artistic evolution.
Lambert's collaboration with Madonna began by directing the video for "Borderline" (1984), which depicted Madonna torn between love and ambition in Los Angeles. "Borderline," filmed on location in Los Angeles, California, from January 30 to February 2, 1984.[3]The video, which juxtaposed colorful scenes in the barrio with black-and-white shots in a photography studio, tells the story of a young woman torn between her Hispanic boyfriend and a British photographer.[4]
Lambert described the process as highly improvisational, stating there was "no formula" and that they were "inventing it as we went along”. In describing the video's narrative, Lambert toldRolling Stone: "[A] boy and [a] girl enjoy simple pleasures of barrio love; girl is tempted by fame, boy gets huffy, girl gets famous, but her new beau's out-of-line reaction to a behavioral trifle (all she did was spray-paint his expensive sports car) drives her back to her true love".[5]
"Borderline" premiered on MTV in March 1984 and became one of the videos that helped establish Madonna's early image. Years later, it was included in Madonna's video compilationsThe Immaculate Collection(1990) andCelebration: The Video Collection(2009).[6][7]
Lambert went on to direct "Like a Virgin" (1984), filmed in Venice, Italy, and New York. The video, featuring Madonna in a gondola and wearing a wedding dress, incorporated symbolic imagery such as a lion, reflecting Lambert's vision of combining fantasy and reality.
In 1985, Lambert directed the "Material Girl" video, paying homage to Marilyn Monroe's performance of "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" from *Gentlemen Prefer Blondes*. The video blended commentary on fame and materialism, becoming one of Madonna's most recognizable works.
Lambert's direction of "La Isla Bonita" (1987) featured Madonna portraying both a devout Catholic woman and a vibrant Flamenco dancer, exploring Latin influences and religious symbolism.
In 1989, Lambert directed "Like a Prayer," which became one of Madonna's most controversial videos due to its use of religious imagery, including burning crosses and references to stigmata. Lambert aimed to explore themes of sexual and religious ecstasy, sparking widespread debate and cementing Madonna's reputation as a provocative artist.
Through these videos, Lambert played a key role in shaping the visual narratives during a time that Madonna was being propelled to global stardom.
Mary Lambert directedJanet Jackson‘s iconic music videos for “Nasty” and “Control.” The “Control” video, known for its storyline of Jackson asserting independence from her parents, was filmed at theGrand Olympic Auditoriumin Los Angeles – but behind the scenes, the production was fraught with challenges.[8]
Both Lambert and producerSharon Oreckrecall it as a difficult and trying experience; Oreck said in 2011 that it was her "worst nightmare" of the many videos she had produced. The crowd, which had been told that they would see Janet Jackson perform, had expected a free concert. The audience, expecting a free Janet Jackson concert, instead endured 50 takes of Jackson lip-syncing “Control.”[8]
At the time, Jackson was in the process of firing her father,Joe Jackson, as her manager. His presence loomed over the set, with Lambert and Oreck recalling how he angrily demanded $1 million in liability insurance before allowing Janet to sit on a trapeze used in the video. When Lambert and Oreck threatened to walk off the project unless the issue was addressed, the record label reluctantly stepped in, telling them, “We don't say no to Joe Jackson.”[8]
Tensions escalated further when the label requested more white audience members to be visible on camera. Lambert quietly rearranged the crowd, but when they realized what was happening, the crowd grew angry. Lambert told the record company representative that she absolutely could not go on due to the potential for violence, and he went out and explained things to the crowd, which calmed down enough to complete the video.[8]
Despite the difficulties, Lambert successfully directed the video to completion. In 1988, the song won aSoul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul or Rap Music Video, beating out her brotherMichael,Whitney Houston, andJody Watley.
Annie Lennox: Mary Lambert directed the music video for "Walking on Broken Glass," showcasing Lennox in a period setting inspired by the filmDangerous Liaisons.[9]
Mick Jagger: Lambert directed the video for "Just Another Night," featuring Jagger performing in a nightclub setting, reflecting the song's energetic rock style.[10]
The Go-Go's: She directed the video for "Turn to You," which presents a 1960s prom scenario, aligning with the band's upbeat pop-rock sound.[11]
Whitney Houston: Lambert directed the video for "So Emotional," capturing Houston's dynamic stage performance and behind-the-scenes moments, highlighting her vocal prowess.[12]
Alison Krauss: She directed the video for "When You Say Nothing at All," emphasizing Krauss's emotive performance in a simple, elegant setting.[13]
Live: Lambert directed the video for "I Alone," featuring the band's intense performance, mirroring the song's passionate lyrics.[14]
Mötley Crüe: She directed the video for "Smokin' in the Boys Room," depicting a rebellious high school scenario, aligning with the band's hard rock image.[15]
Queensrÿche: Lambert directed the video for "The Lady Wore Black," featuring the band's performance interspersed with thematic imagery, complementing the song's dark tones.[16]
Sting: She directed the video for "Russians," utilizing stark imagery to underscore the song's commentary on Cold War tensions.[17]
Debbie Harry: Lambert directed the video for "I Want That Man," showcasing Harry in a stylized, futuristic setting, reflecting the song's pop sensibilities.[18]
Tom Tom Club: She directed the video for "Genius of Love," featuring vibrant, animated sequences that match the song's eclectic style.[19]
In 1987, she released her first feature film, the stylish and controversialSiesta, starringEllen BarkinandJodie Foster.  It was nominated for theIFP Spirit Award for Best First Feature, losing toDirty Dancing.
She is known to horror fans for directing the 1989 adaptation ofStephen King's novelPet Semataryand its sequel,Pet Sematary Two.[20]
More recently, Lambert directed 2005'sUrban Legends: Bloody Maryand the 2011Syfyhorror filmMega Python vs. Gatoroid.[21]She also directed the 1993Digital PicturesFMVvideo gameDouble Switch.
In 1989, Mary Lambert directedPet Sematary, a supernatural horror film based onStephen King's 1983 novel of the same name. The project marked the first film adaptation of King's work, with King himself penning the screenplay. StarringDale Midkiff,Denise Crosby,Blaze Berdahl,Fred Gwynne, andMiko HughesasGage Creed, the film's title uses asensational spellingof "pet cemetery".[3]
The film premiered on April 21, 1989, and achieved significant box office success, grossing $57.5 million on an $11.5 million budget. The popularity of the film led to a sequel,Pet Sematary Two, which was released in 1992 with Lambert returning as director.[22]
Development for the film began in 1984 when the rights were initially sold toGeorge A. Romerofor $10,000. However, Romero was unable to proceed with the project due to scheduling conflicts withMonkey Shines.[23]The project languished until the1988 Writers Guild of America strike, whenParamount Picturesfaced a potential shortage of films for 1989. King's screenplay forPet Sematarywas complete, prompting Paramount to greenlight the project.[24]
When it came to selecting a director, King retained creative control and personally chose Mary Lambert. She won him over with her passion for his work and her dedication to staying true to the novel's tone and themes.[25]
Filming took place on location inMaine, honoring King's stipulation that the film be shot in the same state where the novel is set. Locations includedEllsworth,Bangor, andMount Hope Cemetery, with King actively involved throughout production. He regularly consulted with Lambert, offering input and collaborating on key decisions to ensure the adaptation preserved the essence of his novel.[24]
During the casting process, Lambert faced resistance from studio executives. She insisted on casting two-year-oldMiko Hughesas Gage Creed, despite the studio's preference for using twins, which was the standard cost-effective practice for child roles. Lambert felt Hughes had a natural talent that could not be duplicated.[26]She also fought to castFred Gwynneas Jud Crandall, despite concerns that his previous role asHerman Munsterwould prevent audiences from taking him seriously.[24]
Another creative decision by Lambert involved the character of Zelda, Rachel Creed's sister. Initially, young actresses auditioned for the role, but Lambert ultimately castAndrew Hubatsekin order to heighten the unsettling nature of the character.[27]
The film's conclusion was changed at Paramount's request. Lambert originally filmed a more ambiguous ending, in which Rachel Creed returns as an undead figure, leaving her husband's fate uncertain. However, the studio wanted a more graphic climax, resulting in reshoots to depict Rachel attacking Louis Creed.[28]
The film's soundtrack included music by theRamones, one of King's favorite bands. Lambert, having a personal friendship with the band through her work directing music videos, requested they write and perform the track "Pet Sematary," which plays over the closing credits.[27]
She is married to Jerome Gary and has a son named Jordan.[29]

After eleven years with the company, Norwood asked for and received an unconditional release from Atlantic Records at the end of 2004, citing her wish "to move on" as the main reason for her decision.[52]Completing her contract with the label, a compilation album titledThe Best of Brandywas released in March 2005. Released without any promotional single, it reached the top 30 in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, where the collection was appreciated by contemporary critics who noted the creativity of Norwood's back catalogue.[53]Andy Kellman ofAllMusicexpressed, "This set, unlike so many other anthologies from her contemporaries, hardly confirms dwindling creativity or popularity."[54]Thereupon she reportedly began shopping a new record deal under the auspices ofKnockout Entertainment, her brother'svanity label.[55]

Norwood has been classified as some to have acontraltovocal range.[178][179][180]Her voice has often been described as soft, raspy, and husky by music critics and Norwood herself.[181]Music critic andSlant Magazinewriter Andrew Chan describes Norwood's vocal tone as having "an unusual mix of warmth and cold, hard edges". He further describes her vocal quality, saying, "Like little else in pop-music singing, Brandy's subtle manipulation of timbre and texture rewards close listening. [...] Her main claim of technical virtuosity has always been her long, cascading riffs, a skill many R&B die-hards revere her for."[182]Norwood is also noted for her use ofmultitrack recordingto create intricate vocal arrangements and layering. Terry Sawyer ofPopMatterswrites on this skill, remarking, "While it's been said that Brandy's voice isn't exactly a barn burner, it's not mentioned enough that she does more than enough with what she's got. She never leaves her voice hanging in spotlit scarcity, folding its variegated terracing, whispering out the lead track, shouting in the back-up, and piling each song with enough interlocking sounds to create the tightly packed illusion of vocal massiveness."[183]In 2023,Rolling Stoneranked Brandy at number 193 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[184]
Norwood's initial sound on her eponymous debut album was "street-oriented"R&B,[185]that incorporated elements ofhip hop[185][186]andpop-soul.[186]She sang about love while also highligting other topics such as, "tributes to her little brother ("Best Friend"), God ("Give Me You"), the perfect man ("Baby") and older crooners like Aretha and Whitney ("I Dedicate")".[186]On her second albumNever Say Never, she went for a moreadult contemporaryoriented direction while maintaining "a slight streetwise edge".[31]Her third studio albumFull Moonsaw Norwood, and her then-creative partnerRodney Jerkins, experiment with blending her previous R&B sounds with futuristic, forward-thinking productions, including influences of2-step garageandelectro-funk.[187][188][189]Along with her style, her voice had gone through an evolution, with her light, girlish voice becoming much deeper, warmer, and smokier than it had been throughout the 1990s.[190]The lyrics also reflected the change, as the album explored more adult, sexual topics and focused on both physical and emotional aspects of an intimate relationship.[188]
In 2004, her recent motherhood, life experiences, and growing affinity for British rock bandColdplay, caused her to shift toward a more experimental vision for her fourth studio albumAfrodisiac. The album, a collaboration with producersTimbalandandKanye West, utilized the distinctiveillbientaesthetic, which fusesambient pop,dub, andbreakbeatsoundscapes with progressive sampling methods.[191]A four-year hiatus and a few life-changing occurrences caused Norwood to return to the music industry in late 2008 withHuman, her fifth studio album, which discussed topics of love, heartache and honesty.[192]Experiencing a career and personal rejuvenation in 2012, Norwood was eager to scale back her previous album's pop style and return to R&B on her sixth studio albumTwo Eleven. The album was a melding of both Norwood's1990s R&Bsound and the bass-heavy trends ofpost-2000s contemporary hip-hop.[193]
Since the start of her career, Norwood has namedWhitney Houstonas her most prominent music and entertainment influence. Early in her career, she would often describe Houston as her "idol", crediting her voice, music, and performances as critical to her, both personally and professionally.

I wanted to be like her, sing like her, and do everything she was doing."[195]Beginning in the late 1990s, Houston would evolve as a personal friend and mentor to Brandy, with Houston nicknaming herself as Norwood's "godmother".[196]
Norwood also names her father, vocal coachWillie Norwood, as instrumental to her discovery and development as a musician. She exclaims that her dad "taught me everything that I know [about singing]". About her dad, Norwood states: "I grew up singing in church with my dad, where he was the musical director and we sang gospel songs in a cappella almost exclusively. He bought me my first 4-track tape recorder. At first, I didn't like my own voice, but he encouraged me to embrace the unique qualities of my voice."[197]
While developing her own style and vocal sound, Norwood would credit gospel-jazz singerKim Burrell,new ageartistEnya, and English singer-songwriterSadeas major influences. In speaking about them, she said, "...it was listening to those women, along with my own creative voice, that helped me to find my niche, my own sound."[198][197]Norwood has also noted several other musical inspirations, includingMichael Jackson,Mariah Carey,Boyz II Men,the Clark Sisters,Stevie Wonder,Aretha Franklin,Coldplay,Janet Jackson,Timbaland, and her brotherRay J.[197][199][200][201]

The couple kept their relationship secret until February 2002, when Norwood announced that she was expecting her first child. However, a year after the birth of their daughter, Sy'rai Iman Smith, Norwood and Smith separated.[265]In 2004, Smith revealed that the pair had never been legally wed, but that they had pretended to marry to preserve Norwood's public image.[266]Norwood responded that she regarded her relationship with Smith as a "spiritual union and true commitment to each other,"[266]though she later confirmed Smith's statement and justified her actions with the pressure of having to be a role model.[267]
By the following year, Norwood had begun a relationship withNBAguardQuentin Richardson, who was then playing for theLos Angeles Clippers. The couple became engaged in July 2004, but Norwood ended their 14-month engagement in September 2005.[268]It was reported that Norwood had to get a tattoo of Richardson's face on her back transformed into a cat.[269]In 2010, she briefly dated rapperFlo Rida.[270]At the end of 2012, Norwood became engaged to music executive Ryan Press.[271]In April 2014, Norwood called off her engagement with Press following their breakup earlier that year.[272]
Following the release of her seventh studio albumB7, fans speculated on the meaning behind the album's closing track, "Bye BiPolar". While Norwood does not havebipolar disorder, according to notes that the singer wrote to accompany the album, "Bye BiPolar" is a metaphor for her love life and discussing the way that her mental health struggles have been exacerbated by toxic relationships.[273]Norwood told theNew York Post: "I have not been diagnosed as bipolar [...] but I've had moments where trauma has caused me to not be myself, and I felt at a point that I could've experienced moments of that."[274]In an interview withThe Grio, Norwood said, "I've dealt with depression in the most severe ... like severe depression. I've dealt with trauma. I've dealt withPTSD. I've gone through a lot and I had to overcome a lot, but I had to overcome everything that I've overcame by doing the work," turning to therapy, prayer, journaling and meditation.[275]
On December 30, 2006, while driving on the405 Freewayin Los Angeles,[276]Norwood struck a Toyota driven by 38-year-old Awatef Aboudihaj, who later died from her injuries at the L.A.Providence Holy Cross Medical Center.[276]Law enforcement officials later reported that Norwood was driving her car at 65 miles per hour (105 km/h) and did not notice that vehicles ahead of her had slowed considerably. Her vehicle then collided with the rear of Aboudihaj's, causing the Toyota to strike another vehicle before sliding sideways and impacting the center divider. As the Toyota came to a stop, it was hit by yet another vehicle.[277]However, a source in theCalifornia Highway Patrollater reported that Aboudihaj actually struck the car in front of her and then slammed on her brakes before Norwood made contact. The sudden stop caused Norwood to hit Aboudihaj's car.[278]As confirmed,toxicologyreports showed that Aboudihaj had "slight traces" ofmarijuanain her system at the time of the crash.[279]
Norwood was not arrested.[276]Nevertheless, there have been multiple lawsuits filed against Norwood, all of which were ultimately settled out of court by her attorney Ed McPherson. Aboudihaj's parents filed a $50 millionwrongful deathlawsuit against Norwood.[280]Initially set to go to trial in April 2009,[281]the lawsuit was eventually cancelled as Norwood had settled out of court with Aboudihaj's parents.[282]Aboudihaj's husband also filed a lawsuit against Norwood, suing her for an undisclosed amount of financial relief to cover medical and funeral expenses, as well as legal costs and other damages.[283]He rejected his part of a $1.2 million settlement offer in February 2009,[284]but did settle in November of that year.[285]The couple's two children received $300,000 each,[284]while two other drivers who were involved settled with Norwood for undisclosed amounts.[286][287]In May 2009, Norwood stated, "The whole experience did completely change my life, and I can say that I think I'm a better person from it. You know, I still don't understand all of it and why all of it happened, but I definitely have a heart, and my heart goes out to everyone involved. I pray about it every single day, and that's all I can really say on the subject."[288]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
