The Caine Mutiny Court-Martialis a 2023 Americanlegal dramafilm written and directed byWilliam Friedkin. It is based onHerman Wouk's1953 play of the same name, itself based on Wouk's 1952 novelThe Caine Mutiny. It starsKiefer Sutherland,Jason Clarke,Jake Lacy,Monica Raymund, andLance Reddick. The film marks a posthumous release for Reddick and Friedkin, who both died in 2023 on March 17 and August 7, respectively, and is Friedkin's final work.[4]
The film premiered on September 3, 2023 at the80th Venice International Film Festivaland was released in the United States on October 6, 2023 onParamount+ with ShowtimebyRepublic Pictures.[3][5]

Maryk, relieves him of command; Maryk now facescourt-martialformutiny. Lt. Greenwald, a skepticalJAGlawyer, is made to defend Maryk. During the cross-examination the personality and actions of Queeg raise the question of who should be court-martialled.[6]
The Caine Mutiny Court-Martialis a film that I have long awaited to make, originally written by one of the masters of his time,Herman Wouk. I knew that I wanted to create a highly tense, pressurized scenario which would move rapidly along like a bat out of hell. I intentionally chose to keep the issue of right and wrong as ambiguous as possible. I was consistently impressed with the level of expertise that our actors brought to their roles and I believe that these are some of the best performances I have ever seen.
In September 2021,William Friedkinannounced plans to develop an adaptation ofThe Caine Mutiny Court-Martialand that he was beginning the process of casting the film.[7]The following year, in August,Deadline Hollywoodofficially reported that a new adaptation ofHerman Wouk's novelThe Caine Mutinydirected by Friedkin was in the works forParamount Global Content DistributionandShowtime Networks.Kiefer Sutherlandwas announced to star, with Friedkin having altered Wouk's script himself to reflect a more modern timeline, setting it in thePersian Gulf, as opposed to the original'sWorld War IIsetting.[8]Principal photography began presumably in January 2023[8][9]and was completed sometime before starLance Reddick's death in March.[10]In the wake of his death, filmmakerGuillermo del Toroposted atweet, praising the actor's performance in the film.[11]
Del Toro himself served as back-up director on the film for liability reasons, due to Friedkin's age,[12]and had sat beside him every day during the shoot.[13]Since the production had been operating on a tight schedule, Friedkin expected that everyone come to the set prepared so as to avoid doing any retakes. According to del Toro, rather than scold a particular actor who stumbled over a crucial line several times, Friedkin instead asked, "You wanna do it in an hour or so? Or we pick it up tomorrow?":
"The gesture was healing, soothing and put the entire set back in control. I had seen, at the ripe age of 58, that of th[e] many tools in Billy's arsenal, kindness was one of the most effective ones."[14]
In March 2023,Paramount Global Content DistributionrevivedRepublic Pictures, withThe Caine Mutiny Court-Martialannounced as one of its first acquisitions.[15]The Caine Mutiny Court-Martialhad its world premiere on September 3, 2023 at the80th Venice International Film Festivalwhere it screened out of competition.[3][6]Upon its release,Paramount+announced it will premiere the film in all international markets where the service is available.[16]The film was released on October 6, 2023 on Paramount+ with Showtime followed by a linear release onShowtimeon October 8.[5]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 95% of 55 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's consensus reads: "The final film from a master of the medium,The Caine Mutiny Court-Martialserves as a gripping reminder that a single setting, a solid cast, and some sharply written dialogue is sometimes all you need."[17]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 71 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[18]
Pete Hammond, in his review forDeadline Hollywood, wrote that the film is "solid and no-frills".[19]

Republic Picturesis currently an acquisition-only label owned byParamount Pictures.[2]Its history dates back toRepublic Pictures Corporation, an American film studio that originally operated from 1935[3]to 1967, based inLos Angeles,California. It had production and distribution facilities inStudio City, as well as amovie ranchinEncino.
Republic was known for specializing inWesterns,cliffhanger serials, andB-filmsemphasizing action and mystery. The studio was also notable for developing the careers of such famous Western stars asRoy Rogers,Gene Autry, andJohn Wayne. It was also responsible for the financial management and distribution of several big-budget feature films directed byJohn Ford, as well as oneShakespearemotion picture directed byOrson Welles.
Under the supervising leadership ofHerbert J. Yates, Republic was considered a mini-major film studio, producing almost 1,000 motion pictures.[4]
Created in 1935[5]byHerbert J. Yates, a longtime investor in film (having invested in20th Century Picturesat its founding in 1933)[4]and owner of the film processing laboratoryConsolidated Film Industries, Republic was initially founded upon Yates' acquisition of six smallerindependentPoverty Rowstudios.[4][6]
In the depths of theGreat Depression, Yates' laboratory was no longer serving the major studios, which had developed their own in-house laboratories for purposes of both economy and control, while the small, independent producers were going under in the face of increased competition from the majors combined with the general impact of the depressed economy. In 1935, he thus decided to create a studio of his own to insure Consolidated's stability. Six surviving small companies (Monogram Pictures,Mascot Pictures,Liberty Pictures,Majestic Pictures,Chesterfield Pictures, (and Invincible Pictures)) were all in debt to Yates' lab. He prevailed upon these studios to merge under his leadership or else face foreclosure on their outstanding lab bills. Yates' new company, Republic Pictures Corporation, was presented to their producer-owners[4]as a collaborative enterprise focused on low-budget product.
Acquiring and integrating these six companies enabled Republic to begin life with an experienced production staff, a company of veteran B-film supporting players and at least one very promising star, a complete distribution system, and a functioning and modern studio. In exchange for merging, the principals were promised independence in their productions under the Republicaegis, and higher budgets with which to improve the quality of the films. After he had learned the basics of film production and distribution from his partners, Yates began asserting more and more authority over their film departments, and dissension arose in the ranks. Carr and Johnston left and reactivated Monogram Pictures in 1937;[4]Darmour resumed independent production forColumbia Pictures; Levine left and never recovered from the loss of his studio, staff and stars, all of whom now were contracted to Republic and Yates. Meanwhile, Yates installed a staff of new, "associate" producers who were loyal to him. Freed of partners, Yates presided over what was now his film studio and acquiring senior production and management staff who served him as employees, not experienced peers with independent ideas and agendas.
Republic also acquiredBrunswick Recordsfor recording sessions with singing cowboysRoy Rogersand Gene Autry. They hiredCy Feueras head of the studio's music department.[7]
At the 1958 annual meeting, Yates announced the end of motion picture production.[4]
Shut out of their attempts to acquire television broadcasting licenses, most studios resisted making their film libraries available to local stations. Republic, however, established a subsidiary, Hollywood Television Service, in December 1950. Earl Collins, Republic's branch manager in Los Angeles, accepted the presidency of the new TV arm. Collins made two major announcements: effective June 25, 1951, much of Republic's backlog of feature films would be available to local stations; and, effective that same day, Republic's studio lot would be available for rental to independent TV producers.[8]The Republic features, including theGene AutryandRoy Rogerswesterns, were uniformly edited to a running time of 53 minutes and 30 seconds each, in order to fit neatly into one-hour time slots. This was looked upon by TV programmers as a tremendous convenience, and Hollywood Television Service found hundreds of ready customers.
Hollywood Television Service also produced television shows filmed in the same style as Republic's serials, such asThe Adventures of Fu Manchu(1956). Also, in 1952, the Republic studio lot became the first home ofMCA's series factory,Revue Productions.
While it appeared that Republic was well suited for television series production, it did not have the finances or vision to do so. Yet by the mid-1950s, thanks to its sale of old features and leasing of studio space to MCA, television was the prop supporting Republic. During this period, the studio producedCommando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe; unsuccessful as a theater release, the 12-part serial was later sold toNBCfor television distribution.
Talent agentMCA exerted influence at the studio, bringing in some high-paid clients for occasional features, and it was rumored at various times that either MCA or deposedMGMheadLouis B. Mayerwould buy the studio outright.
As the demand and market for motion pictures declined with the increasing popularity of television, Republic began to cut back on its films, slowing production from 40 features annually in the early 1950s to 18 in 1957 (in 1956—the year the company had recorded a profit of $919,000—it temporarily ceased production of features.[9]) Perhaps inspired by the success ofAmerican International Picturescatering to teenaged audiences, Republic dispensed with its old "no exploitation" rule and released several films in the late 1950s aboutjuvenile delinquency, such asThe Wayward Girl(1957),Juvenile Jungle(1958), andYoung and Wild(1958).
A tearful Yates informed shareholders at the 1958 annual meeting that feature film production was ending; the distribution offices were shut down the following year.[10][11]
On July 1, 1958, Victor M. Carter, a Los Angeles businessman and turnaround specialist,[12]acquired controlling interest in the company for nearly $6 million, becoming its president.[13]He turned Republic into a diversified business that includedplasticsandappliancesin addition to its film and studio rentals and Consolidated Film Industries, renaming the company Republic Corporations.[14]In 1963, having used the studio for series production for years, Republic began leasing its backlot to other firms, includingCBS. In February 1967, Republic's studio was purchased outright by CBS[15]and, having more than quadrupled the stock price for shareholders, Carter sold his controlling interest.[12]Other than producing a 1966 package of 26Century 66100-minutemade-for-TV moviesedited from some of the studio's serials to cash in on the popularity of theBatmantelevision series, Republic Pictures' role in Hollywood ended with the sale of the studio lot. Republic sold its library of films toNational Telefilm Associates(NTA).
Non-entertainment acquisitions included Mansbach Metal Company and Kentucky Electric Steel Company, both acquired in September 1968.[16]Republic reported a $13 million loss for the year ending October 1970, and a $43 million loss for the year ended July 1971. The company promotedSanford Sigoloff, who would later earn a reputation as a turnaround expert, to lead as President.[17]
Today, the studio lot is known asCBS Studio Center. In 2006, it became home to the network's Los Angeles stationsKCBS-TVandKCAL-TV. In 2008, the CBS network relocated from itsHollywoodTelevision Cityoperations to the Radford lot, and its executives are based from the site.
In its early years, Republic was sometimes labeled a "Poverty Row" company, as its primary products wereB moviesandserials. Most of the technical staff had been with Mascot, a serial specialist, and thus was already geared to the steady production of weekly chapter plays. Republic's own serials began in 1936 and developed a following very quickly. Many were live-action adaptations of radio and comic-strip adventures.Dick Tracy(1937), starringRalph Byrdas the intrepid detective, was so popular that it spawned three sequels.The Lone Ranger(1938) and its follow-upThe Lone Ranger Rides Again(1939) were well received, andAdventures of Captain Marvel(1941) reached new heights of visual effects. Serials produced afterWorld War IIwere more economy-minded, with the running times slashed from 20 minutes per episode to 13 minutes, and with the cliffhanger endings borrowed from older Republic serials and features. The studio also stopped licensing expensive comic-strip and radio properties, and instead created generic cops-and-robbers stories and science-fiction adventures. Despite the obvious economies, the Republic serials still found an audience, the last film beingKing of the Carnival(1955). Republic kept many of its serials in circulation; they were still playing in local movie theaters well into the 1960s.
The backbone of the company was its feature-lengthWesterns. Many of its Western film leads — among themJohn Wayne,Gene Autry,Roy Rogers,Bill Elliott,Allan "Rocky" Lane, andRex Allen— became recognizable stars at Republic. However, by the mid-1940s, Yates was producing better-quality pictures, mounting big-budget fare such asThe Quiet Man(1952),Sands of Iwo Jima(1949),Johnny Guitar(1954), andThe Maverick Queen(1956). Another distinguishing aspect of Republic Pictures was Yates' avoidance of any controversial subject matter (exploitation filmsbeing a staple of B movies), in contrast to the other "Poverty Row" studios that often dodged theProduction Code.
Republic's leading female star wasJudy Canova, who was enormously popular in Republic's customer base of small towns and rural areas. Republic produced many "hillbilly"ruralmusicals and comedies featuring Canova and theWeaver Brothers and Elviry.[18]She left Republic after a salary dispute in 1943, but was wooed back into the fold in 1951.
In 1946, Republic incorporated animation into its Gene Autry feature filmSioux City Sue. It turned out well enough for the studio to dabble in animated cartoons. After leavingWarner Bros.in 1946 (reportedly because of angering his peers at the studio's cartoon division for taking credit that was not really his),Bob Clampettapproached Republic and directed a single cartoon,It's a Grand Old Nag, featuring the equine character Charlie Horse. Republic management, however, had second thoughts owing to dwindling profits and discontinued the series.[19]Clampett took his direction credit under the name "Kilroy". Republic also released another cartoon series in 1949 (this time without Clampett): a free-wheeling series of animated travelogues calledJerky Journeys, written and produced byLeonard Levinson, but only four cartoons were made.[20]
From the mid-1940s, Republic films often featuredVera Hruba Ralston, a former ice skater fromCzechoslovakiawho had won the heart of Yates, marrying him in 1952.[21]She was originally featured in musicals as Republic's answer toSonja Henie, but Yates tried to build her up as a dramatic star, casting her in leading roles opposite important male stars. Yates billed her as "the most beautiful woman in films", but her charms were lost on the moviegoing public while her noticeable Czech accent limited her range, and soon exhibitors complained that Republic was producing too many Ralston pictures. Years later, John Wayne admitted that he had departed Republic in 1952 over the prospect of having to appear in yet another film with her. Yates remained Ralston's most ardent supporter, and she continued to appear in Republic features until its final production,Spoilers of the Forest(1957).
By the mid-to-late-1940s, the American film industry faced an existential threat, the result of years of wartime stress on costs and the postwar exchange and trade restrictions enacted by the nations ofContinental Europe(practically closing off the market to smaller studios such as Republic), theParamount Case(even though Republic never owned more than a handful of theaters), and the rise of television. In 1947, Yates stopped the production of short subjects, reduced the amount of serials, and organized Republic's feature output into four types of films: "Jubilee", usually a Western shot in seven days for about $50,000; "Anniversary", filmed in 14–15 days for $175,000-$200,000; "Deluxe", major productions made with a budget of around $500,000; and "Premiere", which were usually made by top-rank directors who most often did not work for Republic, such asJohn Ford,Fritz LangandFrank Borzage, and which could have budgets of $1,000,000 or more.[22]Some of these "Deluxe" films were produced by independent companies and were picked up for release by Republic.[citation needed]
Although Republic released most of its films in black and white, it occasionally produced higher-budgeted films such asThe Red Pony(1949) andThe Quiet ManinTechnicolor. During the late 1940s and 1950s, Yates utilized a low-cost, two-color process calledTrucolor(similar toCinecolor, favoring blues and oranges) in many Republic films, includingJohnny Guitar,The Last Command(1955), andMagic Fire(1956). In 1956, the studio devised its ownwidescreenfilm process,Naturama, andThe Maverick Queenwas the first film made in that process.[23]
Following the immense success of their syndication of the Republic Pictures catalogue tocable television,National Telefilm Associatesannounced on December 28, 1984, that they had acquired the logos, copyrights, and trademarks of Republic Pictures Corporation and effectively renamed themselves as such.[24]A television production unit was set up under the Republic name and offered, among other things, off-network repeats of the CBS seriesBeauty and the Beastand game showPress Your Luckinsyndication. There were also a few theatrical films, includingFreeway,Ruby in Paradise,Dark Horse,Live Nude Girls, andBound. At the same time, subsidiary NTA Home Entertainment was renamed Republic Pictures Home Video and began remarketing the original Republic film library. In 1985, the company bought outBlackhawk Films, and eventually, Republic decided to close Blackhawk in 1987.
Also that year, Republic Pictures Home Video, the home video division of Republic Pictures, had signed an agreement with Hawk Company, headed byRobert Clouse, in order to gain access to 31 projects that were developed by Hawk, for home video release, and that Republic Pictures Home Video received a 24% share in the newly formed Hawk Company organization.[25]In January 1993,Blockbuster Entertainmentannounced they would purchase a 35% stake in Republic,[26][27]
On March 24, 2023,Paramount Globalannounced it would revive the Republic Pictures brand, with the intention of it serving as the company's acquisitions label, releasing titles acquired byParamount Global Content Distribution, similar to the distribution model of, amongst other companies,Stage 6 FilmsorAmerican International Pictures.[28]

Headquartered atParamount Plazain the northern part ofNew York City'sBroadwaydistrict, Showtime operates eight 24-hour, linearmultiplex channelsand formerly a standalone traditional subscriptionvideo on demandservice; the channel's programming catalog and livestreams of its primary linearEastandWest Coastfeeds are also available via an ad-free subscription tier of Paramount+ of the same name, which is also solda la cartethroughApple TV Channels,Prime Video Channels,The Roku ChannelandYouTube Primetime Channels. (Subscribers of Paramount+'s Prime Video add-on also receive access to the East Coast feeds of Showtime's seven multiplex channels.)[1][2]It is a sister premium television network toThe Movie ChannelandFlix.
In addition, the Showtimebrandhas been licensed for use by a number of channels and platforms worldwide includingShowtime Arabia(it has been merged intoOSN) in the Middle East andNorth Africa, and the now-defunctShowtime Movie ChannelsinAustralia. As of September 2018[update], Showtime's programming was available to approximately 28.567 million U.S. households which subscribed to a multichannel television provider (28.318 million of which receive Showtime's primary channel at a minimum).[3]
Showtime was launched on July 1, 1976, on Times-Mirror Cable systems inEscondido,Long Beach, andPalos Verdes, Californiathrough the conversion of 10,000 subscribers of the previous Channel One franchise. Exactly a week later Showtime launched on Viacom Cablevision's system inDublin, California;[4]the channel was originally owned byViacom.[5]The first program to be broadcast on Showtime wasCelebration, a concert special featuring performances byRod Stewart,Pink Floyd, andABBA. By the end of its first year on the air, Showtime had 55,000 subscribers nationwide.[4]On March 7, 1978, Showtime became a nationally distributed service when it was uplinked tosatellite, becoming a competitor withTime Inc.'sHBOand otherpay cablenetworks.[6]
In 1979, Viacom sold a 50% of Showtime to theTelePrompTer Corporation.[4]On July 4, 1981, Showtime began a 24-hour programming schedule (rival HBO followed suit in December of the same year).[7]In 1982,Group WCable, a subsidiary ofWestinghouse Electric Corporation(which acquired TelePrompTer the previous year), sold its 50% stake in Showtime back to Viacom for $75 million.[4]The sale of Group W's stake in the channel happened shortly after the company began a partnership with Walt Disney Productions (nowThe Walt Disney Company) to develop a competing premium service,The Disney Channel. Group W left thejoint venturein September, due to disagreements over creative control and financial obligations.[8]In 1982 Showtime broadcast its firstmade-for-cable movieFalcon's Goldand its first original series and children's programFaerie Tale Theatre.
In August 1982,MCA Inc.(then the owner ofUniversal Pictures),Gulf+Western(then the owner ofParamount Pictures) and Warner Communications agreed to acquireThe Movie Channel(TMC). The three companies combined acquired a controlling 75% interest in the service (with each holding a 25% ownership stake) from Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment.[9]The deal was spurred by the studios wanting to increase their share of revenue for licensing rights to their films to premium television services, as well as concerns that HBO's dominance of that market and its pre-buying of pay cable rights to films prior to their theatrical release would result in that service holding undue negotiating power for the television rights, resulting in a lower than suitable licensing fee rate the studios would be paid for individual films. The three companies announced an agreement in to acquire interests in TMC on November 11, 1982.[10][11][12]In late December of the same year, theU.S. Department of Justicelaunched a routine preliminary inquiry into the proposed partnership. The Department of Justice had blocked a similar attempt by MCA, Gulf+Western,20th Century Fox, andColumbia Picturesto create a competing pay service, Premiere, in anantitrustcase ruling two years earlier in January 1981.[13]
On January 7, 1983, Viacom International (adding itself as a partner) drafted an amendment to the proposal to consolidate The Movie Channel with Showtime. Under the revised proposal, the four studios would each own a 22.58% stake in the two networks, with American Express owning a 9.68% minority interest. In addition, the consortium would appoint a management team separate from those employed by the two channels–which continued to operate as separate services–to operate the joint venture. However the deal ran into regulatory hurdles because Warner, Universal, and Paramount received 50% of their respective total revenue from film releases and licensing fees from premium services. Also Showtime and TMC combined would control about 30% of the pay cable marketplace, creating anoligopolywith HBO (which in conjunction with Cinemax controlled 60% of the market).[11][12][14]
After a four-month investigation resulted in the Department of Justice filing a civil antitrust lawsuit against the five parties to block the Showtime-TMC merger on June 10, 1983, the Department asked Warner and American Express to restructure the deal during hearings for the case.[15]The Department's decision–citing concerns, including some expressed by HBO management, that combining the assets of Showtime and TMC would stifle competition in the sale of their programming and that of other pay cable services to cable providers–was despite the fact that under the original proposal, MCA, Gulf+Western and Warner had each agreed to continue licensing films released by their respective movie studios to competing pay television networks.[11][12]
The partners involved in the merger would also set standard prices for films that were acquired for broadcast on The Movie Channel and Showtime, either those produced by the studio partners or by unassociated film studios. To address the Justice Department's concerns over the deal, the four partners submitted a revised proposal for consideration on July 19 which included guarantees of conduct agreeing that Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros. would not receive higher residual licensing payments for films acquired by Showtime and The Movie Channel than those paid by other studios, and that all four partners would not permit the two channels in the venture to pay lower fees for films produced by three studio partners than those paid by smaller pay television services for the same films.[16]
After the revised proposal was rejected on July 28, Warner Communications and American Express restructured the purchase to include only Viacom as a partner, bowing Gulf+Western and MCA out from the partnership. The changes – which Justice Department officials acknowledged would "prevent any anti-competitive effect from arising" following the merger, by allowing other premium services to enter the market should the venture significantly raise licensing fee prices for films–led the Justice Department to drop its challenge to the merger agreement on August 12; the department formally approved the deal the following day on August 13.[11][12][17][18]When the deal was completed on September 6, 1983, the operations of The Movie Channel and Showtime were folded into a newholding company, Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc., which was majority owned by Viacom (controlling 50% of the venture's common stock as well as investing $40 million in cash), with Warner Communications (which owned 31%), and Warner-Amex (which owned the remaining 19% interest) as minority partners.[19][20]
As the consolidation of its operations with The Movie Channel was ongoing, in 1983, Showtime increased its national distribution on cable providers when competing premium serviceSpotlightceased operations, effectively absorbing that channel's subscriber base.[4]
In 1984 the network's first major promotional campaign, "We Make Excitement" (also referred to, particularly in bumpers and program introductions, as "Showtime Excitement") was created by the J. Walter Thompson company and utilizing an adapted version of thePointer Sisterssong "I'm So Excited". The campaign lasted into 1986 and coincided with both the exclusivity deal signed with Paramount for films (see below) and a graphical upgrade to the network's presentation to include computer-generated graphics.[21]
On August 10, 1985, afterTime Inc.and cable providerTele-Communications Inc.(TCI) jointly submitted a bid to buy the company for $900 million and the assumption of $500 million in debt as well as an earlier offer by American Express the previous month to buy out Warner's share of the company (under a clause in the agreement that allowed either company the option of buying out their partner's stake in Warner-Amex), Warner Communications exercised an option to acquire American Express' 50% share of Warner-Amex Cable Communications for $450 million. Among the options, barring that it chose to sell Viacom a 50% interest in the company for $450 million, the deal originally excluded Warner-Amex's 19% interest in Showtime-The Movie Channel, Inc.; that interest would have reverted to Warner, which intended to operate Warner-Amex as a wholly owned subsidiary.[22][23][24]
Two weeks later on August 26, Viacom acquired Warner Communications and Warner-Amex's combined 50% ownership interest in Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc. as well as full ownership of the Warner-Amex and public shareholder interests inMTV Networksfor $671.7 million, giving Viacom exclusive ownership of both networks and once again making it the sole owner of Showtime through its $500 million cash payment and acquisition of 1.625 million shares from Warner for the latter's 31% stake in Showtime/The Movie Channel and Warner-Amex's 19% interest in the unit and its 60% interest in MTV Networks (Viacom owned Showtime alone or jointly with other companies–TelePrompTer Corporation, and later briefly, its successor Group W Cable–from the time it launched in July 1976). The buyout, part of an option given by Warner in its purchase of American Express' interest in MTV, was exercised in part to finance much of the buyout of Showtime/The Movie Channel without borrowing any money (ironically, Warner Communications would eventually acquire rivals HBO andCinemax, when the company merged withTime Inc.in 1990 to formTime Warner, which is now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[25][26][27][28]The subsidiary was renamedShowtime Networks, Inc.in 1988.
Also in 1988, the company formed Showtime Event Television (now Showtime PPV) as apay-per-viewdistributor of special event programming. In 1990, Showtime ventured into acquiring and premieringindependent filmsexclusively for the channel as part of the30-Minute Movieshort filmanthology series. One of its first premieres,12:01 PM, was nominated for anAcademy Award;1992'sSession Manwon anAcademy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.[6]In the years that followed, Showtime expanded its acquisitions into the realm of feature-length fare, including theAdrian Lyne-directed 1997 remake ofLolita.
On March 1, 1994, Showtime and The Movie Channel in conjunction with rivals HBO and Cinemax implemented a cooperativecontent advisory systemto provide to parents specific information about pay-cable programming content that may be unsuitable for their children; the development of the system—inspired by the advisory ratings featured in program guides distributed by the major premium cable services—was in response to concerns from parents and advocacy groups about violent content on television, allowing Showtime Networks and other premium services discretionary authority to assign individual ratings corresponding to the objectionable content depicted in specific programs (and categorized based on violence, profanity, sexuality or miscellaneous mature material).[29]A revised system—centered around ten content codes of two to three letters in length—was implemented by Showtime and the other participating premium services on June 10, 1994.[30]
In 1997, the channel's first major rebrand since the 1980s was introduced, with a new logo emphasizing the "SHO" part of the network's name within a circle (intended to be a spotlight), playing into the channel's common acronym in listings services likeTV Guide. A new slogan, "No Limits" (in reference to the fact that as a premium channel, Showtime could push the boundaries of programming without censorship, as well as offer the type of exciting programming that appealed to subscribers), and a bold red-and-black color scheme was instituted, with promotions and bumpers feature surrealistic imagery; the campaign was created by the newly formed in-house marketing and advertising agency, "Red Group".[31]
In 2000, Showtime launched "Showtime Interactive 24.7", a service that providedDVD-style interaction of its entertainment offerings. The following year in 2001, Showtime became one of the first cable networks to launch ahigh definitionsimulcast feed (withStar Trek: Insurrectionbecoming the first film on the network to be broadcast in HD); Showtime also began to provideDolby Digital 5.1surround soundon select programs.[32][33]
On June 14, 2005, Viacom decided to separate itself into two companies (only five years after the company's acquisition ofCBS), both of which would be controlled by Viacom parentNational Amusements, amid stagnation of the company's stock price. When the split was completed on December 31, 2005, the original Viacom was restructured asCBS Corporationand kept Showtime Networks along with the original Viacom's broadcasting assets (which included the CBS television network,UPNand the company's broadcast group, which becameCBS Television Stations),Paramount Television(now the separate armsCBS Studiosfor network and cable production, andCBS Media Venturesfor production offirst-run syndicated programsand off-network series distribution), advertising firm Viacom Outdoor (renamedCBS Outdoor),Simon & Schuster, andParamount Parks(which was later sold toCedar Fair, L.P.on June 30, 2006). A new company that assumed theViacomname tookParamount Pictures, theMTV NetworksandBET Networkscable divisions, andFamous Music(the latter of which was sold toSony-ATV Music Publishing(CBS once ownedits sister company) in May 2007).[34][35]
On August 13, 2019, the announcement was made that CBS and Viacom wouldmerge into a new entityknown asViacomCBS(now known as Paramount Global). Viacom CEOBob Bakishwould be president and CEO of the new company, while Ianniello would become chairman and CEO of CBS and oversee CBS-branded assets.Shari Redstonewould also serve as chairperson of ViacomCBS.[36][37]On October 29, 2019, National Amusements approved the re-merger deal. It closed on December 4, 2019. As part of the new structure the Showtime Networks unit and its assets—Showtime, The Movie Channel andFlix—became part of the Premium Network Group division ofViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks, along withBETand temporarilyPop TV(which was transferred to the Youth & Entertainment Group division the following month, later named MTV Entertainment Group), to be overseen by SNI CEODavid Nevins.[38]ViacomCBS renamed itself as Paramount Global on February 16, 2022; the company's domestic networks division became Paramount Media Networks on the same day.[39][40]
On January 30, 2023, Paramount Global announced plans to fully integrate the Showtimedirect-to-consumer service(which was sold directly to streaming-only consumers) with the premium tier of theParamount+streaming service; the combined service would be branded asParamount+ with Showtime, replacing a streaming bundle of the same name that launched in August 2022.[41]The merger commenced on June 27, 2023,[42]with the cable-specific Showtime AnytimeTV Everywhereapp (which was offered to subscribers of the linear Showtime television service) ceasing operations on December 14, and the standalone Showtime app being discontinued on April 30, 2024;[43][44][45]the primary Showtime channel was rebranded as Paramount+ with Showtime on January 8, 2024, although the former name remains in use as a standalone brand for its multiplex channels and for marketing of the network's original programs.[46]
In 1991, afterHBOandCinemaxdebuted the first premium television multiplex service in the United States, Showtime followed with the testing of its own secondary service–Showtime 2–on October 1 of that year.[47]In April 1994, Showtime announced the creation of a new themed multiplex service, consisting of five channels: Spanish service Showtime En Espanol; family-oriented Showtime Family Television; action-oriented service Showtime Action Television; a service featuring comedy films and series called Showtime Comedy Television; and an all-movie channel called Showtime Film Festival.[48]This planned extension to the multiplex did not come to fruition–although a third multiplex service, Showtime 3, would make its debut in 1996.[49]
The multiplex would eventually expand over time with the launch of the action film channel Showtime Extreme on March 10, 1998, followed by the debut of thescience fictionchannel Showtime Beyond in September 1999; theShowtime Unlimitedname for the Showtime multiplex, TMC and Flix came into use around this time.[50]Three additional themed channels made their debut in March 2001: Showtime Family Zone (which carries films intended for family audiences), Showtime Next (a channel featuring films and series that appeal toward adults between the ages of 18 and 34 years old) and Showtime Women (a channel featuring movies, specials,
and Showtime original programs that appeal toward a female audience).[51][50]The programming format of Showtime 3 was overhauled five months later on July 1, 2001, to focus on theatrical movie releases and Showtime's original made-for-cable films, that under the new name Showcase.
Showtime Family Zone, Showtime Next and Showtime Women do not have distribution by most pay television providers as extensive as the other Showtime multiplex channels. The availability of either of the three channels on cable providers varies depending on the market;Dish Networkonly carries Showtime Family Zone, andDirecTVcarries Showtime Next and Showtime Family Zone, but not Showtime Women.
Depending on the service provider, Paramount+ with Showtime provides up to sixteenmultiplex channels–eight 24-hour multiplex channels, all of which are simulcast in bothstandard definitionandhigh definition–as well as avideo on demandservice (Paramount+ with Showtime On Demand).[52]Paramount+ with Showtime broadcasts its primary and multiplex channels on both Eastern andPacific Time Zoneschedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main Paramount+ with Showtime channel), resulting in thedifference in local airtimesfor a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.
Subscribers to the separate premium film service The Movie Channel, which is also owned by Paramount, do not necessarily have to subscribe to the linear Paramount+ with Showtime service in order to receive TMC; both The Movie Channel and co-owned fellow movie service Flix are typically sold together in a package (although in the case of Flix, this depends on the channel's provider availability), though DirecTV and Dish Network alternately sell TMC through a separate film tier. For unexplained reasons, live feeds of The Movie Channel and Flix have not been included alongside the other Showtime multiplex channels on its proprietary streaming services (including the Paramount+ premium tier) or its add-on tiers that are sold through live-TV streaming providers (such asHulu,YouTube TVandDirecTV Stream), restricting their distribution to traditional cable, satellite and telco/fiber optictelevision providers. From 1999 to 2005, the package encompassing Showtime and its sister networks was marketed as "Showtime Unlimited"; the broader tier sometimes included the Sundance Channel (nowSundance TV) during this period, by way of the stake Showtime Networks held in the network from its 1996 inception until Sundance's 2008 purchase byRainbow Media(now AMC Networks).
SHO×BET now focuses on programming aimed at African American audiences and incorporating original scripted content targeted at that demographic from Showtime andBET's respective libraries, in addition toBET+programming to drive viewers to that streaming service.
Showtime HDis ahigh definitionsimulcast feed of Showtime that broadcasts in the1080iresolution format. In addition to its main channel, all of Showtime's multiplex channels also broadcast in the format, though availability of all of the HD feeds varies by provider. Showtime HD is available through virtually all providers which carry Showtime, along with Showtime's streaming services. Films shown on Showtime's HD simulcast feeds are broadcast in their domesticaspect ratioif that version is provided by the studios that maintain pay television distribution rights with the channel.[53]
Showtime operates asubscription video-on-demandtelevision service calledShowtime on Demand, which is available at no additional charge to Showtime subscribers. Showtime on Demand offers feature films, episodes of Showtime's original series, adult programming and sports events. Showtime on Demand's rotating program selection incorporates select new titles that are added each Friday, alongside existing program titles held over from the previous one to two weeks. The service began to be test marketed in 2001 and was officially launched in July 2002.[54]
On October 27, 2010, Showtime launchedShowtime Anytime, a website that featured around 400 hours of streaming program content available instandardorhigh definitionthat was accessible to subscribers of the Showtime television service withTV Everywherelogin. Content available on the service included Showtime original programming, feature films, comedy specials, documentaries and sports programming.[55]It was available nationally to Showtime subscribers of satellite providerAT&T DirecTV, and regionally by Comcast Xfinity;Spectrum; Optimum; Cox Communications;CenturyLink Prism;Grande Communications;Mediacom;[56]AT&T U-verse;[57]andVerizon FIOS.[58]The Showtime Anytimeapp(which was offered as a free download) was initially released on theiOSApp Storefor theiPadandiPhoneon October 3, 2011.[59]On October 1, 2012, anAndroidapp became available through theGoogle Playplatform for Android devices.[60]
In September 2017, it was discovered that the Showtime Anytime website was injected with code that mined the cryptocurrencyMonerousing the viewer's CPU, which would potentially cause degraded performance for other websites and applications. The code was removed as soon as it was discovered.[61][62]
The Anytime app and website viewing were shut down in December 2023.[63]
On September 22, 2011, Showtime launchedShowtime Social, asecond screeninteractive app providing interactivity with Showtime programs including viewer-participant polls and trivia questions as well as real-time aggregation ofTwitter,Facebookand blog comments about particular Showtime programs; the app utilizes Automated Content Recognition technology to generate interactive content regardless of whether it is being watched live, on-demand or byDVR; the app also displaysheat mapsdepicting viewer reactions throughout the duration of an episode at the conclusion of the program. The app–which was renamedSHO Syncon September 13, 2012–was originally released for Apple iOS devices (iPad and iPhone), with an app forLG-manufacturedSmart TVsbeing released on August 15, 2013.[64][65][66][67]
On July 9, 2015, Showtime announced it would discontinue SHO Sync, immediately discontinuing support of the iPad app with the iPhone and LG apps to be discontinued at a later date. However, the channel hinted that the core interactive functions of SHO Sync may be restored in a different form, with the possibility of being incorporated into Showtime Anytime and the Showtime over-the-top streaming service.[68]
On June 3, 2015, then-Showtime parentCBS Corporationannounced that it would launch anover-the-topsubscription video on demand service that would be distributed as a standalone offering without the requirement of having an existing television subscription to use (in the manner of competitor HBO's OTT offering,HBO Now).[69][70]The service, which used the same branding as the linear television channel, was officially launched on July 7, 2015 (coinciding with the season premieres ofRay DonovanandMasters of Sexon July 12).[71][72][73][74]The service was initially available for purchase throughApple Inc.(toApple TVandiOSdevices),Hulu,Roku,PlayStation Vue, andAmazon Primeas well as through Showtime's website (SHO.com).[75][76][77][78]
The Showtime streaming service was identical to Showtime Anytime; it offered a back catalog of episodes of various past and present Showtime original series (with new episodes of Showtime original series being made available for streaming the same day as their original broadcast on the main linear Showtime channel), feature films and documentaries, and sports events and analysis programs. Subscriptions were also available over Amazon Prime (Amazon Channels), Hulu, The Roku Channel, and Apple TV (Apple TV Channels) as add-ons. Unlike HBO Now, Showtime also provided live streams of the East and West Coast television feeds of the linear Showtime channel (live streams of Showtime's multiplex services, and sister networks The Movie Channel, The Movie Channel Xtra, and Flix were not available on the service; live streams of Showtime's multiplex channels were available for Amazon Prime users as part of the Showtime add-on subscription).[79][80][81]
The Showtime streaming service co-existed with Paramount Global's flagship streaming serviceParamount+,[82]and became part of a bundle offer with the service.[83]In August 2022, the Paramount+ apps were updated with the ability to upgrade a subscription to the "Paramount+ with Showtime" bundle, and for subscribers to the bundle to access Showtime content from within the Paramount+ apps. Showtime would continue to be offered as a standalone service and application.[84][85][86]However, in September, the company was in talks of moving the entire Showtime content within Paramount+.[87][88]By December 2022, Paramount CEOBob Bakishsaid that it "didn't make sense to run Showtime as a 100% stand-alone organization".[89]
On January 30, 2023, Paramount Global confirmed the two services would be fully merged in the near future in the United States, with both the Showtime service and the current Paramount+ Premium tier to be rebranded "Paramount+ with Showtime", echoing similar integrations in other international markets. The "Showtime" brand will remain active as a distinct programming imprint.[41][90]On May 20, 2023, Paramount Global announced that the merger of both services would take place on June 27, with the standalone Showtime app being shut down on April 30, 2024.[91][45]The primary Showtime channel was rebranded as Paramount+ with Showtime on January 8, 2024, although the former name remains in use as a standalone brand for its multiplex channels.[46]
Paramount+ with Showtime's programming schedule currently consists largely of theatrically released feature films—which occupy much of the service's daily schedule, varying in quantity depending on channel—and original series targeted at adult audiences (including, as of June 2020[update], dramas likeShameless,Homeland,Yellowjackets,Billions,The Chi,The L Word: Generation Q, andPenny Dreadful: City of Angels; comedies such asBlack Monday,Our Cartoon PresidentandKidding; and docuseries includingThe CircusandVice). In addition, Showtime has documentary films, boxing matches, sports-centric magazine series, occasional originalstand-up comedyspecials, and short-form behind-the-scenes specials centered mainly on theatrical films (either running in their initial theatrical or Showtime Networks broadcast window).[citation needed]
Since the early 1980s, Showtime has run an adult-oriented late nightprogramming blockon its main channel called "Showtime After Hours" (which was briefly branded as "Showtime Late Night" during the mid-1990s) each night after 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time; programs featured within the block include feature films, series produced specifically for broadcast during the block and occasional stand-up comedy specials.[citation needed]Softcore eroticaprogramming has previously aired during the "After Hours" block, though adult films have been absent from Showtime's primary channel since the mid-2000s; the network began broadcasting a limited amount of original erotica series (such asBeach Heat: Miami) on its main channel in 2010, after having been removed for most of the previous decade.[citation needed]The network's multiplex channels Showtime 2 and Showtime Extreme also occasionally feature adult films during the overnight hours, though this has become less commonplace since late 2011.[citation needed]
Until the formation of Showtime Family Zone in 2001, Showtime heavily incorporated programming (both American and foreign) aimed at children and teenagers as part of its daytime schedule; in particular, the main channel ran a late afternoon block of teen-oriented series on Sundays (such asReady or Not,Chris CrossandDegrassi High), as well as a morning block of shows aimed at younger children (such asOWL/TV,A Bunch of MunschandThe Busy World of Richard Scarry) during the early and mid-1990s, and a weekday mid-afternoon and Sunday morning film block called "Showtime Familytime" that ran during the 1980s and 1990s.[citation needed]
The main Showtime network also carried, unusually for a premium channel, news programming; the now-defunctAll News Channel(partially owned by Viacom) produced 90-second long news updates that aired during Showtime's primetime promotional breaks in the early 1990s (ANC also produced news updates for fellow Viacom network VH1), in part as a response to the firstGulf War.[92]
Showtime has become known in recent years for the network's original television programs, the most popular of which include thecrime dramaDexter, thedarkcomedy dramaWeeds, family dramasRay DonovanandShamelessand the drama/thriller seriesHomeland. Other notable past and present original series includeStargate SG-1(which ran on Showtime for its first five seasons, before moving to the Sci-Fi Channel (nowSyfy) for the remainder of its run);Dead Like Me;Californication;Gigolos;Nurse Jackie;The Tudors;Brotherhood;Soul Food;Queer as Folk;The L Word;The Big C;Penn & Teller: Bullshit!; andUnited States of Tara. In mid-2017, the channel aired the critically acclaimed[93][94]third season ofDavid Lynch's TV seriesTwin Peaks. From 2007 to 2013, multiplex service Showtime 2 broadcast an original program exclusive to that channel, the seasonal late nightreality seriesBig Brother After Dark, a companion to sister broadcast networkCBS' American adaptation ofBig Brother; the program moved to TVGN (which has since been renamedPop) starting with the June 26, 2013, premiere ofBig Brother's15th season.[95]
Showtime formerly produced its own originalmade-for-cable movies, originally branded as "Showtime Original Movies" until 1994 and "Showtime Original Pictures" thereafter until the channel discontinued producing television films in 2007. Showtime is also one of only two premium cable services (alongside Disney Channel during its existence as a premium channel prior to 1997) that has produced original movies aimed at family audiences; these films were originally broadcast under the separate banner "Showtime Original Pictures for Kids" from 1995 to 1997 and "Showtime Original Pictures for All Ages" from 1997 to 2005.
A signature feature of Showtime was alate-nightblock known asShowtime After Hours, which featuredsoftcore pornographicfilms and original series. Showtime did not have set start or end times for the block, as they varied depending on the mainstream feature films–and original series on certain nights–that aired prior to and following it, and also depended on the number of programs and programs in particular that were scheduled to air within the block. Programs that aired under the Showtime After Hours banner carried either a TV-MA or R rating (usually the former), primarily forstrong sexual contentandnudity. The block had often been the subject of both scrutiny in the media and a source of humor inpopular culture, with references to Showtime's late night programming being featured in various films and television shows.
As of 2024[update], Showtime–and sister channelsThe Movie ChannelandFlix–maintains exclusive first-run film licensing agreements withAmblin Partners(including releases produced in conjunction withDreamWorks Pictures, which maintains a pay television licensing agreement for its other releases with Showtime rivals HBO and Cinemax, andParticipant),[96]A24,[97]andBleecker Street.[98]
Despite being corporately reunited with Paramount Pictures in 2019 as a result of the ViacomCBS merger, Paramount maintains an existing output deal withMGM+(formerly Epix, which Paramount co-owned with Lionsgate and MGM from its 2009 launch until 2018) until the end of 2025. New films from Paramount Pictures will not be able to air on Showtime until 2026 unless further negotiations are made.[99]
Showtime also shows sub-runs – runs of films that have already received broadcast orsyndicated televisionairings – of theatrical films distributed byIFC Films,Sony Pictures(including content fromColumbia Pictures,TriStar Pictures,Screen Gems,Revolution StudiosandMorgan Creek Productions),Warner Bros. Pictures(including content fromNew Line Cinema),Universal Pictures(including content from subsidiaryFocus Features),Open Road Films,Screen Media,Oscilloscope(select films),Summit Entertainment(for films released prior to 2013),Paramount Pictures(for films released prior to 2020),Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer(including content from subsidiaryUnited Artists),Lionsgate(sub-run rights with the latter two studios are for films released prior to 2015), andWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures(including content fromPixar,20th Century Studios,Walt Disney Animation Studios,Walt Disney Pictures, andMarvel Studios).
The window between a film's initial release in theaters and its initial screening on Showtime and sister channels The Movie Channel and Flix is wider than the grace period leading to a film's initial broadcast on HBO/Cinemax,Starz/Encore, andEpix. Films that Showtime has pay cable rights to will usually run on The Movie Channel and Flix during the period of its term of licensing.
Within years of its launch, Showtime entered into licensing agreements with several movie studios. Following Viacom's 1983 acquisition of a joint stake in The Movie Channel,Paramount Pictures(then owned byGulf+Western) signed a five-year exclusive first-run distribution agreement with Showtime and The Movie Channel to carry the studio's films through 1989.[100]On July 15, 1987, HBO signed a five-year deal with Paramount Pictures to broadcast 85 of their films released from May 1988 onward;[101][102]in May 1989, after it signed a licensing deal with HBO, Paramount Pictures filed a lawsuit against Showtime Networks, Viacom and its parent National Amusements over Showtime's alleged refusal to pay a total of $88 million in fees for five films (that underperformed in their theatrical release) to reduce the minimum liability for its 75-film package from Paramount.[100]After Paramount Pictures was purchased by Viacom in 1994, Showtime (which was also owned by Viacom at the time) signed a seven-year distribution deal with Paramount which took effect in January 1998, following the expiration of Paramount Pictures' contract with HBO.[103]
In 1986, Showtime signed an agreement withBuena Vista Motion Pictures Group; its contract withWalt Disney Picturesexpired after 1992, while output deals withTouchstone PicturesandHollywood Picturesexpired after 1996.[104]Rival pay channel Starz signed a deal with Disney in 1994,[105]carrying only Touchstone Pictures and Hollywood Pictures films released from January 1997 onward early on.[106]Also in 1986, Showtime signed an agreement withOrion Picturesfor an exclusive first-run film output deal, that coincides with ownerViacompurchasing a minority stake in Showtime.[107]By 1989, Showtime had already made exclusive deals withCarolco Pictures(signed in 1988),[108]Atlantic Entertainment Group,[109]Cannon Films(both signed in 1986),[110]Universal Pictures,De Laurentiis Entertainment Group,Imagine Entertainment(signed in 1986),[111]andWeintraub Films.
On April 13, 1990, Showtime signed an exclusive first-run film output deal withNew Line Cinema; the deal expired after 1995. In July 1993, Encore signed an output deal with New Line Cinema, broadcasting its films released between 1994 and 2004.[112][113]On November 22, 1993, Showtime signed exclusive first-run premium cable rights with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (renewing an existing pact with the studio) andUnited Artists,[114]which were renewed for nine additional years in 2000.[115][116]On March 5, 1996, Showtime announced a seven-year output deal withPhoenix Pictures(as part of an agreement that also included the purchase of an 11% equity interest), broadcasting titles from that studio released between 1996 and 2002.[117]During that time, Showtime also maintained output deals withTriStar Pictures(between 1994 and 1999),[118]Dimension Films(between 1997 and 2003),[119]Castle Rock Entertainment(which expired after 1999),PolyGram Filmed Entertainment(which expired after 2001), andArtisan Entertainment.[120][121]In 2006, Showtime entered into a partial deal withRogue Picturesto broadcast select films released by the studio (especially those originally produced for home video release).
On December 4, 2008, Showtime signed a four-year exclusive first-run distribution deal with Summit Entertainment, broadcasting 42 films that were released by that studio between 2009 and 2012.[122]On May 27, 2011, rival premium channel HBO had signed an output deal with Summit Entertainment, allowing films that were released between 2013 and 2017 to be broadcast on HBO.[123]Showtime formerly had a deal withThe Weinstein Company(since 2009, including releases byDimension Films).Netflixassumed the rights to The Weinstein Company's films starting in 2016.[124][125]
The future of Showtime was put into question after negotiations to renew film output deals with Paramount Pictures (which was separated from Showtime following the December 2005split of Viacom and CBSinto two separate companies, with CBS Corporation taking ownership of Showtime; the companies would however re-merge 14 years later), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Lions Gate Entertainment broke down, due to the failure between the studios and Showtime to agree on licensing fees for movies from the channel's three largest film distributors.[126]All three studios then entered into ajoint venture, Studio 3 Partners, to formEpixas a competitor to Showtime, HBO and Starz; Epix debuted in May 2009 as abroadband Internetservice, with the television channel launching on October 30 of that year.[127][128]
From November 13, 2019 to December 31, 2023, Showtime is the exclusive premium cable broadcaster for films distributed byA24(excluding titles part of A24's already-existing partnership withApple Inc.) through an output deal made between the two entities.[97]
Showtime has broadcast a limited amount of sports programming, which is produced by the channel's Showtime Sports division. Showtime also operates Showtime Sports PPV (formerly Showtime Sports & Entertainment Television or SSET), which formerly broadcast boxing matches and has broadcast other select event programming forpay-per-view. Beginning in March 1986, Showtime's sports programming consisted largely ofboxing matchesproduced under the bannerShowtime Championship Boxing; in 2001, the network launchedShoBox: The New Generation, focusing primarily on up-and-coming boxers. In 2004, Showtime began broadcasting all domestic fights telecast on the channel in high definition.[129]
In December 2006, Showtime announced a deal to broadcastmixed martial artsmatches from the then-newly formedElite Xtreme Combat(or EliteXC), an MMA organization formed by Showtime Networks and ProElite, Inc., with all events broadcast under the bannerShoXC; the league folded two years later in 2008.[130]
In 2008, Showtime acquiredInside the NFL, the longest-running program in the history of HBO, from HBO after it had cancelled the seasonal analysis and interview program in February of that year;Inside the NFLmoved to Showtime that September. In 2021,Inside the NFLmoved toParamount+.[131]
In February 2009, mixed martial arts promotionStrikeforceannounced a three-year broadcast agreement with Showtime, allowing it to broadcast up to 16 events per year, as well as a deal with sister network CBS for an option to produce up to four events for that network;[132]Strikeforce ended its run on Showtime when the league folded in January 2013.[133]In addition to broadcasting big-ticket Strikeforce events on Showtime, the promotion also announced it would produceShoMMA: Strikeforce Challengers, an event series highlighting up-and-coming fighters.[134]

Linked page for 'William Friedkin' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Friedkin):
William David Friedkin(/ˈfriːdkɪn/; August 29, 1935 – August 7, 2023) was an American film, television and opera director, producer, and screenwriter who was closely identified with the "New Hollywood" movement of the 1970s.[1][2]Beginning his career in documentaries in the early 1960s, he is best known for his crime thriller filmThe French Connection(1971), which won fiveAcademy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Director, and the horror filmThe Exorcist(1973), which earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Director.
Friedkin's other films in the 1970s and 1980s include the dramaThe Boys in the Band(1970), considered a milestone ofqueer cinema; the originally deprecated, now lauded thrillerSorcerer(1977); the crime comedy dramaThe Brink's Job(1978); the controversial thrillerCruising(1980);[3][4]and the neo-noir thrillerTo Live and Die in L.A.(1985). Although Friedkin's works suffered an overall commercial and critical decline in the late 1980s, his last three feature films, all based on plays, were positively received by critics: the psychological horror filmBug(2006), the crime filmKiller Joe(2011), and the legal drama filmThe Caine Mutiny Court-Martial(2023), released two months after his death. He also worked extensively as an opera director from 1998 until his death, and directed various television films and series episodes for television.
Friedkin was born in Chicago, Illinois, on August 29, 1935, the son of Rachael (née Green) and Louis Friedkin. His father was a semi-professional softball player, merchant seaman, and men's clothing salesman. His mother, whom Friedkin called "a saint," was a nurse.[5][6]His parents wereJewish emigrants from Ukraine, in the Russian empire.[7]His grandparents, parents, and other relatives fled Russia during a particularly violentanti-Jewish pogromin 1903.[8]Friedkin's father was somewhat uninterested in making money, and the family was generally lower middle class while he was growing up. According to film historianPeter Biskind, "Friedkin viewed his father with a mixture of affection and contempt for not making more of himself."[5]
After attending public schools in Chicago, Friedkin enrolled atSenn High School, where he played basketball well enough to consider turning professional.[9]He was not a serious student and barely received grades good enough to graduate,[10]which he did at the age of 16.[11]He said this was because ofsocial promotionand not because he was bright.[12]
Friedkin began going to movies as a teenager,[9]and citedCitizen Kaneas one of his key influences. Several sources claim that Friedkin saw this motion picture as a teenager,[13]but Friedkin himself said that he did not see the film until 1960, when he was 25 years old. Only then, Friedkin said, did he become a truecineaste.[14]Among the movies that he also saw as a teenager and young adult wereLes Diaboliques,The Wages of Fear(which many consider he remade asSorcerer), andPsycho(which he viewed repeatedly, likeCitizen Kane). Televised documentaries such as 1960'sHarvest of Shamewere also important to his developing sense of cinema.[9]
Friedkin began working in the mail room atWGN-TVimmediately after high school.[15]Within two years (at the age of 18),[16]he started hisdirectorialcareer doing live television shows and documentaries.[17]His efforts includedThe People vs. Paul Crump(1962), which won an award[which?]at theSan Francisco International Film Festivaland contributed to the commutation ofCrump'sdeath sentence.[16][18]Its success helped Friedkin get a job with producerDavid L. Wolper.[16]He also made the football-themed documentaryMayhem on a Sunday Afternoon(1965).[19]
As mentioned in his voice-over commentary on the DVD re-release ofAlfred Hitchcock'sVertigo, Friedkin directed one of the last episodes ofThe Alfred Hitchcock Hourin 1965, called "Off Season". Hitchcock admonished Friedkin for not wearing a tie while directing.[20]
In 1965, Friedkin moved to Hollywood and two years later released his first feature film,Good TimesstarringSonny and Cher. He has referred to the film as "unwatchable".[21]Several other films followed:The Birthday Party, based on an unpublished screenplay byHarold Pinter, which he adapted from his own play; the musical comedyThe Night They Raided Minsky's, starringJason RobardsandBritt Ekland; and the adaptation ofMart Crowley's playThe Boys in the Band.[22]
His next film,The French Connection, was released to wide critical acclaim in 1971. Shot in a gritty style more suited for documentaries than Hollywood features, the film won fiveAcademy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Director.[23]Friedkin's next film was 1973'sThe Exorcist, based onWilliam Peter Blatty's best-selling novel, which revolutionized the horror genre and is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time.The Exorcistwas nominated for 10Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. It won forBest ScreenplayandBest Sound. Following these two pictures, Friedkin, along withFrancis Ford CoppolaandPeter Bogdanovich, was deemed one of the premier directors ofNew Hollywood. In 1973, the trio announced the formation of an independent production company atParamount Pictures,The Directors Company. Whereas Coppola directedThe Conversationand Bogdanovich, theHenry Jamesadaptation,Daisy Miller, Friedkin abruptly left the company, which was soon closed by Paramount.[24]
Friedkin's later movies did not achieve the same success.Sorcerer(1977), a $22 million Americanremakeof the French classicThe Wages of Fear, co-produced by both Universal and Paramount, starringRoy Scheider, was overshadowed by theblockbusterbox-office success ofStar Wars, which had been released exactly one week prior.[23]Friedkin considered it his finest film, and was personally devastated by its financial and critical failure (as mentioned by Friedkin himself in the 1999 documentary seriesThe Directors).Sorcererwas shortly followed by the crime-comedyThe Brink's Job(1978), based on the real-lifeGreat Brink's RobberyinBoston, Massachusetts, which was also unsuccessful at the box-office.[25]
In 1980, Friedkin directed an adaptation of theGerald Walkercrime thrillerCruising, starringAl Pacino, which was protested during production and remains the subject of heated debate. It was critically assailed but performed moderately at the box office.[26]
Friedkin had a heart attack on March 6, 1981, due to a genetic defect in hiscircumflex left coronary artery, and nearly died. He spent months in rehabilitation.[27]His next picture was 1983'sDeal of the Century, a satire aboutarms dealingstarringChevy Chase,Gregory Hines, andSigourney Weaver.
In 1985, Friedkin directed the music video forBarbra Streisand's rendition of theWest Side Storysong "Somewhere",[28]which she recorded for her twenty-fourth studio LP,The Broadway Album. He later appears as Streisand's interviewer (uncredited) on the television special, "Putting It Together: The Making of the Broadway Album".[29]
The action/crime movieTo Live and Die in L.A.(1985), starringWilliam PetersenandWillem Dafoe, was a critical favorite and drew comparisons to Friedkin's ownThe French Connection(particularly for its car chase sequence), while his courtroom drama/thrillerRampage(1987) received a fairly positive review fromRoger Ebert.[30]He next directed the cult classic horror filmThe Guardian(1990) and the thrillerJade(1995), starringLinda Fiorentino. Though the latter received an unfavorable response from critics and audiences, he said it was one of the favorite films he directed.[31]
In 2000,The Exorcistwas re-released in theaters with extra footage and grossed $40 million in the U.S. alone. Friedkin directed the 2006 filmBugdue to a positive experience watchingthe stage versionin 2004. He was surprised to find that he was, metaphorically, on the same page as the playwright and felt that he could relate well to the story.[32]The film won theFIPRESCIprize at theCannes Film Festival. Later, Friedkin directed an episode of the TV seriesCSI: Crime Scene Investigationtitled "Cockroaches", which re-teamed him withTo Live and Die in L.A.starWilliam Petersen.[33]He directed again forCSI's 200th episode, "Mascara".[34]
In 2011, Friedkin directedKiller Joe, a black comedy written byTracy Lettsbased onLetts' play, and starringMatthew McConaughey,Emile Hirsch,Juno Temple,Gina Gershon, andThomas Haden Church.Killer Joepremiered at the68th Venice International Film Festival, prior to its North American debut at the2011 Toronto International Film Festival. It opened in U.S. theaters in July 2012, to some favorable reviews from critics but did poorly at the box office, possibly because of its restrictive NC-17 rating. In April 2013, Friedkin published a memoir,The Friedkin Connection.[35]He was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the70th Venice International Film Festivalin September.[36]In 2017, Friedkin directed the documentaryThe Devil and Father Amorthabout the ninthexorcismof a woman in the Italian village ofAlatri.[37]In August 2022, it was announced officially that Friedkin would be returning to film directing to helman adaptationof the two-act playThe Caine Mutiny Court-MartialwithKiefer Sutherlandstarring as Lt. Commander Queeg.[38]The film was completed before Friedkin's death, and debuted in September 2023 in the out-of-competition category at theVenice Film Festival.[39]
Friedkin citedJean-Luc Godard,Federico Fellini,François Truffaut, andAkira Kurosawaas influences.[40]Friedkin namedWoody Allenas "the greatest living filmmaker".[41]
In regard to influences of specific films on his films, Friedkin noted thatThe French Connection['s]  documentary-like realism was the direct result of the influence of having seenZ, a French film byCosta-Gavras:
After I sawZ, I realized how I could shootThe French Connection. Because he shotZlike a documentary. It was a fiction film but it was made like it was actually happening. Like the camera didn't know what was gonna happen next. And that is an induced technique. It looks like he happened upon the scene and captured what was going on as you do in a documentary. My first films were documentaries too. So I understood what he was doing but I never thought you could do that in a feature at that time until I sawZ.[42]
Friedkin was married four times:
While filmingThe Boys in the Bandin 1970, Friedkin began a relationship withKitty Hawks, daughter of directorHoward Hawks. It lasted two years, during which the couple announced theirengagement, but the relationship ended about 1972.[51]Friedkin began a four-year relationship with Australian dancer and choreographerJennifer Nairn-Smithin 1972. Although they announced an engagement twice, they never married. They had a son, Cedric, on November 27, 1976.[52][53]Friedkin and his second wife, Lesley-Anne Down, also had a son, Jack, born in 1982.[46]Friedkin was raised Jewish, but called himself an agnostic later in life, although he said that he strongly believed in the teachings ofJesus Christ.[54][55]
Friedkin died fromheart failureandpneumoniaat his home in theBel Airneighborhood of Los Angeles on August 7, 2023.[6][56]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
