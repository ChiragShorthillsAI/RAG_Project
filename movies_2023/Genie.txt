Genieis a 2023 AmericanChristmasfantasy comedyfilm directed by Sam Boyd and written byRichard Curtis. It is a remake of the 1991 British television filmBernard and the Genie, also written by Curtis. The film starsMelissa McCarthy,Paapa Essiedu,Denée Benton,Marc Maron, Jordyn McIntosh,Luis GuzmánandAlan Cumming. It was released onPeacockon November 22, 2023.
Bernard is overworked and overstressed at his job with a high-end auction house in New York. In trying to satisfy the unreasonable demands of his narcissistic, greedy, cruel boss, Mr. Flaxman, Bernard misses his daughter Eve's 8th birthday (and other family time). Having failed to bring his daughter a birthday present, Bernard lamely offers her an antique box that he had sitting in their home. Bernard's disappointed wife Julie leaves him, and the next day Mr. Flaxman fires Bernard. A dejected Bernard wipes dust off the box, and swirling colorfully out of it appears a 2,000+ year-oldgenienamed Flora, an eccentric middle-aged woman, who tells Bernard that she can grant him unlimited wishes.
Flora encourages Bernard to solve his problems by making a plan and using his wishes to execute it. Bernard is slow to come up with a good plan, and his early wishes tend to go awry.  For example, when his family comes to visit, he accidentally sends one of them briefly to a fiery hell before sending them all back home. Another involves redecorating the apartment in a way that his wife might like, including swapping theMona Lisafor a framed football jersey, which she never liked to see hanging on the wall. This ends up with Bernard and Flora being arrested and threatened with extradition to France. Nevertheless, Bernard is able to reconnect with his daughter and makes some wishes that help fulfill the Christmas dreams of children and house the homeless. Flora comes to respect Bernard's character. She also develops a romantic interest in Bernard's doorman, Lenny.
Bernard has seen that Flora is rather sad and lonely as a genie, and he uses a wish to free her. She tells him that he will still have three wishes afterwards. He uses the first wish to go back in time to the point before he had missed his daughter's birthday. He quits his job at the auction house, instead taking his wife and daughter out for her birthday, and giving her a doll house, which she had hoped for. He uses his last two wishes to make sure that they have a wonderful dinner at an exclusive restaurant. Three months later, Bernard goes out to pick up a pizza: Lenny now is running Bernard's favorite pizza joint, and Flora is making the pies.

The website's consensus reads: "Melissa McCarthy is as hard-working as ever, but her efforts aren't enough to raiseGeniepast the realm of blandly predictable holiday fare."[7]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 35 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[8]
Owen GleibermanofVarietywrote "It's certainly a wholesome Christmas cookie of a movie, so if that's your thing by all means make it a holiday streaming snack. But it's my wish that Melissa McCarthy would get the great comedy she deserves."[9]The Hollywood Reporter'sFrank Scheckwrote, "To be fair, the film directed by Sam Boyd has its amusing moments, thanks to Curtis' well-honed comic instincts. Essiedu nicely underplays as Bernard, going more for emotion than cheap laughs, and McCarthy is such a warm, engaging presence that you'll search your home for any old-looking bottle that might contain a similarly helpful genie".[10]

For a short period in the 1970s, he lived inWarrington,Cheshire, where he attended Appleton Grammar School (nowBridgewater High School). He lived at Merricourt on Windmill Lane,Appleton, Warrington, during this time. His university friendRowan Atkinsonwas an occasional visitor to the house.[11]
He then won a scholarship toHarrow School, where he joined the editorial team ofThe Harrovian, the weekly school magazine, and this, he asserts, is "where I learned all the skills that made me a sketch writer. I did reviews, comment pieces and funny articles where I'd try to conjure something out of nothing."[12]While at Harrow, Curtis directed a school performance ofJoe Orton's playThe Erpingham Camp; this controversial choice was given the 'green light' by his classics master,James Morwood. Later, Curtis commented that Morwood's support had helped him understand that it was all right "to push boundaries and to be funny".[12]Curtis did not approve offaggingat the school, and at 18, when he became head of his house, he banned it.[12]
He achieved a first-class Bachelor of Arts in English Language and Literature atChrist Church, Oxford. At theUniversity of Oxford, he met and began working withRowan Atkinson, after they both joined the scriptwriting team of the Etceteras revue, part of theExperimental Theatre Club. He appeared in the company's "After Eights" at theOxford Playhousein May 1976.
Collaborating withRowan AtkinsoninThe Oxford Revue, he appeared alongside him at his breakthroughEdinburgh Fringeshow. As a result, he was commissioned to co-write the BBC Radio 3 seriesThe Atkinson Peoplewith Atkinson in 1978, which was broadcast in 1979.[13]He then began to write comedy for film and TV. He was a regular writer on the BBC comedy seriesNot the Nine O'Clock News, where he wrote many of the show's satirical sketches, often with Rowan Atkinson. Curtis co-wrote withPhilip PopeforThe Hee Bee Gee Bees' song "Meaningless Songs (In Very High Voices)", released in 1980, to parody the style of a series ofThe Bee Gees' disco hits. In 1984 and 1985, Curtis wrote material for ITV's satirical puppet showSpitting Image.[14]
First with Atkinson and later withBen Elton, Curtis then wrote theBlackadderseries from 1983 to 1989, each season focusing on a different era in British history. Atkinson playedthe leadthroughout, but Curtis was the only writer who participated inevery episode ofBlackadder. The pair continued their collaboration with the comedy seriesMr. Bean, which ran from 1990 to 1995.
Curtis had by then already begun writing feature films. His first wasThe Tall Guy(1989), a romantic comedy starringJeff Goldblum,Emma Thompsonand Rowan Atkinson and produced by Working Title films. The TV movieBernard and the Geniefollowed in 1991.
In 1994, Curtis created and co-wroteThe Vicar of Dibleyfor comedianDawn French, which was a great success. In an online poll conducted in 2004Britain's Best Sitcom, it was voted the third-best sitcom in British history andBlackadderthe second-best, making Curtis the only screenwriter to create two shows in the poll's top 10 programmes.[citation needed]
Curtis achieved his breakthrough success with the romantic comedyFour Weddings and a Funeral.The 1994 film, starringHugh GrantandAndie MacDowell, was produced on a limited budget by the British production companyWorking Title Films. Curtis choseMike Newellto direct the film after watching his TV filmReady When You Are, Mr. McGill.[15]Four Weddings and a Funeralproved to be the top-grossing British film in history at that time. It made an international star of Grant, and Curtis' Oscar nomination for the script catapulted him to prominence (though the Oscar went toQuentin TarantinoandRoger AvaryforPulp Fiction). The film was also nominated for Best Picture, but lost toForrest Gump.
Curtis' next film was also for Working Title, which has remained his artistic home ever since. 1997'sBeanbrought Mr. Bean to the big screen and was a huge hit around the world. He continued his association with Working Title writing the 1999 romantic comedyNotting Hill,starringHugh GrantandJulia Roberts, which broke the record set byFour Weddings and a Funeralto become the top-grossing British film. The story of a lonely travel bookstore owner who falls in love with the world's most famous movie star was directed byRoger Michell.
Curtis next co-wrote the screen adaptation of the international bestsellerBridget Jones's Diaryfor Working Title. Curtis knew the novel's writerHelen Fielding. Indeed, he has credited her with saying that his original script forFour Weddings and a Funeralwas too upbeat and needed the addition of the titular funeral.
Two years later, Curtis re-teamed with Working Title to write and directLove Actually. Curtis has said in interviews that the sprawling, multi-character structure ofLove Actuallyowes a debt to his favourite film,Robert Altman'sNashville. The film featured a "Who's Who" of UK actors, includingHugh Grant,Colin Firth,Bill Nighy,Emma Thompson,Liam Neeson,Andrew Lincoln,Alan RickmanandKeira Knightley, in a loosely connected series of stories about people in and out of love in London in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Its regular festive screening has seen it labelled as being arguably a modern-day Christmas staple.[16][17]
Curtis followed this in 2004 with work as co-writer onBridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, the sequel toBridget Jones's Diary. Curtis then wrote the screenplay toThe Girl in the Café, a television film directed byDavid Yatesand produced by theBBCandHBOas part of theMake Poverty Historycampaign'sLive 8efforts in 2005. The film starsBill Nighyas a civil servant andKelly Macdonaldas a young woman he falls in love with at a fictionalG8 summitin Iceland. Macdonald's character pushes him to ask whether the developed countries of the world cannot do more to help the most impoverished. The film was timed to air just before theGleneagles G8 summitin 2005. It received threeEmmy Awardsin 2006, includingOutstanding Made for Television Movie,Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a MovieforKelly Macdonaldand aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Specialtrophy for Curtis himself. Curtis said of Yates' direction that he made "a much more beautiful film, and a surprising film and a better film than I could possibly have made."[15]
"The difference between having a good idea for a movie and a finished movie is the same as seeing a pretty girl across the floor at a party and being there when she gives birth to your third child... It's a very long journey."
In May 2007, he received theBAFTAFellowship at theBritish Academy Television Awardsin recognition of his successful career in film and television and his charity efforts.[19][20]Curtis next co-wrote withAnthony Minghellaan adaptation ofAlexander McCall Smith's novel,The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, which Minghella shot in mid-2007 in Botswana. It premiered on the BBC on 23 March 2008, just days after Minghella's death. The film did not run in the US until early 2009, when HBO aired it as the pilot of a resulting six-episode TV series with the same cast, on which Curtis served as executive producer.
His second film as writer/director,The Boat That Rocked, was released in 2009. The film was set in 1966 in the era ofBritish pirate radio. It followed a group of DJs on apirate radio stationrun from a boat in theNorth Sea. The film starredPhilip Seymour Hoffman,Bill Nighy,Nick Frost,Rhys Ifans,Gemma ArtertonandKenneth Branagh. The film was a commercial and critical disappointment in the UK. Curtis re-edited the film for its US release where it was re-titledPirate Radio, but also failed to find an audience. He followed that withWar Horse, which he rewrote for directorSteven Spielbergbased on an earlier script by playwrightLee Hall. Curtis was recommended to Spielberg byDreamWorks StudioexecutiveStacey Snider, who had worked with Curtis during her time atUniversal Studios. Curtis's work on the World War I-setBlackadder Goes Forthmeant he was already familiar with the period.[21]

Soon after the film came out, Curtis delivered a screenwriting lecture as part of the BAFTA and BFI Screenwriters' Lecture Series.[24]He followed that withTrash, which he adapted from thenovelby Andy Mulligan for directorStephen Daldry.[25]With three unknown Brazilian children in the lead roles, the film co-starredWagner Moura,Rooney MaraandMartin Sheen. It was filmed in 2013 in Rio de Janeiro and released in Brazil on 9 October 2014 and in the UK on 30 January 2015.

While Barth's original screenplay depicted an obscure musician unable to capitalize on his windfall, Curtis's more conventional script featured an independent musician unable to control his own career once the music industry takes over.[28]It began filming on 21 April 2018 and was released on 28 June 2019.[30]

The campaign fights for a 0.05% tax levied on each bank trade ranging from shares to foreign exchange and derivatives that could generate $700bn worldwide and be spent on measures to combat domestic and international poverty as well as fightclimate change.[32]
In October 2010, a short film created by Curtis titledNo Pressurewas released by the10:10 campaignin Britain to promoteclimate change politics. The film depicted a series of scenes in which people were asked if they were going to participate in the 10:10 campaign, told there was "no pressure" to do so, but if they did not, they were blown up at the press of a red button.
Reaction was mixed, but the video was swiftly removed from the organisation's website.[33]

Peter Debruge from theVarietywrote: "If Bailey is the film’s big discovery, then McCarthy is its no-brainer. Dolled up to look like Divine’s evil-stepsister in her glowing green lair, the comic star’s just delicious as the movie’s deep-sea villain. Her timing is impeccable, and though the part is virtually identical to the one Pat Carroll originated, she aces what’s demanded of these tricky remakes: Basically, McCarthy manages to hit every beat the super fans expect, while surprising with every pause and inflection."[92]

And I think just saying like, "Can't we all just be kind to each other?" and that gets a "F— you, lady," I don't know what to do."[98]

He frequently appeared in the live alternative stand-up series he had organized withJaneane GarofalocalledEating It, which used the rock barLuna Loungein New York'sLower East Sideas its venue, from the 1990s until the building was razed in 2005.[27]
His first one-man show,Jerusalem Syndrome, had an extendedoff-Broadwayrun in 2000 and was released in book form in 2001. In 2009, he began workshopping another one-man show,Scorching the Earth. According to Maron (inScorching The Earth), these two shows "bookend" his relationship with his second wife, comicMishna Wolff, which ended in a bitter divorce.[28][29]
In May 2008, he toured withEugene MirmanandAndy KindlerinStand Uppity: Comedy That Makes You Feel Better About Yourself and Superior to Others.In January 2009, a collaboration withSam Seder, which had begun in September 2007 as a weekly hour-long video webcast becameBreakroom Live with Maron & Seder, produced by Air America.[30]Until its cancellation in July 2009, the show was webcast live weekdays at 3 p.m. Eastern, with episodes archived for later viewing. In its final incarnation, the show was informal, taking place in the actual break room of Air America Media, with the cafeteria vending machines just off-camera. This meant occasional distractions when Air America staff and management alike would occasionally come in for food and drink. Maron and Seder held court in an online "post-show chat" with viewers, in an even less formal continuation of each webcast, after the credits had rolled.
Maron's stand-up act is marked by his commitment to self-revelation and cultural analysis. He is particularly known for relentless on-stage exploration of his own relationships with family, girlfriends, and other stand-up comedians whom he has known and befriended over his years in the business.[31]In October 2013, Maron released his first hour-long special through Netflix,Marc Maron: Thinky Pain.[32]Maron would follow this with another special,More Later, which was released in December 2015 throughEpix.[33]

His 2023 specialFrom Bleak to Darkwas namedNew Yorkmagazine's "No. 1 Best Comedy Special of 2023."[35]
From almost the first day of theliberal talk radionetworkAir America's broadcasts in 2004, Maron co-hostedMorning Sedition, a three-hour early-morningradio showwithMark Rileythat aired weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern time.[36]The show was unique in the Air America lineup in its heavy reliance on both live and pre-produced sketch comedy, utilizing the talents of staff writers as well as the on-air hosts. The format was aleft-leaningnear-satire of typical morning "Buddy" radio programs, including recurring characters, interviews and listener call-in segments, and it attracted a loyal fan base.[37]
As 2005 came to an end, it became known that Maron's contract would not be renewed on its December 1, 2005, end date because of problems with then Air America executive Danny Goldberg. Goldberg reportedly did not "get" the comedy or agree with the satiric and often angry tone set by Maron and other writers (Jim EarlandKent Jones) for a morning drive-time show. On November 28, 2005, it was officially announced that Maron's contract had not been renewed. His lastMorning Seditionbroadcast was on December 16, 2005, and the show was discontinued shortly thereafter.[36]
On February 28, 2006, Maron began hosting a nighttime radio program withJim Earlas a sidekick forKTLK Progressive Talk 1150AMin Los Angeles calledThe Marc Maron Showfrom 10:00 pm until midnight PST. The program was frequently delayed (sometimes for over an hour) owing to KTLK's contractual agreement to broadcast local sports events that would often go into overtime.The Marc Maron Showwas never nationally syndicated by Air America despite reported contractual clauses promising such. The show was streamed online live, but the show was not publicized, and the existence of the stream was not well promoted.[citation needed]
On July 5, it was announced that Maron's final episode would be on July 14. A few days before that date, Maron bluntly discussed his long struggle with Air America Radio's executives on-air. In 2008, Marc andSam Sederexpanded their prior collaboration on a weekly hour-long video webcast (streamed at The Sam Seder Show website) into a daily show (and "post-show chat") produced by Air America Media[38]calledMaron v. Seder.[39]The show becameBreakroom Live with Maron & Sederstarting in 2009 and could be viewed on Air America Media's website.[40]On July 15, 2009, after less than one year, Air America Media canceledBreakroom Live. According to the show's hosts, the cancellation was for financial reasons.[41]Ironically, the day before the cancellation, the show got some of the first real publicity it had ever received when MaximumFun.org posted its podcast of an interview with Maron onThe Sound of Young America.[42]
On the finalBreakroom Livewebcast, Maron said that this marked the third time since 2005 he'd been told by an executive at the network that his services would not be required in the immediate future. Co-host Sam Seder pointed out that this would be the end of hisfourthshow at Air America since the troubled network's inception.[43]
Due to a precarious state in his comedic career, on September 1, 2009, Maron began a twice-weeklypodcastcalledWTF with Marc Maronin what Maron would later describe in a 2015 interview as a "Hail Mary pass"; his first-ever guest was fellow stand-upJeff Ross.[44][45]In a free-form discussion, Maron and his guests touch on topics like the arc of the interviewees' careers, their shared past experiences, and stories from the road.[38]As of 2024, Maron has released more than 1,500 episodes of the show, garnering critical acclaim and more than 600 million downloads;[46][47][48]notable guests includePresident Barack Obama,Sir Paul McCartney,Robin Williams,Jerry Seinfeld,Chris Rock,Lorne Michaels,Leonardo DiCaprio, andBrad Pitt. The show has been noted for its influence on other long-form interview podcasts that emerged after its debut.[49][50][51]In April 2021, it was announced that Maron and his producer Brendan McDonald would be the recipients of the first-ever Governors Award by the Podcast Academy for Excellence in Audio (The Ambies) for their work onWTF.[52]The success of Maron's podcast opened up numerous other avenues on film and TV as well as giving him a massive boost to audience attendance at his stand-up shows.
His only major film credit for many years was a small part credited as "angry promoter" in the 2000Cameron CrowefilmAlmost Famous, in which he is first seen fighting withNoah Taylor's character and then yelling at and chasing after the main characters as they drive away on a bus, at which point he yells, "Lock the gates!" which is now used in the intro to his podcasts.[53]He was also featured at the Luna Lounge in the 1997 mockumentaryWho's the Caboose?starringSarah SilvermanandSam Seder.[54]In 2019, Maron starred in aLynn Shelton–directed comedy film titledSword of Trust.[55]In 2020, Maron played publicist Ron Oberman oppositeJohnny Flynn'syoung David Bowie in the movieStardust.[56]

Maron, a television series created by and starring Maron for a 10-episode first season, premiered onIFCon May 3, 2013.[59]The show is loosely autobiographical, revolving around Maron's life as a twice-divorced sober comedian running a comedy podcast out of his garage but establishing many differences between the real-life Maron and the version of him on TV. As the executive producer and star ofMaron, Maron appeared in all 51 episodes of the show from 2013 to 2016, portraying a fictionalized version of himself.[60]The show ended in 2016 after four seasons onIFC.[61]Maron directed two episodes of the show, "The Joke" and "Ex-Pod."

In an interview withKCRW, Maron stated, "I have no idea why they asked me to play guitar on the track. I'm only good at one thing on the guitar. It just so happens it was exactly the thing they needed."[71]
Reviews for the solo were positive.IFC's Melissa Locker said "Marc Maron plays a mean guitar."[72]Spin's Chris Martins called the guitar solo a "shredfest" as well as "angular."[73]The Strangercalled it "a frequency-fraying guitar solo that's better than you'd expect, although it won't makeJ Mascisjealous."[74]
Maron wrote and performed on the score for his filmSword of Trust.[75]
Maron lived inAstoria, Queens, through the 1990s and most of the 2000s, but moved back to Los Angeles in late 2009.[76]Maron also speaks openly of his caring for numerous stray cats that he takes into his home. This has led him to refer to his home, on theWTFpodcast, as the "Cat Ranch".[77]After his cat Boomer went missing, Maron began incorporating the catchphrase "Boomer lives!" to the end of each podcast. Since then, he has one addition to the "Cat Ranch" by the name of Buster Kitten. LaFonda died in December 2019. After she passed, Maron briefly replaced "Boomer lives!" with "LaFonda lives!" for a few episodes of his podcast. Monkey died in August 2020. He now usually concludes his podcast with some guitar playing and the phrase "Boomer lives... LaFonda... Monkey... Cat angels everywhere!" Maron currently lives inGlendale, Los Angeles, with his two cats, Buster and Sammy.[78]
Maron has spoken openly, in his act and on his podcast, about his alcohol and drug abuse during the 1990s.

Maron has been married twice, to Kimberly Reiss andMishna Wolff, a former stand-up comedian. Both relationships have figured prominently in his act. During numerous appearances at theEdinburgh Fringefestival in 2007, Maron riffed on his then-recent separation and divorce from Wolff.
On the October 14, 2013, episode of his podcast, Maron announced that he had broken up with his former fiancée, Jessica Sanchez.[81]He then had a five-month relationship withMoon Zappa.[82]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
