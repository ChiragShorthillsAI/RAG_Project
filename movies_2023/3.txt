As a child, Anne Yum finds comfort in the TVgame showCan't Stop the Quizto escape her stressful family; her father leaves them, her mother is a gambling addict, and her older sister Jenny abandons Anne and their dog, Mr. Linguini, to pursue dreams of fame. Years later, a tightly wound Anne lives alone with Mr. Linguini and feels invisible at work but still watchesCan't Stop the Quizevery night.
Learning that her mother has escaped her nursing home and fled toMacau, Anne reunites with the reckless, chaotic Jenny. Unemployed and living in her car, Jenny comes to stay with Anne and claims to have won a lucrative lawsuit against a restaurant chain after choking on a chicken bone. While watchingCan't Stop the Quiz, Jenny secretly records Anne answering every question at remarkable speed, and the video goes viral, much to Anne's horror. She is tracked down by Ken, aloan sharkwho has kidnapped Mr. Linguini and demands that Anne pay off her mother's $80,000 debt.
Jenny encourages Anne — whose video gained the attention of theCan't Stop the Quizcasting directors — to go on the show and win enough money to get Mr. Linguini back. Anne refuses, but Jenny kidnaps her and drives her toPhiladelphiato audition for the show, admitting on the way that she lied about winning the lawsuit. Jenny dislocates her wrist at a bar. Waiting at the hospital, they reminisce about the childhood summer they spent with their cousins inBurbank, who didn't like them and never invited them back. Anne reveals that she felt too uncomfortable and unwelcome to use the cousins' bathroom, leading her to defecate in a hole in the backyard.
At the audition, Jenny calms a nervous Anne with drugs that are soon revealed to behallucinogens. After taking a different drug to counteract the others, Anne does well, impressing the crowd and the producers. Jenny reveals that she lied about lying about the lawsuit, and really does have a large settlement coming; this was all part of her plan to become a self-describedlife coach, knowing Anne would not have tried out for the show otherwise. An angry Anne lashes out at Jenny, who reveals that their cousins discovered the hole in the backyard, but Jenny willingly took the blame.
Anne returns home and bonds with her cantankerous neighbor Francine, who urges her not to worry about getting people to like her. Invited to compete onCan't Stop the Quiz, Anne finally stands up to her obnoxious coworkers and decides to go on the show with Francine as her partner. Meanwhile, Jenny tries to negotiate with Ken, discovering that he and his gang are running a struggling animal shelter, and she steals Mr. Linguini back.
Traveling toLos Angeleswith Francine to film the show, Anne meets her idol, host Terry McTeer, and maintains her disdain for Ron, the show's obsequious long-running champion. Anne is too used to answering questions at home with her dog at her side and finishes the first round in a distant second place to Ron. Jenny arrives with Mr. Linguini, and the sisters reconcile as she convinces Anne to finish the game. She also forces the producers to let Mr. Linguini join Anne, who catches up to Ron in the second round.
During a commercial break, an anxious Anne is comforted by Terry. When the third round is chosen to be a game of charades, Anne switches partners to play with Jenny instead, and they share a heartfelt moment on the winning word, as Anne admits that Jenny is her hero. Anne wins, while Ron has an on-camera meltdown until he is told off by Terry. The sisters arrange for Francine to meetPaul Reubens, her celebrity crush, whom she thinks isAlan Cumming.
Anne goes on to win a record-breaking 93 consecutive games and is hired as a writer on the show. Jenny receives her obscenely large check from the lawsuit, paying off their mother's debt and buying aMalibumansion where Anne, Jenny, and Mr. Linguini live together.

Hulu(/ˈhuːluː/,HOO-loo) is an Americansubscriptionstreaming mediaservice owned byDisney Streaming, a subsidiary of theDisney Entertainmentsegment ofthe Walt Disney Company. It was launched on October 29, 2007, initially as ajoint venturebetweenNews Corporation(later21st Century Fox) andNBC Universal, which was laterbought byComcast. Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initiallybrandedas "Hulu Plus," which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and un-delayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—anover-the-topstreaming television service offering access tobroadcast televisionchannels.
In 2011, Hulu launchedits services in Japan, marking its first and only international expansion. Three years later in 2014, Hulu Japan was acquired byNippon TVand spun off from its American counterpart.[2]Since February 2021, Hulu's original content has since been distributed outside of the U.S. viaDisney+under theStarbrand. In 2019, Disney acquired a majority stake in Hulu as part of itsacquisition of 21st Century Fox, and subsequently acquired the remaining stakes held by AT&T and Comcast in 2019 and 2023, respectively, giving it full ownership. After the acquisition, Disneysoft launchedan integration of Hulu into Disney+ as a content hub in December 2023, allowing subscribers of both services to access Hulu content from within the Disney+ app. Hulu is one of the three streaming services in the Disney Bundle, alongside Disney+ andESPN+.
On January 6, 2025, Disney began its acquisition of a 70% stake inFuboTV, with the latter merging with Hulu's Live TV service. The combined company will remain publicly traded on theNew York Stock Exchange, but will be controlled by Disney executives. As part of the deal, Fubo settled a lawsuit againstESPN Inc.(majority-owned by Disney),Fox Corporation(21CF's successor), andWarner Bros. Discovery(WarnerMedia's successor after its merger withDiscovery, Inc.) over a joint venture known asVenu Sports, with Fubo being granted a preliminary injection to stop its launch in August 2024. The merger will take 12 to 18 months according to Disney and Fubo. Venu Sports was discontinued a few days later.
The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

Hulu began an advertising campaign during NBC's broadcast ofSuper Bowl XLIIIwith an initial ad starringAlec Baldwintitled "Alec in Huluwood."[16]Advertisements have since aired featuringEliza Dushku,Seth MacFarlane,Denis Leary, andWill Arnett.[citation needed]
In July 2007,Providence Equity, the owner ofNewport Television, became one of the earliest "outside" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 millionequity investment,[17]before the company was known as "Hulu."[18]With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an "independent voice on the board."[18]In April 2009,the Walt Disney Companyjoined the Hulu consortium as a stakeholder, with plans to offer content fromABC,ESPNandDisney Channel.[19][20][21][22]
Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

Her more recent films have been:Misconception(2014),ForEveryone.Net(2016), a documentary film about the inventor of theWorld Wide Web, SirTim Berners-Lee, and a Netflix comedyMaria Bamford: Old Baby(2017).  In 2019, Yu was nominated for anEmmy Awardfor "Outstanding Direction for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special" for theFosse/Verdonepisode "Glory".[2]
Yu grew up inLos Altos Hills,California. Her father, Dr. John Kou-ping Yu, anoncologist, was born inShanghai. Her mother,Connie Young Yu, writer and historian, is a third-generationCalifornian.[citation needed]
Yu graduated fromGunn High SchoolinPalo Alto.[when?]She was a reporter for the school newspaper,The Oracle.[3]
She went on to attendYale University, where she was a two-timeNCAAAll-Americanand three-timeAll-Ivyinfencing.[4]As a world-classfoilist, she was a member of the Junior World Team and the United States national team at the World Championships andWorld University Games.[citation needed]Yu graduated from Yale University in 1987[5]summa cum laude,Phi Beta Kappa,[6]with a bachelor's degree in English.[7]
After graduation, Yu thought of pursuing law school like her peers. However, her father discouraged her from doing so.[8]She discovered film production while searching for a job that allowed flexible hours to allow her to compete in fencing. She started as aproduction assistantin 1989[4]on a few commercials, where she got to arrange frozen noodles on forks and re-park cars. When she started working in documentary, she became further intrigued by the process.[9]Yu refused to attend film school and gained her film education on the job. She focuses on making documentaries but says that one day she'd love to make a fully animated comedy feature.[9]The opportunity to make film is a random occurrence for Yu.[10]Her documentary films present worldwide issues that people face every day and allow the subjects to speak for themselves as much as possible. She is adamant that story should come before politics.[1]Her films intend to inform the general public to incite people to become active in everyday issues such aswater conservationand regulation.[11]When not making documentaries and feature films, Yu spends time directing television shows.
Yu began her career in 1993 with her shortSour Death Balls, a silent black-and-white montage of assorted subjects' reactions to blindingly bitter candy, which was shot on an old schoolBell & Howellwind-up camera.[1]She got her inspirations from daily interactions in her life, i.e. when a child offered local people sour candy. Yu sent the short film to film festivals, and it became her first feature at theTelluride Film Festivalin 1993.[12]Yu made her first documentary,Men of Reenaction(1994), which explores the extremes of people searching for authenticity through Civil War reenacting.[13]
Her most famous work was her Academy Award-winningBreathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O’Brien. Thedocumentary shortfeatures Berkeley writerMark O'Brien, a disabled poet with aniron lung. His editor at thePacific News Service,Sandy Close, introduced the pair and suggested that a film be made.[8][14]It debuted at the1996 Sundance Film Festivaland won several honors, including the International Documentary Association Achievement Award for Best Documentary, before the Academy Awards.[4]
Yu's 1998HBOdocumentaryThe Living Museum, which followsCreedmoor Psychiatric CenterpatientIssa Ibrahim, was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 1999Sundance Film Festival.[15]
In the 2000s, Yu's chance to work in episodic TV came when she received an invitation to apprentice atJohn Wells Productionsas the first participant of their director diversity program. Shadowing directors, Yu sensed she was a guinea pig. “If you screw this up,” she told herself, “they’ll never let another woman of color from documentaries do this again.”[1]While working for Wells' production company, she began directing in television for shows likeGrey's AnatomyandThe West Wing.[4]On her first directorial assignment, an episode ofThe West Wing, Yu was heartened that Wells encouraged her stylistic input. “He made a point of saying, ‘You should bring your own ideas to the table,’ rather than just follow prescribed formula.” So she decided to open with a series of mood-establishing low, wide-angle shots to signal the calm before the gathering storm.[1]
She directed a sport comedy film,Ping Pong Playa(2007), that explored Asian family culture through a Chineseping pongplaying son that is trying to prove himself to his family. Her producer friends Joan Huang and Jeff Guo approached her with the idea of working on a comedy together. They felt the time was right to have an obnoxious Asian American character on the screen. Yu and her comrades felt that Asian American cinema had plenty of good dramas and wanted to fill the void of superficial comedy.[9]She tried to bring the same loose hand and adaptability she used for documentaries to scripted material. Her approach toPing Pong Playawas to “have a lighter touch, especially with actors” to give them a sense of freedom.[1]
In her later documentaries such asLast Call at The Oasis(2011) andMisconception(2014), Yu focused on capturing the big picture and understanding how these issues intertwined with other aspects of life such as climate, population, and the environment.[16]Last Call at The Oasisaddresses the water crisis in the United States, and working on the film made her consider the impact of the crisis on her children and their children. This project became more personal to Yu and compelled her to complete it. It took six months of research prior to filming, as Yu wanted to create the big picture of the facts and threats of the water crisis in the domestic United States.
Last Call at the Oasisinspired Yu to direct her 2014 documentaryMisconception, which paints the population issues from a person-to-person point of view. While filmingLast Call at the Oasispeople questioned the purpose of acting on water conservation because they cannot control the population growth affecting it. Her main goal is to take this topic and tie with emotionally, entertaining, and interesting stories.[17]
The majority of her work after 2015 has been focused on television production and directing. ForNetflix, she directed episodes of the dramas13 Reasons WhyandHollywoodand didMaria Bamford's comedy specialOld Baby.
Jessica's work in the 2020s includes directing a number of television drama series.This Is Us(Don't Let Me Keep You, 2021),The Morning Show(Kill the Fatted Calf, 2021),In Treatment(Brooke,Laila,Colins,Eladio, 2021).

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
