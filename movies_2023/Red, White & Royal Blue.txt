Alex Claremont-Diaz, thefirst son of the United States, attends the wedding of Prince Phillip,Duke of Cambridge. Alex has a long-standing feud with Prince Henry, Prince Phillip's younger brother. During the reception, Alex and Henry get into an argument that results in the £75,000 wedding cake falling on top of them.
To mitigate the fallout and help his mother's re-election campaign, Alex and Henry are forced into a series of interviews and appearances, where they pose as friends. Alex later admits to Henry that he began to resent him after Henry rebuffed him at Alex's first appearance as a public figure. Henry apologizes, explaining he had just lost his father and was forced to go to events, and the two make amends, later beginning to text and become friends.
Invited to Alex's annual New Year's party, Henry leaves abruptly after seeing Alex kiss several girls at midnight. Alex follows him outdoors to theWhite Housegrounds. Henry kisses Alex, but fails to respond to Alex's attempts to contact him over the following weeks. After confiding in Nora, his best friend and theVice President's granddaughter, Alex realizes that he is attracted to Henry.
Weeks later, Alex reunites with Henry and the pair become lovers, although they keep their involvement secret from everyone except close family and friends, and theirSecret ServiceandMI5bodyguards. Alex and Henry use private jets to traipse back and forth across the Atlantic throughout the film.
When Alex comes up with a plan for his mother to win Texas in the upcoming election, he travels there to lead the campaign. When he goes to Brooklyn to speak at theDemocratic National Convention, Henry unexpectedly visits him. Alex later comes out to his mother, who is supportive, but advises him to think about his relationship carefully.
Alex invites Henry to his family's vacation home nearAustin, Texas, and Alex begins to tell Henry that he is in love with him, but Henry, fearing that he cannot sustain a love-relationship – since theBritish royal familywill not accept it – preemptively leaves the conversation and flees to England. He refuses to respond to Alex's attempts to contact him. Alex visits Henry in London unexpectedly and demands an explanation for his behavior. Henry admits that he loves Alex too, but explains that his royal position makes it impossible. Alex convinces Henry that their relationship is worth fighting for, and the two reconcile.
Shortly after Alex returns to the U.S., Alex and Henry's personal e‑mails to each other are hacked and posted online by a political journalist who used to be in a relationship with Alex, and are being widely reported in the press. Alex makes a touching speech.  Both the White House and the Palace cut off all Alex's and Henry's means of contact. Zahra Bankston, theWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff, gets in touch with Shaan, Henry'sequerry, and Alex and Henry are finally able to talk. Alex immediately flies to London to reunite with Henry. King James III summons them to a meeting and tells them that they cannot be together since their relationship is incompatible with royal tradition and the expectations of the public. However, Henry's supportive sister Beatrice notices a crowd gathered in front ofBuckingham Palacein support of them, and news reports of similar crowds all over the U.K. Alex and Henry kiss in front of the window, then step outside together onto the balcony and openly greet the cheering public as a couple.
On election night, Henry returns to the United States to be with Alex, whose plan to win Texas for his mother ultimately results in her re-election. Later that evening, Alex and Henry are seen biking down the street toward Alex's "working class" childhood home in Austin, where they leave the bikes on the lawn and go inside to personally celebrate.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 76% of 116 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "Amusing and endearing,Red, White & Royal Blueis a cheerfully formulaic rom-com that embraces inclusion without falling back on stereotypes."[31]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 62 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[32]
CNN Entertainment's Brian Lowry stated that the film "is at its core a fairy-tale romance – only where the challenge isn't the customary wicked stepmother or malevolent witch, but rather what happens when true love finds two princes, not one."[33]Amy Nicholson ofThe New York Timeswrote: "It sounds like fan fiction and looks like it, too, particularly when Galitzine dips his chin bashfully – a tic thatPrincess Dianapassed on to her boys. Yet, as in any screwball romance worth its trans-Atlanticsea-salt, the first-time director Matthew López gets us rooting for the cheeky couple's transition from rivals to romantic bedfellows, boosted by the cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt, who photographs the leads so adoringly that you half-expect them to turn to the camera and hawk a bottle of cologne. Thanks to their playful chemistry, we're sold." She, however, criticized several "over-florid theatrical flourishes".[34]The Observer's Wendy Ide awarded the film three out of five stars, dubbing it "so slick and polished, it feels obsessively micro-managed rather than directed." However, she praised the charisma of Zakhar Perez and Galitzine and credited it for the film's appeal: "It turns out that watching two impossibly beautiful boys making cow eyes at each other might be just the escapist pulp we need right now."[35]
New York Post's Lauren Sarner thought that the film "has some big flaws, but it's fun and cute rom-com with heart". She criticized Thurman's performance (dubbing it "career-worst"), herTexan accentand the writing of her character, but praised Zakhar Perez's and Galitzine's performances. Sarner also took note of resemblance between Prince Henry andPrince Harry; both princes aresparesand their romances with their American lovers lead to strained relationships with their older brothers.[36]Jessie Thompson ofThe Independentawarded it three out of five stars, summarizing it as "wry and witty at first, but then becomes unstuck as it enters into soap opera mode", additionally drawing comparisons withThe Crownand Prince Harry's media tour, and taking note of an "air ofliberalfantasy to it all". She characterized the casting of Zakhar Perez and Galitzine as "absurdly [good] ... like cartoonDisneyprinces made into humans", and Thurman's performance as "delightfullycamp".[37]
The Guardian's Benjamin Lee awarded it two out of five stars and dubbed it "well-intentioned yet listless", writing: "Red, White and Royal Bluejust isn't the fun, brain-disengaged romp it could have been, any praise going toward intention rather than execution."[38]BBC's Louis Staples thought that the "creaky" formulaic script "often sounds like it was written byChatGPT", criticized the film's overt leaning into "fictionalised specifics ofAnglo-American relations" and intostereotypes of the BritishandAmericans. He negatively compared it toThe Princess Diaries(2001),Single All the Way(2021),The Knight Before Christmas(2019),Fire Island(2022) andBros(2022), before concluding, "If you're looking for a film about beautiful men with perfect hair and sculpted abs, which doesn't demand too much from you, then it might be for you. But if you're expecting it to be in the grade of romcoms that are laugh-out-loud hilarious and actually say something interesting about relationships – or anything beyond lazy clichés – then you'll be royally disappointed."[39]
The cast and filmmakers announced a sequel for the film on May 9, 2024, at a Q&A session after a screening.[48]

In 2023, Lopez made hisfeature directing debutwithRed, Whiteand Royal Blue, which he also adapted from the novel byCasey McQuiston. The film was both a critical and commercial success, debuting at #1 for several weeks on Amazon Prime.[12]In New York, López's work has been seenoff-BroadwaywithThe Whipping ManandThe Legend of Georgia McBride.Other works includeSomewhere,Reverberation,The SentinelsandZoey's Perfect Wedding.[13][14][15][16]
López was born inPanama City, Florida[17]to two public school teachers. His father, born inSan Juan, Puerto Rico, is the older brother of actorPriscilla López.[18]
López's breakout playThe Whipping Mandebuted at Luna Stage[19]in Montclair, New Jersey in 2006 and premieredOff-Broadwayat theManhattan Theatre Club[20]on February 1, 2011, directed byDoug Hughesand starringAndre BraugherandAndre Holland. The Off-Broadway production ofThe Whipping Manwas extended four times, and won the 2011Obie Awardfor Performance (Braugher) and the 2011Lucille Lortel Awardfor Outstanding Lighting Design. López won the John Gassner New Play Award.[21]
The Whipping Manis set in Richmond, Virginia in the immediate aftermath of theAmerican Civil Warand concerns two recently freed slaves encountering their former master. The former slaves, like their former master, identify as Jewish. The play examines the unique occurrence ofPassoverin 1865 beginning the day after Robert E. Lee's surrender atAppomattox.  It explores the meaning of freedom, and the various ways people are enslaved — to addictions, to prejudices. In hisThe New York TimesreviewCharles Isherwoodcalled the play "emotionally potent, almost surreal in the layers of meaning it conjures."[22]Braugher and Holland both earned critical acclaim for their performances. Between 2012 and 2016,The Whipping Manwas one of the most widely produced plays in America.[23]
Somewherepremiered at theOld Globe Theatre[24]in San Diego in September 2011,[25]before moving to Hartford Stage, Hartford, Connecticut.[26]Matthew López was the Playwright-in-Residence at the Old Globe Theatre. The play, featuring a majority Latin cast, concerns a theatrical family living in Manhattan in 1959, asWest Side Storycaptured the zeitgeist.  The proposed construction ofLincoln Centerand the ensuing demolition of their neighborhood leaves the family to fight for their home and their dreams.Somewherewas directed by Giovanna Sardelli, and featured Matthew López's aunt Priscilla López. Critics lauded the production, comparing López's writing to Tennessee Williams'The Glass Menagerie.[27]The story ofSomewherehas roots in López's family history. His father was an extra in the 1961 film adaptation ofWest Side Story, and appears on screen in the playground, just after the prologue[28]
López's next playReverberationpremiered at Hartford Stage,Hartford, Connecticut[29]running from February 19, 2015, to March 15, directed by Maxwell Williams and starringLuke Macfarlane. The story follows Jonathan, a young gay New Yorker, who spends increasingly more time holed up in his Astoria apartment following a violent attack that has left him afraid to go out into the world. He is befriended by his new upstairs neighbor, Claire, aHolly Golightly-like character who, despite her active social life, is just as afraid and lonely as Jonathan. The play examines how violence – against women, against the LGBTQ community – impacts the lives of those both directly and indirectly affected by it.Charles IsherwoodofThe New York Timeswrites that "the play is marked by a perceptiveness about the echoing loneliness that many urban dwellers live with."[30]
The Legend of Georgia McBridedebuted atDenver Center for the Performing Arts[31]in 2014,[32]and premiered Off-Broadway at the Lucille Lortel Theatre[33]in 2015. The play tells the story of Casey, a down-on-his-luck Elvis impersonator who is induced to turn his jumpsuits into dresses and become a drag queen. The play toggles between quippy comedy and show-stopping dance numbers, withCharles IsherwoodofThe New York Timescommenting that the play was "full of sass and good spirits – along with a spritz or two of sentimentality."[34]In February 2018, New Regency announced it was developing the film adaptation of the play in association withJim Parsons' production company.[35]
López's playThe Inheritance,directed byStephen Daldry,[36]premiered London's Young Vic Theatre in 2018, where it was hailed by TheDaily Telegraph[37]as "the most important American play of the century."  It transferred to theNoël Coward Theatrein the West End later that year, and opened on Broadway last autumn.The Inheritanceearned eleven nominations for the74th Tony Awards, including Best Play, as well as eight nominations at the2019 Laurence Olivier Awards, winning for Best New Play, Best Director (Stephen Daldry), Best Actor (Kyle Soller), and Best Lighting Design (Jon Clark).

López is the first Latino writer to win any of these awards for Best Play.The Inheritancewas also selected as the recipient of theGLAAD Media AwardforOutstanding Broadway Production.[40]
Set in New York three decades after the height of theAIDS epidemic,The Inheritancewrestles with what it means to be a gay man today, exploring relationships and connections across age and social class and asking what one generation's responsibilities may be to the next. The play is a loose adaptation ofE.M. Forster's novelHowards End.  The premiere featured a cast that includedVanessa Redgrave,John Benjamin Hickey, andPaul Hiltonas Forster himself.TheEvening Standarddeclared[41]the play "a work of rare grace, truth, and beauty."

How dare you? How dare you create a world where there is such misery that's not our fault? It's utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?"[262]Within days, the video was viewed over five million times.[263]Fry later stated he did not refer to any specific religion: "I said quite a few things that were angry at this supposed God. I was merely saying things thatBertrand Russelland many finer heads of the mind have said for many thousands of years, going all the way back to the Greeks."[264]"Because the God who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, utter maniac."[265]In May 2017, it was announced that Fry, along with broadcasterRTÉ, were under criminal investigation for blasphemy under theDefamation Act 2009, following a complaint from a member of the public about the broadcast: the case was dropped afterGardaíconfirmed that they had not been able to locate a sufficient number of offended people.[266]The following year, in 2018, the article on blasphemy was removed from the Irish Constitution following a referendum.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
