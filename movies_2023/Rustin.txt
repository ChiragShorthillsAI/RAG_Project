Rustinis a 2023 Americanbiographicaldrama filmdirected byGeorge C. Wolfe, from a screenplay by Julian Breece andDustin Lance Black, and a story by Breece about the life ofcivil rights activistBayard Rustin.[2]Produced byBarackandMichelle Obama's production companyHigher Ground, the film starsColman Domingoin the title role, alongsideChris Rock,Glynn Turman,Aml Ameen, Gus Halper,CCH Pounder,Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Johnny Ramey,Michael Potts,Jeffrey Wright, andAudra McDonald. It is based on the true story of Rustin, who helpedMartin Luther King Jr.and others organize the1963 March on Washington.
Rustinpremiered at theTelluride Film Festivalon August 31, 2023, and was screened at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 13, 2023. The film received alimited theatrical releaseon November 3, 2023, before being released onNetflixon November 17. The film received generally positive reviews, with Domingo's performance garnering numerous accolades including nominations for theAcademy Award,BAFTA Award,Golden Globe Award, andSAG Awardfor Best Actor.
In 1960, as thecivil rights movementfights for racial equality across the United States, activistBayard RustinurgesMartin Luther King Jr.to lead a protest ahead of theDemocratic National Convention. New York CongressmanAdam Clayton Powell Jr.andNAACPleaderRoy Wilkins, critical of King's rising popularity and Rustin's influence, threaten to accuse King of a homosexual relationship with the openly gay Rustin, leading to Rustin's resignation from theSouthern Christian Leadership Conference.
Three years later, Rustin remains alienated from King and much of the movement, but his commitment tononviolent actionis embraced by many younger activists, includingTom Kahn, his assistant and lover. Planning a large-scale march on Washington, D.C., Rustin enlists the help ofA. Philip Randolph, the respected architect of demonstrations that led to such victories asending racial segregation in the armed forces. Despite support from NAACP organizerMedgar Evers, Wilkins rejects Randolph and Rustin's plan, and Rustin begins an affair with Elias Taylor, a married organizer and pastor.
Violence againstdemonstrators in Birminghamreceives national attention and spurs Rustin to leave his work at theWar Resisters League, while Evers is assassinated hours after PresidentJohn F. Kennedycalls for civil rights legislation. Rustin visits King — remembering being assaulted by police himself in 1942 for refusing to move to the back of a bus — and convinces him to lend his support to the march. Wilkins continues to object to Rustin's participation due to hisreputation, but Randolph appoints Rustin as his deputy director, fully in charge of organizing theMarch on Washington.
Gathering a team of volunteers and dedicated activists, includingCleve RobinsonandDr. Anna Hedgeman, at a makeshift office in Harlem, Rustin visits theNational Mallbut is prevented from meeting with D.C. officials. He warns King that they have made powerful political enemies, and is forced to accept Wilkins' and others' demands that reduce the march to a single day. Rustin and his organizers continue to raise funds and public support, but his affair with Taylor strains his relationship with Kahn.
SenatorStrom Thurmondpublicly denounces Rustin as a communist, and Powell attempts to embarrass him into stepping down, but Rustin's remarkable efforts to organize a 100,000-person march in seven weeks speak for themselves. After Rustin receives a strongly-worded call from Taylor's pregnant wife, Taylor ends their affair. Thurmond publicizes Rustin's arrest for homosexual activity in Pasadena ten years earlier, but Randolph and King come to his defense.
On August 28, 1963, the March on Washington draws over 200,000 people, gathering in front of theLincoln Memorial. The massive demonstration culminates in King's "I Have a Dream" speech, and though Wilkins invites Rustin to join themarch's leadersat the White House, he remains behind with his volunteers. An epilogue explains that the march was the nation's largest peaceful protest at that time; theCivil Rights Actwas enacted nine months later; and Rustin would later meet his lifelong partner, and receive thePresidential Medal of Freedom.
In February 2021, it was reported thatGeorge C.

Lenny Kravitzwrote and performed an original song, "Road to Freedom," for the film. On approaching Kravitz for writing a song for the film, Wolfe said, "The one note I gave him was the song needed to help deliver us as an audience, from feeling to action. And trombones. I begged for trombones." Wolfe became fascinated with trombones after filmingMa Rainey's Black Bottom(2020), andTrombone Shortywas brought on board to contribute to the song.[10]
Rustinpremiered at theTelluride Film Festivalon August 31, 2023.[11]It also screened at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 13, 2023.[12][13]MichelleandBarack Obamaintroduced the film at the opening night of the HBCU First Look Film Festival at theNational Museum of African American History and Culture.[14][15]The film was released in select theaters on November 3, 2023 and premiered worldwide onNetflixon November 17.[16][17]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 83% of 169 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7/10. The website's consensus reads: "Colman Domingo is sensational inRustin, a stirring biopic that shines an overdue light on a remarkable legacy of public service."[18]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[19]
Domingo garnered much critical acclaim for his performance in the title role.[20]John Anderson ofThe Wall Street Journalcommended Domingo as a "force of nature in this film, delivering a complex, highly sympathetic portrayal" that "determines what the movie actually is, while preventing it from going awry."[21]Maureen Lee Lenker elaborated, in her review forEntertainment Weekly, that "Domingo infuses Rustin with a warmth and vibrancy that creates a performance of immense empathy" and followed this by stating "his portrait of a man fighting for both his race and his sexuality feels incredibly personal and helps hammer home Rustin's commitment to true 'justice for all.'"[22]The Guardian's Benjamin Lee appreciated the film'sintersectionalcoverage of Rustin's struggles and concluded that Domingo "nails the charming persuasiveness that would explain how Rustin achieved so much in such a short amount of time and as he slowly starts to experience a level of acceptance for his whole self, rather than handpicked parts, there’s a genuine poignancy to watching him crumble in front of us, a weight we can feel being lifted away.[23]
Other critics were more lukewarm towards the film, in particular for its screenplay and direction.Bilge EbirifromVultureobserved that the script was laden with "ham-handed stage-setting with lines" that equated to "classroom-exercise level writing", leading to a film that was "filled with all the clichés of the genre." He also elaborates that the film's "predictable plot points" and the "pro forma" nature of Rustin's "personal affairs" in conjunction with Wolfe's "methodical direction" led to "visual inertia".[24]RogerEbert.com's Robert Daniels similarly agreed that the film suffocated Domingo and suppressed his potential, noting that he "ultimately clings to these emotional crescendos, gripping for dear life to a film that rarely, if ever, rises to his level."[25]In his review, Michael O'Sullivan ofThe Washington Postfound the film's "perfunctory plot" to be "as montage-y and as superficial as the film’s opening reenactments" and criticized the lack of character development across the supporting cast, noting "none of them stands out as a three-dimensional character".[26]
Specific criticism was further directed towards the film's approach of Rustin's sexuality as a narrative. Dustin Guastela ofJacobincriticized the film for caricaturing Rustin's political views: "Rustinclaims the civil rights hero has been forgotten because of his sexuality. But it was his fiery and provocative class politics that makes him both controversial and prophetic today." He argues that the film's lack of development in the relationship between Rustin andTom Kahn"weaponized" Rustin's sexuality as a means to obscure that Rustin's "historical neglect" was also due, in part, to his political views, which were "no less a reason for his official erasure from canonical civil rights history."[27]In his review forIndieWire, David Ehrlich also lamented the film's handling of Rustin's sexuality and stated that "Rustinis diminished by the forced momentum of its plotting, by how inelegantly the script incorporates the social dynamics of Rustin’s homosexuality (the love triangle that develops between Rustin, fellow activist Tom Kahn, and a composite character played by Johnny Ramey stops the movie dead in its tracks every time it comes up)."[28]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
