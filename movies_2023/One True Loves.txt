Jesse is suddenly found alive so, completely torn, she must now choose between a husband and a fiancé.
One True Loveswas released in the United States on April 7, 2023.
Emma recalls meeting her eventual husband Jesse 15 years previously at a high school keg party with her best friend Sam. Now, at her parents,' celebrating her recent engagement to Sam, she gets a shocking call from Jesse, saying he's still alive, four years after he was declared dead.
Emma remembers her first kiss with Jesse in the police station, taken in for attending the underage party. Both, anxious to leave their small life and experience the world, head out to do it, Jesse as a photographer and Emma as a writer. Exploring the world, he proposes after six years. They marry in Maine by a lighthouse near his cabin.
After Jesse disappears in a helicopter crash a year after the wedding, on his way to an Alaska assignment, Emma moves back to Acton Massachusetts in an effort to mend her life back together. Working at her family bookstore in town, her older sister Marie constantly tries to guide her.
Four years later, Emma runs into her old best friend, Sam, and they become inseparable. Newly engaged, she receives an unexpected phone call revealing Jesse is alive. Completely torn, Emma must now choose between a husband and a fiancé.
Jesse's return is heavily televised. Just before he arrives to his parents', they warn Emma that Jesse knows nothing about her new engagement. They have an empassioned kiss on camera, but in the house she tells him about being engaged.
Later, at home with Sam, after he expresses insecurity after seeing Emma kissing Jesse on TV, Emma and Sam make love. Waking, as he sees she's not wearing his engagement ring and has mixed feelings about who she loves, she temporarily moves out until she can figure out her feelings.
Marie, her older sister who's been pushing Emma for years to move on from Jesse, takes her in. She picks him up by car and sees her family briefly, as they're driving to the Maine cabin for the weekend. When Emma doesn't respond to text messages Sam sends her, he has a meltdown in his high school band class, eventually keeping them and much of the school listening until the end of the day talking about Emma.
At the cabin, Jesse and Emma discover new things about each other. She has tattoos and, since moving back east her life focus is different. Emma is more sedentary and is content to run the family bookstore, no longer interested in their nomadic lifestyle. Moving back to New England, she eventually was able to heal from the pain of Jesse's believed death. Emma now wants kids, which they'd never discussed.
Although his license was revoked upon his declared death, Jesse and Emma get pulled over for speeding. Showing the officer the articles about his disappearance-reappearance he gets let off the hook, but in the process not only sees that Emma reverted to her maiden name, but he also finds a letter addressed to him.
Climbing the nearby lighthouse, Jesse reads the letter. In it, Emma explains how her grieving process over him evolved. The first three years, her feelings evolved. First in denial, then Emma submerged herself in books not about death or love. Then she crossed paths again with Sam, and the former best friends eventually begin a relationship. By the time Jesse finishes the both he and Emma realise they no longer work.
Back in Acton, Emma seeks out Sam. Accidentally rear-ending him at a stop light, they both get out of their   cars and profess their love for each other.
Two years later, a pregnant Emma gets a letter from Jesse. He's moved on, in California and in a new relationship.

It's always been important to me to constantly challenge people's perceptions of myself, as well as of Asian people as a whole. While I celebrate legendary actors such asJackie Chan,Jet Li, andBruce Lee, I know that my path is very different. I am not a master of kung-fu, after all; I am an actor who trained very hard to embody the character that I was hired to play. As such, I'm beyond excited to step into Sam's shoes for this movie that I am deeply in love with.[4]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
