AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.(doing business asAMC Theatres, originally an abbreviation forAmerican Multi-Cinema; often referred to simply asAMC) is an Americanmovie theaterchain founded inKansas City, Missouri, and now headquartered inLeawood, Kansas. It is the largest movie theater chain in the world. Founded in 1920, AMC has the largest share of the U.S. theater market, ahead ofRegal CinemasandCinemark Theatres. After acquiringOdeon Cinemas,UCI Cinemas, andCarmike Cinemasin 2016, it became the largest movie theater chain in the world.[3]It has 2,807 screens in 353 European theaters and 7,755 screens in 593 American theaters.[2][4]
The company is listed on theNew York Stock Exchange; from 2012 to 2018, the Chinese conglomerateWanda Groupowned a majority stake in the company. Private equity firmSilver Lake Partnersmade a $600 million investment in AMC in September 2018, but the voting power of AMC shares was structured so that Wanda Group still controlled the majority of AMC's board of directors. Amid financial downturns caused by theCOVID-19 lockdowns, in January 2021, Wanda's ownership was increasingly diluted due to new financing by AMC, as well asshort squeezesthat resulted in Silver Lake converting its $600 million debt holding to equity. In early-February 2021, Wanda converted itsClass B sharestoClass A shares, thus reducing its voting power to less than 50%.
AMC Theatres was founded in 1920 by Maurice, William, Irvin, Edward, and Barney Dubinsky, sons of Russian Jewish immigrants Simon and Sarah Dubinsky. The Dubinsky brothers had been traveling the Midwest performing melodramas and tent shows with actressJeanne Eagels. They purchased the Regent Theatre on 12th Street between Walnut and Grand in downtownKansas City, Missouri.[5]Maurice, the oldest brother, died in 1929, and Barney left the company in 1936 after being injured in an auto accident.[6]Edward, the youngest brother, eventually changed his last name to Durwood, and the company they formed eventually became known as Durwood Theatres, after a legal fight with his brothers.[6]The chain also had theaters inSt. JosephandJefferson City, MissouriandLeavenworthandTopeka, Kansas.[7]
When Edward's sonStanleyleft theU.S. Air ForceafterWorld War II, he joined the company in 1945. He persuaded his father to builddrive-in theatersin St. Joseph, Jefferson City, and Leavenworth. In 1947 they expanded further with the acquisition of the Liberty Theater in downtown Kansas City which they remodeled and renamed the Roxy.[8]They won anantitrustsuit to enable them to show first-run product at the Roxy and went on to acquire all of the downtown cinemas in Kansas City includingThe Empire Theater, theCapri Theatre, theMidland Theatreand the Paramount Theatre.[7]
In 1961, after Ed died, Stanley took control of Durwood Theatres, a small ten-theatre chain. With aninterstateplanned around Kansas City, Durwood looked to sites outside downtown and acquired two sites at a shopping center on Kansas City'sWard Parkwayto build a 700-seat theater. As the sites could not be combined, they opened two theaters side-by-side as the Parkway Twin Theatre in 1963.[7]This was the company's first foray into using themultiplexmodel.  According toVariety, Stanley Durwood later claimed in 1962 that he "was standing in the lobby of his 600-seat Roxy in Kansas City mulling over its poor grosses, when he realized he could double his box office by adding a second screen and still operate with the same size staff."[9]
Following the success of the Parkway Twin, AMC followed up with the Embassy 3 triplex at theCountry Club Plaza; the Metro Plaza, a four-screen theater in Kansas City in 1966; and a six-screen theater inOmahain 1969.[10][11][7]
The industry quickly embraced the multiplex concept, where additional screens meant very little difference in staff and operating costs but resulted in a significant profit increase. The concept also provided more film choices at one location, drawing bigger crowds. It also gave owners the flexibility to show big hits on more screens and less reliance on any individual film that could turn out to be a bust.[12]
Stanley renamed Durwood Theatres as American Royal Cinema on October 1, 1968, after theAmerican Royallivestock and horse show, but the latter's producers sought an injunction, and the name was changed to American Multi-Cinema, Inc.[13][7]
Stanley began to apply military management and the insights ofmanagement scienceto revolutionize the movie theatre industry.[14]As he later explained toVarietymagazine, "We needed to define what our company was doing in the (exhibition) business. My dad wasn't that organized."[15]It was structured under the belief that every customer was a "guest".
By the 1980s, the company was experiencing strong growth; in 1983, it had itsinitial public offering.[16]AMC Theatres built its first multiplex overseas in 1985, the 10-screen multiplex atThe Point, Milton Keynesin theUnited Kingdom,[16]and later opened additional sites in the UK such as inDudleyandTamworth, Staffordshire. In October 1988, they announced a joint venture withUnited Artists TheatersandCinema International Corporation(a partnership ofParamount PicturesandUniversal Studios) to run their combined cinemas in the UK, Ireland under the AMC name, however, AMC pulled out of the joint venture in December 1988, and sold their U.K. assets, including their 12 cinemas, to the new entity (later calledUnited Cinemas International) for $98 million and withdrew from the UK market.[17][18][19]
In 1988,Kinepolis Brussels, the firstmegaplexin the world,  with 25 screens and 7,600 seats, was opened byKinepolis, the European chain.[20][21][22][23]
In 1995, AMC Theatres opened the first North American megaplex, the AMC Grand 24 inDallas, Texas, a theater complex that could accommodate thousands.[24]AMC continued to open other megaplex theaters, such as the AMC Hampton Towne Center 24 in Hampton, Virginia, and the chain's busiest theater in the US, theAMC Empire 25inNew York CitynearTimes Square.
On December 13, 1996, AMC opened theOntario Mills30, a 30-screen theater inOntario, California, which at the time was the largest multiplex in the world.[25][16]AMC Theatres' megaplex theatres were a success overseas as well. In April 1996, they opened Canal City 13 inFukuoka, Japan, which was followed on December 20, 1996, by the AMC Arrábida 20 inPorto, Portugal.[19]In January 2002, the 16-screen Great Northern theatre was opened inManchesterin the U.K., marking the chain's return to the UK market after 14 years. This was later supplemented by the opening of a 12-screen cinema on the Broadway Plaza site inBirminghamin October 2003. AMC Theatres sometimes serve a dual function; in addition to the regular cinema functions, they also cater to companies' business conferences that can make use of their projectors for displaying presentations.[26]
In 2004, AMC Theatres was acquired by Marquee Holdings Inc., an investment vehicle controlled by affiliates ofJ.P. Morgan Partners, LLC, the private equity arm ofJPMorgan Chase, andApollo Global Management, a private investment firm.[27]At the time, AMC was publicly traded onAMEXunder the code AEN.[28]
In 2006, the company announced a newinitial public offering(IPO) expected to be worth approximately $789 million;[29]however, adverse market conditions convinced the company's management to withdraw from such an offering on May 3, 2007.[30]The company filed for a $450 million IPO in its third such filing since 2006 on July 14, 2010.[31][32]
Stanley Durwood died in 1999, and his successor was Peter Brown, the first non-Dubinsky/Durwood family member to head the company.[9]Gerardo I. Lopezsucceeded Brown as president and CEO of AMC Theatres on March 2, 2009.[33]Previously, Lopez was the Executive Vice President of President Consumer Products Group,Seattle's Best Coffee, and Foodservice atStarbucks.[34]Under new leadership, one of the first major announcements came in March of the same year; the company announced that it would equip 1,500 of its screens withReal Dprojectors.[35]In the same month, AMC Theatres announced it had closed on a $315 million deal withSonyto replace all of itsreel projectorswithdigital cinemaprojectors, starting in the second quarter of 2009 and completing in 2012.[36]
The company was formerly headquartered in downtown Kansas City. In September 2011, AMC Theatres announced plans to move its headquarters to a new $30 million four-story building designed by360 Architecturein the Park Place development at 117th Street and Nall Avenue inLeawood, Kansasin suburbanKansas City. Kansas had offered $47 million in incentives to get the 400 jobs to move across the Kansas/Missouri border.[37]
After reaching a settlement with the state of Illinois regarding complaints from adisability rightsorganization in April 2012, AMC pledged to equip all of its theaters in the state with captioning and description services by 2014. The disability rights group had accused the company of only providing closed captioning or audio description systems at some of its locations in the state.[38]
In May 2012, AMC Theatres was acquired by Chinese conglomerateWanda Group, headquartered inDalian, who paid $2.6 billion to acquire AMC's 5,048 screens in 347 theaters in the U.S. and Canada.[39]The deal was finalized on September 4, 2012.[40]The acquisition made Wanda the world's largest cinema chain.[41]Wang Jianlin, CEO of Dalian Wanda Group, announced that the company would plan to spend $500 million renovating AMC locations.[40]
AMC Theatres had eight movie theatres in Canada. In July 2012, four locations were sold toCineplex Entertainment, and two more locations were sold toEmpire Theatresand later acquired byLandmark Cinemas. The two remaining locations have since closed.[42]
Gerardo I. Lopezannounced his resignation as CEO of AMC in August 2015. Craig Ramsey was appointed as the interim CEO by the company board.[43]In December 2015, AMC announced thatAdam Aronwould be the company's president and chief executive officer, as well as a member of the company's board of directors, beginning on January 4, 2016.[44]
In March 2016, AMC Theatres announced it would acquire competitorCarmike Cinemas.[45]In July 2016, Carmike's management accepted a revised offer, pending regulatory and shareholder approval.[46]The deal was closed on December 25, 2016, making AMC the largest cinema chain in the United States.[47]
On March 1, 2017, AMC Theatres CEO Adam Aron stated that the company would rebrand Carmike Cinemas locations under the AMC name; smaller locations were rebranded under the new banner AMC Classic (which repurposes trademarks associated with Carmike). Aron also announced a plan to rebrand its kitchen-equipped theaters as AMC Dine-In.[48][49]
In July 2017, AMC Theatres announced they would cut $30 million in expenses by the end of the year. This cost reduction would be accomplished by reducing operating hours, cutting staffing levels, and other measures.[50]
In September 2018,Silver Lake Partnersmade a $600 million investment in AMC Theatres, whose proceeds were used to repurchase approximately 32% of Wanda Group's class Bcommon stock.[51]However, the voting power of AMC's shares is structured in such a way (granting three votes per-share for each Class B share if its stake in the company is above 30%)[52]that, even after reducing its ownership of AMC common stock to just under 50% by the end of 2019, Wanda Group continued to retain majority control over AMC's board of directors.[53]
In October 2019, AMC began to offer on-demand rentals and purchases of digital film releases under the banner AMC Theatres On Demand. The service is tied to the company's Stubs loyalty program.[54][55][56]
On March 18, 2020, AMC announced the closure of all of its theaters due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, in compliance withCDCguidance against any gathering of over ten people. AMC said this shutdown would last for at least six to twelve weeks.[57]On March 25, 2020, AMC furloughed all of its 600 corporate employees, including CEO Adam Aron. All furloughed corporate AMC employees and associates retained active employment status, including all health benefits.[58]
On April 28, 2020, AMC announced they would no longer carry films fromUniversal PicturesafterNBCUniversalCEOJeff Shellcommented inThe Wall Street Journalthat the studio wanted to release films via premium video-on-demand simultaneously with theatrical releases. The company threatened that this will also be done with any other studio "who unilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us, so that they as distributor and we as exhibitor both benefit and neither are hurt from such changes."[59]
On June 3, 2020, AMC stated that it had "substantial doubt" that it would remain in business.[60]On July 28, 2020, AMC and Universal were able to resolve their dispute, with AMC agreeing to a shorter theatrical window of 17 days before Universal could release their films via premium VOD, as well as revenue sharing on the premium VOD window.[61]
On August 20, 2020, AMC began the process of reopening selected locations in the United States where allowed under local health orders. In honor of the company's centennial year, AMC also offered a special 15-cent ticket promotion that day, promoted as "Movies in 2020 at 1920 Prices." The company aimed for at least two thirds of its locations to be open in time for the September 3 release ofTenet.[62]The company upgraded itsair filtrationsystems to four times the rates before the pandemic and installed electrostatic sprayers in the auditoriums.[63][64]In October 2020, the company reported that its existing cash resources "would be largely depleted by the end of 2020 or early 2021."[65]
On January 26, 2021, AMC stated that it had raised $917 million in new funding, including $506 million in equity and new common shares, and commitments for $411 million in debt financing. The company stated that this new funding "should allow the company to make it through this dark coronavirus-impacted winter".[66][67]The next day, as part of a wider series ofshort squeezescoordinated by theRedditcommunityr/wallstreetbets(whichprimarily targetedvideo game retailerGameStop), AMC experienced a major, 300% surge in its share price to a peak of $20.36.[68][69]The surge triggered Silver Lake Partners'convertible bonds; on January 28, it reached an agreement to convert $600 million of its debt holdings in AMC to equity at $13.51 per-share.[70]Mudrick Capital Managementmade nearly $200 million in profit off its holdings of AMC debt.[71]
On February 5, 2021, a U.S.-based subsidiary of Wanda Group issued a filing with the SEC, stating that it had converted its Class B common stock toClass A sharesto permit their sale. While Wanda remained AMC's largest single shareholder, the conversion, as well as AMC's financing efforts taking its stake below 37%, effectively surrendered its majority control since Class A stock only provides one vote per-share.[52][72]On May 21, 2021, Wanda filed a 0.002% stake with the SEC, largely confirming the end of their involvement in AMC.[73]
During its fourth-quarter earnings call in March 2021, the company reported that its revenue had fallen by 88% year-over-year. CEOAdam Aronstated that AMC was facing the "most challenging market conditions in the 100-year history of the company", but cited progress on COVID-19 vaccinations, decisions to allow cinemas in New York City and Los Angeles to re-open, and a "significant" number of upcoming blockbuster films as signs of optimism.[72]Aron also confirmed that Wanda no longer had majority control, and the company would now "be governed like most other publicly traded companies with a wide array of shareholders".[52][74]
In June 2021, retail investors once again poured into AMC stock, propelling shares to an all-time high of $77.26 in another alleged short squeeze.[75]Short sellers betting against AMC incurred losses of over $2.8B as a result.[76]AMC issued more shares during the surge, but warned potential investors against buying the shares "unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment". The cinema chain operator said it believed current prices reflected "market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business".
In the year to date, shares in AMC had soared 2,421% – despite its cinemas being largely shut during the pandemic.[77]
In August 2021, the company revealed plans to begin acceptingcryptocurrenciessuch asBitcoinfor purchases in the future,[78]which it did in November 2021 for online purchases viaPayPal.[79][80]In April 2022, AMC added integration withBitPayas a payment provider to its mobile app, allowing customers to use crypto payments such asDogecoinandShiba Inu.[81]
On August 4, 2022, AMC took Wall Street by surprise with the announcement of its "AMC Preferred Equity Units" after market close, a new preferred share class. The units were to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "APE," a nod to the individual investors who turned the company into ameme stock, who often refer to themselves as "apes". Over 516 million APE units were subsequently issued to AMC shareholders in a 1:1 special dividend, with the units wielding similar economic properties as common shares.[82]AMC stock gained 19% to $22.18 at the close on Friday after initially falling following the announcement of the new units on Thursday. The preferred shares started trading under the "APE" ticker on the New York Stock Exchange starting Aug. 22.[83]AMC CEO Adam Aron stated "We are making great strides on our path towards pandemic recovery".[citation needed]
In February 2023 AMC announced plans to test adynamic pricingmodel for tickets for showings that occur after 4pm based on seat location. Seats located near the front of the theatre and select ADA seats will be priced less than other seats and will only be made available to members of the Stubs rewards program and seats in the middle of the theatre will be priced more than the other non-front row seats. In addition, AMC Stubs A-List members will be able to reserve the expensive middle seats at no additional charge.[84][85]In July 2023 AMC chose to abandon dynamic pricing after testing showed that customers were still not likely to choose front-row seats despite their lower prices, with most customers still sitting in the middle of the theatre or other non-front seats despite the upcharge. This made AMC believe that this made their prices less competitive as competitors did not also adapt dynamic pricing. The company also stated that it would test seats that recline further back in the front rows that would potentially allow better views.[86]
On July 31, the company reported their highest single-week admissions revenue in company history due to theBarbenheimercraze.[87]On September 6, AMC announced that it had planned to sell up 40 million shares.[88]
AMC patentedcup holderarmrestsin 1981.[16]AMC also introduced stadium-style seating. The seats are placed on risers so that each person has an unobstructed view of the screen. In 1995, they introduced "Love Seat" style seating with retractable armrests so that there can be no barrier between two seats.[16]In July 1994, AMC signed an agreement with Sony to begin installing SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound) in auditoriums,[89]and began upgrading selected older auditoriums in 2003. On March 26, 2009, AMC announced an agreement to convert 1,500 existing auditoriums to fully digital 3D screens usingRealDtechnology.[90][non-primary source needed]
On March 30, 2009, they announced they would convert all 4,500 screens in their chain to4Kdigital projectors provided by Sony.[91]In April 2022, AMC also announced an agreement with Cinionic to install laser projectors at 3,500 of its screens in the United States through the end of 2026.[92]
Selected AMC locations offer premium screens and features for a higher ticket price, includingpremium large formats.
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. invested $20 million in virtual-reality arcades and productions: $10 million to virtual reality entertainment company Dreamscape Immersive and another $10 million in a content fund.[102]
AMC Theatres created the now-defunct MovieWatcher program[when?]that rewarded frequent movie-goers similar to other rewards programs but featured innovative aspects. It was based on a points-per-movie-ticket-purchased system, with rewards varying from concessions to movie passes based on point-based level. However, points were limited to a maximum of four points per three-hour time period, which was equal to two tickets.[103]For the AMC cinemas that were not part of the Loews Cineplex acquisition and therefore ticketed byMovieTickets.com, the website's surcharge was waived for MovieWatcher members.[citation needed]
On April 1, 2011, AMC started a new rewards program known as AMC Stubs,[104]which could be purchased for a fee of $12 for an entire year. For that initial fee, members would receive $5 on every $50 spent between the box office and the concession stand at any AMC theater nationwide. AMC Stubs members also received a free size upgrade with every popcorn and drink they purchase (for example, an AMC Stubs member can get a large popcorn for the price of a regular).
Other perks include birthday gifts and waived ticketing fees for online ticketing sites such asMovieTickets.comandFandangoand also online ticket purchases through AMC's own website and mobile app. Receipts or ticket stubs were required for manual adjustments. No more than four manual adjustments would be allowed per account in a single calendar month. Manual adjustments would be made for purchases made within 30 calendar days from date of original purchase.[105]
As of March 29, 2012, AMC Stubs had 3.2 million members, which represents approximately 18% of AMC attendance during fiscal 2012.[104]In July 2018, AMC Stubs was split into three programs that are currently still in-place: the free AMC Stubs Insider; the yearly fee-based AMC Stubs Premiere, which costs $15 annually and provides the same benefits as the original Stubs plus an expedited line at tickets and concessions; and the monthly fee-based AMC Stubs A-List, which includes up to 3 movie tickets a week to any film in any format for $19.95 to $23.95 a month, depending on the state the member plans to watch movies in.[106][107]Discount Tuesdays is another feature every Tuesday for members to purchase tickets typically for just $6 to any film in most locations, with occasional exclusions, plus surcharges for premium formats such as 3D, IMAX, and Dolby Cinema, as well as special events.
Some AMC locations have a bar service under the MacGuffins brand. These are primarily offered at AMC and AMC Dine-in locations, but some AMC Classic locations with liquor licenses offer their alcoholic beverages under this brand. Drinks can be ordered to be consumed in the bar and lounge area or taken into the theater. Some AMC Dine-in theaters have their MacGuffins set up as a full-service restaurant that can be accessed without having to pay for a movie ticket.[108]
Several types of vouchers may be used at AMC Theatres.
Following the acquisition of Carmike Cinemas, AMC began to unify its cinemas under one of three main banners in 2017:[112][113][114][115]
AMC also formed a short-lived partnership withPlanet Hollywoodthat failed due to that company's bankruptcy. The Planet Movies by AMC venture planned to open complexes worldwide with the objective of having icon locations in major metropolitan and other select areas, likeOrlandoandColumbus. Initially, seven existing, unnamed AMC megaplex theaters with more than 150 combined screens were to be re-branded under a license arrangement to incorporate certain elements of the new concept. The initial seven re-branded locations were to include markets such asOrlando, Florida. The AMC Pleasure Island 24 megaplex in Orlando, situated directly across from Planet Hollywood's most successful restaurant and retail unit and adjacent to Disney'sPleasure Island(nowDisney Springs) was to be the first Planet Movies location.
After the initial seven, the joint-venture planned to own and operate all subsequent units including 8 to 10 complexes with 200 to 250 screens planned to open over the next 18 to 24 months. Over the longer term, the venture anticipated rolling out units at the rate of 5 to 10 per year. From almost the very start, the well-publicized financial strains on Planet Hollywood hindered the project. The only Planet Movies location to actually open, a 30 screen megaplex, did so in the summer of 1999 atEaston Town CenterinColumbus, Ohio. The location was also located alongside anOfficial All Star CaféandPlanet Hollywoodrestaurant.
The continued poor financial performance of Planet Hollywood led the company to declare bankruptcy in December 1998, and even before the first location had opened stated that "the joint venture has no definitive plans to expand this concept once the Columbus site is completed". As Planet Hollywood was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy in October 1999 their re-organization plan emphasized focus back on their core restaurant business and away from side-ventures like Planet Movies and their Cool Planet ice cream chain.  The Planet Hollywood restaurant and All Star Café in Columbus were closed in late 2000, and the film memorabilia were also removed from the theater as it was rebranded AMC Easton 30, and continues to operate.  The Planet Movies by AMC joint venture was formally dissolved on January 9, 2001.
Both of theDisney Parksin the United States at one time included AMC movie theaters at their Downtown Disney sections: AMC Dine-In Disney Springs 24 all-stadium-seating megaplex with Dolby Cinema and Dine-In Theatres (opened in 1996) (formerly AMC Pleasure Island 24) atWalt Disney World Resortand AMC Downtown Disney 12 atDisneyland Resortstadium-seating multiplex (opened in 2001, closed in 2018). The AMC CityWalk Stadium 19 located onUniversal Studios Hollywood'sCityWalkwas relaunched after a renovation as "Universal Cinema, an AMC Theatre", on April 21, 2017. This location includes a seven-story IMAX screen with IMAX Laser and IMAX 70mm film, as well as "Black Box"–inspired auditoriums.  It has one Christie Laser Projector per auditorium, with Dolby Atmos speakers.[119]AtUniversal Orlando Resort, AMC had the Universal Cineplex 20 (also a former Cineplex Odeon), until September 2018 when it became aCinemark.[120][121][122]
AMC Independent (also known as AMCi) is an AMC film distribution program that aims to help independent films reach a theatrical audience. The program was announced in 2010 via the AMC Blog,[123]and has been responsible for promoting and distributing all independent films to AMC theaters since.[124][125][126]
In July 2021, AMC Theatres partnered with American artistChance the Rapperand his content production company House of Kicks in a trailblazing internationaldistributionagreement to bring his concert filmMagnificent Coloring Worldto cinemas internationally, marking the first time an individual recording artist distributed a film through AMC.[127]This deal was revisited in 2023 when AMC partnered withTaylor SwiftandBeyoncéto release their respectiveconcert filmsTaylor Swift: The Eras TourandRenaissance: A Film by Beyoncé. In all three cases, AMC acted as both the distributor and exhibitor of the films, bypassing the involvement of major film studios.[128][129]
In January 2022, AMC Theatres started selling popcorn viafood delivery, before entering supermarkets, in order to compensate for theCOVID-19 pandemic-induced downturn in movie theaters.[130][131]

In December 2015,Starplex Cinemaswas sold to AMC for approximately $175 million.[142]Most of these theaters now operate as AMC Classic as of July 2017.
On March 3, 2016, AMC announced its intent to acquireCarmike Cinemasin a $1.1 billion deal, pending regulatory and shareholder approval, which would allow it to overtakeRegalas the United States' largest movie theater chain.[143]The merger officially closed in December 2016.[144]
In July 2016,UCI & Odeon Cinema Groupwas sold to AMC for approximately $1.21 billion, subject to European Commission approval.[145]The acquisition was approved by the European Commission and the deal closed in November 2016.[146][147]
In January 2017,Nordic Cinema Group, the leading movie theater operator in theNordicandBalticarea, was sold to AMC for approximately $929 million.[148][149]The deal was completed in March 2017 after AMC received clearance from the European Commission.[150]
In July 2021, AMC Theatres announced that it would acquire the leases to theAmericana at Brandin downtown Glendale andThe Grove at Farmers Marketin Los Angeles locations, formerly owned byPacific Theatres, and that they would reopen in August as part of the AMC chain. The company has not ruled out acquiring the leases of other Pacific Theatres locations.[151]In December 2021, AMC Theaters also announced that they had acquired the leases to the former Pacific Theaters location atNorthridge Fashion CenterinNorthridge, Los Angelesand theArclightChicago 14 inLincoln Park, Chicago, which both opened in 2022.[152]In February 2022, AMC Theaters reached a deal to acquire the leases to the Arclight Montgomery 16 atWestfield MontgomeryinWashington D.C.and theWestfield UTC mall's Arclight UTC 14 inLa Jolla, with the former reopening that month and the latter in March of that year.[153]During the same month, the company reached an agreement to acquire the lease to the Century 12 Evanston, previously owned byCinemark Theatres, inEvanston, Illinois.[154]In December 2022, the company reached a deal on the acquisition of the former Arclight Cinemas located atThe Hub on CausewayinBoston.[155]
In April 2022, AMC Theaters acquired sevenBow Tie Cinemaslocations in Connecticut, New York, and Maryland.[156]
The early versions of stadium-style seating as built by AMC in 1995 had auditoriums configured with an entrance to a flat area immediately in front of the screen for wheelchair users.  People seated there had to either lean back or look up at an uncomfortable angle to see the screen. Able-bodied guests had to ascend the stairs to sit in the middle of the risers in order to have a comfortable line-of-sight with the screen. Since some wheelchair users have limited neck movement range, this configuration made AMC a popular target forAmericans with Disabilities Act(ADA)lawsuits.[157]AMC subsequently solved the problem in newer theaters by building full-stadium auditoriums where the main entrance is through a ramp that emerges onto a platform in the middle of the risers so that wheelchair users can enjoy optimal line-of-sight. However, theU.S. Department of Justicesued the company, and obtained an order requiring AMC to retrofit over 1,990 screens in 95 multiplexes and megaplexes across the United States.
The company successfully appealed the order to theU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled on December 5, 2008[158]that the order was excessive and violated AMC'sdue processrights under theConstitution of the United States.[157]AMC won by pointing out that theUnited States Access Boardhad not yet amended its guidelines for movie theaters to specifically require them to provide wheelchair guests sightlines that were as good as those from elevated risers, versus merely providing an unobstructed view of the screen. Therefore, the court ruled that it was unfair to AMC to retroactively hold it to a standard that did not exist at the time it began building stadium-style theaters.
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., and some of its executives and underwriters of federal securities law charges had agreed to settle in 2017 for $18 million. The case charged AMC with defrauding investors about the financial health of the acquired theater operators and integration challenges, artificially inflating the stock prices of its secondary public offering (SPO).[159]
When AMC announced that most of their theaters would reopen in mid-July 2020 during theCOVID-19 pandemic, the initial announcement said masks would be recommended but not mandatory. AMC CEO Adam Aron stated, "We are strongly encouraging our guests to wear masks all across the country, but not requiring it" and "We did not want to be drawn into a political controversy... We thought it might be counterproductive if we forced mask wearing on those people who believe strongly that it is not necessary."[160]After massive pushback from the public, Aron changed the policy to require masks: "This announcement prompted an intense and immediate outcry from our customers, and it is clear from this response that we did not go far enough on the usage of masks," Aron said.[161]

Gaspar Noé(Spanish:[gasˈpaɾnoˈe];French:[ɡaspaʁnɔ.e]; born 27 December 1963) is an Argentine filmmaker, who lives and worked primarily in France.[1]He is one of the primary exponents ofNew French Extremity, with his most notable works including the feature filmsI Stand Alone(1998),Irréversible(2002),Enter the Void(2009),Love(2015),Climax(2018),Lux Æterna(2019), andVortex(2021). Noé's father is artist and writerLuis Felipe Noé.
Noé was born on 27 December 1963 inBuenos Aires, Argentina.[2]His fatherLuis Felipe Noé, is a notable Argentine artist, writer, and intellectual.[3]His father is ofItalian descent, while his mother Nora Murphy is of Irish descent.[4]He has a sister named Paula.[5]He lived in New York City until age five,[4]after which point his family returned to Argentina.[6]In 1976, they emigrated to France to escape themilitary dictatorship occurring in Argentina at the time.
Noé graduated fromÉcole nationale supérieure Louis-Lumièrein France in 1982.[7]His first feature filmmaking credits were as an assistant director to Argentine filmmakerFernando SolanasonTangos, the Exile of Gardel(1986) andSur(1988).
His work has been strongly associated with a collection of films often described asnew extreme films.  Highlighting their challenging sexual and violent bodily imagery,Tim Palmerhas described them as part of acinéma du corps(cinema of the body), and a cinema of 'brutal intimacy' because of its attenuated use of narrative, generally assaulting and often illegible cinematography, confrontational subject material, a treatment of sexual behavior as violent rather than mutually intimate, and a pervasive sense of social nihilism or despair.[8]
Noé often directly addresses the audience in confrontational ways, most notably inI Stand Alone, when an intertitle warns the audience that they have 30 seconds to leave the cinema before the final violent climax. In a different way, this can be seen inIrreversible, in which the 10-minute long single-take rape sequence has frequently been read as an assault on viewers, as well as a depiction of an assault on the female character.
Gaspar Noé andLucile Hadžihalilovićhave repeatedly collaborated with each other on film projects. In the early 1990s, Noé co-founded the production companyLes Cinémas de la Zonewith Hadžihalilović.[9]Noé operated the camera and was the cinematographer for two short films directed by Hadžihalilović:La Bouche de Jean-Pierre(1996) andGood Boys Use Condoms(1998). Similarly, Hadžihalilović produced and editedCarne(1991), editedSeul contre tous(1998) and was credited as a writer onEnter the Void(2009). The creative collaboration is made clear in the comparable stylistic choices across these early films, most clearly the credit sequences and the marketing designs. In 2025, Noé will appear in Hadžihalilović's fourth feature film,The Ice Tower.[10]
Three of his films feature the character of a nameless butcher played byPhilippe Nahon:Carne,I Stand Aloneand, in a cameo,Irréversible.
All of Noé's feature films are shot by cinematographerBenoît Debie.[11]
The music forIrréversiblewas composed byThomas Bangalter. The latter also sent Gaspar Noé an unreleased song he made circa 1995 forClimax.The song was namedSangriain reference to the movie.
In collaboration withSaint Laurent, he directed filmsLux ÆternaandSaint Laurent - Summer of ‘21.[12][13]
Noé stated in the September 2012 edition ofSight & Soundmagazine that seeing2001: A Space Odysseyat the age of seven changed his life, without which experience he would never have become a director.[14]A poster for the film features notably in a scene towards the end ofIrreversible.
Many of his movies feature all kind of film posters, which reflects his collection and passion for them. He's believed to be the owner of one of the three known copies of the rarest poster forM(1931 film).[15]SinceIrréversible, he's kept working with French film poster designer Laurent Lufroy for all his feature films: Lufroy even appears inLove(as a policeman),Climax(as a dog-handler) andLux Æterna(using a torch).
Noé also cites the 1983 Austrian serial killer film,Angst, byGerald Kargl, as a major influence.[16]
In 2024, during an interview from his masterclass session inCairo International Film Festivalin Egypt, he said that he want to do a different film, "a film with kids, for children".[17]
He is the business partner of filmmakerLucile Hadžihalilović.[18]
Noé is a dual national of Argentina and Italy, having obtained an Italian passport through lineage, though he does not consider himself Italian.[6][19]"I have never lived in Italy, I don't speak Italian," he said in an interview. "If I hadn't had an Italian passport to travel all over the world, I would have applied for a French one."[6]
Noé suffered a near fatalbrain hemorrhagein early 2020, which partly inspired the plot of his filmVortex.[20]
Besides being a filmmaker, he is an occasional photographer. In 2013, Noé shot the cover art for American singer-songwriterSky Ferreira's debut albumNight Time, My Time. Other celebrities, such asAgnès b.,Todd SolondzorStacy Martinwere shot by Gaspar Noé, as well as several models for erotic magazines.[25]
Many of Noé's films were polarizing or controversial with viewers due to their inclusion of graphic scenes of violence and sexual violence.I Stand Alone, Irreversible, Enter the Void,We Fuck Alone,LoveandClimaxwere all considered controversial for their challenging sexual and violent imagery.
Irreversiblewas hugely divisive amongst critics with journals such asSight and Sound(UK) andPositif(France) allowing critics to openly voice their disagreements about the film.[26][27][28]It caused substantial outrage in many countries for its central scene of rape, filmed in a single take and lasting nearly ten minutes in total, with some critics comparing it to pornography because of its length and the use of a static camera,[29][30]as well as considering the film as a whole to be deeply homophobic for its hellish portrayal of a gay S&M club.[31]On the other hand, it was also frequently praised for its brutal portrayal of the horrors of rape, and its implicit challenge to viewers of the scene. Eugenie Brinkema, for instance, describesIrreversibleas "ethically, generically, subjectively" disruptive: "the rape [...] is real, it is private, it is contained – it is insufferably present. [...] it interrogates vehicles of receptivity and the power and violence done to bodies by bodies".[32]

He also directed a series ofLincolncommercials starringMatthew McConaughey.
In 2019, Cannes Film Festival announced that it would host a masterclass with Refn on working in Film and TV.[34]
In 2005, it was reported that Refn would co-wrote a screenplay withNicholas St. JohntitledBilly's People.[35]However, Refn scrapped the project because his filmsBleeder(1999) andFear X(2003) werebox office disasters.[36]
In 2009, Refn expressed high interest in developing a film biopic of notorious EnglishoccultistAleister Crowley, withBronsonstarTom Hardyin the lead role. Refn admitted to not knowing anything about the life of the magician and referred to Crowley as a "Satan-worshipping cult personality".[37]That year, he became attached to direct a modern retelling ofStrange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr HydewithKeanu Reevesplaying the titular roles. The working title of the film wasJekyll. According to an interview with SciFi Wire, he wanted the film to take place "in modern America and use as much credible science as possible."[38]However, in February 2010, Refn dropped out of the project in order to work onDrive.[39]
In 2010, Refn planned to directPaul Schrader's scriptThe Dying of the LightwithHarrison Fordas the lead.[40]However, in February 2010, Refn exited the project. In September 2011 during promotion forDrive, he claimed that Ford did not want his character to die, causing the film production to fall apart.[41][42]Schrader directed the film, which starredNicolas CageandAnton Yelchinin the Ford and Tatum roles. Following its release, Refn joined with Schrader, Cage, and Yelchin in protesting the studio's final edit of the project, which was not to Schrader's original vision.Channing Tatum, who was to co-star with Ford inThe Dying of the Light, originally wanted Refn to directMagic Mike(2012), whichSteven Soderberghcame to direct.
In 2012, Refn became involved in the direction of a remake of the 1980s crime showThe EqualizerstarringDenzel Washington, but the deal with Sony fell through for unknown reasons.[43]The adaptationThe Equalizerended up being directed byAntoine Fuquafor release in 2014.
In July 2016, Refn revealed that he had turned down the offer to direct theJames BondmovieSpectre.[44]
On August 14, 2016, Refn announced via his Twitter page that his next project would be titledThe Avenging Silence, calling it "Ian Fleming+William Burroughs+ NWR = The Avenging Silence" and posted images for Fleming's novelDr. Noand for Burroughs's novelThe Soft Machine.[45][46]Variety reported that producer Lene Borglum described the purported plot as following: "[A] former European spy [accepts] a mission from a Japanese businessman to take down the head of aYakuzaboss in Japan".[47]
Refn has spoken aboutcharacterizationin his films:
I've always liked characters that because of the circumstances, have to transform themselves, and in the end, it's inevitable that what they end up becoming is what they were meant to be. Take, for example,Pusher II, which is a movie about a son [played by Mads Mikkelsen] who all his life wants his father's love, but realizes he needs to kill him to free the sins of the father from him. What plants the seed for him is realizing he has his own child, and the responsibility of that suddenly forces him to take action. And it's a happy ending, even though it's a dark ending, but for the character, it is what he was meant to become. It's almost like he achieved his true meaning. AndDriveis similar in the sense that The Driver was meant to become a superhero, and he's denied all these things—relationships, companionship. And why would he be denied that? It was because he was meant for something greater.[48]
Refn prefers to shoot his films in chronological order: "I read that [directorJohn Cassavetes] had done it on some of his films, so I thought, 'That's a pretty cool approach.' And after I did it on my first movie, I felt, 'How can you do a movie any other way?' It's like a painting—you paint the movie as you go along, and I like the uncertainty of not knowing exactly how it's going to turn out."[49]Refn spoke more about shooting in chronological order in September 2011, in reference toDrive:
It's always difficult with production. All my films previous toDrivehad been shot in what I call 100-percent almost-chronological order. WhereDriveis like 80 percent. The reason why it didn't go 100 was that I just simply couldn't afford the last remaining pieces. I could afford what I call the "emotional chronological order". So nobody would die or leave the movie in the middle of their shooting schedule. It would always be the end. So there was a build-up as much as possible.[48]
On his approach to working with actors, Refn has said:
I think the first thing I ask any actor is what they would like to do, which sometimes can frighten people or can be looked upon as, 'Oh, you don't know what you want.' But I try to draw the actor in—to force them in, in some cases, because a lot of actors don't want to discuss things or go in deep; they just want to come and do the work, play their part and walk away. But for me, it doesn't work like that. You've got to get absorbed and dirty, and a way to do that is to ask the actor what they would like to do. It also forces them to be more truthful.[49]
Refn'scolor blindnesshas influenced his style: "I can't see mid-colors. That's why all my films are very contrasted, if it were anything else I couldn't see it."[9]
Refn has cited viewingThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre(1974) as inspiration for his filmmaking career:
I grew up in a cinema family. My parents were brought up on theFrench New Wave. That was God to them, but to me it was the antichrist, and how better to rebel against your parents than by watching something your mother is going to hate, which were American horror movies. When I sawTexas Chain Saw Massacre, I realized: I don't want to be a director, I don't want to be a writer, I don't want to be a producer, I don't want to be a photographer, I don't want to be aneditor, I don't want to be asound man. I want to be all of them at once. And that film proved that you can do it because that movie is not a normal movie.[49]
Refn has said numerous times that his largest cinematic influence has been the directorAlejandro Jodorowsky(to whom Refn dedicatedOnly God Forgives),[50]of whom he has said:
I had been seeing Jodorowsky the last couple years in Paris and we'd become quite close. Before we'd have dinner, we'd always have a tarot reading and talk about what it means. I feel that as a filmmaker, he's the last of the great giants of an era that's coming to a close. A year ago, he baptized me as his spiritual son and I wanted to reward that gesture.[51]
He stated that for his first filmPusher, he stole everything fromGillo Pontecorvo's 1965 Oscar-nominatedThe Battle of AlgiersandRuggero Deodato's 1980 highly controversial filmCannibal Holocaust.[52]Also influential to his film viewing experience wereJohn Cassavetes' 1976 filmThe Killing of a Chinese BookieandKevin Smith's 1994 indie filmClerks.[49]
Other favorites includeTokyo Drifter(1966),Kwaidan(1964),My Life as a Dog(1985),Man on Fire(2004),Pretty Woman(1990),Scorpio Rising(1963),Vampyr(1932),Videodrome(1983),Suspiria(1977),Cloverfield(2008),Flesh for Frankenstein(1973),Planet of the Vampires(1965),Liquid Sky(1982),The Shining(1980),Night of the Living Dead(1968),To Die For(1995),Sixteen Candles(1984),The Night of the Hunter(1955),Alien(1979) andBeauty and the Beast(1946). Some of the films Refn helped restore includeRon Ormond'sThe Burning Hell(1974),Curtis Harrington'sNight Tide(1961) andRay Dennis Steckler'sWild Guitar(1962).[53][54][55][56][57]
He has also stated he is influenced byextraterrestrials. After the making ofCopenhagen Cowboy, a "making-of" documentary was produced titledCopenhagen Cowboy: Nightcall with Nicolas Winding Refn, and it arrived on Netflix on January 31, 2023. In the documentary, Refn said:
I am a very superstitious person, and I have contacts with extraterrestrials through my work that I regularly speak with. So it was very natural for me to bring that into the process. I always knew that the Miu character and her so-called sister, Rakel, would essentially come from another dimension. I just had to figure out how I interpreted it into the story.[58]
Refn is married to actressLiv Corfixen,[59]with whom he has two daughters.[60]
After making the movieFear X, Refn was heavily in debt. The story of his recovery is recorded in the documentaryGambler, directed by Phie Ambo.[61]
At the2011 Cannes Film Festival, Refn said that he was repulsed by the controversial remarks byLars von TrieraboutAdolf Hitler, calling them unacceptable.[62]
His wife, Liv Corfixen, wrote and directed a documentary entitledMy Life Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, which chronicles the "behind the scenes" experience of shootingOnly God Forgiveswhen the entire family had to be relocated to Thailand. The documentary has received positive reviews after premiering atFantastic Festand Beyond Fest.[63]The soundtrack for the documentary is also composed entirely byCliff Martinez, with the last track "Disconnected" composed, written and sung by Julian Winding, Refn's nephew.[64]

Korine was born to aJewishfamily inBolinas, California, the son of Eve and Sol Korine.[6]His father was anIranian Jewishimmigrant.[7]His father was a tapdancer and produced documentaries forPBSin the 1970s about an "array of colorful Southern characters"; he would take Korine to carnivals and circuses[8]and taught him how to use aBolexcamera.[9]As a child, Korine watched movies with his father, who rentedBuster Keatonfilms for Korine and took him to seeWerner Herzog'sEven Dwarfs Started Small(1970) in the theater. Korine reminisced that "I knew there was a poetry in cinema that I had never seen before that was so powerful."[10][11]
Korine spent his early childhood in theSan Francisco Bay Arealiving with his family on acommune.[12][13]In the early 1980s, they relocated toNashville, Tennessee,[13]where he attendedHillsboro High Schoolbefore moving to New York City to live with his grandmother.[14]As a teenager, Korine spent his summers in San Francisco, "skateboarding, living on rooftops, running away from my parents, getting in fights. You know, girls. At that point I was just getting into movies, but the idea of making films happened later in high school."[15]He began frequenting revival theaters, watching films byJohn Cassavetes,Werner Herzog,Jean-Luc Godard,Robert Altman,Rainer Werner FassbinderandAlan Clarke. In an interview withBruce LaBruce, Korine briefly mentioned that he studied Business Administration in college. Other sources[16]state that he studied Dramatic Writing atTisch School of the ArtsatNew York Universityfor one semester before dropping out to pursue a career as a professional skateboarder.
Korine was skating with friends inWashington Square Parkwhen he met photographerLarry Clark.[17]Impressed, the photographer asked him to compose a script about skaters and to include in the plot a teenage AIDS experience.[18]Korine told Clark, "I've been waiting all my life to write this story."[19]Within three weeks, Korine wroteKids, a film about 24 hours in the sex- and drug-filled lives of severalManhattanteenagers in New York City during theAIDScrisis.[20]Kidsreceived mixed reviews at the time of its release in 1995, but has since become a significantcult film. Among others, the film featuresChloë SevignyandRosario Dawsonin their first movie roles. The film, while controversial, jumpstarted Korine's career. This put him into contact with film producerCary Woodswho budgeted about $1 million to produceGummo, Korine's personal vision.[17]
In 1997, Korine wrote and directedGummo, a film based on life inXenia, Ohio, a town devastated bya tornadoin the early 1970s. Forgoing conventional narrative,Gummois a nonlinear, fragmented series of sketches written by Korine. Only five experienced actors worked on the movie; much of the cast was found during preproduction in Tennessee. The film is notable for having unsettling, often bizarre scenes, as well as its dreamlike soundtrack, which strengthens the disconcerting atmosphere. It features "an eclectic soundtrack includingdeath metal,MadonnaandRoy Orbison.[21]
It premiered at the 24thTelluride Film Festivalon August 29, 1997. During the screening, numerous people got up and left during the initial cat drowning sequence. Three months later,Werner Herzogcalled Korine to give praise to the film overall, especially the bacon taped to the wall during the bathtub scene. He toldThe New York Times, "When I saw a piece of fried bacon fixed to the bathroom wall inGummo, it knocked me off my chair. [Korine's] a very clear voice of a generation of filmmakers that is taking a new position. It's not going to dominate world cinema, but so what?"[22]
Although a majority of mainstream critics derided it as an unintelligible mess, it won top prizes at that year'sVenice Film Festivaland earned Korine the respect of noted filmmakers such asGus Van Sant, among others.  It has been called "unlike anything you've seen in a while – maybe ever" – and that "if you're the kind of person who claims to be frustrated by the predictability of commercial filmmaking, [it presents] a rare opportunity to put your money where your mouth is."[23]
In 1998, Korine releasedThe Diary of Anne Frank Pt II, a 40-minute three-screen collage featuring a boy burying his dog, kids insatanicdress vomiting on aBible, and a man inblackfacedancing and singing "My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean". It utilizes some of the same actors and themes asGummo, and can be considered a companion piece as the film utilises footage that didn't make the final cut ofGummo. The film "further disgusted critics"[18]and solidified his status as a notoriously shocking and experimental director.
Julien Donkey-Boy, released in 1999, included a signedDogme 95manifesto. While it broke a number of the movement's basic tenets,Lars von Trierlauded Korine's ability to interpret the rules creatively.[citation needed]
The story is told from the perspective of a young man suffering from untreatedschizophrenia, played byEwen Bremner, as he tries to understand his deteriorating world. Julien's abusive and arguably hypersensitive father is played by Werner Herzog. At one point, Korine was to play the son, but he backed down and was replaced by Bremner.
LikeGummoandKids, it too has since become something of a cult classic, a go-to film for those seeking cinema that is, as Roger Ebert said in his three star review, "shocking for most moviegoers", unlike "the slick aboveground indie productions" that are now the norm.[24]
In 2000,The Devil, The Sinner, and His Journeypremiered, which featured Korine in black metalcorpsepaintasO. J. SimpsonandJohnny DeppasKato Kaelin. That same year, Korine directed the short film Korine Tap for Stop For a Minute, a series of short films commissioned byDazed & Confusedmagazine and FilmFour Lab. The film featured Korine tap dancing while wearingblackface.[25][26]
In 2002,Larry ClarkmadeKen Park, based on a script Korine had written several years earlier. The film, another adult tale of youth gone awry, was not distributed in the United States. At the time of its release, Clark and Korine had long since parted ways, and Korine had no involvement in its production.
In 2003, he made the television documentaryAbove the Belowabout his friend and collaboratorDavid Blaineand his 44-day stunt in a park over the bank ofRiver Thamesin London inside a suspendedplexiglasbox. A documentary commissioned bySky TelevisionandChannel 4, it also includes jokes, visual poetry, and music. In addition, Korine has worked with Blaine on a number of Blaine's specials.
He first met his wife,Rachel (Simon) Korine, a 17-year-old fromNashville, around this time.
His third feature film,Mister Lonely, was co-written by his brother, Avi Korine, and starredDiego Luna,Samantha Morton,Denis Lavant,Anita Pallenberg,David Blaine,Werner Herzogand Mal Whiteley. The movie was released in 2008 and debuted at Cannes.[27]His largest film, with a budget of $8.2 million,[28]it received mixed reviews and earned $386,915 in its first 9 months.[29]
The film is the story of "a young American man lost in Paris. He scratches out a living as aMichael Jacksonlook-alike, dancing in the streets, in public parks, at tourist spots and trade shows. Different from everyone else, he feels as if he's floating between two worlds. During a show at a geriatric home Michael Jackson meetsMarilyn Monroe. Haunted by her angelic beauty he follows her to a commune in the Highlands, joining her husbandCharlie Chaplinand her daughterShirley Temple. The commune is a place where everyone is famous and "no-one gets old". Here, ThePope, TheQueen of the United Kingdom,Madonna,James Deanand other impersonators build a stage in the hope that the world will visit and watch them perform. Everything is beautiful. Until the world shifts, and reality intrudes on their utopian dream."[30]
Korine also appeared in the 2007documentary filmBeautiful Losersin which his life and career were one focus of the film, along with other artists such asMike Mills,Shepard Fairey,Margaret Kilgallen, Jo Jackson andBarry McGee. In the documentary, Korine discusses his motivation as an artist and filmmaker, as well as his inspiration for creating films he has never seen. Footage also appears from one of Korine's rare, early, and untitled short films, which preceded his work onKids.
In 2008 Korine was signed to MJZ for worldwide commercial representation.
On 6 September 2009 Korine's filmTrash Humpers[31]premiered as part of the Visions section of the2009 Toronto International Film Festival.[32]Despite being a work of fiction, the film went on to win the top award at the prominent Europeandocumentary filmfestival CPH:DOX –Copenhagen International Documentary Festival– in November 2009.
In March 2011, Korine released a short film entitledUmshini Wam, which is a popularZulustruggle song meaning "bring me my machine gun". The film starred Ninja and Yo-Landi ofDie Antwoord. In September 2011, Korine released a short film entitledSnowballs, sponsored by theProenza Schoulerfashion label.
Korine's next project was the crime dramaSpring Breakers, which was produced in 2012 inFlorida, and starredJames Franco,Selena Gomez,Vanessa Hudgens,Ashley Benson, and Korine's wife,Rachel Korine. In looking at early scenes being filmed and in speaking toward the plot, cast, and earlier works of the filmmaker,Indiewirewrote "this might be the weirdest movie the director has ever made simply by nature of being totally unlike his previous work."[33]"That Mr. Korine appears to be having it both (or many) ways may seem like a cop-out, but only if you believe that the role of the artist is to be a didact or a scold",[34]wroteThe New York Times. Principal filming wrapped up on March 30, 2012.[35][36]The film was selected to compete for theGolden Lionat the69th Venice International Film Festival.[37]where it had its world premiere, and later was shown at theToronto International Film Festivalbefore being released to the general public in March 2013.[33][38]
Korine's featureThe Beach Bumwas released in 2019, starringMatthew McConaugheyas Moondog,Isla Fisheras his wife Minnie,Martin Lawrenceas Captain Wack, andSnoop Doggas Lingerie.[39][40]
In 2023, Korine releasedAggro Dr1ftstarringCatalanactorJordi MollàandTravis Scott. The film premiered at the80th Venice International Film Festival, and was produced and distributed by his companyEDGLRD.[41]
Korine's next feature film, also with EDGLRD, isBaby Invasion, shot from a first-person shooter perspective.[42]
Korine has not primarily regarded himself as a director, instead describing a "unified aesthetic" that his filmography explores as much as his art and photography.[1]Much of his filmography, including his screenplays, explores themes of dysfunctional families, mental disorders, abuse, hedonism, poverty and various subcultures, withunreliable narratorsand acollageof perspectives.[43]This is often presented experimentally, with many of Korine's films incorporatingPolaroids,Super 8,35mm filmandVHSrecordings, such as inGummoandJulien Donkey-Boy.Improvisationis also an important filmmaking technique for Korine, as a way to maintain his films as "living thing[s]."[12]Korine has described the social, psychological and subcultural aspects of his films as constituting what he describes as the "American Landscape".[44]
Korine creditedtap-dance,vaudevilleandminstrelsyas influences on his work in the 1990s and 2000s,[45]with him especially naming the comedy ofFanny Brice,Eddie CantorandAl Jolsonas inspirations for his intentionally stilted style of presentation and humor.[46]Like vaudeville, the style of Korine's work is presentational and works purely by thematic association. He has compared with this to viewing picture books of assorted photos, which would be seemingly devoid of context, but because they are compiled and presented in succession, a narrative is formed, and Korine has said thatGummoand his subsequent films were written in this fashion,[46]striving to retain a "margin of the undefined."[47]In 2009, he summarized an ideal setting in his aesthetic as "an abandoned parking lot and a soiled sofa on the edge [...] with a street lamp off to the side. America seems like a series of abandoned parking lots, streetlights and abandoned sofas." Ensuing from this, the setting appears frequently in his filmTrash Humpers(2009).[48]
In 1997, Korine's favorite writers were listed as the humoristsJames ThurberandS. J. Perelman, as well as theSouthern GothicnovelistFlannery O'Connor.[49]He also credited the philosopherWalter Benjaminas an influence.[50]In recent years, Korine has praised rapper and collaboratorGucci Mane.[51]
Korine has noted British filmmakerAlan Clarkeas a strong inspiration on his filmmaking, especially with regards to his realism and use of extensive scenes.[52]In 1999, he listed his top ten films asPixotebyHéctor Babenco,BadlandsandDays of HeavenbyTerrence Malick,Fat CitybyJohn Huston,StroszekbyWerner Herzog,The Killing of a Chinese BookieandA Woman Under the InfluencebyJohn Cassavetes,McCabe and Mrs. MillerbyRobert Altman,Out of the BluebyDennis HopperandHail MarybyJean-Luc Godard.[1]
Despite the scorn of a majority of mainstream reviewers, Korine has won festival prizes at Venice and Rotterdam among others. Established directors such asBernardo BertolucciandGus Van Santare also outspoken proponents of Korine's work, with Van Sant sayingGummo"changed his life"[49]and Bertolucci saying Korine "created a revolution in the language of cinema."[53]
Korine was initially frequently labeled as an enfant terrible and was often accused of exploitation and self-indulgence; he responded in 1997, asking "How can an artist be expected not to be self-indulgent? That's the whole thing that's wrong with filmmaking today [...] To me, art is one man's voice, one idea, one point-of-view, coming from one person."[54]Korine feels there is no need to justify or explain the images he puts to the screen, clarifying that they are simply the result of "a cinema of passion and obsession."[46]He has added that "I mostly just make things to entertain myself and at the same time hope that there's some type of audience that likes what I'm doing."[55]Korine has also stated that "film is like a dead art because of people not taking chances",[54]and has shown his preference for "auteuristworks".[56]He stated in 1999 that "In another ten or fifteen years, the people that understand and appreciateGummoor my work will be in positions of power", declaring that the culture presented in his art was going to become more prominent.[1]
Korine has said that his films are created with the premise that if there is at least one image that sticks with you after viewing a film and makes you change your perspective on cinema, then it is a success.[49]Roger Ebertsubsequently said in his review ofJulien Donkey-Boythat "Korine, who at 25 is one of the most untamed new directors, belongs on the list withGodard,Cassavetes,Herzog,Warhol,Tarkovsky,Brakhageand others who smash conventional movies and reassemble the pieces ... Harmony Korine is the real thing, an innovative and gifted filmmaker whose work forces us to see on his terms."[24]
Korine has published a number of books.A Crack Up at the Race Riots, an experimental book of fragments which he jokingly described in press appearances and interviews as his attempt to write "the Great AmericanChoose Your Own Adventurenovel", was published in 1998 by Drag City.
The screenplay forKids(1995) was published byGrove Pressthe same year, followed by a collection of the screenplays forGummo(1997),Julien Donkey-Boy(1999) and an unfinished screenplay namedJokesinCollected Screenplays, published byFaber and Faberin 2002. The screenplay forMister Lonely(2007) was released by Swiss publisher Nieves with photographs by Rachel Korine and Brent Stewart in 2008. The majority of these books differ substantially from the movies eventually produced. Drag City also published a collection of his fanzines calledThe Collected Fanzineswith skateboarder and writerMark Gonzalesin 2008.
Korine released a number of photographic collections, usually in conjunction with gallery exhibits. In 1998 he publishedThe Bad Sonin conjunction with Taka Ishii gallery in Tokyo, documenting his various photo shoots withMacaulay Culkin. In 2002,Pass the Bitch Chickenwas released, a collaboration with artist Christopher Wool, which consists of Korine's photographs heavily edited by Korine and Wool. In 2009 he publishedPigxotein conjunction with theVanderbilt UniversityFine Arts Gallery and released byNieves. The university describes the exhibition, which ran through February 26, 2009, as culling "together a number of photographs from Korine's private files in order to reveal a side of the artist's creative process that remains largely unexamined. Depicting an unnamed, mysterious young girl moving through a televised landscape of shifting contexts, Pigxote further illustrates Korine's interest in replacing plot lines and expected narrative tropes with intuitively arranged "experiential moments." They also provide a unique insight into the poetic mind of Nashville's most compelling prodigal son."[57]In 2003 his works were presented at an exhibition atagnès b's Galerie du jour in Paris, with whom Korine has often been associated. In 2010, Korine collaborated with New York Visual Artist Bill Saylor on the bookHo Bags.The book consists of drawing and paintings in which Korine and Saylor drew over each other's works. In 2011 Korine collaborated with the New York brandSupreme, releasing a set of two skateboard decks featuring original artworks by Korine. Since 2014, Korine has taken part in twelve exhibitions at the Gagosian gallery in various locations, including New York, London, Beverly Hills and Geneva.[58]Seven of these have been solo exhibitions.[58]In 2019 the Gagosian featured a collection of works by Korine titled "Young Twitchy".[58]These works consisted of photographs taken by the artist, mostly around his home in Florida, which were then recreated in oil paint and augmented with different characters.[59]In 2023, The Golfer’s Journal featured a collection of works by Korine titled "Wormburner", consisting of portraits of U.S. Presidents playing golf.[60]

Linked page for 'Rick Rubin' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin):
Frederick Jay Rubin(/ˈruːbɪn/,ROO-bin; born March 10, 1963) is an American record producer. He is a co-founder ofDef Jam Recordings, founder ofAmerican Recordings, and former co-president ofColumbia Records.
Rubin helped popularizehip hopby producing records for acts such as theBeastie Boys,Geto Boys,Run-DMC,Public Enemy, andLL Cool J. He has also produced hit records for acts from a variety of other genres, such aspop(Kesha,Adele,Lady Gaga),heavy metal(Danzig,Metallica,Slayer),alternative rock(The Cult,Red Hot Chili Peppers,Beabadoobee,Rage Against the Machine,the Strokes,Weezer),hard rock(Audioslave,AC/DC,Aerosmith),nu metal(Linkin Park,System of a Down,Slipknot), andcountry(Johnny Cash,The Avett Brothers,the Chicks).
In 2021 he co-starred in the six-part documentary miniseriesMcCartney 3,2,1which explores the career ofPaul McCartney.[1]
In 2007, Rubin was called "the most important producer of the last 20 years" byMTV[2]and was named onTime'slist of the "100 Most Influential People in the World".[3]
Frederick Jay Rubin was born into aJewishfamily inLong Beach, New York, on March 10, 1963,[4]the son of housewife Linda and shoe wholesaler Michael Rubin.[5]He grew up inLido Beach. While a student atLong Beach High School, Rubin befriended the school's audiovisual department director, who gave him a few lessons in guitar playing and songwriting.[6]He then played in a band with three friends, performing at garage gigs and school shows until a teacher helped him create apunkband called the Pricks. Their biggest claim to fame was being thrown off the stage atCBGBafter performing two songs due to brawling with hecklers, which had actually been instigated by friends of the band who had been instructed to do so to get the show shut down and create a buzz.[7]Although he had no authority inNew York City, his father traveled toManhattanwearing his Long Beachauxiliary policeuniform as he attempted to "shut down" the show.[citation needed]
Rubin foundedDef Jam Recordingswhile in college at New York University.[8]He moved on to form the bandHose, influenced by San Francisco'sFlipper, where he played guitar. In 1982, a Hose track became Def Jam's first release, a 45 rpm 7" vinyl single in a brown paper bag, and no label.[9]The band played in and around the NYC punk scene, toured the Midwest and California, and played with seminalhardcorebands likeMeat Puppets,Hüsker Dü,Circle Jerks,Butthole Surfers, andMinor Threat, becoming friends withFugazifrontman andDischord RecordsownerIan MacKaye. The band broke up in 1984 as Rubin's passion moved toward the NYC hip hop scene.[9]
Having befriendedZulu Nation'sDJ Jazzy Jay, Rubin began to learn abouthip hop production. By 1983, the two had produced "It's Yours" for Bronx rapperT La Rock, and released it on Def Jam. ProducerArthur Bakerhelped to distribute the record worldwide on Baker's Streetwise Records in 1984. Jazzy Jay introduced Rubin to concert promoter/artist managerRussell Simmonsin the Negril club, and Rubin explained he needed help getting Def Jam off the ground. Simmons and Rubin edged out Jazzy Jay and the official Def Jam record label was founded while Rubin was attendingNew York Universityin 1984. Its first release wasLL Cool J's "I Need a Beat". Rubin went on to find more hip-hop acts outsidethe Bronx,Brooklyn, andHarlem, including rappers fromQueens,Staten Island, andLong Island, which eventually led to Def Jam's signing ofPublic Enemy. Rubin was instrumental in pointing the members of the Beastie Boys away from their punk roots and into rap, resulting inKate Schellenbach's departure from the group.[10]The Beastie Boys' 1985 "Rock Hard"/"Party's Gettin' Rough"/"Beastie Groove" EP came out on the success of Rubin's production work with breakthrough actRun-DMC, of which previous recordings were produced by Simmons and Orange Krush's musician Larry Smith. His productions were characterized by occasionally fusing rap withheavy rock. Rubin tappedAdam DubinandRic Menelloto co-direct the videos for the Beastie Boys' "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)" and "No Sleep till Brooklyn", effectively launching the band's mainstream hip hop career.[11][12]
It was the idea of Rubin's friend Sue Cummings, an editor atSpinmagazine, to have Run-DMC andAerosmithcollaborate on acoverof Aerosmith's "Walk This Way". This 1986 production is often credited with both introducingrap hard rockto mainstream ears and revitalizing Aerosmith's career.[13]In 1986, he worked with Aerosmith again on demos for their forthcoming album, but their collaboration ended early and resulted in only rough studio jams. In the same year, Rubin began his long musical partnership withSlayer, producingReign in Blood, considered a classic of the heavy metal genre. This was his first work with a metal band.
In 1987,the Cultreleased its pivotal third album,Electric. Produced by Rubin, the album remains one of the Cult's trademark and classic works. Rubin worked with the Cult again on the 1992 single "The Witch". He is credited as music supervisor for the filmLess than Zeroand as the producer ofits soundtrack. Rubin portrayed a character based on himself in the 1985 hip-hop motion pictureKrush Groove, which was inspired by the early days of Simmons's career as an artist manager and music producer. He then directed and co-wrote (withRic Menello) a second Run–DMC film,Tougher Than Leatherin 1988.[citation needed][14]
In 1988, Rubin and Simmons went their separate ways after Rubin had a falling out with then Def Jam presidentLyor Cohen. Rubin left forLos Angelesto start Def American Records, while Simmons remained at Def Jam in New York. In Los Angeles, Rubin signed a number of rock and heavy metal acts, includingDanzig,Masters of Reality,the Four Horsemen, andWolfsbane, as well as alternative rock groupthe Jesus and Mary Chainand stand-up comedianAndrew Dice Clay. Though Rubin's work at this time focused mainly on rock and metal, he still retained a close association with rap, signing theGeto Boysand continuing to work with Public Enemy, LL Cool J, and Run-DMC.[15][16][17]
Rubin had originally given his new label the name "Def American Recordings". In 1993, he found that the word "def" had been accepted into the standardized dictionary and held an actual funeral for the word, complete with a casket, grave, celebrity mourners, and a eulogy byAl Sharpton.[5][18]Def American becameAmerican Recordings. Rubin has said: "When advertisers and the fashion world co-opted the image of hippies, a group of the original hippies in San Francisco literally buried the image of the hippie. When 'def' went from street lingo to mainstream, it defeated its purpose."[19]
The first major project on the renamed label wasJohnny Cash'sAmerican Recordings(1994), a record including six cover songs and new material written by others for Cash at Rubin's request. The album was a critical and commercial success, and helped revive Cash's career after a fallow period. The formula was repeated for five more Cash albums:Unchained(on whichTom Petty and the Heartbreakersserved as the backing band),Solitary Man,The Man Comes Around(the last album released before Cash's death),A Hundred Highways, andAin't No Grave.The Man Comes Aroundearned a 2003GrammyforBest Male Country Vocal Performance("Give My Love to Rose") and a nomination forBest Country Collaboration with Vocals("Bridge over Troubled Water" withFiona Apple). Rubin introduced Cash toNine Inch Nails' "Hurt", and the resulting cover version of it onThe Man Comes Aroundbecame a defining song of Cash's later years. Rubin also produced two ofJoe Strummer's final songs, "Long Shadow", a song Strummer wrote for Cash to record although he never did, and a cover ofBob Marley's "Redemption Song". Both were released on Strummer's final album,Streetcore, which was released after his death. Rubin also produced a version of "Redemption Song" with Strummer and Cash together, which was featured in Cash's posthumous box set,Unearthed.
Rubin has also produced a number of records with other artists, which were released on labels other than American. Arguably his biggest success as a producer came from working with theRed Hot Chili Peppers, with whom Rubin produced six studio albums from 1991 to 2011, starting with the band's fifth release,Blood Sugar Sex Magik, which launched the band to mainstream success thanks to the hit singles "Give It Away" and "Under the Bridge". Other albums include One Hot Minute, Californication, By the Way, Stadium Arcadium and I'm With You. The six albums with the Chili Peppers also spawned 12 number-one singles on theBillboardAlternative Songschart, a record the band as of 2015 still holds, and various awards, including 16 Grammy nominations (with six wins), and a Producer of the Year Grammy award for 2006'sStadium Arcadium, which was also nominated for Album of the Year. The band has sold over 80 million albums worldwide, most of which are the Rubin-produced albums. Various members of the Chili Peppers have also been used on other projects by Rubin, John Frusciante featured on Johnny Cash and Chad Smith featured on the Chicks. After 24 years of working with Rubin, the band announced in late 2014 that it would be working withDanger Mouseon its 11th studio album. Rubin returned to the role of producer for the band's two albums released in 2022, seven months apart from one another:Unlimited LoveandReturn of the Dream Canteen. Again these two albums both featured no.1 singles on the Alternative Songs chart.
Rubin also producedMick Jagger's 1993Wandering Spiritalbum,Lords of Acid's 1994Voodoo-Ualbum,Tom Petty's 1994Wildflowers,AC/DC's 1995Ballbreaker,Donovan's 1996Sutras,System of a Down's 1998System of a Down, andMetallica's 2008Death Magnetic.

Rubin left Columbia in 2012, and revived the American Recordings imprint through a deal withRepublic Records. The first albums released under this new deal wereZZ Top'sLa Futuraandthe Avett Brothers'The Carpenter.[25]
Rubin attempted to record acover albumwithCrosby, Stills & Nashin 2012, but the brief sessions were unsuccessful.Graham Nashcalled the sessions "irritable" and "not a great experience".[26]
In July 2021, Rubin signed withEndeavor Contentto further develop his home studio, Shangri-La Recording Studios.[27]
Rubin has a chapter giving advice inTim Ferriss's bookTools of Titans, and often gives advice on creativity via hisInstagrampage.[28]
Rubin's debut book, published on January 17, 2023, byPenguin Press, isThe Creative Act: A Way of Being. It is a nonfiction work about creativity. He said, "I set out to write a book about what to do to make a great work of art. Instead, it revealed itself to be a book on how to be."[29][30]
In 2023, he started hosting apodcasttitled "Tetragrammaton" onApple Podcasts, which mainly featuredinterviews.[31]
Rubin's biggest trademark as a producer has been a "stripped-down" sound, which involves eliminating production elements such asstring sections, backup vocals, andreverb, and instead having naked vocals and bare instrumentation. But by the 2000s, Rubin's style[32]included such elements, as noted inThe Washington Post: "As the track reaches a crescendo and [Neil] Diamond's portentous baritone soars over a swelling string arrangement, Rubin leans back, as though floored by the emotional power of the song."[33]
Of Rubin's production methods,Dan Charnas, a music journalist who worked as vice president of A&R (Artists & Repertoire) and marketing at American Recordings in the 1990s, said, "He's fantastic with sound and arrangements, and he's tremendous with artists. They love him. He shows them how to make it better, and he gets more honest and exciting performances out of people than anyone."[33]Natalie Mainesofthe Chickshas praised his production methods, saying, "He has the ability and the patience to let music be discovered, not manufactured. Come to think of it, maybe he is a guru."[34]ProducerDr. Drehas said that Rubin is "hands down, the dopest producer ever that anyone would ever want to be, ever".[35]
Despite having never worked with Rubin,[36]British bandMusepraised him for his "hands off" approach to production and credited him as an influence on its first self-produced album,The Resistance.[36]The album's lead single, "Uprising", was named UK Single of the Year at the 2010Music Producers Guild Awards, and Muse frontmanMatt Bellamywhile accepting the award said, "I'd like to thankJohn Leckiefor teaching us how to produce and Rick Rubin for teaching us how not to produce."[37]The statement was initially interpreted as a criticism of Rubin,[38]but Bellamy later clarified it was meant as a self-deprecating comment on the band's similarly "hands-off" attitude to production.[36]
In 2014,SlipknotfrontmanCorey Taylorsaid that he met Rubin only four times during the entire recording process ofVol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses): "We were being charged horrendous amounts of money. And for me, if you're going to produce something, you're fucking there. I don't care who you are! [...] The Rick Rubin of today is a shadow of the Rick Rubin that he was. He is overrated, he is overpaid, and I will never work with him again."[39][40]Taylor expressed regret for those comments in 2016, and said he wanted to make amends with Rubin, attributing the friction to being "freshly sober [...] unsure of [himself]" and to never having previously worked with anyone whose methods were like Rubin's.[41]
In 2019, when comparing Rubin toGreg Fidelman(who had recently produced Slipknot's albumWe Are Not Your Kind), Taylor again criticized Rubin for his absences from the studio due to other work commitments. He said that Rubin was "a nice guy, absolutely nice guy" but claimed that "he just wasn't fucking there" and that the band did not see him more than once a week until they finished recording the vocals at his house.[42]
In 2022, Black Sabbath bassistGeezer Butlersaid of Rubin's production of the band's 2013 album13: "Some of it I liked, some of it I didn't like particularly. It was a weird experience, especially with being told to forget that you're a heavy metal band. That was the first thing [Rubin] said to us. He played us ourvery first album, and he said, 'Cast your mind back to then when there was no such thing as heavy metal or anything like that, and pretend it's the follow-up album to that,' which is a ridiculous thing to think."[43][44]Butler also stated that vocalistOzzy Osbourneand guitaristTony Iommihad frustrations with Rubin's suggestions, and said: "I still don't know what [Rubin] did. It's, like, 'Yeah, that's good.' 'No, don't do that.' And you go, 'Why?' [And he'd say], 'Just don't do it.'"[43][44]
Since at least 1999, listeners have criticized Rubin for contributing to a phenomenon in music known as theloudness war, in which thedynamic rangeof recorded music iscompressedand sometimesclippedin order to increase the general loudness. Albums Rubin produced that have been criticized for such treatment include:
Rubin has practicedmeditationsince he was 14 years old.[53]
Rubin began dating former actress and model Mourielle Hurtado Herrera in 2010, and they were married at an unknown[to whom?]date.[54]They have a son born in 2017 and reside inMalibu, California.[55]
Rubin was aveganfor over 20 years, but later began eating meat again.[56]He is a fan ofprofessional wrestlingand held season tickets toWWEevents atMadison Square Gardenthroughout the 1970s and 1980s. He has cited wrestlersRoddy PiperandRic Flairas influences on his work, and has said thatvillainous wrestlerswere hugely influential in the development of theBeastie Boys' public image. He financially backed wrestling promoterJim Cornette's companySmoky Mountain Wrestlingfrom 1991 to 1995.[57]

Thomas is influenced by '80s icons as well as 2010s rappers and R&B singers such asThe Smiths,Rick James,Future,Frank Ocean,Lil JonandPrince; as he toldPigeons & Planes, “What those artists are to me is a point of reference.”[5]
Thomas' music pulls influences from a variety of genres.Dazedhas described Thomas as, "...a delightfully weird, genre-defying enigma who, without breaking a sweat, combines hip-hop, autotune, radio pop, country music, trap beats, emo-punk, acoustic arpeggios and whatever else is in his brain into infectious, digestible three-minute earworms."[23]Thomas is now known for his prolific features, commonly greatly boosting the popularity of a track.[24]
About his musical style, Thomas said, “I’m never chasing a sound because that would just be satire. Rather than trying to copy a sound, I look at what all this music represents: Why is rock tearing through these stadiums; how is rap tearing up the club; how is pop tearing up the charts? I’m still figuring all that out, but the energy of rock is always going to be in my music; it might not be guitar-led, but the intensity and urgency of rock will be there.”[4]
In an Apple Music interview withZane Lowe, Thomas described his style as a fusion ofrock,R&BandBoom bapproduction he designated as "Rock & Boom", a derivativesub-genreof all three. "...the sound that I'm crafting that's called Rock & Boom. It's R&B with the intensity of rock, it has R&B toplines. The boom of course for boom bap, it's the boom bap penmanship. It's also the boom because the808sis gonna shake the world."[25]
Thomas directs all of his own videos, which are usually accompanied by promotional comedy skits and expansive promo campaigns, such as "Rid The Mid".[12]He films most of his music videos and skits in front of agraffiti-covered garage in his home of Beaumont, Texas.[5][7]The garage is continuously transformed based on the theming of the video; as Complex wrote, "In 'Rooting For You,' it’s the backdrop for a boyband of sports mascots. Meanwhile in 'Bad Enough', the garage is transformed into a football field complete with astroturf, bleachers, and a cheer squad."[5]Pitchforkwrote, "Teezo has stirred more social media chatter for the six inch nails stuck in his hair, or the black mesh tops and leather pants that make him look like he’s in a parody of an ’80s hair metal video, than he has for any song."[7]
Our Generation Music wrote that Thomas' image consists of, "nails in his hair, chain-linked necklaces, and eye-black fit for the football field".[26]His managerial alter-ego, named Eugenius Hanes, wears a ginger wig and a cowboy hat.[27]He is involved in high fashion, having previously modeled forMarc Jacobs,Balenciaga, Alyx,Moncler, and Telfar.[13][14][17]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
