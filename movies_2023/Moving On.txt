Moving Onis a 2022 Americancomedy filmwritten and directed byPaul Weitz.[3]The film starsJane Fonda,Lily Tomlin,Malcolm McDowell,Sarah Burns, andRichard Roundtree.
The film premiered at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 13, 2022.[4]
Claire and Evelyn, estranged former friends, reconnect at the funeral of a mutual friend, and decide to exact revenge on their dead friend's widower for the harm he caused to Claire decades earlier.
Roadside Attractionsacquired North American rights to the film, which was released on March 17, 2023.[5]This was Richard Roundtree's final film to be released before his death in October 2023.[6]
Claire leaves her beloved corgie with her daughter and grandchildren so she can travel across the country to attend the funeral of her old college friend Joyce. Before the funeral service, Claire approaches Joyce's widower Howard, and bluntly informs him that she intends to kill him this weekend.
Directly after the service, Claire reconnects with Evelyn, who had been Joyce's college roommate and lover. It is revealed that Howard had wronged Claire decades ago, although the nature of the wrong isn't yet specified. She insists she is going to kill him, now that their friend is gone.
After the two friends are unsuccessful at buying a gun, Evelyn initially refuses to help Claire with her plan to kill him at the wake. Instead, she heads to her assisted living facility.
Meanwhile, at the wake Claire reconnects with her ex-husband Ralph, whom she has not seen in years. Evelyn shows up, outs Joyce upon revealing their two and a half year relationship in NYC between junior year and beyond, so she and Claire leave together.
That evening, Ralph invites Claire to his home for dinner, where she meets his daughter and two grandsons. Afterwards, over drinks, he asks her why she left him, and she cannot bring herself to articulate the reason. Still, they have a romantic evening together and make love. But Claire slips out early in the morning with freshly cooked bacon upon Evelyn's request.
As Evelyn changed her mind about helping to kill Howard, she convinces another resident to loan them his gun by bribing him with the bacon. The gun they want to use to kill Howard turns out to be a flare gun, but she insists it will be lethal at close range.
Under the guise of meeting to apologise, Claire confronts Howard about the assault in a tense scene, insisting that he admit to raping her forty-six years previously, while pointing a flare gun—the only kind of gun they've been able to acquire—at him. However, he collapses from what Claire assumes is a heart attack before she can pull the trigger. Instead, she uses the flare gun to signal that he needs medical help.
In the hospital, it is revealed that Howard actually had a non-life-threatening anxiety attack. Claire goes into his room and describes the assault in detail, but he continues to deny it. So she tries to smother Howard to death with a pillow, but is stopped by Evelyn.
In the end, during a final confrontation between Claire, Evelyn, and Howard in the parking garage at the hospital, Howard fires a shower of expletives at the women. Then he accidentally turns into the path of another driver and dies.
After Howard's funeral, Claire reconnects again with Ralph, as she is now ready to have a potentially ongoing romance with him again.

Tomlin characters
In 1969, after a stint as a hostess on theABCseriesMusic Scene,[13]Tomlin joined NBC'ssketch comedyshowRowan and Martin's Laugh-In.  Signed as a replacement for the departingJudy Carne, Tomlin was an instant success on the already established program, in which in addition to appearing in general sketches and delivering comic gags, she began appearing as the regular characters she created; they became well known and she portrayed them outside of the show in later recordings and television specials:
Tomlin was one of the first female comedians to break out in male drag with her characters Tommy Velour and Rick. In 1982, but later popularized by aSaturday Night Liveappearance on January 22, 1983, she premieredPurvis Hawkins, a black rhythm-and-blues soul singer (patterned afterLuther Vandross), with a mustache, beard, and close-croppedafrohairstyle, dressed in a three-piece suit. Tomlin used very little, if any, skin-darkening cosmetics as part of the character, instead depending on stage lighting to create the effect.
In 1970,AT&Toffered Tomlin $500,000 to play her character Ernestine in a commercial, but she declined, saying it would compromise her artistic integrity.[15][16]In 1976, she appeared onSaturday Night Live[17]as Ernestine in aMa Belladvertisement parody in which she proclaimed, "We don't care, we don't have to...we're the phone company." The character later made a guest appearance atThe Superhighway SummitatUCLAon January 11, 1994, interrupting a speech being given on theinformation superhighwayby then-Vice PresidentAl Gore. She appeared as three of her minor characters in a 1998 ad campaign forFidelity Investmentsthat did not include Ernestine or Edith Ann.[16]In 2003, she made two commercials as an "updated" Ernestine forWebEx.[18]Tomlin brought Edith Ann to the forefront again in the 1990s with three animated prime-time television specials. She published Edith Ann's "autobiography",My Life(1995), co-written withJane Wagner.
Tomlin released her first comedy album,This Is A Recording, onPolydor Recordsin March 1971 that contained Ernestine's run-ins with customers over the phone. The album hit No. 15 on theBillboardHot 200, becoming (and remaining as of 2011[update]) the highest-charting album ever by a solo comedienne.[19]She earned aGrammyaward that year forBest Comedy Recording. Tomlin's second album, 1972'sAnd That's The Truth, featuring her character Edith Ann, was nearly as successful, peaking at No. 41 on the chart and earning another Grammy nomination.

She received a Special Tony Award for this production.[21]The same month, she made the cover ofTimewith the headline "America's New Queen of Comedy".

When theMiami New Timesasked Tomlin about the videos, she responded, "I love David. There was a lot of pressure in making the movie—even the way it came out you could see it was a very free-associative, crazy movie, and David was under a tremendous amount of pressure. And he's a very free-form kind of guy anyway."[22]
Tomlin collaborated again with director Robert Altman in what would prove to be his last film,A Prairie Home Companion(2006).

I certainly never called a press conference or anything like that. [Back in the 1970s,] people didn't write about it. Even if they knew, they would [refer to Jane as] "Lily's collaborator", things like that. Some journalists are just motivated by their own sense of what they want to say or what they feel comfortable saying or writing about. In '77, I was on the cover ofTime. The same week I had a big story inNewsweek. In one of the magazines it says I live alone, and the other magazine said I live with Jane Wagner. Unless you were so really adamantly out, and had made some declaration at some press conference, people back then didn't write about your relationship. In '75 I was making theModern Screamalbum and Jane and I were in the studio. My publicist called me and said, "Timewill give you the cover if you'll come out." I was more offended than anything that they thought we'd make a deal. But that was '75—it would have been a hard thing to do at that time.[32]
Tomlin stated in 2008, "Everybody in the industry was certainly aware of my sexuality and of Jane ... in interviews, I always reference Jane and talk about Jane, but they don't always write about it."[33]In 2015, Tomlin said, "I wasn't totally forthcoming. Everybody in the business knew I was gay, and certainly everybody I worked with and everything like that." Tomlin has been generally quiet about her sexuality.[34]On December 31, 2013, Tomlin and Wagner married in a private ceremony in Los Angeles after 42 years together.[35][36]
Tomlin has been involved in a number offeministand gay-friendly film productions, and on her 1975 albumModern Screamshe pokes fun atstraightactors who make a point of distancing themselves from their gay and lesbian characters—answering the pseudo-interview question, she replies: "How did it feel to play a heterosexual? I've seen these women all my life, I know how they walk, I know how they talk ..."[10]In 2013, Tomlin and Wagner worked together on the filmAn Apology to Elephants, which Wagner wrote and Tomlin narrated.[37]
Tomlin has receivednumerous accoladesthroughout her career,[38][39]including sevenEmmy Awards, twoTony Awardsand aGrammy Award, in addition to a nomination for anAcademy Award.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
