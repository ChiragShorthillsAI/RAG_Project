Smith. It starsHaley Lu Richardson,Ben Hardy,Dexter Fletcher,Rob Delaney,Sally PhillipsandJameela Jamil. The film premiered onNetflixon September 15, 2023.
On December 21st atJFK Airport, the narrator introduces 20-year old Hadley Sullivan. An American student who is often late with an undercharged phone, Hadley just misses her flight to London and is rebooked on the next.
At a charging station, Hadley meets British 22-year oldYalestudent Oliver Jones, who lends her his charger. They hit it off and agree to have dinner together at the food court. Hadley explains she is flying to London for her dad Andrew's second wedding and is ambivalent about his decision to remarry only a few years after divorcing her mother. Oliver reveals he is studyingstatistical inferenceand conducting a unspecified research project. As he is carrying a garment bag, Hadley assumes he is also going to a wedding, which he does not contest.
After boarding, Hadley and Oliver part, but he discovers his seat belt is broken, so is moved to the seat next to Hadley. They spend the flight falling in love.
After landing, Oliver puts his mobile number into Hadley's so she can contact him, but it dies and she loses the number. With no way to find him, Hadley goes to the wedding, arriving right before it's due to start. Although struggling with her father's decision to remarry, Hadley is struck by his fiancée Charlotte's kindness and consideration.
After the ceremony, Hadley overhears family friends telling Charlotte they’ll be leaving early to attend a memorial service. After hearing some of the details, Hadley quickly realizes Oliver has actually come to London to attend his mother’s memorial, not a wedding. Hadley spontaneously decides to go to it, as the wedding reception doesn't start for four hours.
Meanwhile, Oliver's brother Luther collects him at the airport to head to the Shakespeare-themed memorial. There, he reunites with his father Val, and his still-living mother Tessa, who has terminal lung cancer and wants to attend her own memorial. Oliver tells her he is unhappy she refuses to undergo treatment, but Tessa emphasises that even with treatment she would still die, so would rather do so feeling like herself.
Hadley finds the memorial service where she meets Oliver's family. After overcoming her initial confusion over Tessa still being alive, she eventually finds Oliver.
Oliver is happy to see Hadley, and tries to downplay his feelings about his mother's death. When she presses him to be honest and not use statistics to rationalise the situation, Oliver lashes out. Hadley leaves.
Afterwards, Oliver delivers Tessa's eulogy. In it, he confesses that he has attempted to measure his life in numbers to help make sense of it. However, he cannot reduce his mother’s presence and meaning to simple statistics.
Hadley, meanwhile, realises she forgot her backpack at the memorial and attempts to return to the wedding reception on foot, but gets lost. She borrows a phone and calls her dad, who collects her with Charlotte.
Andrew commends Hadley for taking a chance and going to see Oliver, and provides her with closure over her feelings about his divorce from her mother. He and Charlotte both apologise that their excitement to involve Hadley in their wedding unintentionally put pressure on her. Father and daughter reconcile and they all go to the reception together.
Following the memorial, Oliver's family teases him about Hadley, but Oliver insists it's futile to pursue her as the odds of their relationship working out are low. Having found Hadley's backpack, they find Andrew's wedding invitation inside and encourage Oliver to go see her. Val tells him that even if he had known that Tessa would eventually die of cancer, he wouldn't have done anything differently, and the family sets out to find Hadley.
Oliver tracks Hadley down at the reception and admits his three greatest fears: germs, the dark, and surprises, due to his mother's cancer diagnosis. She then kisses him. When Hadley asks Oliver what he's researching, he reveals it's the statistical probability of love at first sight.
The narrator then reveals that Hadley and Oliver will stay together for the rest of their lives, be married for 58 years, and have a daughter.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
