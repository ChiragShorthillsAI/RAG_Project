The Venture Bros.: Radiant Is the Blood of the Baboon Heartis a 2023 Americandirect-to-videoadult animatedscience fictionaction adventurefilm based on theAdult Swimanimated seriesThe Venture Bros., where it serves as the series finale. The film is directed and co-written by the series creatorJackson Publickand writerDoc Hammer, who serve as the film's executive producers and features the voices of the show's returning principal cast,James Urbaniak,Patrick Warburton,Michael Sinterniklaas, Publick and Hammer. The film centers on a nationwide manhunt for Hank Venture, which leads to a coming darkness from the past that involves the Venture Family, the Guild, and the Monarch.
Originally envisioned as a potential eighth season of the series, the film is the second of Adult Swim's line of direct-to-video movies afterAqua Teen Forever: Plantasm, and was released byWarner Bros. Home Entertainmenton digital on July 21, 2023, andBlu-rayon July 25, 2023, followed by its availability onMax(known during the film's production as HBO Max) 90 days later.[1][2][3][4]
Three days afterHank's disappearance, the O.S.I. is distracted with a low-level Guild villain attacking one of their labs with powerful technology supplied by the mysterious new villain organization ARCH.Dr. Mrs. The MonarchandRed Deathare assigned by the Council of Thirteen to investigate.The Monarch, after his Guild initiation reveals via DNA test that they are seemingly related, is forbidden from attackingDr. Ventureuntil their relationship is confirmed. Meanwhile, Dr. Venture struggles with perfecting VenTech's newest invention, the "HelperPod"virtual assistant, due to a bug that makes it levitate while playing music.
Driven by guilt over sleeping with Hank's girlfriend,Deangoes toOrpheusfor help, and they set off, withJefferson, to find him. Acting on advice from his imaginings of various characters he enjoys playing (The Detective, The Bat, Russian Guyovich, and Enrico Matassa), Hank makes his way back to his old family home at the Venture compound in an attempt to rediscover himself. The Monarch is approached by his ex-girlfriend and ARCH's invisible leader Mantilla, who promises to let him arch Dr. Venture again if he joins them. Upon his arrival at the abandoned Venture compound, Hank encounters his old friend and O.S.I. cadet Dermott, who reveals he found a picture of "Bobbi St. Simone" signed to Dr. Venture amongst his collection of stolen Venture memorabilia.
During a detour, Jefferson is attacked by blaculas inChicago, where Dean is seemingly bitten by one and tries to hide it. Dr. Mrs. The Monarch is framed as ARCH's leader and blacklisted by the Guild, but Red Death helps her escape. The Monarch and21are abandoned by ARCH upon breaking in to VenTech Tower, while Mantilla uses 21's phone to hack into the HelperPods and use their levitating bug to uproot the tower, sending them into orbit. Hank arrives at Bobbi's animal sanctuary, who explains that she had a brief tryst with Jonas after he gave her invisibility powers for a movie. She was later recruited by the O.S.I. as a Guild mole, but fell in love with the Guild's leader Force Majeure and had a daughter, Mantilla. The two were later forced to flee and went into hiding after The Sovereign killed Majeure for Guild leadership. Hank, overwhelmed by his head injury, falls back intopurgatory.
BillyandPeteadvise Rusty to individually destroy the HelperPods to slowly lower the tower back to earth. He,Hatred, The Monarch, and 21 are nearly killed by their gravitational field when they try, forcing them to hide in the air ducts. Dr. Mrs. The Monarch breaks into Mantilla's apartment, where she is waiting for her and explains that she wants to run ARCH with her out of admiration. She mentions that Dr. Venture had transferred her mother's invisibility to her in exchange for hereggs(implying that she is technically Hank and Dean's biological mother) and that she is the rightful heir to the Guild. She turns off the HelperPods in exchange for Guild immunity, causing the tower to start falling at a lethal speed. Orpheus comes to purgatory to rescue Hank, who is moved by the fact that Dean is the one who led his rescue.
Dean accidentally transports himself to purgatory and is attacked by the physical manifestations of Hank's characters. Orpheus pulls them both out and Hank finally forgives his brother. Hatred discovers the Ventronic mech inside the tower as they reenter the atmosphere, and the team devises a plan to slow the building's descent. They manage to marginally slow the tower using Ventronic, though The Monarch accidentally ejects his part of the robot in the process. Aided by Hunter Gathers and the O.S.I.'s mothership, Ventronic safely lowers the tower into the ruins of the compound, while The Monarch is impaled by the fallen statue of Jonas after leaving the arm. Dean nervously reveals his bite to Jefferson, who explains that he merely injured himself on Jefferson's tooth necklace when he tackled Dean to safety.
Ben arrives on the scene and saves The Monarch's life by using Dr. Venture's blood for atransfusion, and Ben reveals that they are not related: Monarch—-like Doctor Venture—-is a clone of the original Rusty Venture, infused with minor traces of baboon DNA (to combat premature baldness) which caused his extreme aggression. Monarch was adopted by the Fitzcarraldo family as they could not have children of their own. Ben gives Hank a customGMT Master, given to him by Jonas before Dr. Venture was born. Ben makes note of the engraving on the back, Elige Tua (choose your family), telling Hank that "blood doesn't make a family, love does", while Dr. Venture promises Dean whoever "gave birth to him" loves him very much. A weakened but impassioned Monarch declares his determination to hate Dr. Venture and leaves in triumph. In a post-credits scene, in aflashback montage, a young Dr. Venture reveals Hank and Dean to H.E.L.P.eR., who are growing in an artificialwombattached to his chest.
After the conclusion of the seventh season in October 2018, the series was announced to be renewed for an eighth season.[5][6]On September 5, 2020, one of the show's illustrators, Ken Plume, tweeted thatThe Venture Bros.was cancelled.[7][6]Jackson Publick confirmed two days later that the show was cancelled. The script for Season 8 had been partially written at the time of its cancellation a few months before the public announcement.[8][9]
Following the announcement,Adult Swimstated viaTwitterthat "We also want moreVenture Bros.and have been working with Jackson and Doc to find another way to continue theVenture Bros.story".[10][9]On November 13, 2020,HBO Maxgeneral manager Andy Forssell tweeted that HBO Max was "working on" revivingThe Venture Bros.[11]On May 12, 2021, it was announced that adirect-to-videofilm was greenlit for production from Adult Swim, which will conclude the story from the series, and air on HBO Max 90 days after its home video release.[1][3]In April 2023, it was announced that HBO Max would re-launch as Max on May 23 that year.[12][13]
Production for the film was finished in March 2023.[14]
Radiant Is the Blood of the Baboon Heartwas made available on digital platforms July 21, 2023 and released on Blu-ray on July 25.
The film received highly positive reviews from critics and audiences. On review aggregator websiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 92% approval rating based on reviews from 12 critics, with an average rating of 7.8/10.[15]Nick Valdez ofComicBook.comsaid that the film was an "emotional finale" to the series, stating that "It's the kind of ending that leaves you wanting more. Not because the film itself was lacking, but because it leaves you with such a warm feeling that you don't want it to ever end. And for those who've watchedThe Venture Bros.for all this time, it'll likely hit a hundred times harder."[16]Danielle Dowling, writing forThe New York Times, also said that the film ended on a high note and said that "If we were never to see the Ventures again,Radiantlets us part with them on a high note, but hopefully this end is just the beginning."[17]

The company was founded in 1978 and launched in the United States with twenty films onBetamaxandVHSvideocassettes in late 1979. The company later expanded its line to include additional titles throughout 1979 and 1980.
Warner Bros. began to branch out into the videodisc market, licensing titles to MCADiscoVisionand RCA'sSelectaVisionvideodiscformats, allowing both companies to market and distribute the films under their labels.[4][5]By 1985, Warner was releasing material under their own label in both formats. Titles from Warner Home Video were and continue to be distributed and manufactured byRoadshow Home Videoworldwide except for Australia and New Zealand because of its film counterpart's films released byVillage Roadshow.[6]
Warner also experimented with the "rental-only" market for videos, a method also used by20th Century Foxfor their first release ofStar Warsin 1982. Two known films released in this manner wereSuperman IIandExcalibur. Other films released for rental use includeDirty Harry,The Enforcer,Prince of the City, andSharky's Machine. In 1990, Warner Home Video acquired the worldwide home video rights to theMGM/UAcatalog. The $125 million purchase was used to finance MGM/UA's acquisition by thePathé Communications Corporation.[7]The intended 12½-year-long deal was cut short in February 2000, with MGM paying Warner Home Video $225 million to regain video rights to a number of its films. In exchange, Warner Home Video gained full control over the video rights to MGM's pre-May 1986 library, an asset the studio had acquired outright fromTurner Entertainment Co., but due to a pre-existing licensing deal with MGM, was originally expected to expire in 2001.[8]
On December 20, 1996, Warner Home Video was one of the first major American distributors for the then-newDVDformat, by releasing the filmsAssassins,Blade Runner: Director's Cut,Eraser, andThe Fugitiveon DVD in Japan and on March 24, 1997, in the United States withBlade Runneralso being a launch title for the region there.[9]Warner Bros. executiveWarren Lieberfarbis often seen as "the father of DVD". Lieberfarb's successor, Warner Bros. executiveJames F. Cardwellwas recognized in paving the way for WHV's strategic positioning in next generation technologies such as High Definition DVD (HD DVD), electronic sell-through and portable video. In 2003, Warner Home Video became the first home video releasing company to release movies only on DVD with no VHS equivalent.
In 2009, Warner Home Video introduced theWarner Archive Collection, which allows the public to order custom-made DVDs of rarely seen films and TV series from the Warner and Turner libraries. The films are also available as digital downloads. Warner Archive DVDs and downloads can be ordered online on Warner's website, onAmazon.comor one-timeTurner Classic Movies-affiliated DVD website MoviesUnlimited.com.[10]
On June 30, 2020, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment regained the home video rights to theMGMcatalog after 21 years.
Starting in 2022, due to the finalization of the Warner Bros. Discovery merger, WBHE started distributing the television libraries of Discovery-owned networks including the flagshipDiscovery ChannelandAnimal Planet.
On January 14, 2020, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment andUniversal Pictures Home Entertainmentannounced that they would partner on a 10-year multinational joint-venture. In North America, their physical distribution operations were merged into a company named Studio Distribution Services, LLC.[11]Internationally, Universal will distribute Warner Bros.' titles in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan; while Warner will distribute Universal's titles in the United Kingdom (until 2025), Italy (until 2024) and Benelux.[12]On April 7, 2020, the European Commission approved the merger.[13]Since June 1, 2021,[14][15][16]SDS' logo took the WBHE logo's place on the back covers of the home releases; while there have been several exceptions that had the WBHE logo in place, mainlymanufactured on demandtitles including4K[17][18](also steelbooks)[19][20][21][22][23][24][25]andBlu-rayreleases.[26][27][28][29][30]It is unknown whenever SDS uses an on-screen logo; as Warner releases by SDS use the 2017–present Warner Bros. Home Entertainment logo.
On June 24, 2024, it was reported thatSony Pictures Home Entertainmenthad entered into a distribution deal with SDS to handle the physical distribution of titles fromSony Pictures(Columbia Pictures,TriStar Pictures,Screen Gems,Crunchyroll, LLC, etc.) as well as those fromWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment(Walt Disney Pictures,Marvel Studios,Lucasfilm Ltd.,20th Century Studios,Searchlight Pictures, etc.),Lionsgate Home Entertainment(Lionsgate Films,Summit Entertainment,eOne Films,Roadside Attractions, etc.) andThe Criterion Collectionthrough their existing distribution deals with SPHE.[31]

Williams Street Productions, LLC,[1](formerly known asGhost Planet Industries) is an American animation and live action television production studio owned by theWarner Bros. Television Studiosdivision ofWarner Bros., a unit ofWarner Bros. Discovery. The studio is the in-house production arm ofAdult Swim(theprogramming blockonCartoon Network).Mike LazzoandKeith Croffordoversaw operations for the building for most of its existence.
On December 16, 2019, co-founder Lazzo retired from the company,[2]with business partner and co-founder Crofford retiring the following year.[3]Michael Ouweleenwas named president of Adult Swim on April 29, 2020.[4]
From November 27, 2019 to July 1, 2020 and since May 13, 2022, Ouweleen was named president ofThe Cartoon Network, Inc., which also overseesAdult Swim.[5]
In 1976,Ted Turnerbought the building and used it for his own television station, WTCG. This new channel was the result of a recent UHF takeover. In December 1976, the first WTCG signal was beamed via satellite to its four cable systems located aroundGeorgia. This broadcast was the first use of non-pay-service satellite transmission, an innovation that would come to revolutionize basic cable nationwide.
Starting out as a minor local channel, the station grew into success and was re-launched as WTBS in 1979. Then, after a five-year period, WTBS was renamedTBS Superstation. During this time, Turner also createdCNN, a 24-hour news network. Both became the standard for cable providers by the late 80s. Due to this success, the studio building became too small to operate as a headquarters. A new campus was built across the street for the expanding Turner empire. Upon completion, Turner launchedCartoon Networkto showcase their recent acquisitions of the vastMGMandHanna-Barberalibrary of cartoons.
When Turner moved out of the Williams Street building, they kept ownership, using it as a storage facility. Although no longer its main purpose, to this day, Williams Street houses all the show tapes for Turner Networks. Appointed to run the building were veteran Turner employees such asKeith Crofford,Andy Merrill, and former mail-room employeeMike Lazzo. Although Cartoon Network was run at Hanna-Barbera Studios at the time, certain duties were eventually controlled by the trio at Williams Street. One of their most important early tasks was producing host segments forThe Moxy Pirate Show(laterThe Moxy Show).
From 1990 to 1993, TBS had started its own original programming such asCaptain Planetand2 Stupid Dogs. This interested the team at Williams Street, and they all wished to create their own series. Towards the end of '93, the three mustered up courage to approach Ted Turner with their ideas for Cartoon Network original programming. It didn't go as planned and they were eventually kicked out of Ted's office. According to Lazzo, they were clearly told that unless CN started making more money for Turner, they wouldn't be allowed funding or a chance. They didn't listen.
They decided to produce their own series pilot. On a shoestring budget, they tried to come up with compatible ideas. During brainstorming, they realized they could simply re-use footage of any animation in the Turner library. They eventually settled onSpace Ghost and Dino Boy. Because they felt it would fit, they paired it with Mike Lazzo's idea of a satirical talk show with a clueless host asking guests a stream of stupid questions. The final pilot featured rotoscoped animation superimposed on a simple background and used CNN interview footage for the live-action interview.
They went back to Turner and presented the pilot, andSpace Ghost Coast to Coastwas then greenlit for a ten-episode season. Work began, and the minor CN production/storage facility became its own studio, named afterCoast to Coast's own in-show one: Ghost Planet Industries. Soon the series was acquiring its first C and D-list celebrity guests, small animation and writing crew, and voice actors. The voice actor forSpace Ghostwas local voice actorGeorge Lowe; all other roles were done by the GPI crew. The series eventually premiered on April 14, 1994. This marked Cartoon Network's first original series and the first animated talk show in history.
Due to its more mature surreal humor, the series attracted a devoted cult audience. Its success led to a special that was simulcast on TBS, a special short for VHS release of blockbusterThe Mask, and much more famous guests. In the height of popularity, it was awarded its own spin-off. Turner commissioned GPI to produce some sort of lighter version for TBS, due to a need for children's programming.Cartoon Planetpremiered on TBS in 1995 and later moved to Cartoon Network in 1996. The series featured Space Ghost hosting segments and cartoons for young viewers. After two seasons, TBS decided to cancel all kids' programming, following the trend ofTNTandUSA.
The current name of the company originates from the location of its headquarters building (which is also the home office forCartoon NetworkandAdult Swim) at 1065 Williams Street NW inAtlanta,Georgianear the current offices ofTBSandTNTon Techwood Drive.[6]The facility began as a carpet factory and was purchased by Turner as overflow offices for, among other things, set building and woodworking facilities, as well as CNN Field Engineering. Soon after CNN moved into theCNN Centerin downtown Atlanta in the early 1980s, other Turner operations moved into the Techwood campus, an old country club which became the first headquarters forCNN.[6]The street is named for early Atlanta settlerAmmi Williams.
The company's original name, Ghost Planet Industries, came fromSpace Ghost's fictional planet, where the animatedtalk showSpace Ghost Coast to Coastwas purportedly filmed.[7]
The studio'sproduction logofeatures a wavy, blurred gray image of Space Ghost's fictional studio, with the words "Williams Street" beneath it. The soundtrack ofJack Webb'sMark VII Limited's production logo (a rumbling drum roll and two clinks of ahammer) is often used while the GPI/Williams Street production card is shown.[8]
This list is only for video games licensed by Williams Street Games; seeAdult Swim Gamesfor other video games produced after the label's dissolution.
Williams Street formed their own music label,Williams Street Records. The label was created after Jason DeMarco, Adult Swim's vice president of strategic marketing and promotions, worked onDanger Doom, a project withDanger MouseandMF Doomin 2005. Danger Mouse had previously worked on the music forToonamiand wanted to do an album that sampled that work. The group suggested the idea to Mike Lazzo; the project was successful. Williams Street Records now releases a majority of the music related to their shows. The label is managed by DeMarco.[38]
1065, the street number for Williams Street, is also the hull number forFishCenter Live's USSFishCenterprise(a parody of theoriginalStar Trek'sUSSEnterprise).[39]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
