It starsJustin H. Min,Sherry Cola,Ally Maki,Tavi Gevinson,Debby Ryan,Sonoya Mizuno,Jacob Batalon, andTimothy Simons. The plot followsSan Francisco Bay Arearesidents Ben, Miko, and Alice as they search for their niches and eventually find themselves inNew York City, where they discover their future paths.
The film had its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 21, 2023, and was released theatrically in the United States on August 4, 2023, bySony Pictures Classics. It generally received positive reception from critics.
Ben Tagawa is an aspiring filmmaker and film school dropout. He lives inBerkeleywith his girlfriend Miko, who works for an Asian American film festival, though he is dismissive of Miko's passion for politics and theAsian Americancommunity.
At his day job managing anarthousemovie theater, Ben hires Autumn, a young white woman, as a ticket seller. Miko confronts him at their apartment about pornography she found on his computer, which confirms her suspicions that he has asexual preferencefor white women. Ben denies this and tries to invalidate her concerns. While they appear to have resolved the fight, Miko reveals that she has accepted an internship in New York City.
Ben meets with his best friend Alice, a "womanizing" lesbian, at a diner to talk over the news. Alice flirts with Nina, one of the waitresses. When Ben calls Miko, now in New York, he acts dismissively towards her interests. Upset, she says that they should take a break from the relationship. In response, Ben asks Autumn on a date. However, when he makes a derogatory joke about Autumn's experimental art, she becomes upset and rebuffs his attempt to kiss her.
After his failed date with Autumn, Alice invites Ben to aqueerhouse party. Alice says that she is no longer seeing Nina, as Nina wanted to enter a serious relationship, and Alice is only interested incasual dating. At the party, Ben strikes up a conversation with Sasha, a grad student, and they begin dating. While Ben is excited about Sasha, Alice tells him that she has been suspended from her grad program for kicking Nina's roommate, who confronted her about her treatment of Nina. She announces that she has decided to travel to New York, upsetting Ben.
Sasha breaks up with Ben a few weeks later. Although she had told him she was single, she was actually on a break with her girlfriend, with whom she has decided to resume her relationship. At work, Ben announces that the movie theater is going out of business. Ben attempts to call Miko but receives no response, and also fails to make progress on a screenplay that he is working on. Alice invites him to New York, since he has hit "rock bottom".
There, Ben stays with Alice, who to his surprise is now in a serious relationship with Meredith, aBarnardprofessor. When he tries to surprise Miko at her internship, he learns that Miko has never worked there. Alice and Ben also discover that Miko has been modeling for Leon, a white fashion designer, who she has known since before her relationship break with Ben. Upon staking out Miko's address, Alice and Ben see Miko and Leon holding hands.
Ben rants to Meredith and Alice and assumes that Leon is anAsian fetishist. In response, Meredith asks him about his own racial preference for white women. Feeling defensive, Ben references Alice's physical altercation with Nina's roommate, causing a fight between Meredith and Alice.
Ben returns to Miko's address and confronts Miko and Leon in the street, accusing Leon of having sex with Miko during Miko and Ben's relationship. Leon lets them talk privately in the apartment, where Ben tells Miko that Leon is fetishizing her because of her race, based on Leon's professed interests inEast Asianculture. Miko calls out Ben's own hypocrisy for being angry she is dating someone else, as her friend saw Ben and Sasha on a date as well. Miko acknowledges she should have told him about Leon, but he needs to look into his own toxic behaviors and that their relationship is over.
Returning to Meredith's, Ben apologizes to her and Alice for causing their fight and announces that he is leaving the city earlier than planned. While he at first runs towards Miko and Leon's apartment, he sees the happy couple in a café together, so he relents and returns to Berkeley.

Comics artistChris Waresaid of the compilation: “As a serious cartoonist, one secretly hopes to create ‘That Book’: a book that can be passed to a literary-minded person who doesn’t normally read comics: one that doesn’t require any explanation or apology in advance and is developed enough in its attitude, humanity, and complexity that it speaks maturely for itself… Adrian Tomine‘sKilling and Dyingmay finally be That Book, and I’m amazed and heartened by it.”
Tomine has contributed to several rock bands‘ album packaging design, includingliner notesandalbum artforEels'Electro-Shock Blues, "Last Stop: This Town", "Cancer for the Cure", andEnd Times;Yo La Tengo's2006coversalbumsYo La Tengo Is Murdering the ClassicsandMurder in the Second Degree;The Softies'It's Love; andThe Crabs'What Were Flames Now Smolder.

Tavi Gevinson(born April 21, 1996) is an American actress, writer, and magazine editor. At age twelve, she came to public attention for her fashion blogStyle Rookie. By 15, she had shifted her focus to pop culture and feminist discussion. Gevinson began acting in 2013, and later starred in theHBO MaxseriesGossip Girl(2021–2023).
Gevinson was the founder and editor-in-chief of the online magazineRookie, aimed primarily at teenage girls.
Gevinson was born inChicago, Illinois, and raised in the suburban town ofOak Park, Illinois.[1]Her father, Steve Gevinson, is a high school English teacher.[2]Her mother, Berit Engen, is aweaverand part-timeHebrewinstructor who grew up inOslo, Norway.[3][4]Gevinson's father was born to an Orthodox Jewish family; her mother, who was raisedLutheran,convertedto Judaism in 2001.[5][6][7]Gevinson and her two older sisters, Rivkah and Miriam, were raised in the Jewish faith; she had aBat Mitzvahceremony.[4][7][8]Gevinson attendedOak Park and River Forest High Schooland graduated in 2014.[9]
Gevinson started a fashion blog, Style Rookie, in 2008. The blog, featuring photos of the 11-year-old in distinctive outfits and her commentary on the latest fashion trends, began drawing nearly 30,000 readers each day.[10]Her father "wasn't terribly interested" in her new hobby until she asked for his permission to be interviewed byThe New York Timesfor an article about young bloggers.[11]
Because of the blog's success, Gevinson was invited to attendNew York Fashion WeekandParis Fashion Week. She made overseas fashion-related trips to Tokyo and Antwerp, funded byPopmagazine,[4]and was commissioned to write articles forHarper's BazaarandBarneys. She styled a shoot forBlackBookmagazine,[4]acted as a muse and model forRodarte's clothing line atTargetstores,[4][12]and partnered with Borders&Frontiers to design and sell her own T-shirt.[13]In 2010, she spoke at a marketing conference in New York and at Idea City, a Canadian version of theTED conference.[4]

It's hard to imagine a kid being able to come back down to reality."[15]AGraziafashion editor complained on Twitter that a large bow Gevinson wore had blocked her view of a runway during fashion week.[4]Anne Slowey ofEllefelt her success was "gimmicky" and commented, "She's been thirteen for, like, the last four years."[4]Gevinson later remarked: "A lot of people on the Internet have a problem with a young person doing well. I felt like there were people who were [at fashion week] because of their name, their money or their family, and I didn't have any of those things."[16]
In early 2011, Gevinson decided to stop writing primarily about fashion: "Lately I've been looking to other places for a creative outlet and for inspiration ... Now I'm more intrigued by mixing fashion with the other stuff I've been enjoying."[17]Her personal style also became less outlandish: "Before, dressing up was my outlet, and now I'm pursuing other creative things that take up a lot of time and energy, so in the morning I usually want to put on something simple and comfortable."[18][19]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
