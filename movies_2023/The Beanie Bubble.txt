Apple TV+is an Americansubscriptionover-the-topstreaming serviceowned byApple. The service launched on November 1, 2019, and it offers a selection of original production film and television series calledApple Originals.[9]The service was announced during theApple Special Event of March 2019,[10][11]where entertainers from Apple TV+ projects appeared onstage, includingJennifer Aniston,Oprah Winfrey, andSteven Spielberg.[12][13]The service can be accessed through Apple's website and through theApple TV app, which has gradually become available on manyApple devicesand some major competingdigital media players,[14]including somesmart TVmodels and video-game consoles.
Apple plans to expand the services' availability,[15][16][17][18]and there are workarounds for subscribers whose device is not presently supported.[14]Access is included as part of theApple Onesubscription.[19]Most of the content is available inDolby Visionprofile 5 andDolby Atmos. Upon its debut, Apple TV+ was available in about 100 countries, fewer than the reported target of 150.[20][21]Several countries were excluded from service despite other Apple products being available.[22][23][24]Commentators noted that the fairly wide initial reach of the service offered Apple an advantage over other recently launched services such asDisney+, and that because Apple distributes its own content through the service instead of distributing licensed third-party content (as, for example,Huludoes) it will not be limited by licensing issues during its expansion.[25][26][27]
By early 2020, Apple TV+ had poor growth and low subscriber numbers relative to competing services.[28][29][30][31]In the middle of that year, Apple began to license older television programs and films, attempting to stay competitive with other services, attract and retain a viewership for its original content, and convert into subscribers users who were trialing the service.[29][28]Since then, the service has become the home to critically acclaimed content: between September 2021 and March 2022, Apple TV+ netted aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy SerieswithTed Lassoand theAcademy Award for Best PicturewithCODA, the first Best Picture win for a film distributed by a streaming service.[32]Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston have all signed a multi year look deal with Apple TV+ to develop more television projects under their production companies after their critically acclaimed shows. Apple TV+ (along with the simultaneously announceda-la-cartepremium-videosubscription aggregation serviceApple TV app) is part of a concerted effort by Apple to expand its service revenues.[16][33][34]The service's programming arm isApple Studios.
Apple had long been rumored to have an interest in beginning astreaming televisionservice, and in 2015 entered into negotiations with varioustelevision studiosand programmers to aggregate their content for a live-television streaming bundle.[35][36]Negotiations fell apart over differing views on how to value the content, lack of transparency on details, and the personality of Apple's chief negotiator,Eddy Cue.[35]
In October 2016, Apple CEOTim Cooksaid that television is "of intense interest to me and other people here", and added that Apple has "started focusing on some original content", which he called "a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it's an area we're focused on."[37]
In June 2017, Apple began to take the first major steps to form its new television unit by hiring the co-presidents ofSony Pictures Television, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to oversee all aspects of worldwide video programming.[36][2]In August, Matt Cherniss was hired as Head of Domestic Creative Development, reporting directly to Van Amburg and Erlicht.[3]For the rest of 2017, Apple continued to fill out its executive team for Apple TV+, with Kim Rozenfeld joining as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted,Jay Huntjoining as Creative Director for Europe,Morgan Wandelljoining as Head of International Creative Development, Tara Sorensen joining as Head of Kids Programming, and Max Aronson, Ali Woodruff, Carina Walker, and Michelle Lee joining as development and creative executives.[38][39][4][6][40]
Throughout 2019, Apple continued to build out its unscripted content team, with Molly Thompson hired as Head of Documentaries in April.[5]In November, Rozenfeld stepped down as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted to focus on producing content again with a first-look content production deal with Apple under his Half Full Productions. Cherniss took over Rozenfeld's duties overseeing current scripted programming.[41]
In May 2018, it was reported that Apple was expected to start a sister project to its original content service, and begin selling subscriptions to certain video services directly via itsApple TV appapplication oniOSandtvOS, rather than asking Apple device owners to subscribe to those services through applications individually downloaded from Apple's app store.[42]
In October 2018, it was reported that Apple would distribute its future original content through a still-in-development digital video service within its TV application that is pre-installed in all iOS and tvOS devices. The service was expected to feature both original content, free to owners of Apple devices, as well as subscription "channels" from legacy media companies such asHBOandStarz, which would allow customers to sign up for online-only services.[43]Later that month, it was reported that Apple intended to roll out the service in the U.S. during the first half of 2019 and that it would expand its availability to around 100 countries in the months after its launch.[44]
On March 25, 2019, Apple held a press event to announce Apple TV+. At the event, Apple showed a teaser of its upcoming original content and formally announced some of it, with actors and producers attached to the content appearing on stage. The announced content includedHelpsters, the first series fromSesame Workshop, the producer ofSesame Street, and Oprah Winfrey's first projects for Apple TV+, including a documentary under the working titleToxic Labor[45]about workplace sexual harassment, a documentary series about mental health, and a revival ofOprah's Book Clubas a standalone television series.[46][47]
On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would launch on November 1 at $4.99 per month (with a 1-week free trial) for an account that can be shared with up to six family members. Apple also announced that it would be give away a year of Apple TV+ to anyone who bought a newApple TV,Mac,iPad,iPhone, oriPod Touchbeginning that day.[48]Student subscribers to the monthlyApple Musicservice at a discounted rate also have Apple TV+ bundled in at no additional cost for the time being.[49]
From the start of Apple TV+ on November 1, 2019, Apple offered a free one-year subscription to anyone buying certain of its hardware products (an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod Touch, or Mac).[50]Apple initially extended the free year that was due to end on November 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021,[51]but then announced in mid-January 2021 that it would extend it a second time to July 31, 2021.[52]
In mid-June 2021, Apple added a note to its website advising customers that new users subscribing after June 30, 2021, would receive only three months of free subscription instead of a year.[53]
On October 24, 2022, Apple announced it was to increase pricing of Apple TV+ (along withApple MusicandApple One) subscriptions in many regions. The monthly plan increased $2 to $6.99, and the annual plan increased $20 to $69.[54]
During the announcement of Apple TV+, Apple announced a number of prominent writers, directors, and stars who would be featured in the service. The signing of high-profile talent was intended to attract viewers to the service.[55]
As of March 2019[update], five of the upcoming series had completed production, with six more well into filming.[56]On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would have eight original series (seven scripted and one unscripted) and one original documentary available at launch, with plans to launch new original content every month thereafter. Most series were expected to launch with three episodes, with a new episode released weekly thereafter, although Apple said that not all series would follow that model and that some series might instead launch all at once.[57]
Early critical reaction to the bulk of the service's programming was mixed to poor, but commentators predicted that Apple would have time to grow into its new role as a content provider and to produce well-regarded content, especially as the free year of the service provided with many Apple product purchases enticed users to continue watching, and for some to eventually pay for a subscription, as new series are released.[58][59][15]
On March 13, 2020, Apple suspended all active filming on Apple TV+ shows due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, and all production on series was postponed for an indeterminate period.[60]
Apple's decision in mid-2020 to license large swaths of existing older content for the Apple TV+ service was viewed, in part, as buying time for its original content production during the pandemic by keeping users engaged and in a habit of visiting the service regularly, so that a viewer base would be in place by the time new Apple original content was released.[29][28]
In addition, Apple TV+ endeavored to gain new high-profile content, taking advantage of the pandemic's disruption of theatrical film releases. Among these acquisitions were the 2020 feature filmGreyhoundstarringTom Hanks, which was purchased fromSony Picturesfor $70 million.[61]In July 2020, the service won a heated bidding war forEmancipation, a slavery-based action-thriller starringWill Smithand directed byAntoine Fuqua.[62]Apple paid a record $105 million for the rights.[62]Apple also reportedly considered a $350 to $400 million offer for the rights to stream theJames BondfilmNo Time to Die, which was far short of the $650 to $800 million studioMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(owned byAmazon, which is one of theBig Techcompanies alongside Apple) was willing to accept.[63]
In October 2017, following reports ofsexual abuse allegationsagainst producerHarvey Weinstein, Apple announced that it was severing ties withThe Weinstein Company(TWC) and cancelling a plannedbiopicseries aboutElvis Presley.[64]
In April 2018, Apple signedKerry Ehrinto a multi-year deal to produce original content.[65]Ehrin and Apple renewed the deal in May 2020.[66]
In June 2018, Apple signed theWriters Guild of America's minimum basic agreement andOprah Winfreyto a multi-year content partnership.[67][68]The same month, Apple announced that it had given a multi-series order toSesame Workshopto produce variouslive-actionand animated series as well as a single puppet-based series.[69]
In September 2018, it was reported that Apple had decided to shelveVital Signs, a six-episode biopic television series centering on the life of hip-hop producer and performerDr. Dreand starringIan McShane,Sam Rockwell, andMichael K. Williams, due to concerns about the show's content being too graphic, with moments cited including characters usingcocaine, instances ofgun violence, and an explicitorgyscene. Reports further indicated that Apple CEO Tim Cook was taking a hands-on approach to the company's Worldwide Video Unit, with programming decisions reportedly being aligned to Cook's personal taste, with a preference for family-friendly shows. Various programs in different stages of production apparently had their content altered, including the toning down ofThe Morning Showand the removal of crucifixes from a scene in theM. Night Shyamalandrama series. Additionally, Apple reportedly passed on a television series from comedianWhitney Cummingsabout the #MeToo movement because it was "too sensitive a topic".[70][71][72]Cummings's series was ultimately put into development byAmazon Prime Videoin October 2018.[73]
In November 2018, Apple entered into a multi-year agreement with entertainment companyA24to produce a slate of original films in partnership with its Worldwide Video Unit.[74]The same month, Apple signed a deal with DHX Media (nowWildBrain) and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide to develop and produce original programs, including new series, specials, and shorts based on thePeanutscharacters.

Apple is seemingly pleased with its box-office returns, which reached $221 million and nearly made back its budget. It is apparent that Apple is attempting to compete with movie production companies.[119][120][121]
In March 2022, Apple announced that it would airFriday Night Baseball, a weekly doubleheader ofMajor League Baseball(MLB) games with live pre- and postgame shows on Apple TV+ in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom starting in the2022 Major League Baseball season.[122]

In mid-2020, Apple began discussions with film and television studios to license their previously released content as part of an effort to build a back catalog of non-original films and television shows for the streaming service.[30][29]The shift was designed to help the service better compete against the large content libraries competitors likeNetflixhave.[30]This represented a pivot for Apple, which had initially attempted to build the service entirely on original content, avoiding licensing fees to help keep monthly subscription fees low, and relying on its Apple TV Channels content partners to supply other content users wanted.[30][29]
Analysts believed that the addition of older, highly re-watchable content like popular sitcoms and well-liked films would help retain the slowly growing subscriber base while Apple continues to develop original content.[28]The shift was also an acknowledgement of poor growth, especially relative to competing services.[28]The back catalog development was also seen as a move to attempt to persuade free trial users to transition into paid users as the first wave of one-year trials was scheduled to expire in November 2020.[29]
On May 26, 2020, Apple announced its first acquisition of catalogue content would be theFraggle Rockseries.[128]In addition to being the exclusive home of the 1983–1987Jim Henson Companyseries, Apple would develop a new, full-length, rebootedFraggle Rockseries after the success of theFraggle Rock: Rock On!short-form series on Apple TV+.[129]On October 19, 2020, Apple announced the exclusive transmission rights of the various animated productions of thePeanutsfranchise, withdrawing them from broadcast television after 55 years; as part of that agreement, Apple TV+ must make the majorPeanutsspecials available for free in short windows.[130]After an outcry from fans of the specials, Apple sublicensedA Charlie Brown ThanksgivingandA Charlie Brown ChristmastoPBSfor commercial-free airing.[131]In 2021,It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brownalso came to the PBS rotation. The PBS sublicensing arrangement ended before October 2022.[132]
In March 2024, Apple made 51 catalog films available under a "Great Movies special collection" banner.[133]
Apple has announced a number of partnerships, bundles, and initiatives to increase subscriber growth in the service.[when?]
It has included Apple TV+ in several reduced-cost bundles designed to increase uptake and stickiness of subscriptions, including a bundle with Apple Music available for students, a bundle offeringCBS All AccessandShowtimefor an additional $9.99 monthly for TV+ subscribers, and a bundling of the service as part of theApple Onesubscription package.[134][135][136]
It has partnered with largecable television MSOsand telecommunicationsmobile network operators, such asAltice USA,[137]the UK'sEE,[138]and Ireland'sEir TV,[139][140]to offer those systems' customers Apple TV+ as part of a bundle, sometimes including anApple TV 4Kset-top box.
By February 2020, about 10 million people had signed up for Apple TV+.[30][29]This included users who received a free one-year trial with the purchase of an Apple device,[30][29]although it was estimated that less than 10% of Apple device owners eligible for the trial had activated it, perhaps because of Apple's failure to promote the service, Apple's desire to slow the uptake rate due to accounting concerns, or users' lack of interest in the service's perceived poor content options.[30]About half of those 10 million users actively used the service.[31]In late 2020, the continuing expansion of availability of the Apple TV app to a growing number of smart TV platforms and to newer lines ofPlayStationandXboxvideo game consoles (specifically, thePS4andPS5, and the XboxOne,Series S, andSeries X[141]) was seen as potentially boosting subscriber numbers for Apple TV+, including as part of Apple One subscription bundle purchases.[142]But Apple has created no native TV app for theWindowsandAndroidplatformsor official method to stream the content toChromecastor on theAndroid TVplatform (except for selectSonyBraviatelevision models[143]), leaving users of those devices to use a web browser to view Apple TV+ content, where possible, or to employ other workarounds, especially for sending Apple TV+ content to a television set.[14]On December 16, 2020,Googleannounced it would add the Apple TV app to itsChromecast with Google TVdevice in early 2021 and to its Android TV platform by June 1, 2021;[144][145]Google made Apple TV available on its Chromecast with Google TV, as well as on selectSonyandTCLsmart TVsrunning the Google TV interface, on February 18, 2021.[146]On December 18, 2020, theBritish Urban Film Festivalannounced that it was to be the first UK film festival to host all of its official selections on theApple TV app.[147]
The service received several nominations for the2021 Golden Globe Awardsin both the television and film categories and was regarded as having "established an impressive track record for turning out consistently good—and sometimes great—programming for subscribers, despite offering a much, much smaller overall offering."[148]Apple's seriesTed Lassowon fourPrimetime Emmy Awards in 2021, includingOutstanding Comedy Series,Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series(Jason Sudeikis),Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series(Brett Goldstein) andOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series(Hannah Waddingham).[149]
Apple TV+ is the first streaming service to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture, withCODAat the94th Academy Awards.[150]As of March 2022, it is estimated to have 25 million paid subscribers and an additional 50 million viewers who access the service via promotions.[151]

Imagine Entertainment, formerlyImagine Films Entertainment, also known simply asImagine(stylized asIMAGINE), is an Americanfilmandtelevisionproduction companyfounded in November 1985 by producerBrian Grazerand directorRon Howard.
Brian Grazer and Ron Howard met in 1982 onNight Shift, with Howard directing and Grazer co-producing. They followed it up by working on 1984'sSplash.[8]
The company was originally founded in November 1985, following the success of the motion pictureSplash. It was originated from a merger of two production companies,Ron Howard's Major H Productions andBrian Grazer's self-titled production company Brian Grazer Productions.[9]The company went public the following year. At first, the company set a deal withTri-Star Picturesto produce feature films and television shows. Imagine granted Tri-Star the right of first refusal to syndicate their off-network shows produced by Imagine. Its offering was sold toAllen & Co.for 1,667,000 units for common stock and warrant it to purchase additional one-third of its stock. The net proceeds were used for development and production of theatrical films, television series, mini-series and made for television movies, although "the company does not presently intend to develop game shows or daytime soap operas." Imagine however has its prospectus having negotiations withParamount Televisionfor a commitment withABCfor a half-hour pilot and five episodes based on the comedy filmGung Ho.[10]
Later the same year, Imagine had a five-year deal withShowtime/The Movie Channel, Inc.and it was able to develop projects for the channelsShowtimeandThe Movie Channel. The agreement would kick-off with 1989 pay television availabilities and include pay-per view exhibition rights to all Imagine-produced films and about 30 motion pictures and "an unspecified number of original products" are also covered by the agreement. "There was the option of developing "long-form dramas" or series as part of the original material to be developed and aired exclusively onShowtime, adding that it could also acquire the syndication rights to these films and original products.[11][12]
In April 1987, producers Philip and Mary Ann Hobel had inked a pact with Imagine Films Entertainment to develop and produce theatrical fare for the company through Hobel Productions, and expected to serve as the eyes and ears of Imagine of New York, and will be backed by a development fund for the purchase of books, plays, scripts and ideas to be developed as film projects, and plans to do both comedy and drama projects with a concentration on contempo themes and issues through a first-look agreement.[13]
On July 29, 1987,Tri-Star Picturesand Imagine Films Entertainment announced the termination of obligations by Imagine to offer Tri-Star distribution rights for all of its television programming and feature films. Imagine, which received more than $1.7 million from Tri-Star, made a $1.3 million payment to Tri-Star, the companies said and advances from Tri-Star were eliminated. The companies said they "intend[ed] to work together on a project-by-project basis" and that projects already in development were not affected. Imagine said the modified agreement "provide[d] it with the flexibility to pursue certain financing and distribution opportunities which were not anticipated when the companies entered the original agreement."[14]
In November 1987, Imagine Films Entertainment announced its plans to move its financial and administrative activities fromNew YorktoLos Angeles, and Neil Braun, who was president and chief-executive officer of the company would not be part of the move, and instead would leave the company and is expected to reveal of his plans shortly and his personal commitments would keep him from making the shift, but he called the consolidation "the right decision for the company" while expressing his disappointment at not being able to stay on.[15]
On December 1, 1987, the company sealed a production and distribution deal withUniversal Picturesvia a "long-term multiple picture agreement" that they distributed Imagine's films for three to five films a year and the agreement "contemplates the possibility" that Universal acquired a 20% share in Imagine[16][8]and it ran through November 1992 for financing 50% of 30 films. Imagine had an IPO in 1986 at $8 for a package of one share and one warrant. Shares rose to $19.25 before falling in the stock market crash in 1987 to $2.25. In the summer of next year, Imagine struck a deal withMCA TVto handle distribution of its television material. MCA and Imagine had a joint television venture which MCA had the exclusive network and home video distribution rights. Imagine retained domestic distribution rights for now and was banking on those rights becoming more valuable in the future as its theatrical and television programs gained exposure. Imagine's television division focused on half-hour comedies, whereas MCA focused on one-hour programs for the networks.[17][18]
In September 1988, Robert Harris who was employee ofMCA, and president ofUniversal Television Groupjoined the company as president of motion pictures and television. Harris said the studio was also taking original feature cable projects withShowtime,HBO,TNT,USAandMTV Network(which includesNickelodeonandVH-1, in addition to projects with on-air networks).[18]

Imagine andCentralretained rights in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively. The Imagine-Central joint venture was separate from MCA's own ongoing exploration of a joint venture with a European company for Europe-based long-form co-production. The company was in discussions with two or three potential partners, but a deal was not expected soon. Its projects required U.S. and UK presales to go forward, although the venture intended to seek U.S. buyers going beyond the three big commercial networks to includeFox, as well as cable networksTNT,USA Network,ShowtimeandHBO. The deal also allowed for theatrical distribution, although such co-productions were not in the planning.[19]
Imagine andSecond Citysigned a joint venture deal in May 1989. In September 1989, Imagine is entering syndication production business and signed a long-term co-production deal with Second City Entertainment, for a late night talk/comedy strip that was distributed by MCA TV.

The result wasMy Talk Show, which aired in the 1990–91 season.[18]As HA!: The Comedy Network is ready to air in 1990, they stuck deals with Imagine Films Entertainment, for series featuring the Second City Repertory Company, as well asMTM Enterprises.[20]

The first film planned to be developed for the branding was a remake of the 1963 family feature filmFlipper, and an adaptation of the book seriesCurious George. Both MCA/Universal and Imagine agreed to an extension that Universal would handle theatrical distribution, network, foreign and home video rights, whileUniversal Studios Floridahandled the theme park rights to the properties that were proposed by Imagine Family Films. The new Imagine Family Films banner was intended to model on the success of Disney, and decided to extend on the natural extension of the wholesome wide appeal fare the company has been using since its founding.[21]

By May 1992, 48% of the stock was public traded and worth $9.375. The duo agreed to a new six-picture deal with Universal while concurrently offering $9 a share to buy the company's public outstanding share to start a new company with its assets. If not, they planned to leave the company at their contract expiration in November to start the new company anyway. Universal was providing the cash for a buyout of an equity stake in the new company.[12]By January 21, 1993, it approved a $9 share offer made by its founders and co-chief executives, and IFE Acquisition Co. could render the offer for the deal.[23]

Because of their weak financial pact renewal with Universal in January 2012, Imagine laid off 5 employees, including production executive Jeremy Steckler.[27]This also moved Imagine from exclusive to afirst-look deal.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
