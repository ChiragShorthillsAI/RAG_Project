A professionalhitmanknown only as The Killer stakes out aParisianhotel room. He prepares to use a sniper rifle to kill a target who will check into the hotel room at an unknown time. While waiting for the target, he eats, practices yoga, listens to music (exclusivelythe Smiths), and talks on the phone with his handler, Edward "Eddie" Hodges, who is an attorney and his former university law professor. The target arrives with adominatrixand The Killer shoots but misses, accidentally shooting the dominatrix. He flees, evading the police and disposing of his equipment. He then flies to the United States.
The Killer returns to his hideout in theDominican Republicto find it has been broken into and his girlfriend Magdala has been attacked. She is in theICUof a hospital, with her brother watching over her. He says that Magdala was interrogated and tortured by two assassins but managed to injure one of them and escape. The Killer tracks down Leo, the taxi driver who drove the assassins to The Killer's home. Leo identifies one of the assassins, a strong man with a limp leg, nicknamed "The Brute", and a woman who resembles aQ-Tip, known as "The Expert". The Killer shoots Leo and seeks to track down the two assassins.
The Killer travels to Hodges' office inNew Orleans,Louisiana, and enters the building disguised as a maintenance person. After forcing Dolores, Hodges' secretary, to restrain her boss and herself, The Killer destroys their electronics. As Hodges attempts to get The Killer to leave, The Killer shoots him in the chest with a nail gun to torture the names of the hitmen out of him. However, Hodges doesn't reveal the information and dies more quickly than The Killer anticipated. Dolores offers to show The Killer the assassins' identities in her paper files in her home, asking in return that The Killer give her a non-suspicious death so her children can claim a life insurance payout. After receiving the names at her home, The Killer breaks his rule not to show empathy; he snaps her neck and shoves her down a flight of stairs, making her death look like an accident, as she had requested. He then disposes of Hodges' body.
The Killer drives toSt. Petersburg,Florida, where he confronts The Brute, whom he identifies by his limp. At night, he breaks into The Brute's home to kill him, but he is blindsided and tackled. A fight ensues, during which The Brute realizes who The Killer is before The Killer fatally shoots him and sets his house on fire with a Molotov cocktail.
The Killer travels toBeacon,New York, and confronts The Expert "Q-Tip" assassin in a gourmet restaurant. Appearing to accept her fate, The Expert offers to share with him a "last supper" ofwhiskey, during which she questions The Killer's motivations. They leave the restaurant and go to a park. After The Expert appears to slip down a small flight of ice-covered stairs, she asks The Killer to help her up, but The Killer shoots her, revealing that she was concealing a knife.
The Killer travels toChicago, to kill billionaireventure capitalistHenderson "Clay" Claybourne, reflecting during his flight that police take more interest in the deaths of rich people. He uses tools bought onAmazonto enter Claybourne's penthouse. Confronting him, The Killer remains mostly silent. Claybourne says that he has no personal problem with The Killer and, as a first-time client of a hitman, agreed to pay Hodges for "the trail to be scrubbed", not knowing what that meant. The Killer spares Claybourne, but he promises him a slow death if Claybourne ever targets him again. The Killer returns to the Dominican Republic and sits next to a recovering Magdala.

The film began alimited theatrical releaseon October 27, 2023, viaNetflix, before streaming on the platform on November 10, 2023.[18]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 85% of 288 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "The Killerfinds director David Fincher on firm footing with a stylish and engaging thriller that proves a perfect match for leading man Michael Fassbender."[19]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[20]
Terming it a "horribly addictive samurai procedural,"Peter BradshawofThe Guardianwrote that the film is "entertainingly absurd and yet the pure conviction and deadpan focus that Fassbender and Fincher bring to this ballet of anonymous professionalism makes it very enjoyable."[21]IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio found it "as unfeeling as any Fincher thriller, at once predictable in its simplicity but also strangely daring because of it".[22]Timemagazine's Stephanie Zacharek, noting the proliferation of thrillers about contract assassins, praised Fincher for simplifying his entry into the subgenre to its essence, which Zacharek felt expanded its possibilities rather than limiting them, especially with Fassbender's performance effectively realizing them.[23]
The New York Timeswas less positive, withManohla Dargisunmoved by character and plot but nonetheless impressed by the talents of Fincher and Fassbender. "The character is boring and so is this movie, but like the supremely skilled Fincher, who can't help but make images that hold your gaze even as your mind wanders, Fassbender does keep you watching."[24]
The film has drawn comparisons to the 1967 filmLe Samouraï.[25][26][27]

Andrew Kevin Walker(born August 14, 1964) is an American screenwriter. He is known for having writtenSeven(1995), for which he earned a nomination for theBAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, as well as several other films, including8mm(1999),Sleepy Hollow(1999) and many uncreditedscript rewrites.
Walker was born inAltoona, Pennsylvania, though some time during his childhood, he moved toMechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, where he was raised. He attended theMechanicsburg Area Senior High Schooluntil his graduation in 1982. Walker soon enrolled inPenn State Universityto pursue a career infilm production. He graduated from Penn State in 1986, with aBachelor of Artsin film and video.[1]
Shortly after completing his education, he moved to New York City and took a job atTower Records. During that time, he worked on several projects, but Walker was unable to find much success until 1991, when he completed the script forSeven. Walker decided to move to Los Angeles to sell his screenplay. There, he personally contacted screenwriterDavid Koepp, who showed the script to executives atNew Line Cinema, who ended up purchasing the rights to it. The film, however, took nearly three years to begin production.Christmas VacationdirectorJeremiah S. Chechikwas originally chosen to direct the optioned film but he asked for a number of modifications, including the changes to the ending, particularly the removal of the head in a box scene.[2]Walker continued reworking the script but the film got passed around in Hollywood. The project finally went ahead whenDavid Fincheragreed to direct the film after he read the original draft, which was accidentally sent with the ending intact.[2]
While the project was ongoing, Walker found other work as a screenwriter, including a short stint withHBO'stelevision seriesTales From the Crypt, as well as writing two other films,Brainscan(1994) and the novel adaptationHideaway(1995).[1]
Sevenbegan production between his two other films, headed by Fincher as thedirectorand starringMorgan Freeman,Brad PittandKevin Spacey. At one point during production, the studio proposed several changes — which would later become a recurring theme throughout Walker's career — deeming it too dark for its target audience. Both Fincher and Freeman backed Walker's original script, and it eventually went unchanged.[1]The film was met with critical acclaim and enormous box office success, earning$327,311,859 worldwide.[3][4]It would allow Walker to make a name for himself in the movie industry.
However, Walker would not earn another film credit to his name for another four years, though he penned several uncredited rewrites during this period, includingThe Game(on which he again worked with David Fincher) andPaul W. S. Anderson'sEvent Horizon.[5]In1999, Walker's8MMfinally saw the light of day, having been sold by him for a reported $1.25 million. Once again, the film's production encountered concerns regarding the dark subject matter, and the studio asked Walker to lighten the film's tone. WithJoel Schumacheras director, Walker felt a rewrite would no longer be needed. But as it turned out, Schumacher supported the studio and made changes of his own, leading to a much-publicized fallout between the two, with Walker virtually disowning the film and walking away from the set. He refused to even watch the film, which became a critical failure.[6]In an interview withThe Guardian, he said that "it was such an inherently depressing experience that the very least I can do is protect myself from the miserable experience of actually watching it."[7]In 2015, he expressed his openness to a redo8MMinstead of remakingSeven.[7]The latter had left the studios and producers unhappy with Somerset merely standing there helpless as Mills shot John Doe.[8]
Walker found other success in 1999, as he penned uncredited rewrites to the critical hitsStir of EchoesandFight Club, now considered acult classic. Walker's adaptation ofWashington Irving'sshort story"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" also wrapped up production asSleepy Hollow, directed byTim Burton. While Burton admired Walker's original script, he hired the playwright and Academy Award-winning screenwriterTom Stoppardto tone down the violence.[6]The film, starringJohnny Depp, was still a box office and critical success.[9]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
