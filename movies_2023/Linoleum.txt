James Christopher Gaffigan(born July 7, 1966) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and producer. His material often addresses fatherhood, laziness, food, religion, and general observations. He is regarded as a "clean" comic, using little profanity in his routines, although he does use it from time to time.[1]He has released several successful comedy specials, includingMr. Universe,Obsessed,Cinco, andQuality Time, all of which have receivedGrammynominations.
Gaffigan's memoirDad Is Fat(2013) and his most recent bookFood: A Love Story(2014) were both published byCrown Publishers. He co-created and starred in theTV LandseriesThe Jim Gaffigan Show, based on his life. He collaborates extensively with his wife, actressJeannie Gaffigan, with whom he has five children.
Gaffigan was born on July 7, 1966,[2]inElgin, Illinois,[3]the youngest of six children born to charity worker and fundraiser Marcia Miriam (née Mitchell) and banker Michael Ambrose Gaffigan.[4][5]Of Irish descent, his family's surname was Gavahan.[5]His maternal grandfather wasIowa Supreme CourtJusticeRichard F. Mitchell.[5]Gaffigan was raised inChestertoninNorthwest Indiana, a region that he has stated influenced his comedy because of its authenticity,[6]and often jokes about growing up in a large family.[7]His mother was accomplished atneedleworkand received a national award for original design and craftsmanship from the American Needlepoint Guild in 1985.[8]She died of cancer in 1990 at age 53.[8]
Gaffigan's father was the president and CEO of the Mercantile National Bank of Indiana for 15 years until his retirement in 1991.[9]A formerseminarian, he was also actively involved in local charity work.[10]He died oflung cancerin 1999.[10]Gaffigan's father was the first in his family to attend college,[11]and encouraged his children to seek careers that promised job security.[12]However, at about the age of five, Gaffigan announced that he wanted to be an actor.[13]
As a teenager, Gaffigan watchedSaturday Night Live.[11]He attendedLa Lumiere SchoolinLa Porte, Indiana, where he played on the school'sfootballteam. He attendedPurdue Universityfor one year, where he was a member of thePhi Gamma Deltafraternity, before transferring toGeorgetown University'sMcDonough School of Business, where he graduated in 1988 with a degree in finance.[12][14]He played football atGeorgetownandPurdue.[15][16]Although he "hated" studying finance, he worked as a litigation consultant for a short time after graduating and "was horrible at it".[17]
Gaffigan moved to New York in 1990 to pursue comedy,[14]a move that was inspired by his admiration for fellowHoosierDavid Letterman.[18]He worked in advertising during the day[12]and took acting classes at night.[7][18]During this time, he was cast inBlockbuster Video's"Entertainment Squad" series of commercials.[19]His career began in earnest when a friend from his acting class dared him to take astand-upseminar that required a live set at the end.[7][13]He fell in love with stand-up,[7]and began playing comedy clubs nightly—after his evening acting classes—until the early hours of the morning.[18]He was often found sleeping at his day job; his boss had to wake him up to fire him.[18]
For the first seven years of Gaffigan's stand-up career, he tried various styles, ranging from angry comedy to impressions and voices. Live comedy was in decline following its peak in the 1980s, and was further affected by the increased popularity ofcable television.[7]After periodically auditioning forThe Late Show with David Lettermanfor six years,[20]Gaffigan did a successful stand-up routine on the show in 1999,[21][22]and his career took off.[18]
Gaffigan's style is largelyobservational. Some of his main topics are laziness, eating and parenthood. His famousHot Pocketroutine was inspired by a commercial he saw that he mistook for aSaturday Night Livesketch.[13]He often performssoliloquies. For example, in high-pitched voice, he may portray someone giving negative feedback on his own performance (After he made a diarrhea joke in his 2012 special "Mr. Universe", he used the voice to say, "Really, he's using diarrhea jokes?"[23]). He has said, "That inside voice is my connection with the audience".[13]
In an interview with theDuluth News-Tribune, he explained that he began developing the voice as a teenager, when he disarmed people by talking for them in their presence.[24]He said he also used it to fend off hecklers earlier in his career, when comedy clubs were more "combative".[24]He cursed early in his career, and added cursing to his comedy albumDoing My Timeat the request of his label, in the hopes of drawing more teens.[25]He has now largely removed profanity from his routine, as he feels his subject matter doesn't lend itself to cursing and that it reduced the effort he put into crafting his jokes.[25][26]
In 2004, Gaffigan's stand-up material was featured inComedy Central's animated seriesShorties Watchin' Shorties. In October 2005, he filmed a liveComedy Centralspecial that aired the following January,[7]and became the comedy album/DVDBeyond the Pale. The routine consisted primarily of material regarding food and American eating habits, and the comedian unknowingly predicted a future menu item atDunkin Donuts—the "glazed donut breakfast sandwich"—while commenting on the future of America's eating habits.[27]His 2009 albumKing Babywas also a television special filmed inAustin, Texas, at the end of his "The Sexy Tour". Comedy Central releasedKing Babyon DVD. In a March 2009 interview onAnytime with Bob Kushell, Gaffigan defended his naming of the tour, stating that he thought it would be funny that parents would be unsure about whether to bring their teenage children to the show.[28]Four years later, on March 14, 2013, Gaffigan was named the "King of Clean" by theWall Street Journal.[29]
On February 25, 2012, Gaffigan taped a one-hour stand-up special—Mr. Universe—at theWarner TheaterinWashington, D.C.;[30]it was nominated for a Grammy.[12]He announced that, based on the business model used byLouis C.K.'sLive at the Beacon Theater, the stand-up would be available online through his website for $5, with 20% of the total proceeds going to theBob Woodruff Foundation,[31]an organization that provides support to military veterans.[32]In 2012, he was among the top-ten grossing comics in the US, according to Pollstar.[12]
Gaffigan filmed his 2014 comedy special titledJim Gaffigan: ObsessedatBoston'sWilbur Theateron January 18, 2014.[33]Obsessedpremiered onComedy Centralon April 27 becoming the most watched stand-up comedy special of the year for the network.[34]The accompanying album, also titledObsessed, debuted at number 11 on theBillboard200and number 1 on the Billboard Comedy Album charts.[35]2015 saw him embark on a headlining tour, culminating in a winter show atMadison Square Garden.[11]
Gaffigan has performed stand-up to support charitable causes as well. In 2002, he was part of aUnited Service Organizationevent atGuantanamo Bay Naval Base.[36]Gaffigan performed at the 2013 Stand Up for Heroes charity event benefitting the Bob Woodruff Foundation alongside fellow stand-up comediansJerry Seinfeld,Bill CosbyandJon Stewart.[37]Gaffigan also performed at the 2013CNN Heroesevent, which celebrates everyday heroes doing extraordinary work around the world.[38]In May 2014, Gaffigan performed at theMake It RightGala, an organization founded byBrad Pitt, which builds sustainable homes and buildings for communities in need.[39]On September 26, 2015, he performed at the Festival of Families, a Catholic event held inPhiladelphia. Gaffigan was the only comedian on the bill at the festival, and the event was visited byPope Francis. The event had more than one million attendees.

In 2016, Gaffigan embarked on hisFully Dressed Tour, performing in the United States, Canada, and the UK.
Gaffigan has appeared at the "Just for Laughs" comedy festival inMontreal, Quebec, numerous times.
Gaffigan creditsDavid LettermanandBill Murrayas influences, and asserted thatRichard Pryorwas the greatest stand-up comedian ever.[11]His comedy mentor wasDave Attell, who Gaffigan said was the only person who thought he was funny in his early stand-up years.[41]
On the episode ofComedians in Cars Getting Coffeefeaturing Gaffigan, he admitted that the show's hostJerry Seinfeldwas a big influence for him.
Gaffigan is widely noted as aneverymanand a clean comic;[12][42]some of his signature routines regardHot Pockets,[42][43]cake, andbacon.[23]His tendency to avoid profanity has drawn mixed responses. One critic compared him toFull House-eraBob Saget(who starred in the 1990s family show), which Gaffigan took as an insult.[25]Hampton Stevens inThe Atlanticwrote that Gaffigan "champions a vital element to standup that[Lenny] Brucehad taken away—the indispensable, but apparently forgotten idea that comedians have no obligation to be provocative, topical, socially conscious, or anything else but funny."[23]
I did my set, I walked off stage and they said the executive producer wants to meet you up in his office. I thought maybe it was going to be something good. I thought maybe Dave wants me to be a writer. But they wanted me to develop my ownshow.
As Gaffigan's comedy career stalled in the 1990s, a friend suggested he audition for commercials, a move that turned out to be profitable.[7]He has appeared in over 200 TV commercials,[25]ranging fromRolling RocktoSaturntoChryslerandESPN. His ubiquity earned him the title of 'Salesman of the Year' byBusinessWeekin 1999.[44]He also performed in a trio of Sierra Mist commercials for the2007 Super Bowlas part of the comedy ensemble "The Mis-Takes".[45][46]He appeared in an ad series forSierra Mistalongside fellow comedianMichael Ian Black.[47]
After his first appearance onThe Late Show with David Lettermanin 1999, Gaffigan was tapped by the host to develop a sitcom calledWelcome to New Yorkin which he also co-starred alongsideChristine Baranski.[11]The show was cancelled after its first season, despite positive reviews.[48]During the 2000/2001 TV season, he was a cast member ofThe Ellen Showon CBS,Ellen DeGeneres's second sitcom. He appeared in two movies chosen for the 2001Sundance Film Festival:Super Troopersand30 Years to Life.

He appeared onLaw & Orderepisodes "Flight" and "Reality Bites", and in the "Smile" episode ofLaw & Order: Criminal Intent.[50]
He was in an episode ofThe Daily Showas a man posing as aDaily Showcorrespondent who knows nothing about the show (he refers to it as "The John Daily Show") and just wants to be seen with Jon Stewart. It was meant as a parody of the2009 White House gatecrash incident.[citation needed]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
