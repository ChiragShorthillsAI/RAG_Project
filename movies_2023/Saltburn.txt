The film had its USwide releaseon 22 November before its streaming release byAmazon Prime Videoon 22 December, on which it became one of the most-streamed films.[8]The film received generally positive reviews, and was nominated for twoGolden Globe Awardsand fiveBAFTA Film Awards.
In late 2006,[9]scholarshipstudent Oliver Quick struggles to fit in at theUniversity of Oxfordbecause of his inexperience withupper-classmanners. He befriends Felix Catton, an affluent and popular student who is sympathetic to Oliver's stories of his parents'substance abuseandmental health issues. When Oliver becomes distraught over his father's sudden death, Felix comforts him and invites him to spend the summer at his family'scountry house, Saltburn.
At Saltburn, Oliver meets Felix's parents Sir James and Elspeth, his sister Venetia, and Elspeth's friend Pamela, and he reunites with Felix's American cousin Farleigh, with whom Oliver has had a tense relationship as Oxford classmates. Oliver quickly wins over Felix's family except for Farleigh, and his obsession with Felix grows. One night, after watching Felixmasturbatein a bathtub, he lustfully drinks thesemen-laced bathwater. Later, having seen Venetia waiting outside his bedroom window, he performsoral sexon her while she is on herperiod. Farleigh witnesses this and informs Felix, but Oliver claims nothing happened when Felix confronts him. At night, Oliver initiates sexual advances on Farleigh, threatening him in the process. The next morning, James evicts Farleigh after receiving a report fromSotheby'sabout his intention to sell some of James's valuables.
As the summer ends, Elspeth and James plan a party for Oliver's birthday. Felix surprises Oliver with a trip to see hisestrangedmother, causing Oliver to panic. Upon arriving at the family's house inPrescot, Felix realises Oliver had lied to him about his upbringing. His father is still alive, neither of his parents has substance abuse or mental health troubles, and they live in a respectablemiddle classsuburb. Horrified and hurt by Oliver's deception, Felix decides not to tell anyone to spare his own family the humiliation but orders Oliver to leave Saltburn after the party. During the extravagant celebrations, Oliver seeks to make amends with Felix by expressing his adoration for him, but Felix rejects him and suggests he seek help.
The next morning, Felix is found dead in Saltburn'shedge maze. Oliver implies Felix's death was connected to Farleigh supplying drugs during the party, and James withdraws financial support from Farleigh and bans him from ever returning. Oliver mourns Felix and visits his grave alone, where he lies naked on the grave soil and masturbates on it. After Felix's funeral, Elspeth insists Oliver extend his stay at Saltburn. Venetia, increasingly distraught and disturbed, accuses Oliver of destroying her family. He attempts to seduce her, but she eventually rebuffs him. The next day, Venetia is found dead, having slit her wrists in the bathtub. Despondent over Oliver's continuing presence at Saltburn and Elspeth's closeness to him, James bribes him to leave, which Oliver accepts.
In 2022, Oliver reads about James's death in a newspaper. He subsequently has what seems to be a chance encounter with Elspeth at a café. She is delighted to see him again, insisting he return with her to Saltburn. After spending several months with Oliver, Elspeth becomes terminally ill. On her deathbed, Oliver confides to Elspeth that he is responsible for all of the tragic and horrifying events at Saltburn. He orchestrated his initial meeting with Felix at Oxford and poisoned Felix's drink in the maze, resulting in his death. He also placed razor blades beside Venetia while she was bathing, encouraging her suicide. He even planned his encounter with Elspeth at the café, after which shebequeathedall her assets, including Saltburn, to him. He then removes her life support, killing her. Having now assumed ownership of Saltburn and the Catton family fortune, Oliver happily dances naked around the mansion.
Saltburnis the second film written and directed byEmerald Fennell, afterPromising Young Woman(2020).[9]By January 2022,Tom AckerleyandMargot Robbie'sLuckyChap Entertainmentwas in talks to produce, after collaborating with Fennell on her previous film.[10]In May 2022, Ackerley, Robbie, and Josey McNamara were confirmed as producers, whileRosamund Pike,Jacob ElordiandBarry Keoghanjoined the cast.[11][12]In joining the cast ofSaltburn, Keoghan had to drop out from the role of EmperorCaracallainGladiator II(2024).[13]Fennell said that Australian actor Elordi "...did the most exceptional audition... He did such a genius, genius bit of observational comedy. He really really understood that for all of [Felix's] beauty and charisma, he's just sort of a spoiled little boy. He came in and just absolutely blew us all away".[14]
Carey Mulligan, star ofPromising Young Woman, was revealed to be part of the cast in December 2022.[15]
In writing the film, Fennell wanted to sympathise with unlikeable people, saying
the sorts of people that we can't stand, the sorts of people who are abhorrent—if we can love them, if we can fall in love with these people, if we can understand why this is so alluring, in spite of its palpable cruelty and unfairness and sort of strangeness, if we all want to be there too, I think that's just such an interesting dynamic.
She had long wanted to make her own version of films and books set in acountry house, and set the film in 2006 to "really [knock] the fucking glamour off things" by setting it in the recent past.[16]
Filming began on 16 July 2022, withLinus Sandgrenserving as cinematographer.[17]The film is shown in a 4:3aspect ratio, with Fennell saying it gives the impression of "peeping in".[16]
Fennell was determined not to film in an estate familiar to viewers, and wanted to set the movie in one location, so aligning the filming with the film's plot, saying, "It was important to me that we were all in there together, that the making of the film in some way had that feeling of a summer where everyone loses their mind together...I didn't want to be constantly picking up and moving" and avoiding the need for post-production adjustments due to multiple locations.[16]Fennell was successful, with filming occurring at theUniversity of OxfordatMagdalen College,St Hugh's CollegeandBrasenose Collegeand inDrayton House,Northamptonshire,[18][19]which had never been used for a film before. As part of the contract, no one was allowed to reveal the location of the house or the identity of its owners. Despite the house's opulence, the actors ultimately became familiar with Drayton's interiors over the course of filming and comfortable working in it, in order to convey the idea that this grand location was for their characters completely normal and simply their home.[16]
Costumes were designed with 2000s fashion displayed in the form of ostentatious jackets,rugby shirts, and ostentatious jewellery.[14]
The film is scored by Anthony Willis, who previously scored Fennell'sPromising Young Woman. The soundtrack was released byMilan Recordson 17 November 2023.
Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 2001 song "Murder on the Dancefloor" was featured in the last scene of the film.[20][21]As a result, the song received 1.5 million streams onNew Year's EveonSpotify[22][23]and subsequently re-entered theUK Singles Chartat number eight on 5 January 2024 with 2.2 million streams, marking the song's best-ever streaming week.[24]The film also featuresLadytron's 2005 track "Destroy Everything You Touch",MasonandPrincess Superstar's 2006 track "Perfect (Exceeder)" andTomcraft's 2002 track "Loneliness" which, in addition to "Murder on the Dancefloor", became trending songs, particularly onTikTok.[25][26]
The film focuses on excess and obsession. Fennell stated "I drew from my own experience of being a human person, who has felt that thing we all feel at that time in our life which is that absolute insane grip of obsessive love...But obviously I didn't quite go to the lengths that some of the people [in the film] do".[14]
Discussing the film's influences, Fennell has citedA Clockwork Orange(1971),[27]Cruel Intentions(1999),[27]Daphne du Maurier'sRebecca(1938),[27]and the novelThe Go-Between(1953) byL.P. Hartleyand its1971 film adaptation.[27][28]She commented, "I think that I was sort of looking more at thatBritish Country Housetradition ofThe Go-Betweenand that sort of very specific British... sort ofJoseph Loseyworld, where class and power and sex all kind of collide in one specific place".[29]Fennell cited Losey'sThe Servant(1963) as an influence because of its "undeniable erotic power" that "relies entirely on the threat of violence—not just literal violence, but a complete chaotic upending of the status quo".[30]
Patricia Highsmith's novelThe Talented Mr. Ripley(1955) and itsfilm adaptation(1999) have often been cited as an influence by critics due to the common themes of social class and the similarities between Oliver andTom Ripley,[31][32][33]though Fennell herself has downplayed these comparisons.[29]Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkeralso found similarities toBrideshead RevisitedbyEvelyn Waugh.[34]A reviewer for the Australian student magazineFarragodescribed the film as "the lovechild ofCall Me by Your Name(2017) andParasite(2019)".[35]
Some critics noted that the rich stylisation and visual influences in the film show aesthetic influences fromFrancis Ford Coppola'sBram Stoker's Dracula(1992) andStanley Kubrick'sThe Shining(1980).[36]According to these critics, Fennell's Gothic visual style in general mirrors the mythical elements of Coppola's 1992 Dracula film about otherworldly seduction: theSaltburngarden scene, especially, parallels the carnal possessions of Lucy (Sadie Frost) and Mina (Winona Ryder), who are cosmically drawn toGary Oldman's Count Dracula.[37]Saltburnhas been billed as a sort of "vampire movie" by the filmmaker herself.[38]
Other critics have found similarities toPier Paolo Pasolini'sfilmTheorem(1968) andStanley Kubrick'sBarry Lyndon(1975), which also addressed themes of class, power, desire, and seduction.[39][40][41]Fennell described her satire of the British class system as "Barry Lyndonmeetsindie sleaze".[30]
Saltburnhad its world premiere at the50th Telluride Film Festivalon 31 August 2023.[42][43]It premiered in the United Kingdom (UK) as the opening film of the67th BFI London Film Festivalon 4 October 2023.[44]It also premiered in Australia atSXSW Sydneyon 20 October 2023.[45]
Amazonspent $75 million to acquire distribution rights.[46]In the United States,Saltburnwas given alimited releaseon 17 November 2023, followed by awide releaseon 22 November.[31]It was originally scheduled to be released a week earlier but was moved to take advantage of the initial positive response it received at its Telluride premiere.[47]Warner Bros. Pictureshandled the UK and Ireland release ofSaltburn, with a 16 November release in Australia and a 17 November release in the UK.[48][49]
The film became available to stream worldwide onAmazon Prime Videoon 22 December 2023.[50][51]The film was highly popular on Amazon Prime, becoming one of its top 10 worldwide film debuts, as viewership quadrupled two weeks after its launch.Deadline Hollywoodcredited the success to the film's viral marketing andword-of-mouth.Saltburn-themed videos amassed nearly 4 billion views onTikTok, with three million influencers and content creators engaging with the film across all platforms and the officialSaltburnsocials obtaining 153 million views.[8]
Saltburngrossed $11.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $9.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $21.1 million.[2][3]
In its limited opening weekend, the film made $322,651 from seven theatres.[52]Expanding to 1,566 theatres the following Wednesday, the wide expansion of the film was released alongsideNapoleonandWish, and made $684,000 on its first day of wide release and then $301,000 on Thanksgiving Day. Its debut made $1.8 million on the weekend (and a total of $2.9 million over the five-day frame), finishing in ninth.[53]The film dropped just 16% the following weekend, grossing $1.6 million.[54]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 72% of 295 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's consensus reads: "Emerald Fennell's candy-coated and incisiveSaltburnis a debauched jolt to the senses that will be invigorating for most."[55]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 61 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[56]Audiences surveyed byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B−" on an "A+" to "F" scale, and those polled byPostTrakgave it a 75% overall positive score, and 42% said they would definitely recommend it.[53]
The Guardianreviewed the film after its August premiere. Its criticPeter Bradshawgave it three out of five. He noted that it "boasts dazzling turns from Rosamund Pike and Carey Mulligan" but that "the heavily drawn-out ending feels uncertain".[57]Writing in theObserver, Wendy Ide wrote that it "stars a miscast Barry Keoghan (he's way too old for the role)" but that "Rosamund Pike, as Felix's mother Elspeth, is gloriously rude; Archie Madekwe, as poor relation Farleigh, is a malicious delight". She awarded it two out of five.[58]
Nicholas Barber, reviewing for theBBC, enjoyed the "outrageous, laugh-out-loud punchlines" but felt that "Fennell is prone to fumble" plot twists. Barber praised the "superb ensemble cast", especially Keoghan ("magnetic"), Pike ("steals the show"), and Elordi ("a revelation"). He concluded that "if you see it as a lurid pulp fantasy rather than a penetrating satire, thenSaltburnis deliriously enjoyable" and awarded it four out of five.[7]Empirealso praised the charismatic ensemble cast and gave the film three out of five. In her review, Sophie Butcher reported that "Saltburnlooks divine. Fennell's eye is extraordinary, and alongside cinematographer Linus Sandgren, she captures the grand beauty of her architectural locations impeccably" but was disappointed that "scenes often build to reach the cusp of something truly electric, but are let down by clunky dialogue".[59]
Writing inSight and Sound, Sophie Monks Kaufman found that "the story's superficial treatment of its characters ... becomes increasingly ruinous" and that "the most menacing thing anyone can muster here is a passive-aggressive karaoke choice". She was also underwhelmed by the film's "ostentatious visual language".[6]However,Entertainment Weeklycolumnist Maureen Lee Lenker gaveSaltburnan "A", saying the film is a "Gothic thriller dusted with poisonous candy-pop glitter…Its endless visual and literary layers will bring its ardent admirers back to it again and again, because it is a triumph of the cinema of excess, in all its orgiastic, unapologetic glory."[60]FilmmakerRobert Eggersnamed it as one of his favorite films of 2023.[61]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
