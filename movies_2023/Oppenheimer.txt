Oppenheimeris a 2023epicbiographicalthriller filmwritten, produced, and directed byChristopher Nolan.[8]It follows the life ofJ. Robert Oppenheimer, the Americantheoretical physicistwho helpeddevelop the first nuclear weaponsduringWorld War II. Based on the 2005 biographyAmerican PrometheusbyKai BirdandMartin J. Sherwin, the film dramatizes Oppenheimer's studies, his direction of theLos Alamos Laboratoryand his1954 security hearing.Cillian Murphystars as Oppenheimer, alongsideRobert Downey Jr.as theUnited States Atomic Energy CommissionmemberLewis Strauss. Theensemble supporting castincludesEmily Blunt,Matt Damon,Florence Pugh,Josh Hartnett,Casey Affleck,Rami Malek, andKenneth Branagh.
Oppenheimerwas announced in September 2021. It was Nolan's first film not distributed byWarner Bros. PicturessinceMemento(2000), due to his conflicts regarding the studio's simultaneous theatrical andHBO Maxrelease schedule.[9]Murphy was the first cast member to join, with the rest joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production began by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. The cinematographer,Hoyte van Hoytema, used a combination ofIMAX65 mm and65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time, selected scenes in IMAXblack-and-whitefilm photography. As with many of his previous films, Nolan used extensive practical effects, with minimalcompositing.
Oppenheimerpremiered atLe Grand Rexin Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21 byUniversal Pictures. Its concurrent release with Warner Bros.'sBarbiewas the catalyst of the "Barbenheimer" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as adouble feature.Oppenheimerreceived critical acclaim and grossed $976 million worldwide, becoming thethird-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film and thesecond-highest-grossing R-rated film of all timeat the time of its release.
The recipient ofmany accolades,Oppenheimerwas nominated for thirteen awards at the96th Academy Awardsand won seven, includingBest Picture,Best Director(Nolan),Best Actor(Murphy), andBest Supporting Actor(Downey). It also won fiveGolden Globe Awards(includingBest Motion Picture – Drama) and sevenBritish Academy Film Awards(includingBest Film), and was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by theNational Board of Reviewand theAmerican Film Institute.
In 1926, 22-year-old doctoral studentJ. Robert Oppenheimergrapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying experimentalquantum physicsunderPatrick Blackettat theUniversity of Cambridgein England. Oppenheimer clashes with Blackett, leaving him a poisoned apple, but he later retrieves it. Visiting scientistNiels Bohradvises Oppenheimer to studytheoretical physicsat theUniversity of Göttingenin Germany.
Oppenheimer completes his PhD and meets scientistIsidor Isaac Rabi. They later meet theoretical physicistWerner Heisenbergin Switzerland. Wanting to expandquantum physicsresearch in the United States, Oppenheimer teaches at theUniversity of California, Berkeleyand theCalifornia Institute of Technology. He marriesKatherine "Kitty" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair withJean Tatlock, a troubledcommunistpsychiatrist who later dies in an apparent suicide.[a]
Whennuclear fission is discoveredin 1938, after the Germans succeed in splitting the atom, Oppenheimer realizes it can be weaponized. In 1942, duringWorld War II, U.S. Army ColonelLeslie Groves, the director of theManhattan Project, recruits Oppenheimer as the director of theLos Alamos Laboratoryto develop anatomic bomb. Oppenheimer fears theGerman nuclear research program, led by Heisenberg, might yield afission bombfor theNazissooner.
Oppenheimer assembles a team consisting of Rabi,Hans Bethe, andEdward Teller, and collaborates with the scientistsEnrico Fermi,Leo Szilard, andDavid L. Hillat theUniversity of Chicago. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation coulddestroy the world; after consulting withAlbert Einsteinand having Bethe do his own calculations on the matter, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are "near zero". Teller attempts to leave the project after his proposal to construct ahydrogen bombis rejected, but Oppenheimer convinces him to stay.
AfterGermany's surrenderin 1945, some scientists question the bomb's relevance. Oppenheimer believes it would end theongoing Pacific Warand save lives. TheTrinity testis successful, and PresidentHarry S. Trumanorders theatomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, resulting inJapan'ssurrender. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is guilt-ridden and haunted by the destruction and mass fatalities. After Oppenheimer expresses his remorse to Truman, the president berates him and dismisses his plea to cease further atomic development.
As an advisor to theUnited States Atomic Energy Commission(AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoningCold War. AEC ChairmanLewis Straussresents Oppenheimer for publicly dismissing Strauss's concerns about exportingradioactive isotopesand for recommending negotiations with theSoviet Unionafter the Sovietssuccessfully detonate their own bomb. Strauss also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947, though he had in fact expressed his belief that he had caused achain reactionthat would one daydestroy the world.
In 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestratesa private security hearingbefore a Personnel Security Board concerning the renewal of Oppenheimer'sQ clearance, during which his loyalty to the United States is questioned. However, the hearing is akangaroo court. Oppenheimer's past communist ties are raised and his associates' testimony is twisted against him, with Teller's being the most damaging. After Kitty vigorously defends herself and her husband, the board no longer suspects Oppenheimer of disloyalty but stillrevokeshis clearance, thereby damaging his public image and limiting his influence on American nuclear policy.
In 1959, during Strauss'sSenate confirmation hearingforSecretary of Commerce, Hill unexpectedly testifies about Strauss's personal motives for engineering Oppenheimer's downfall. Strauss's nomination is narrowly voted down, enraging him. In 1963, PresidentLyndon B. Johnsonpresents Oppenheimer with theEnrico Fermi Award.
DirectorSam Mendeswas interested in adapting the 2005 Oppenheimer biographyAmerican PrometheusbyKai BirdandMartin J. Sherwin. After that project failed to materialize, the book wasoptionedby various filmmakers over the next fifteen years. The authors became pessimistic about a film adaptation.Oliver Stonedeclined an opportunity to direct, saying "I couldn't find my way to its essence".[54][55]In 2015, J. David Wargo optioned the book, then commissioned and rejected several scripts. During theCOVID-19 pandemic, Wargo flew toHollywoodto meet with actorJames Woods, who set up a meeting withCharles Roven, a producer for variousChristopher Nolanfilms, and in turn, Roven gave a copy of the book to Nolan. Both Wargo and Woods are executive producers of the film.[55]Woods said he was asked not to promote the film because his outspoken political views posed a risk to the film's commercial success and awards campaign.[56]
Nolan had long desired to make a film about Oppenheimer, even prior to readingAmerican Prometheus.[57]In 2019, towards the end of production on Nolan's science-fiction filmTenet(2020), starRobert Pattinsongave him a book of Oppenheimer's speeches. According to Nolan, the speeches showed Oppenheimer "wrestling with the implications ... of what's happened and what [he's] done". Nolan wanted to depict "what it would have been like to be Oppenheimer in those moments", in contrast toTenet, which employstime travelto curb a potentialweapon of mass destruction.[58][5]
In December 2020,Warner Bros. Picturesannounced plans to give its 2021 films simultaneous releases in theaters and onHBO Max, citing theimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. Nolan, who had partnered with Warner Bros. on each of his films sinceInsomnia(2002), was outraged, as he was a staunch supporter of traditional film exhibition.[59]In January 2021, media reports mentioned the possibility that Nolan's next film could be the first not to be financed or distributed by Warner Bros.[60]By mid-2021, Nolan had left Warner Bros. and was meeting with other studios to develop his new project.[5]Nolan had previously supported Warner Bros.' decision to giveWonder Woman 1984(2020) a simultaneous release, saying he felt that situation had been handled properly, but said he had been excluded from any discussions regarding the postponed release ofTenet.[61][62]
In September 2021, it was announced that Nolan would write and direct a biographical film about Oppenheimer and his contributions to theManhattan Project, with Cillian Murphy in negotiations to star.[63][64]Due to his strained relationship with Warner Bros., Nolan approached multiple studios, includingSony,Universal,Paramount, andApple.[65][66]According to insiders, Paramount was ruled out early in the process due to the replacement of the CEO and chairman,Jim Gianopulos, withBrian Robbins, an advocate for increased streaming-service releases.[66]
Nolan signed with Universal because he had previously worked withDonna Langley, chairwoman and chief content officer of theNBCUniversalstudio group, on an unsuccessful attempt to make a film version of the UK television seriesThe Prisoner.[67]Langley agreed with Nolan's stance on traditional film exhibition and Universal agreed to finance and distributeOppenheimer, with production set to begin in the first quarter of 2022.[68]Universal also agreed to Nolan's terms, which included a production budget of $100 million,[69]an equal marketing budget, an exclusive theatrical window ranging from 90 to 120 days, 20 percent of the film'sfirst-dollar gross, and a three-week period both before and after the opening, in which Universal could not release another new film.[66][5]
Nolan became aware of Oppenheimer as a youth, after hearing the lyric "How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?" in theStingsong "Russians" (1985).[70]He was also inspired by hisfears of nuclear holocaustthroughout childhood, as he lived during the era ofCampaign for Nuclear Disarmament(CND) and theanti-nuclear protestsinRAF Greenham Common. He felt that "while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away", and felt the 2022Russian invasion of Ukrainehad caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[58]Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic ofHoward Hughesapproximately during the time of production ofMartin Scorsese'sThe Aviator(2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[57]Emily Bluntdescribed theOppenheimerscript as "emotional" and remarked that Nolan had "Trojan-Horseda biopic into a thriller".[71]
By September 2021, both Roven and Nolan had begun contacting Bird and Sherwin to discuss the script. During Bird's first meeting with Nolan, he had already written aspec scriptwhile they discussed the script's content, although Nolan did not disclose the script to them yet.[72]Oppenheimeris the first screenplay written by Nolan in thefirst person, as he wanted the narrative to be conveyed from Oppenheimer's perspective. He described the "texture" of the film being "how the personal interacts with the historic and the geopolitical" with the intention of making it acautionary tale.[57][73][74]He began developing the script after he completedTenetand wrote it in only a few months; he had already been thinking about making a film about Oppenheimer for over 20 years.[57]
A major plot element is Oppenheimer's response to the long-term consequences of his actions. Nolan wished to explore the phenomenon of delayed reactions, as he felt people are not "necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of [their actions] in the moment".[70]He also chose to alternate between scenes in color andblack-and-whiteto convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, respectively,[75]with most of Oppenheimer's view shown via the former, while the latter depicts a "more objective view of his story from a different character's point of view".[76][70]Wanting to make the film as subjective as possible, the production team decided to include visions of Oppenheimer's conceptions of the quantum world and waves of energy.[77]Nolan noted that while Oppenheimer never publicly apologized for his role in theatomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he still believed Oppenheimer had felt genuine guilt for his actions and thus portrayed him as exhibiting those feelings.[78]
I think of any character I've dealt with, Oppenheimer is by far the most ambiguous and paradoxical. Which, given that I've madethree Batman films, is saying a lot.
Nolan began by trying to find the "thread that connected the quantum realm, the vibration of energy, and Oppenheimer's own personal journey" and sought to portray the difficulties in his life, particularly regarding his sex life.[58]As such, Nolan wanted to candidly portray his affair withJean Tatlock. He also wanted to explore Tatlock's influence on Oppenheimer's life, since she was a Communist, which had "enormous ramifications for [Oppenheimer's] later life and his ultimate fate".[79]Nolan also sought to explore the relationship between Oppenheimer and AdmiralLewis Strauss, former chair of theU.S. Atomic Energy Commission, having been inspired by the relationship betweenWolfgang Amadeus MozartandAntonio Salierias depicted inAmadeus(1984).[70]
Another critical moment of the film was the meeting in which PresidentHarry S. Trumancalled Oppenheimer a "crybaby". Nolan wanted to convey the scene from Oppenheimer's perspective and felt it was a "massive moment of disillusion, a huge turning point [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with", while also underscoring that it is a "huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception".[57]He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the "highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible".[74]For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work. However, he did have the intention to present a "strong set of troubling reverberations at the end".[78]
Oppenheimermarks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Cillian Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. To prepare for the role, Murphy read extensively on Oppenheimer's life and was inspired byDavid Bowie's appearance in the 1970s.[80][10][70]Nolan called Murphy one day to ask him to play the part, and Murphy enthusiastically accepted, excited to play a lead role in a Nolan film. Afterward, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet with Murphy, who read the script in Nolan's hotel room.[81]Murphy lost an undisclosed amount of weight for the role in order to better match the real-life Oppenheimer's gaunt appearance.[82]Nolan also set up a phone call between Murphy and Nobel laureateKip Thorne, who had previously worked with Nolan onInterstellar(2014).[57]As a graduate student, Thorne had attended some of Oppenheimer's seminars, and explained to Murphy his experience with Oppenheimer's gift for facilitating group discussions of difficult scientific concepts.[57]
The casting process was so secretive that some cast members did not know which role they would be playing until they signed on.[37]Robert Downey Jr.,Matt Damon, andEmily Blunttook pay cuts to work on the film, with each earning $4 million in lieu of their usual $10–20 million upfront salary.[83]Downey went to Nolan's house to read the script, which was printed in black on red paper.[84]Downey would later describeOppenheimeras "the best film" in which he has appeared to date.[85]Downey previously met with Nolan for the role ofJonathan Crane / ScarecrowinBatman Begins(2005), but Nolan felt Downey wasn't right for the role, which went to Murphy.[86]Blunt met Nolan in Los Angeles and, when she was offered the role ofKatherine "Kitty" Oppenheimer, she enthusiastically accepted; she also contacted Murphy to get an expectation of what working with Nolan would be like.[84]Asked to play the part ofLeslie Groves, Damon—who had appeared in Nolan'sInterstellar—was taking a break from acting as a result of negotiations with his wife Luciana Bozán Barroso incouples therapy, but signed on toOppenheimeras he had reserved one exception: if Nolan offered him a role in a film.[87]
Nolan cast writer-directorBenny Safdieas physicistEdward Tellerafter asking directorPaul Thomas Andersonabout his experience directing Safdie inLicorice Pizza(2021).[88]Safdie had worked alongside a nuclear physicist atColumbia Universitywhile in high school.[70]It is Nolan's first film sinceInsomnia(2002) to not featureMichael Caine.[89]Glen Powellauditioned and was rejected for the role that went toJosh Hartnett.[90]For Harry S. Truman's appearance, Nolan sought his collaboratorGary Oldman, who was on a break from filming theApple TV+seriesSlow Horses(2022–present); Oldman told Nolan that he was contractually obliged to not cut his hair, so either he could play Truman with a prosthetic cap and a wig or get someone else to play the part, which Nolan agreed.[91]
Pre-productionhad begun by January 2022 in New Mexico, where a two-day casting call took place inSanta FeandLos Alamosfor people to audition to play local residents, military personnel, and scientists.[92][93]Another casting call was held in February.[94]
Principal photographybegan on February 28, 2022, atGhost Ranchin New Mexico,[95]and lasted for 57 days withHoyte van Hoytemaserving as cinematographer.[82][24]The originalshooting schedulehad set aside approximately 85 days for filming.[96]However, during pre-production, it had become clear that principal photography could not be completed within $100 million over that many days on location all over theUnited States.[96]To efficiently use the budget forlocation shootingin California and New Jersey and constructing high-quality historically accurate sets in New Mexico, Nolan compressed the shooting schedule from 85 to 57 days.[96][97]Murphy, who appears in nearly every scene, described the pace as "insane".[96]
Oldman said he would be on set for a day in May for "one scene, a page and a half".[52]The original choice forOval Officelocation in theNixon Presidential Libraryfell through a week before filming, and since Oldman's dates were unmovable, the production design team redressed the Oval Office set from theHBOseriesVeep(2012–2019), which according to Ruth De Jong had fallen into "nightmarish" disrepair.[98]Nolan filmed his eldest child, his daughter Flora, in a scene in which she played a young woman disintegrated in a nuclear explosion. It appears in the film as one of Oppenheimer's visions, in which Nolan intended to show "that if you create the ultimate destructive power, it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you".[58]
The film used a combination ofIMAX65 mm and65 mm large-formatfilm.[10]It is also the first film to shoot sections on IMAXblack-and-whitephotographic film, whichKodakcreated andFotoKemdeveloped specifically for the film.[100][101]Van Hoytema used 50 mm and 80 mm Hasselblad lenses when filming on the IMAX MKIV or IMAX MSM 9802 cameras, while scenes shot on the Panavision Panaflex System 65 Studio cameras were shot using Panavision Sphero 65 and Panavision System 65 lenses.[102]Additionally, the production had Panavision construct a custom probe lens to allow the filmmakers to use IMAX cameras formacro photographyandmicrophotographyto record theminiature effects.[103]Miniatures were filmed with IMAX cameras at 48 frames per second, while miniatures needing higher speed were shot on35 mm filmwith anArriflex 435 EScamera at 150 frames per second.[104][105][106][107]In the second week of April, filming took place on location at theInstitute for Advanced StudyinPrinceton, New Jersey.[108]Filming also occurred in California,[51]primarily around thecampus of the University of California, Berkeley.[109]Scenes set in the city ofBerkeleyitself were filmed inPasadena.[110]
During a 2021 research trip, Nolan discovered that Los Alamos had drastically changed from its 1940s appearance and could not be used for exterior shots of the town; for example, the town's equivalent of aMain Streethas aStarbucks.[95]Instead, the production team constructed a version of 1940s-era Los Alamos on top of a similar plateau at Ghost Ranch.[95]It took three months to build the set, which was used for only six shooting days.[95]The general plan was to shoot only exterior shots on the set at Ghost Ranch, then shoot interior shots on location inside various historic buildings in the real town of Los Alamos.[110]Interior shooting in Los Alamos began on March 8, 2022.[95]Many scenes in the film take place in academic lecture halls; to save time and money, the production team decided against attempting to reconstruct those halls as sets at Ghost Ranch, and shot them inside a historicWomen's Army Corpsdormitory in Los Alamos.[95]Scenes were also filmed in Oppenheimer's original cabin in Los Alamos, which had been restored.Kai Birdvisited the set and was impressed by Murphy's performance.[111]The New York hotel scenes were shot in Albuquerque'sOld Post Office building, while the Washington, D.C. scenes were shot in state government buildings in the state capital of Santa Fe.[110]
Although the news coverage surrounding the film's release implied that most of the film was shot in New Mexico, the official making-of bookUnleashing Oppenheimerrevealed that many of the film's most important scenes were shot within thestudio zoneinLos Angeles County. Early on, three days were set aside for filming atUCLA's Kerckhoff Hall, which was used for both the Cambridge and Göttingen scenes.[112]TheMillennium Biltmore HotelinDowntown Los Angelesstood in for theMark Hopkins Hotelfor one of Oppenheimer's encounters with Tatlock, for thePlaza Hotelfor Strauss's 1949 birthday celebration,[113]and for an unnamed Washington, D.C. hotel for the scene where Szilard and Hill try to get Oppenheimer to sign a petition against dropping the bomb on Japan.[114]Oppenheimer's security hearing was shot inAlhambra, California, in a "disused office building in the former manufacturing headquarters for the petrochemical company C.F. Braun & Co."[115]The scene in which Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked was shot on May 19, 2022, the production's last day in Alhambra.[116]
Filming involved the use of real explosives to recreate theTrinitynuclear test, forgoing the use ofcomputer-generated graphics.[117]When this news first broke online, many fans (aware of Nolan's famous preference for in-camera practical effects) thought it meant he had set off a real atomic bomb.[5]Nolan later remarked that it was both "flattering" and "scary" that his fans would think that of him.[5]The production team was able to obtain government permission to film atWhite Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[5][110]The production filmed the Trinity test scenes inBelen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[5][110]A special set was built in which gasoline,propane,aluminum powder, andmagnesiumwere used to create the explosive effect.[58]Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the special effects supervisor, Scott R. Fisher, referred to them as "big-atures", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. To make the models look closer to their intended real-life size, the team usedforced perspective.[118][119]Visualizations of the interactions between atoms, molecules and energy waves, as well as the depiction of stars, black holes and supernovas, were also achieved through practical methods. Nolan claimed the film contains no computer-generated effects,[120]and used practical effects to achieve "real-world imagery".[121]
The last portion of principal photography was for Nolan and van Hoytema to travel to Europe to obtainestablishing shotsfor the early European phase of Oppenheimer's life.  For example, they did not bother with shooting in any actual part of the University of Cambridge; "van Hoytema simply set up a camera acrossthe river".[122]Filmingwrappedin May 2022.[123]
Editing was completed byJennifer Lame, who had previously editedTenet.[10]While inspecting the footage during editing, Nolan and Lame performed "character passes" to ensure all the characters were properly displayed on screen, due to the film having a faster pace than most traditional blockbusters.[70]Visual effectswere handled byDNEG, which produced more than 100 VFX shots from more than 400 practically shot elements,[124]marking their eighth collaboration with Nolan.Andrew Jacksonwas the visual effects supervisor,[125]who stated that the film used mostly "invisible" visual effects through "'in-camera' special effects created on set".[126]Digitalcompositingwas used for the Trinity scene to add multi-layers to the explosion which was shot in a multifaceted viewpoint.[127]There were 160 VFX artists who worked on the film, 134 of whom were left uncredited.[128]
Steven Spielbergwas the first person to see the final cut, in a private screening of its first 70mm print. Nolan said: "He said some very kind things, but really just to watch him watch ... I wasn't even supposed to watch it with him, but seeing the great master watching? It was sort of irresistible."[129][130]
Ludwig Göranssoncomposed the score for the film, after doing so for Nolan's previous film,Tenet.[10]Göransson's score was featured in a trailer for the film on May 8, 2023.[131]It was also featured in the Universal Pictures exclusive five-minute Opening Look on July 13.[132][133]Nolan had advised him to use a solo violin for Oppenheimer's central theme in the film, with Göransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from "the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds".[70]
Oppenheimer's teaser trailer was released on July 28, 2022, featuring a live countdown to 5:29 a.m. (MDT) on July 16, 2023, the 78th anniversary ofthe first detonation of an atomic weapon; it premiered in screenings ofNopebefore being posted online on Universal's social media profiles.[134]Empirecommented that it is exemplary of Nolan's style: "heady, brooding stuff with a real sense of weight".[135]
In December 2022, two trailers premiered in front ofAvatar: The Way of Water, with one being exclusive to IMAX theaters and the other being shown in all other formats. The latter was eventually released online.[136][137]In May 2023, an official main trailer debuted during preview screenings ofGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. It was subsequently released to the public on May 8, 2023, alongside a theatrical release poster.[138]
Oppenheimerhad its world premiere atLe Grand Rexin Paris on July 11, 2023,[139]followed by the British premiere atOdeon Luxe Leicester Squarein London on July 13,[140]and the American premiere atAMCLincoln Square13 in New York City on July 17.[141]Both the London and the New York premieres were affected by theSAG-AFTRA strike, as some actors left the London premiere early,[140]and Universal Pictures canceled thered carpetevent for the New York premiere.[141]SAG-AFTRAPresidentFran Drescherlater claimed the studios "duped" the guild into accepting a twelve-day-extension for negotiations to continue promoting summer films likeOppenheimer.[142]Oppenheimerwas released theatrically on July 21, 2023, by Universal Pictures.[10][143]In addition to standarddigital cinemas, it was also released in various film formats including IMAX 70 mm (30 prints),standard 70 mm(113 prints) and35 mm(around 80 prints).[144]
The film was released on the same day asBarbie, afantasycomedyfilm directed byGreta Gerwigbased onMattel'sBarbiefashion dolls and media franchise, and distributed by Warner Bros. Many speculated that the decision by Warner Bros. to releaseBarbieon the same day asOppenheimerwas made in order to deplete ticket sales ofOppenheimeras retaliation for Nolan releasing the film with Universal.[145]Due to the tonal and genre dissonance between the two films, many social media users createdmemesabout how the two films appealed to different audiences,[146]and how they should be viewed as adouble feature.[147]The trend was dubbed "Barbenheimer",[148]and was described ascounterprogrammingduring a summer of "entertainment industry meltdown".[149]Cillian Murphy had endorsed the phenomenon, saying "My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain."[150]
In March 2022, Universal Pictures halted the release of its titles in Russia, joining other major American film distributors in theboycott against the countryfollowingits invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.[151]Oppenheimerhad also been banned by Russia'sMinistry of Culture, which had refused to license screenings of the film, stating that it did not meet their goals of "preserving and strengthening traditional Russian spiritual values".[152]
The film was not released in Japan until eight months after its initial global release.Varietynoted the controversial reputation in Japan due to theatomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A Universal spokesperson said that "plans have not been finalized in all markets". American films are often released in Japan a few months after the initial theatrical release.[153]In December 2023, the independent Japanese film distributor Bitters End announced that it would theatrically release the film in 2024, as Universal's distributor in JapanToho-Towaopted not to release it.[154][155]The film was later released by Bitters End in Japan on March 29, and during its first three days, it was ranked as the country's highest grossing foreign film after making 379.3 million yen ($2.5 million) at the box office.[156][157]
In the United States, the film received anR-ratingfrom theMotion Picture Associationfor "some sexuality, nudity, and language". It is Nolan's first film to receive that rating sinceInsomnia(2002).[158]In Australia, the film received an MA 15+ rating from theAustralian Classification Boardboard for "strong sex and a suicide scene".[159]In the United Kingdom, the film received a 15 certificate from theBritish Board of Film Classificationfor "strong language and sex", meaning anyone under the age of 15 cannot be admitted to view the film.[160]In some countries, including those in the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, Universal distributed a version of the film with Florence Pugh's nude body covered by a computer-generated black dress.[161][162][163]
In India,Oppenheimerwas released with all scenes depicting nudity, sex and cigarette smoking being censored, earning theU/A certificatefrom theCentral Board of Film Certification(CBFC) while retaining the running time.[164]
The audio of the scene in which Tatlock directs Oppenheimer to read a verse from the Hindu scriptureBhagavad Gita, "I am become Death, destroyer of worlds", remained intact.[165]AsNDTVreported, theMinister for Information and BroadcastingAnurag Thakurquestioned how the CBFC certified the film with the verse heard during such circumstance in the first place, and asked the scene to be deleted.[166]Hindu nationalistswere angered by the scene and demanded its removal.[167]Among them was journalistUday Mahurkar, who wrote an open letter to Nolan calling the scene a "direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus", and demanded its removal from all releases ofOppenheimeracross the world.[165]On the other hand, actorNitish BharadwajtoldThe Times of Indiathat "The use of this verse in the film should also be understood from Oppenheimer's emotional state of mind. A scientist thinks of his creation 24x7x365 days, irrespective of what he is doing. His mind space is consumed fully of his creation & the physical act is just a natural mechanical act."[168]
Oppenheimerwas released onUltra HD Blu-ray, regularBlu-rayandDVDformats includingdigitalon November 21, 2023.[169]As the former two releases sold out days after release, Universal worked on restocking before the holiday season.[170]Nolan was vocal during the home release campaign of the film about the importance of physical media libraries, stating that letting films only exist digitally or onstreaming servicesallows companies to have too much control and creates a danger for film preservation.[171][172]The film was released for streaming in the United States exclusively onPeacockand in Canada onAmazon Prime Videoon February 16, 2024.[173][174]Additionally, it began streaming onJio Cinemain India from March 21, 2024.[175]
Oppenheimergrossed $330.1 million in the United States and Canada and $645.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $976 million;[6][7]$190 million of which came from IMAX alone.[176]It is thethird-highest-grossing R-rated filmof all time behindJoker(2019) andDeadpool & Wolverine(2024).[177][178]In September 2023,Oppenheimerbecame the highest-grossing biographical film of all time, surpassingBohemian Rhapsody(2018).[179][180]
By August 2023,Oppenheimerhad become the highest-grossing film ever to not reach the top spot at the domestic box office, although in its sixth weekend it topped the worldwide box office with a total of $38.12 million, surpassingBarbiefor the first time.[181]It is also the highest grossing World War II-related film, surpassingDunkirk(2017), also a Nolan film.[182][183]Additionally,Oppenheimerbecame one of the top five highest-grossing IMAX releases, earning $183 million[184](approximately 20% of its total gross), over $17 million of which was earned from the 30 screens showing IMAX 70 mm prints.[185]The film was booked to be rereleased in IMAX theaters on November 3, including six IMAX 70 mm prints, as these theaters reported selling out during the initial release.[184]Deadline Hollywoodcalculated the net profit of the film to be $201.9million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[186]
In the United States and Canada,Oppenheimerwas released alongsideBarbie,[187]in what became known as 'Barbenheimer'. The week of their releases,AMC Theatresannounced that over 40,000 AMC Stubs members had already pre-booked tickets to both films on the same day.[188]After grossing $33 million on its first day (including $10.5 million from Thursday night previews), it went on to debut to $82.5 million,[189]finishing second behindBarbieand marking one of the best opening weekends ever for an R-rated drama.[190]64% of the audience was male, with 33% being 18–34 years old. The Barbenheimer phenomenon was credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend being for the two films (27% forOppenheimer), a combined total of 18.5 million people.[191]The opening weekend was Nolan's best for an original film, being the highest of his filmography outside of the latter two films fromThe Dark Knighttrilogy.[192]It achieved the third-highest opening weekend for a biopic film, behindThe Passion of the Christ(2004) andAmerican Sniper(2014).[193]
Oppenheimermade $46.2 million in its second weekend (a drop of 44%), remaining in second behindBarbie.[194][195]The film made $28.7 million in its third weekend, finishing third behindBarbieand newcomerMeg 2: The Trench.[196]On August 16,OppenheimersurpassedSing(2016) to become the highest-grossing film to never reach the number one spot at the box office.[197][198]During its fourth weekend, the film made $18.8 million (a drop of 35%) rising back up to second place.[199]In its fifth and sixth weekends, the film grossed $10.7 million and $9 million (a drop of 43% and 16% respectively), finishing in third and fourth place at the box office and passing $300 million domestically in its sixth weekend.[199]Following its 13 Oscar nominations, the film expanded from 1,008 theaters to 2,262 in its 28th week of release and made $1 million, an increase of 284% from the previous weekend.[200][201]
In Japan,Oppenheimerwas released on March 29, 2024.[202][203]Prior to its release, it attracted controversy there, and Warner Bros. issued an apology following criticism of the Barbenheimer phenomenon as insensitive.[204]Despite the outcry, the film would do very well in Japan, grossing $2.5 million and placing third in the country's box office during its opening weekend.[205][206][207]
The film received a range of comments from the Japanese public. Some theaters displayed content warnings for the film.[208]A number of people from Hiroshima who viewed the film reported feeling discomfort and distress while watching it.[209]One point of contention was on the choice to not visually depict thenuclear bombing of Japan. A number of Japanese people praised the choice and others felt that it resulted in the downplaying or glorification of the bombing.[209][210][211]Takashi Hiraoka, former mayor of Hiroshima, reportedly felt that the horror of nuclear weapons had not been sufficiently portrayed in the film.[209][210]A number of people reported feeling that Oppenheimer was glorified in the film for his role in developing the bomb, and a number of people felt that he was also a victim of his circumstances and experienced distress from it.[209][211]Masao Tomonaga, who experienced one of the nuclear bombings, felt that the film was "anti-nuclear" and expressed disappointment in the lack of a scene for the atomic bombing in Japan, but was reportedly satisfied with the portrayal of Oppenheimer's distress after the bombings.[209]A Hiroshima resident was reported advocating for more people to see the film,[209]and another advocated for fewer.[211]
When commenting onOppenheimer'ssuccess in the country,USC School of Cinematic Arts'Vice Dean of Faculty, Akira Mizuta Lippit, stated in an article forDeadline Hollywoodin May 2024, "Previous films about Japan, good and bad, some offensive or ignorant, have nonetheless enjoyed box office success in Japan," noting how films likePearl HarborandThe Last Samuraiwere "embraced by Japanese audiences," whereas other films likeMemoirs of a Geishawere "a little less so."[207]
Outside the United States and Canada,Oppenheimergrossed $98 million in its opening weekend.[212]The following weekend, it earned $77.1 million, dropping by 21% to become Nolan's highest-grossing film in 30 countries, including India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Turkey.[213]In its third weekend,Oppenheimergrossed $52.8 million (a drop of 31%)[214]and $32 million in its fourth weekend.[215]It held well in the following weeks, making $32 million and $29.1 million in its fifth and sixth weekends.[216][217]As of September 10, 2023, the highest-grossing territories were the UK ($75 million), China ($61.6 million), Germany ($51.9 million), France ($43.1 million) and Australia ($25.9 million).[218]
Oppenheimerreceived critical acclaim.[b]Critics praised the film primarily for its screenplay, cast performances, and visuals.[c]It was frequently ranked as one of Nolan's best films,[233][234][225][d]and one of the best of 2023, although some criticism was aimed towards the writing of the female characters.[229]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 93% of 508 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "Oppenheimermarks another engrossing achievement from Christopher Nolan that benefits from Murphy'stour-de-forceperformance and stunning visuals."[236]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100, based on 69 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[237]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled byPostTrakgave it a 93% overall positive score, with 74% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[191]
Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-TimesgaveOppenheimera perfect four out of four, describing it as "magnificent" and "one of the best films of the 21st century".[238]The A.V. Club'sMatthew Jackson deemed it a "masterpiece", adding that "it's Christopher Nolan's best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers and a movie that burns itself into your brain".[239]Empire's Dan Jolin labeled it a "masterfully constructed character study", taking particular note of Murphy's performance and van Hoytema's IMAX cinematography.[240]Peter Suderman, writing forReason, said that the film leaves the viewer with a sense of "fear and foreboding about the horror of full-on nuclear conflict in the wake of the nuclear bomb. Humanity is both greatandterrible.Oppenheimerisn't just a movie—it's a warning."[241]
Matt Zoller Seitz, writing forRogerEbert.com, awardedOppenheimera full four out of four rating. He lauded Nolan's storytelling, exploration of Oppenheimer's character and its technical achievements, concluding: "As a physical experience,Oppenheimeris something else entirely—it's hard to say exactly what and that's what's so fascinating about it". He also compared the role of the conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein in the film to the role of "Rosebud" inCitizen Kane.[242]Peter Traversdescribed the film as a "monumental achievement" and "one of the best films you'll see anywhere".[243]Caryn JamesofBBC Culturesimilarly termed it "boldly imaginative and [Nolan's] most mature work yet", adding that it combined the "explosive, commercially-enticing action ofThe Dark Knighttrilogy" with the "cerebral underpinnings" ofMemento,InceptionandTenet.[244]IGNcritic Siddhant Adlakha rankedOppenheimer10/10, describing it as "a three-hour biopic that plays like a jolting thriller" and Nolan's most "abstract" work yet.[245]
In August 2023, it ranked number three onCollider's list of "The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far," with the site writing that Nolan "explores the world's obsession with destructive nuclear weapons from the perspective of their creator; using theGreek mythofDante[sic] as an inspiration,Oppenheimermakes it clear that once this type of power is unleashed, it is bound to be used again."[246]
Despite praising the film's themes and performances,CNN's Brian Lowry believed that "Nolan juggles a lot, in a way that somewhat works to the movie's detriment".[247][248]Owen GleibermanofVarietyfound the film's first half "mesmerizing" and "tick[ing] with cosmic suspense", but wrote that "a certain humming intensity leaks out of the movie" after the Trinity Test sequence, which was itself described as a "letdown".[249]Manohla DargisofThe New York Timescalled the film "a brilliant achievement in formal and conceptual terms", praising Nolan for capturing "the kinetic excitement of intellectual discourse" and comparing the film's complex narrative structure to a "Cubisticportrait". However, she found some of the cameos by supporting actors such as Malek "distracting", and noted that the film's black-and-white scenes could feel "overlong" despite ultimately working in service of Nolan's narrative intentions.[250]In a mixed review, Odie Henderson ofThe Boston Globecalled the film "visually stunning but emotionally empty", criticizing Nolan's screenplay for rendering Oppenheimer an "enigma whose inner life is expressed by gimmicky cuts to scenes of outer space rather than evidence of human emotions." Furthermore, Henderson negatively characterized the film's second half as "an interminable series of scenes set in courtrooms and at congressional hearings", and felt Pugh and Blunt were "wasted" in "severely underwritten" roles.[251]
While praising how the film acknowledges the contribution of "American scientists and American enterprise",Brett Masoncomplained that it omits the crucial contributions of non-Americans who ensured the work was able to commence as early as December 1941: "Nolan completely ignores the crucial role that British science and Australian physicistMark Oliphantplayed in jump-starting the quest."[252]Writing for theLos Angeles Times,Justin Changdefended Nolan's accurate depiction of how Oppenheimer could not see the true victims of his work. Chang wrote that instead of satisfying "representational completists" by detouring toHiroshimaandNagasaki, "Nolan treats them instead as a profound absence, an indictment by silence".[219]Chang later won the 2024Pulitzer Prize for Criticismfor that article.[253]Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkerdescribed the film as a "History Channelmovie with fancy editing" and wrote, "I was tempted to call it a movie-lengthWikipediaarticle. But after a look online, I realized I was giving Wikipedia too little credit—or Christopher Nolan, the movie's writer and director, too much".[254]
ForIndieWire's annualcritics poll, in which 158 critics and journalists from around the world voted,Oppenheimerwas placed second in their Best Film list, with 69 overall mentions and 17 first-place votes. Nolan was also ranked second on the Best Director list, while his screenplay was placed eighth. Murphy was the highest-placed actor on the Best Performance list (fourth overall) while Van Hoytema's work topped the Best Cinematography list.[255]Oppenheimeralso appeared in over 410 critics' lists of the best films released in 2023, and was ranked first in 99 of them.[256]
Oliver Stonedeemed the film "a classic, which I never believed could be made in this climate".[257]Paul SchradercalledOppenheimer, "the best, most important film of this century",[258]whileDenis Villeneuvecalled it "a masterpiece".[259]Steven Soderberghsaid of the film, "Oppenheimeris a real accomplishment. I read somewhere that Chris [Nolan] implied that this is the movie he's been building toward, and I think he's right. And I'm thrilled that it's a massive hit."[260]Spike Leealso praised the film, calling it a "great film", but felt that it should have shown what happened to the Japanese people, given the film's length.[261]Japanese directorTakashi Yamazakisaid, "As a person of Japanese ancestry and descent, my response toOppenheimer[is that] I would like to dedicate a different film to that when that day comes."[262]Other filmmakers, includingA. V. Rockwell,Joe Dante,Reinaldo Marcus Green,Chad Hartigan,Max Hechtman,Don Hertzfeldt,Matt Johnson,Raine Allen-Miller,James PonsoldtandAdam Wingardcited it as among their favorite films of 2023.[263][264]
Korean film critic Yim Jeong-sik said "Oppenheimerdepicts the tragedy of the combination of science and politics. Oppenheimer developed the atomic bomb to stop theNazisfrom developingnuclear weapons, but the result was the bomb dropped onJapanand countless casualties. The film coldly shows how science loses its purity and becomes a tool of the state through the process of Oppenheimer's choice combining withAmerica's imperial ambitions."[265]
The renewed attention to theTrinitysite and associated nuclear testing encouraged theUnited States Congressto revise theRadiation Exposure Compensation Act(1990), which provided compensation programs for people affected by radiation and nuclear testing during theCold War, known as "Downwinders" and primarily consisting of theNavajo Nation. TheUnited States Senateapproved amendments to accommodate additional services to people inNew Mexico, but it has not passed through Congress as theHouse of Representativeshad not yet debated its inclusion as part of the national defense bill for the 2024 fiscal year.[266][needs update]
Some scenes in the movie were taken word-for-word out of the book or real life events.[269]Many of the changes are small embellishments or changes from real life. For example, Oppenheimer was not as excited about his discovery of black holes as shown in the film since he did not know how significant it would become. The study was indeed released on the same dayGermany invaded Poland, as shown in the film. During the Trinity test, Donald Hornig had his hand on the kill switch for a faster reaction time and not near it as depicted in the film. Truman did call Oppenheimer a "crybaby" but in a letter toDean Achesonone year later, not immediately after meeting Oppenheimer.[269][270]
It was also pointed out that the incorrectAmerican flagwas used. In the film, the current 50-star flag is shown. This version was not adopted until 1960. During the war, the American flag had only 48 stars as Hawaii and Alaska had yet to become states.[271]
The scene where Oppenheimer poisons his tutor's apple at university is based on accounts that Oppenheimer gave of the incident, but it is unclear whether it occurred in real life.[272]Oppenheimer is depicted as puttingpotassium cyanidein the apple before having a change of heart the next day and narrowly preventing it from being eaten. There is no evidence that Niels Bohr nearly ate the apple or had any involvement in the incident.[269]Oppenheimer and Einstein were friends,[273]but the specific conversations which the film revolves around never happened.[269]Oppenheimer took his concerns about an unstoppable chain reaction to physicistKarl ComptonatMIT, not Einstein.[269]Although the film portrays Groves' aggressive recruitment of Oppenheimer,Arthur Comptonat theMetallurgical Laboratoryhad earlier recruited and appointed Oppenheimer to take over the research into the bomb-design part of what became the Manhattan Project.[274]
As Strauss correctly points out in the film's dialogue, Oppenheimer never expressed regret for the atomic bombings, but as Chang explained in his Pulitzer Prize-winning article, the true situation not depicted in the film was even worse: Oppenheimer avoided giving an apology when confronted by a reporter during his 1960 visit to Tokyo and Osaka.[219]In addition to their interpersonal conflicts, Strauss had another reason to undermine Oppenheimer's credibility by revoking his security clearance: Oppenheimer was opposed to further development of thehydrogen bombby the United States.Scott Sagandescribes the loss of Oppenheimer's influence as a possible constraint upon thenuclear arms racebetween the United States and USSR as a "broader tragedy" less clearly depicted in the film than the scientist's personal tragedy, but he called the production "highly accurate" otherwise for a Hollywood film.[275]
Many efforts undertaken at other Manhattan Project sites likeHanford, WashingtonandOak Ridge, Tennesseewere not shown.[270]Most of them, overseen by GeneralLeslie Groves, focused on understanding and producing the radioactive material that powered the nuclear explosions.[276]In addition to the team at Los Alamos, those working at other Project sites, particularly the University of Chicago'sMetallurgical Laboratory, also expressed concerns about using the atomic bomb against Japan.[277]The film was criticised for its omission of the 30Native Americanfamilies who were forcibly displaced from Los Alamos in 1942 to make space for the experiment.[278]
Another technical problem accurately represented throughout the film was plutonium production. This can be analyzed through the occurrence of discussions offizzle, ingenuity, engineering breakthroughs and setbacks, and once again, the determination to succeed. The film focused on the great cost it took to obtain the plutonium, as well as the overall process of breeding plutonium.Enrico Fermi, a main scientist involved in theManhattan Project, was the one who discovered that plutonium was the element necessary to produce a spontaneous fission reaction.[279]His contributions to the Manhattan Project were not included in the film as much as they were recognized in real-life.
In the film, a scene depicts the May 31, 1945, meeting of the Interim Committee, which J. Robert Oppenheimer attended as a member of the Scientific Panel of consultants. In this scene, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson is portrayed ordering the removal ofKyotofrom the list of top atomic bomb targets, allegedly because it was a favored honeymoon destination for him and his wife. However, historian of science and nuclear weapons,Alex Wellerstein, clarifies that this portrayal is a myth. According to Wellerstein, Stimson's diary from his 1926 travels with his wife does not mention Kyoto, and the only brief visit they made there was in 1929, during a single night stay while on a "fact-finding" mission related to his role asGovernor-General of the Philippines. The film's depiction overlooks that Stimson's objection to targeting Kyoto was primarily strategic rather than personal. He expressed this viewpoint to President Truman on multiple occasions, including at thePotsdam Conference. Stimson wrote in his diary on July 24, 1945, "He [Truman] again reiterated with the utmost emphasis his own concurring belief on that subject, and he was particularly emphatic in agreeing with my suggestion that if elimination was not done, the bitterness which would be caused by such a wanton act might make it impossible during the long post-war period to reconcile the Japanese to us in that area rather than to the Russians."[280][281]
Oppenheimerearned a leading 13 nominations at the96th Academy Awards, becoming Nolan's most Oscar-nominated film.[282][283][284]At the ceremony, the film wonBest Picture,Best Director,Best Actorfor Murphy,Best Supporting Actorfor Downey Jr.,Best Cinematography,Best Film Editing, andBest Original Score.[285]Besides composer Göransson, all recipients were first-time Oscar winners, including Nolan, Thomas, Roven, Downey Jr. and van Hoytema, who had each earned previous Academy Award nominations.[286]Oppenheimerbecame both the highest-grossing and longest Best Picture winning film since 2003'sThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.[287]The film was also nominated forBest Supporting Actressfor Blunt,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Costume Design,Best Makeup and Hairstyling,Best Production Design, andBest Sound.

He experienced a career resurgence with his roles asErnest LawrenceinOppenheimer(2023) and a serial killer inTrap(2024).[4]
On television, Hartnett portrayedEthan Chandleron theShowtimefantasy seriesPenny Dreadful(2014–2016). He also appeared in an episode ofBlack Mirrorin 2023 andThe Bearin 2024.
Hartnett was born inSaint Paul, Minnesota.[1]The son of Daniel Thomas Hartnett and Wendy Anne (née Kronstedt), he was raised by his father, a building manager and former guitarist forAl Green, and his stepmother, Molly, an artist.[5]He has three younger siblings named Jake, Joe, and Jessica.[6]Hartnett was raisedRoman Catholic,[7]attendingNativity of Our Lord Catholic School.[8]AtMinneapolis South High School, he playedfootball, but a knee injury forced him off the team when he was 16. He went on to tryyouth theater, where he acted in productions ofThe Adventures of Tom SawyerandGuys and Dollsand attracted attention from atalent scout. Originally interested in becoming apainter, he decided to become a film actor while working in avideo rental shop, where he became acquainted with films such asTrainspotting,12 Monkeys, andThe Usual Suspects.[9][10]
After Hartnett graduated from high school in 1996, he moved toPurchase, New York, to attend the Conservatory of Theatre Arts & Film at theState University of New York at Purchase. He was expelled after writing a letter to the dean contending that the college's evaluation system stifled students' creativity.[9]At the age of 19, Hartnett moved to Los Angeles at the recommendation of his manager, Nancy Kremer, who had previously helped him book television commercials.[11][12]
Shortly after arriving in Los Angeles, he caught an improbable break, landing a part in the short-lived drama seriesCrackeronABC. His first feature film wasHalloween H20: 20 Years Later, in which he played the son of characterLaurie Strode. Released on August 5, 1998, it performed well at the box office.
Hartnett then developed a successful film career, appearing in the major filmsThe Faculty(1998),The Virgin Suicides(1999), andBlack Hawk Down(2001). In 2001, he starred in the war dramaPearl Harbor. He was originally scheduled to play the role of Tino inDeuces Wild, but dropped out to star inPearl Harbor. Also in 2001, he starred inO, an adaptation ofWilliam Shakespeare'sOthelloset in an American high school, as Hugo, the film's version ofIago. In 2002, he starred in the romantic comedy40 Days and 40 Nights.
In the early 2000s, Hartnett was approached several times to play the role ofClark Kent/Supermanfor a project originally helmed byBrett Ratnerbut always turned it down, not wanting to commit to a predicted ten-year role.[13][14]Hartnett said of his decision, "It just wasn't the kind of movie I wanted to do. I turned down other superhero roles as well." He was also considered for, but not offered, the role ofBatmaninChristopher Nolan'sBatman Begins, which ultimately went toChristian Bale.[9][15]
Hartnett was chosen as one ofTeen People's "21 Hottest Stars Under 21" in 1999,Teen People's "25 Hottest Stars under 25", and one ofPeople's "50 Most Beautiful People", both in 2002. He was also votedBlissmagazine's "3rd Sexiest Male". During this period, he was marketed as ateen idoland a potentialmegastar; his unease with this public image eventually led to his disillusionment with pursuing roles in high-profile films.[9]
Hartnett's next films includedHollywood Homicide(2003),Wicker Park(2004),Mozart and the Whale(2005),Sin City(2005), andLucky Number Slevin(2006).

Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt[1]was born on August 12, 1975, inFalmouth, Massachusetts, to Christine Anne "Chris" Boldt and Timothy Byers Affleck.[2][3][4]The surname "Affleck" is of Scottish origin.[5]He also has Irish,[6][7]German,[8]English, and Swedish ancestry.[9][full citation needed]Affleck's maternal great-great-grandfather,Heinrich Boldt, known for the discovery of theCurmsun Disc, emigrated fromPrussiain the late 1840s.[10][11]His mother was aRadcliffe College- andHarvard-educated elementary school teacher. His father worked sporadically as an auto mechanic,[12][13]a carpenter,[14]abookie,[15][16]an electrician,[17]a bartender,[18]and a janitor at Harvard University.[19]In the mid-1960s, he had been a stage manager, director, writer and actor with theTheater Company of Boston.[20][21][22]During Affleck's childhood, his father was "a disaster of a drinker".[23]Affleck first started acting by "reenacting what was happening at home" during role play exercises atAlateenmeetings.[24]
After his parents divorced when he was nine, Affleck and his older brother,Ben, lived with their mother and visited their father weekly.[23]He learned to speak Spanish during a year spent traveling around Mexico with his mother and brother when he was ten.[25]At the time, his brother Ben was filmingThe Second Voyage of the Mimi, which was set in Mexico. The two brothers spent "all of our time together, pretty much. Obviously at school we were in different grades, but we had the same friends."[25]When Affleck was fourteen, his father moved toIndio, California, to enter a rehabilitation facility, and later worked there as an addiction counselor.[17][26][27][28]He reconnected with his father during visits to California as a teenager: "I got to know him, really, because he was sober for the first time ... The man I knew before that was just completely different."[23][29]
Growing up in a politically active, liberal household inCentral Square, Cambridge,[15][30]Affleck and his brother were surrounded by people who worked in the arts,[31]were regularly taken to the theater by their mother,[32]and were encouraged to make their own home movies.[33]The brothers sometimes appeared in local weather commercials and as film extras because of their mother's friendship with a local casting director.[18][29][34]Affleck acted in numerous high school theater productions while a student atCambridge Rindge and Latin School.[29][35]He has said he "wouldn't be an actor" if not for his high school theater teacher Gerry Speca: "He kind of turned me on to acting, why it can be fun, how it can be rewarding."[35]
At age eighteen, Affleck moved to Los Angeles for a year to pursue an acting career, and lived with his brother and their childhood friendMatt Damon.[36]Despite having "the best possible first experience" while filmingTo Die For,[37]he spent much of the year working as a busboy at a restaurant inPasadena. He decided to move toWashington, D.C., to study politics atGeorge Washington University.[18]He soon transferred toColumbia UniversityinNew York City, where he followed theCore Curriculumfor a total of two years.[38][39][40]However, he did not graduate: "I would do a semester of school, go do a movie ... Opportunities kept presenting themselves that were hard for me to turn down ... By then, I didn't really have roots at the school or a group of friends."[37]
Affleck acted professionally during his childhood due to his mother's friendship with a Cambridge-area casting director, Patty Collinge.[37]In addition to local weather commercials and filmextrawork,[41]he appeared asKevin Bacon's brother in thePBStelevision filmLemon Sky(1988), directed by Collinge's husband Jan Egleson,[37]and as a youngRobert F. Kennedyin theABCminiseriesThe Kennedys of Massachusetts(1990).[42]These early acting experiences "meant nothing more than a day off from school" to Affleck, and he only began to consider a career as an actor when in high school.[41]When he later moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career in earnest, his first film role was as asociopathicteenager inGus Van Sant's 1995 satirical comedyTo Die For. During filming inToronto, Affleck shared an apartment with co-starJoaquin Phoenixand they became close friends.[33]Peter TraversofRolling Stonepraised Affleck's performance, saying he "skillfully capture[s] the pang of adolescence among no-hopers."[43][44]However, Affleck then had a "disappointing" experience while making the 1996 dramaRace the Sunand, "as soon as the film finished, I went to school."[39]
While studying at Columbia, Affleck had a supporting role in Van Sant'sGood Will Hunting(1997), written by his brother and their childhood friendMatt Damon.[18][37]Despite arranging a first meeting between Van Sant and his brother to discuss the project, Affleck was reluctant to leave college temporarily to act in the film.[39]He was eventually persuaded to play one of four friends living inSouth Boston– a role written specifically for him[36]– and improvised many of his lines.[45][46]Jay Carr ofThe Boston Globepraised the "emotional subtleties and variety" of the performances, and singled out "Casey Affleck's junior member of the quartet, dying to be taken as seriously as the others."[47]Following the film's success, Affleck's career opportunities did not significantly improve. At the same time, his life became exposed to the public and parts of his life became "part of pop culture and public life."[18]Also in 1997, he had a small role inKevin Smith'sChasing Amy, starring his brother. He returned to university for a semester before quitting to focus on his acting career.[39]
Affleck's career entered a "dark" period, with a series of supporting roles in critical and commercial failures.[36][33]He later remarked: "It dawned on me late that I should be selective about what I do."[37]In the independent comedyDesert Blue(1998), he starred oppositeKate Hudsonas a small-town jock.[48]Peter Stack of theSan Francisco Chroniclefelt that, while "interesting", his character was "entirely underdeveloped".[49]In 1999, he made an uncredited appearance in the teen comedyAmerican Pie[50]and appeared as a punk rocker romantically involved with bothGaby HoffmannandChristina Ricci's characters in the New Year's Eve ensemble comedy200 Cigarettes.[51][52]In the comedyDrowning Mona(2000), starringDanny DeVito, Affleck played a shy gardener suspected of murder.[53]Elvis MitchellofThe New York Timesacknowledged, in an otherwise negative review, that his role was "well played".[54]Also in 2000, Affleck had a small role in the comedyAttention Shoppersand playedFortinbrasinEthan Hawke'sHamlet.[55]He appeared as the brother ofHeather Graham's character in the romantic comedyCommitted(2000), with Emanuel Levy ofVarietypraising a "terrific" performance.[56]Also in 2001, he had a small role inAmerican Pie 2and appeared in the teenslasher filmSoul Survivors. Robert Koehler ofVarietyfound him "bland"[57]while Carla Meyer of theSan Francisco Chroniclesaid that he did not make "much of an impression, [but may] have been too depressed to really act."[58]One positive experience Affleck had during this period was working with Van Sant and cinematographerHarris SavidesonFinding Forrester(2000) as Van Sant's assistant and technical consultant: "Can you imagine a better film school than that? Gus is not only somebody who I love a lot but is also who has taught me, maybe more than anybody else in film."[33][59]
Affleck found a degree of commercial success when he was cast inSteven Soderbergh's heist comedyOcean's Eleven(2001), starringGeorge Clooney,Brad Pittand Damon. In roles Soderbergh originally intended forLuke WilsonandOwen Wilson,[60]Affleck andScott CaanplayedMormonbrothers and wisecracking mechanics who help to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously.[61]While it was a "great, fun social experience", Affleck spent much of his time on set "being, like, 100 feet away from the camera in the background."[36]He would later reprise his role inOcean's Twelve(2004) andOcean's Thirteen(2007).
In 2002, Affleck and Damon starred in Van Sant's experimental dramaGerry, playing two men who get lost while hiking in the desert.[62][63]Affleck, Damon, and Van Sant conceived of the idea and wrote the screenplay together while living in neighboring New York apartments.[45]The film, which had minimal dialogue, received mixed reviews.[64][65]Affleck, who rarely watches his own films,[61]said ofGerryin 2016: "That was an incredible experience. I saw one scene recently out of context at theTelluride Film Festivaland I can't believe anyone ever sat through the whole thing. It probably works better as a whole but one scene lifted out – I thought, 'This is unbearable!'"[37]Also in 2002, Affleck starred with Damon and then-girlfriendSummer Phoenixin aWest Endstage production ofKenneth Lonergan'sThis Is Our Youth.[18][66][67]Lonergan and Affleck became friends during rehearsals,[68]and Affleck later acted inworkshop productionsof Lonergan's plays in New York.[69][70]
Affleck's first leading role was in 2006's little-seen independent comedy-dramaLonesome Jim, directed bySteve Buscemi. He played a depressed writer who returns from New York to live with his parents in Indiana, and begins a relationship withLiv Tyler's character.[71]Buscemi has said he knew Affleck would be able to carry the film after watching his performance inGerry.[72][73]Stephen Hunter ofThe Washington Postremarked: "Affleck's interesting .. He probably can't be a star in big movies because his drawback is a voice that sounds like a snivel drawn through a wet nasal passage into a whine ... And yet in certain kinds of films – this kind – he's 100 percent authentic."[74]Ty Burr ofThe Boston Globesaid Affleck "gets so far under the skin of this semi-charming jerk that the performance becomes both brave and aggravating."[75]However, Stephen Holden ofThe New York Timesfelt it "would be a stronger movie if Mr. Affleck had the wherewithal to bare more of the passive-aggressive rage inside ... a more resourceful actor would have used this blank slate to scrawl a thousand telling details."[76]Also in 2006, he had a supporting role in the romantic comedyThe Last Kissas a friend ofZach Braff's character.[77]
Affleck had a breakthrough year in 2007, with the release of two films featuring critically acclaimed performances.[78]The first of these performances was in the Western dramaThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, in which he playedRobert FordtoBrad Pitt'sJesse James.[79]Affleck auditioned repeatedly for the role.[80]While the directorAndrew Dominikhad seen Affleck inGerry,[81][82]he cast him partly because of his "beautiful-sounding voice. The voice is the thing that really gets you."[83][84]Manohla Dargis ofThe New York Timesdescribed Affleck's performance as a "revelation" which "manages to make the character seem dumb and the actor wily and smart."[85]Similarly, Claudia Puig ofUSA Todaydeclared him a "real revelation [who] perfectly inhabits the role"[86]while Todd McCarthy ofVarietysaid Affleck made "an indelible impression as the insecure, physically unprepossessing weakling."[87]Dana Stevens ofSlatesaid "the movie belongs to Affleck [who] goes for broke in a wonderfully brave and weird performance as the craven naif Bob. Somehow he makes us want to flee this creep at top speed, even as we pray no harm will come to him." For his performance, Affleck was nominated for theGolden Globe Award,Screen Actors Guild AwardandAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
While he was filmingThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert FordinCalgary, Affleck was visited by his brother, who offered him the leading role in his directorial project, the Boston crime thrillerGone Baby Gone(2007).[37]While his brother was a first-time director and in the midst of a career downturn, Affleck had confidence in the project: "I felt like I knew him better than anyone else did."[37][88]His performance, as an inexperienced private investigator tasked with finding a missing child, earned Affleck further plaudits for his acting.[89]Manohla Dargis ofThe New York Timessaid: "I'm not sure exactly when Casey Affleck became such a good actor ... Most actors want you to love them, but [he] doesn't seem to know that, or maybe he doesn't care."[90]Jim Ridley ofThe Village Voicedescribed him as "a major talent coming into his own"[91]while Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chronicleremarked that "the revelation is Casey Affleck, who heretofore has been a rather wormy, uncharismatic screen presence."[92]Ty Burr ofThe Boston Globecommented: "I'd never stopped to consider Casey Affleck as a movie star before, but under his big brother's tutelage, he blooms as a leading man of richly watchable savvy and intelligence."[93]
WhileThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert FordandGone Baby Gonewere, respectively, a financial failure and a modest box office success,[83][94]Affleck's acting career was widely believed to be at a turning point.[33]However, he lost career momentum while directingI'm Still Here(2010), a divisive mockumentary about the musical career of his friend and then brother-in-lawJoaquin Phoenix.[33]While Affleck later clarified that it was "a planned, staged and scripted work of fiction",[95]there was much media speculation during filming about whether Phoenix's public behavior was performance art or a genuine breakdown.[96]Claudia Puig ofUSA Todayremarked that, "whether truth or folly, it's not particularly well made. Even in the midst of Phoenix's most oddball and obsessive torment, it's boring ... What, exactly, is the point of a joke that nobody really gets?"[97]Ty Burr ofThe Boston Globedescribed it as "an interesting but half-baked exercise in persona deconstruction, celebrity politics, and meta-meta-entertainment ... Parts of it are close to genius; most of it is actively torturous to watch."[98]Kenneth Turan of theLos Angeles Timessaid the film "turns out to be much more interesting to speculate about than to actually watch."[99]Reflecting on the experience in 2016, Affleck said: "We never thought people would actually think it was real ... In hindsight, we should have had a press junket and done talk shows and said how it was a mockumentary."[70]
Affleck used his own money to fundI'm Still Hereand, after running out of cash,[95]filming was paused for a month to allow him to play a Texanserial killerinMichael Winterbottom's crime dramaThe Killer Inside Me(2010).[100]Affleck later expressed regret over the film's graphic violence.[70]Philip French ofThe Guardianfound him "disturbingly brilliant"[101]while Peter Travers ofRolling Stonepraised "a mesmeric, implosively powerful performance."[102]Mark Olsen of theLos Angeles Timessaid Affleck "showcases his uncanny ability to project a person holding two thoughts in his head at once, as he often gives away nothing in his face to convey the firestorm obviously raging in his soul."[103]Affleck then had a supporting role in the heist comedyTower Heist(2011)[104]and voiced a character in the 2012 animationParaNorman.[105]
After spending "a big chunk of time" directingI'm Still Hereand dealing with the subsequent backlash,[106]Affleck returned to regular acting work in 2013. "It was ugly for a minute ... I sort of remembered why I liked acting and I missed it."[59]InDavid Lowery'sAin't Them Bodies Saints(2013), Affleck andRooney Marastarred as outlaw lovers in 1970s-era Texas.[107]Affleck was drawn to the opportunity to play a character who "was a much better person than anyone thought", after a string of roles as "assassins or murderers or just creeps".[107]Shannon M. Houston ofPastedescribed him as the film's "standout actor": "Down to his very jawline, Affleck captures the physicality and feeling of a sincerely romantic outlaw."[108]Betsy Sharkey of theLos Angeles Timesremarked: "Affleck plays conflicted souls so very well ... Here you wish for a criminal's redemption."[109]Matt Pais of theChicago Tribunesaid: "He has great instincts when it comes to morally compromised anti-heroes, and without trolling for our sympathy, Affleck's Bob is more than just a collection of behaviors; it's a smartly considered performance."[110]Sebastian Doggart ofThe Guardiansaid he "shows himself again to be a master of the criminal outsider"[111]while Chuck Wilson ofThe Village Voicefound him "flat-out heartbreaking".[112]
The opportunity to act oppositeChristian Balein the dramaOut of the Furnace"reinvigorated" Affleck and reminded him why he enjoyed acting.[113]Claudia Puig ofUSA Todayfound his performance as anIraq Warveteran dealing withposttraumatic stress disorder"completely captivating ... The chemistry between Bale and Affleck is powerful, intensifying the credibility of their brotherly bond."[114]Matt Pais of theChicago Tribunesaid Affleck "finds something fierce and noble in uneven material and in his character's rage. He's not like any other actor in American movies."[110]Ann Hornaday ofThe Washington Postdescribed the performance as "a searing portrayal of a young man who pushes himself to the punishing physical limit in search of both money and catharsis."[115]Manohla Dargis ofThe New York Timesremarked that Affleck "can come across as intensely vulnerable on screen, which nicely works for a broken man like Rodney."[116]In 2014, Affleck andJessica Chastainhad supporting roles inChristopher Nolan's science fiction filmInterstellaras the grown-up children ofMatthew McConaughey's character,[117]with Todd McCarthy ofThe Hollywood Reporterdescribing his character as "thinly developed".[118]Also in 2014, Affleck and producerJohn Powers Middletonlaunched the production company, The Affleck/Middleton Project.[119]
Affleck starred in three films in 2016, the first two of which underperformed financially.[120][121]InJohn Hillcoat's crime thrillerTriple 9, Affleck played an uncorruptible detective. Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chroniclesaid he "arrests our attention. I wonder if any other screen actor has ever seemed so focused and so distracted at the same time. He thinks more than he says, and so we listen, trying to get the part he's leaving out."[122]Justin Chang ofVarietydescribed him as "one of the most persuasive leading men of his generation"[123]while Brogan Morris ofPastedeclared him "maybe Hollywood's best offbeat leading man ... Few actors can suggest so much with such quiet precision, and even here Affleck is compulsively watchable despite his undercooked character."[124]In Disney's disaster dramaThe Finest Hours, Affleck played a taciturn engineer on board a sinking ship.David SimsofThe Atlanticsaid he "gives the kind of measured, thought-out performance he's so eminently capable of, even if the film isn't complex enough to rise to his level ... He animates an introverted character with subtle mental busywork whenever he's on the screen."[125]Sheri Linden ofThe Hollywood Reporternoted that he "manages to turn his man of few words into the movie's most compelling figure."[126]
In his final role of 2016, Affleck starred as Lee Chandler, a grief-stricken loner, inKenneth Lonergan's dramaManchester by the Sea. One of the film's producers, Matt Damon, initially intended to star in the film. When scheduling conflicts made this unfeasible, Damon agreed to step aside on the condition that he be replaced with Affleck.[127]Lonergan readily agreed,[128]remarking that Affleck was "the natural person to go to."[129]Affleck had close relationships with both men and had previously offered notes on early drafts of the script.[61]The film was a box office success,[130]and Affleck's performance received widespread critical praise. A.O. Scott ofThe New York Timesdescribed it as "one of the most fiercely disciplined screen performances in recent memory. [He] conveys both Lee's inner avalanche of feeling and the numb decorum that holds it back."[131]
Kenneth Turan of theLos Angeles Timespraised his "quietly ferocious performance, his willingness to submerge himself into this character to an almost frightening extent."[132]Ann Hornaday ofThe Washington Postsaid the film was "anchored by a quietly volcanic central performance by Casey Affleck, in a breathtaking breakout role he's long deserved."[133]David Fear ofRolling Stonestated: "He's given impressive turns before [but] the way Affleck gradually shows you the man's bone-deep grief and emotional damage makes you believe that one of this generation's finest actors has simply been waiting to be coaxed out."[134]Affleck won theNational Board of Review,Critics' Choice,Golden Globe,BAFTA, andAcademy Awardfor his performance.
After dropping out of Lowery'sPete's Dragonin order to star inManchester by the Sea,[61]Affleck reteamed with the director to star oppositeRooney Marain the experimental dramaA Ghost Story, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2017.[135]Affleck's character dies suddenly at the outset and he spends much of the film covered by a white sheet with two eye-holes, haunting his former home. David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reportersaid Affleck's performance managed to resonate despite limited time onscreen.[136]Peter Debruge ofVarietysaid Affleck "has never been an easy actor to read. He's a low-charisma mumbler who tends to keep his characters' emotions bottled up, making him the rare performer who can convey as much with a sheet over his head as he does without."[137]Jordan Hoffman ofThe Guardiandescribed him as "cinema's finest mumbler ... I can't even tell if he's speaking or just emitting high-pitched vibrations anymore."[138]In 2018, Affleck starred oppositeRobert Redfordin the outlaw dramaThe Old Man & the Gun, his third collaboration with Lowery.[139]
In 2019, he directed, wrote and starred in the survival dramaLight of My Life.[140][141]It had its world premiere at theBerlin International Film Festivalon February 8, 2019[142]and received positive reviews from film critics.[143]Affleck next starred inOur Friend, oppositeDakota JohnsonandJason Segel, directed byGabriela Cowperthwaite, based upon a true story revolving around a couple, whose best friend moves in for support, following a cancer diagnosis.[144]which had its world premiere at the2019 Toronto International Film Festival.[145]Affleck next acted in and producedThe World to Come, directed byMona FastvoldalongsideKatherine WaterstonandVanessa Kirby.[146]In 2023, Affleck played the supporting role of military intelligence officerBoris PashinChristopher Nolan's biopicOppenheimer.[147]
Affleck was introduced to actressSummer Phoenixby her brother,Joaquin, in the late 1990s.[18][148]They began dating in 2000,[149]and acted together in both the 2000 filmCommitted[150]and a 2002 stage production ofThis Is Our Youth.[151]The couple became engaged in January 2004[148]and married on June 3, 2006, in Savannah, Georgia.[152]They have two sons born in 2004 and 2007.[153]On August 1, 2017, Phoenix officially filed for divorce, citing "irreconcilable differences",[154]and it was finalized later that year.[155]Affleck has said it was an amicable divorce and that they remain friends.[23]
He has been in a relationship with actressCaylee Cowansince January 2021.[156]
In a 2016 interview, Affleck said that he had been sober for "almost three years ... My father was a disaster of a drinker, my grandmother was an alcoholic, my brother spent some time in rehab – it's in our genes."[23]
In 2008, Affleck filmed an episode of documentary series4Real, in which he visited thePawnee Nation of Oklahoma, and remarked upon the progress they had made due largely to "their own resourcefulness and determination and their character, and not because of the goodness of our collective heart."[157]During the2016 presidential campaign, Affleck supportedHillary Clinton[33][158]and characterizedDonald Trumpas "a dangerous fool".[61][159]In 2017, multiple financial contributions to Trump were made by Affleck's production company, which he co-founded withJohn Powers Middleton. In a statement, Affleck denied involvement: "I had no knowledge of it, was never asked, and never would have authorized it ... The policies of the Trump administration, and the values they represent, are antithetical to everything I believe in."[160]
Affleck has settled two sexual harassment lawsuits out of court for an undisclosed amount.[161]
In 2010, two of his former co-workers fromI'm Still Herefiled civil lawsuits against Affleck.Amanda White, one of the film's producers, sued Affleck for $2 million with multiple complaints includingsexual harassmentand breach of oral contract.[162]She detailed numerous "uninvited and unwelcome sexual advances" in the workplace. White alleged that Affleck refused to honor the terms of the production agreement, including her fee, in retaliation.[162]
The film's cinematographer, Magdalena Gorka, sued Affleck for $2.25 million with multiple complaints including intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of oral contract.[163][164]Gorka alleged that she had been subjected to "routine instances" of sexual harassment by crew members includingAntony Langdon, "within the presence and with the active encouragement of Affleck."[163]
Initially, Affleck denied the allegations and threatened to countersue.[165]No countersuits were filed.[161]His lawyer claimed, "Both women left the film in April 2009 and both were refused when they wanted to return", and "there was no mention of sexual harassment before June [2010]."[166]The film's associate producer Nicole Acacio and an unnamed female editor both defended Affleck's conduct on set.[167]The lawsuits were later settled out of court.[168]Both women received credit for their work on the project; no details of any financial settlement were released.[169]
Affleck addressed the allegations in a 2016 interview withThe New York Times, stating: "It was settled to the satisfaction of all. I was hurt and upset — I am sure all were — but I am over it. It was an unfortunate situation — mostly for the innocent bystanders of the families of those involved."[170]The allegations and lawsuits attracted scrutiny during the2016–17 film awards season, when Affleck was recognized for his performance inManchester by the Sea, which culminated in further controversy following his Best Actor win at the89th Academy Awards.[171][172][173]The following year, amidst theMe Too movement, Affleck withdrew from presenting the award forBest Actressat the90th Academy Awards.[174]
In a 2018 interview with the Associated Press, Affleck discussed the lawsuits and allegations in light of the Me Too movement.[175]He characterized his behavior at the time of the lawsuits as defensive and said he has since worked to understand his own culpability.[175]He remorsefully acknowledged that the set ofI'm Still Herewas "an unprofessional environment" and that "I contributed to that unprofessional environment and I tolerated that kind of behavior from other people and I wish that I hadn't. And I regret a lot of that ... I behaved in a way and allowed others to behave in a way that was really unprofessional. And I'm sorry."[175]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
