Having been fired from his job, Ralphie works as a rideshare driver to support himself and his pregnant girlfriend, Sal. He works out at a local gym with his friend Jason, who sells Ralphie prescription pills. Jason suggests Ralphie meet some of his friends, claiming they have resources to get him back on his feet.
At a restaurant, Ralphie is introduced to a group of men led by the charismatic "Dad Dan." He notices the men are each branded with a tattoo of a triangle with a line across the top. After the dinner, Dad Dan approaches Ralphie in his car. He tells Ralphie that he understands his pain, suggesting he has the look of someone who never had a father figure. The next day, Jason gives Ralphie a new pair of sneakers, telling him it is a gift from the group for making a good impression.
Ralphie attends a meeting at the group's expansive house outside the city. Each man introduces himself as a "Son" or "Dad," and how long they have been practicing celibacy. Ralphie is surprised by the men's open misogyny, revealing these men have all left their spouses to live on this compound together. While exploring the house, Ralphie discovers a gun inside Dad Dan's office desk. Rather than scold him, Dad Dan warmly invites Ralphie to join this "family." He tells Ralphie that he sees a staggering beauty inside of him, with a power to create and annihilate.
Ralphie drives a young kid, who accidentally leaves his phone in the backseat. Ralphie pawns the phone for cash, much to Sal's dismay. Ralphie attends another group meeting, where Dad Dan breaks him down during an initiation exercise. Ralphie reveals his inner rage and the group suggests he leave his girlfriend. While driving at night, Ralphie picks up a gay couple outside a club. When they attempt to have sex in his backseat, Ralphie slams the car to a halt, then dangerously speeds through the streets.
The group goes shopping at a mall. Ralphie refuses to have Dad Dan pay for an expensive shirt for him, instead using his own limited savings. As the group is leaving they run into group member Brad's spouse, who he had abandoned. Ralphie watches her berate Brad, realizing he has made a mistake and attempts to flee. Dad Dan urges Ralphie to take back his power instead. After slapping himself in the bathroom, Ralphie attacks a stranger in a fit of rage.
Sal questions Ralphie about his behavior, leading to a heated argument where Ralphie walks out on her. Ralphie moves into the group's home and is initiated into the group by being branded. After celebrating, Dad Dan offers his gun to Ralphie, who reveals that his father walked out on his family on Christmas Day. Dad Dan attempts to fuel Ralphie's descent further by claiming "There is no god, but Ralph." Ralphie strikes Dad Dan and escapes the compound.
After encountering bodybuilder Ahmet at the gym, Ralphie follows him to an industrial factory. Inside, Ahmet proceeds to haveanal sexwith him. When they finish, Ahmet introduces himself, but Ralphie suddenly shoots him dead, stealing his truck and pawning his personal belongings. Ralphie returns to Sal, who has just delivered their baby Jayce in the hospital. Ralphie returns from grocery shopping to discover that Sal has left him, leaving only a note that says "Forgive me."
Ralphie returns to Dad Dan's compound with his baby, but is soon followed by police looking to arrest him for Ahmet's murder. Ralphie reveals the gun, demanding the group help him. They take the baby upstairs and Ralphie leads the group in a chant, then shoots Dad Dan in the head. He shoots a police officer, then flees the compound and escapes into the woods. Ralphie eventually comes upon a senior living community, where he breaks into the kitchen pantry for food. A worker discovers him and offers to help him. Ralphie puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger, but the gun doesn't fire and he collapses. The worker cooks a meal for Ralphie and tells him a story. Ralphie curls up into the worker, who embraces him like a scared child as police arrive at the scene.

Manodromehad its world premiere at the73rd Berlin International Film Festivaland screened February 18, 2023 in the opening weekend of the Main Competition.[11]The film was nominated for the prestigiousGolden Bear, in addition to theTeddy Awardfor Queer Cinema. It was released in the United States byLionsgate Filmsin theaters and digital on November 10, 2023.[12]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 49% of 35 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's consensus reads: "Jesse Eisenberg does some impressive work inManodrome, even if the story isn't quite deep or nuanced enough to support his deeply committed performance."[13]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[14]
The Playlistlabeled the film as the "Best Eisenberg offering in over a decade."[15]Chris Barsanti ofSlant Magazinepraised Trengove for his cinematic craftsmanship, stating "While Trengrove’s skill is apparent in the slow build of tension, it truly stands out in the arguably more impressive way he holds Ralphie’s view of the world separate from that of the film’s."[16]Awards Dailycalled the film "A thought-provoking piece of queer filmmaking that should not be missed."[17]Deadlinecompared the film toTaxi Driver, writing that its tone and brutal treatment of male violence may not appeal to everyone.[18]According toThe Hollywood Reporter, the film tackles themes of toxic masculinity and power dynamics in relationships through a story of a men's retreat, but its execution is too extreme, and the depiction of a poisonous cult of men whose entitlement is matched by their sense of victimhood can be shocking to some. David Rooney wrote that Jesse Eisenberg's performance as the tightly coiled Ralphie is compelling and "generally rises above the lofty self-seriousness of a movie that aims to sound the death knell on toxic masculinity."[19]
Variety's Peter Debruge wrote thatManodromestruggled to live up to its provocative premise, lacking the depth and nuance needed to effectively explore the state of contemporary masculinity, saying, "The characters feel thin, the secret society seems implausible and its goals too vague to capture the imagination."[20]Writing forCineuropa, Davide Abbatescianni described the film's final result as a "captivating pastiche made up of thriller, psychological drama and surreal comedy tropes, filled with crazy twists and turns...This hodgepodge may be amusing or fascinating to some, but frustrating to others. That being said, viewers certainly should not expect a serious treatment of any of the themes this movie aims to broach," he warned.[21]
Collider's review, titled "Jesse Eisenberg Struggles With Inner Rage in Raw Deconstruction of Masculinity," said thatManodromemay have its imperfections, but it offered a thoughtful exploration of toxic masculinity and its impact, as well as a strong warning about the dangers of enabling broken men. It writes, "it serves as a gritty character study where Eisenberg can flex some new acting muscles. Add the always-reliable Brody to the mix, and it’s easy to forgiveManodrome'simperfections."[22]

Philip Ettinger(born September 8, 1985) is an American actor. He first gained attention for his supporting role as the troubled environmental activist, Michael, inPaul Schrader'sFirst Reformed(2017). Other significant roles have been as Garrett Drimmer in theCBS All AccessseriesOne Dollar(2018), as the young-adult version ofMark Ruffalo's twin characters, Dominick and Thomas Birdsey, inHBO'sI Know This Much Is Truein 2020, and in the lead role of Cole Freeman inBraden King's cinematic adaptation of the Carter Sickels' novelThe Evening Hour(2020).
Philip Ettinger was born September 8, 1985[1]to aJewishfamily in Fair Lawn, New Jersey.[2][3]He attended Fair Lawn High School, where he was a member of the Masques drama club. He began studying film directing atEmerson CollegeinBoston,Massachusetts.[2]After unexpectedly winning the lead role in a play his freshman year, however, he enrolled in a summer acting program atWilliam Esper StudioinNew York City, where a teacher encouraged Ettinger to transfer to theMason Gross School of the ArtsatRutgers UniversityinNew Brunswick,New Jersey.[2][4]This course included spending a year inEnglandstudying at theGlobe TheatreinLondon.[2]He graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.[4]
Ettinger's professional career began in 2008 in an episode ofLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit.
In 2014, Ettinger was nominated for aLucille Lortel Awardfor Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play, for his work inJoshua Harmon'sBad Jews. (The awards are to recognize excellence in New York Off-Broadway Theatre).[5]Ettinger starred alongsideEthan HawkeandAmanda Seyfriedin the supporting role of Michael, the troubled husband of Seyfried's character, Mary, inPaul Schrader's filmFirst Reformed,which was premiered at the2017 Toronto Film Festival.[4]The performance was a breakthrough for the actor; so much so, that theLos Angeles Timesfilm critic,Justin Changstated in an article regarding his personal choices for what should land on the 2018 Oscar nomination ballot, "When lead performances sneak into the wrong categories, it makes it all the harder for an organization to recognize a genuinely supporting turn — like, for example, Ettinger's galvanizing work inFirst Reformed, which lasts all of one scene and continues to stay with me.."[6]Ettinger continued to make strides in 2018, starring as Garrett Drimmer, a young steel mill worker raising a toddler on his own, in theCBS All Accessensemble seriesOne Dollar, and appearing in theSebastián Silva-directed filmTyrel, which premiered at the2018 Sundance Film Festival.[4]
In 2020, Ettinger landed the role of playing the 17–19-year-old versions ofMark Ruffalo's twin characters, Dominick Birdsey and his paranoid schizophrenic twin, Thomas, inHBO'sI Know This Much Is True.This brought him considerable critical notice, with Dan Seddon ofNMEnoting, "Actor Philip Ettinger (among the series' supporting players)makes a case for himself too, whose stint as the college-aged twins during flashbacks is a raw and fascinating portrayal of the Birdseys complicated youth."[7]Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson examined Ettinger and star Ruffalo's collaboration on the twins with favor, "The relationship between Dom and Thomas is drawn with aching clarity, one brother trying to be good to the other while resentments build up around them. Crucially, neither Ruffalo nor Ettinger overplay Thomas's condition. Though he is volatile, and frustrating, and wounded, there is nothing childlike about him, really—at least not in the style of so many misbegotten depictions of mental illness on screen... In the other role, Ruffalo and Ettinger both keenly express Dom's agony over his assumed responsibilities and all they deny him in his own life. It's particularly heartbreaking to watch Ettinger's youthful appetite for escape dissipate as he realizes just how serious his brother's situation is, how much time and attention and patience it will require.I Know This Much Is Trueis wise enough to both regret and accept that onus, gradually allowing Dom to find the ragged purpose in a life he feels has been robbed of that very thing. Ruffalo communicates that hopeful resignation quite well, building on Ettinger's more wide-eyed performance to craft a man in full."Haaretz's Adrian Hennigan pointed out Ettinger's success in portraying both twins, "The actors (including Donnie and Rocco Masihi) playing the younger versions of the twins are also outstanding: Philip Ettinger subtly delineates how these identical twins are very different characters..."[3][8][9]
Earlier that year Ettinger attended both the2020 Sundance Film Festivaland theInternational Film Festival Rotterdamin the Netherlands to promote his first lead role as Cole Freeman inBraden King's cinematic adaptation of the Carter Sickels novelThe Evening Hour.[10][11][12]In it, Ettinger depicts a young nursing home aide struggling to support himself, and his grandparents, in economically depressedAppalachia, by buying excess pain meds from members of hisWest Virginiancommunity, and reselling them to others in that same area. The film was released in 2021.[13]Other projects include Ian Barling's 2021 short filmSafe,[14][better source needed]which premiered atLa Semaine de la Critiqueat Cannes in July 2021,Hold Upin 2022[15][better source needed]by writer-director Alex Rollins Berg, andLittle Brother,[16]an indie film written and directed by Sheridan O'Donnell. Ettinger also stars alongside Emmy-winnerMartha PlimptoninSardinia, a 2024 short film written and directed byPaul Kowalskiand Executive Produced byPatton Oswalt.[17][better source needed]The film is about a serious man trying to avoid catching a deadly laughing plague in a growingly polarized and dystopian society, and was named a 2025 Oscar contender for Best Live Action Short by Deadline.[18]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
