William Oberst Jr.(born November 21, 1965) is an Americanstage, film and television actor ofGerman descent.[1]Known for his work inhorrorandcult films, his career includes projects in film, television and one-man-show theater performances.[2]He first received recognition for his portrayals of icon andhumoristLewis Grizzardas performed in theatrical tours across theSouthern United States,[3]and played the 'Facebook Stalker' in the 2011 onlineinteractive videofilm and Facebook appTake This Lollipopand its 2020 sequel.
Oberst Jr. was born and raised inGeorgetown, South Carolina,[4]and is a graduate of theUniversity of South Carolina.[1]He is a native ofPawleys Island, South Carolinaand lives and works inLos Angeles, California.[5]
Oberst admits to having been a "fat kid" when young[1]and says he "started doing imitations of my teachers to entertain the kids who picked on me… They couldn't hit me if they were laughing."[5]This led to his growing up to become an actor and mimic known for bringing historic figures to life.[5]
Oberst has received attention for his many theatrical portrayals of historical figures, includingJesus,[1]Mark Twain,[6][7][8]Abraham Lincoln, andJohn F. Kennedy.[1][9]
Beginning in 1994, and continuing through 2004, Oberst portrayedJesusinJesus of Nazareth.[10]Overlapping, and for the five years from 1996 through 2004, he playedJohn F. Kennedyin the one man showJFK.[11]Iconic historical figures who are revered or demonized by history draw Oberst's interest as an actor.[4]Oberst had also created theone man showStand Up! When Comedy Was Funnywhere he featured the classic comedy routines ofRodney Dangerfield,Bob Newhart,Woody AllenandMoms Mabley.[12]
He was chosen byLewis Grizzard's widow Dedra and the former manager Steve Enoch to portray the southern icon, and since 1999 has been portraying Grizzard with the touring production that has continued for over 10 years under several names:A Tribute To Lewis Grizzard,Lewis Grizzard Returns, andLewis Grizzard: In His Own Words.[9][13][14][15][16][17][18]
In 2006, Oberst began his career in film andtelevisioncareer. Since 2008, he has appeared in over 100 independent film and television projects.[19]
After his very first performance asKennedyin 1996, a woman from the audience, who identified herself as having served as a secretary inThe White Houseduring the Kennedy administration, told Oberst his characterization "made her grieve for the first time in 30 years."[1]Of Oberst's seasonal and one-man interpretation ofCharles Dickens'sA Christmas Carol, where he creates and plays a dozen different characters in a 45-minute "abridged" version, Kathyrn Martin ofThe Sun News(Myrtle Beach, South Carolina) wrote that in his shorter interpretation Oberst "focuses on the character ofScroogeand, more subtly, the craftsmanship of the original literary work," and "Oberst is a superb actor with an appreciation for both language and history."[20]Though skilled at bringing many characters to life, Oberst's years portraying Grizzard have received the greatest attention: reviewer Jeff Johnson ofCharleston'sPost and Courierpraised Oberst's performance as "an uncanny impersonation;"[21]Alec Harvey ofThe Birmingham Newsalso felt that his impersonation was impressive: "Oberst, for all intents and purposes,isGrizzard in the show," and he "brings back to life one of the most beloved Southern writers of the 20th century,"[22]and Tanya Perez-Brennan ofThe Florida Times-Unionreported that "throughout the performance, Oberst had a commanding stage presence".[23]
Oberst brings this same attention to character detail to television and film. Regarding his portrayal ofGeneral William T. Shermanin theHistory Channel's 2007Sherman's March,[24]The Atlanta Journal-Constitutionreported, alluding to Oberst's prior fame playingLewis Grizzard, "Could it be? Lewis Grizzard burning Atlanta?"[25]Dorothy RabinowitzofThe Wall Street Journalnoted that the docudrama "owes much to the flinty authority of William Oberst Jr., splendid in the role of Sherman."[26]Of his role inDogs of Chinatown(2008) as Vitario, the mob's second in command,Kung Fu Cinemawrote "[Oberst] is the film's best actor and with his unique looks I can see him carving out a successful dramatic career in Hollywood as a heavy, something he seems to be doing with roles in a couple upcoming horror films."[27]
For Oberst's portrayal as Dale, the slightly "off" backwoods swamp-dwellingRangerinDismal(2008), reviewer Dustin Hall ofBrutal As Hellwrote, "Something everyone can appreciate is the performance by Bill Oberst Jr. as Dale, who has great screen presence as the patriarch of the flesh-eating family. Only two years into his film career, Bill's played a variety of business and small-town sheriff types, now he lends a malicious glee and a disturbing, penetrating stare to Dismal to surprising effect",[28]and Duane L. Martin ofRogue Cinemawrote, "I don't even know how to describe how great [Oberst] was at bringing just the right personality and intensity to the role. He was the quintessential swamp rat, but at the same time, he was much more than that. The mannerisms and personality he brought to the role made the character memorable. So many times in films like this, these types of characters are just generic and forgettable, but when I look back on this film now, his character is the one that stands out to me the most."[29]
In 2011 Oberst played the creepy "Facebook Stalker" in the online filmTake This Lollipop, an interactive video which uses theFacebook Connectapplication to bring viewers themselves into the film though use of their own pictures and information posted toFacebook, and which underscores the danger when one posts too much personal information online. In describing the opening sequences,CNNwrote "A sweaty, wild-eyed man in a stained undershirt hunches over his computer in a shadowy basement. He's broken into your Facebook account and is reading your posts as his dirty, cracked fingernails paw at the keyboard. Rage (jealousy? hate?) builds as he flips through your photos and scrolls through your list of friends. He rocks back and forth, growing more agitated as the pages flash past. Then he consults a map of your city and heads to his car."[30]Ad Agepraised Oberst's portrayal of a "sweat-covered, mouse-rubbing" stalker by writing that Oberst "givesHannibal Lectera run for his money."[31]
The 2012B-MovieAbraham Lincoln vs. Zombies, was widely panned (as is most films byThe Asylum). However, most critics praised Oberst's portrayal of President Lincoln, citing it as one of the best performances ever given in an independent horror movie:Dread Centralreviewer Matt Serafini wrote, "If there existed an Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a B-Movie, this year's winner would easily be Bill Oberst, Jr., for his outstanding portrayal of our 16th President... it is certainly the closest thing to an award caliber performance you'll probably ever see in a movie produced by The Asylum",[32]whileJoBlo's Jason Adams wrote "Oberst is legitimately great in the role and his presidential chops suggest he could actually play Lincoln in a biopic that didn't involve dismembering heads every five minutes",[33]and CHUD.com's Jared Rasic wrote that Oberst's "Lincoln is powerful, noble and pretty damn badass with a scythe", expanding "Bill Oberst Jr. is a film saver. Each role of his I've seen, he always completely commits to the performance, whether he's playing a redneck cannibal, a cyber stalker or the 16th President of the United States... Oberst Jr. is on the cusp of becoming a very known quantity and has a very good chance at becoming America's next boogeyman".[34]
The 2012 Shockfest Film Festival in Hollywood, CA featured the Shocker Awards.  Jourdan McClure'sChildren of Sorrowwon 'Best Film' and Bill Oberst Jr. won 'Best Actor'.
In March 2012, the UK-based site Erebus Horror named Bill Oberst Jr. the "King of Horror" following a vote from their readers.[35]
In 2017, theiHolly International Film Festivalawarded Bill Oberst Jr. their Life-Time Achievement Award. In 2021, Horror Fuel Magazine announced that Oberst will co star in the 2022 horror film Jasper, alongsideKane Hodder,Bill MoseleyandMichael Berryman.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
