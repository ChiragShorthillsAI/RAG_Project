Asteroid City(styled as"Asteroid City"[6]) is a 2023 Americanscience fictioncomedy dramafilm written, directed, and produced byWes Anderson, from a story he wrote withRoman Coppola. It features anensemble cast, includingJason Schwartzman,Scarlett Johansson,Tom Hanks,Jeffrey Wright,Tilda Swinton,Bryan Cranston,Edward Norton,Adrien Brody,Liev Schreiber,Hope Davis,Steve Park,Rupert Friend,Maya Hawke,Steve Carell,Matt Dillon,Hong Chau,Willem Dafoe,Margot Robbie,Tony Revolori,Jake Ryan, andJeff Goldblum. Its plot mostly follows a play about a JuniorStargazerconvention in aretrofuturisticversion of 1955, but it becomesmetatextualbecause the making of the play is the subject of a television documentary.[7]The story is aboutextraterrestrialsandUFOswitnessed in the American Southwestern desert in close proximity toatomic test sitesafter World War II.
The project was announced in September 2020 as an untitledromance film, with Anderson writing, producing and directing, alongsideJeremy Dawsonof American Empirical Pictures andSteven RalesofIndian Paintbrush. In February 2021, it was described as being about a "group of brainy teenagers". Originally set for Rome, filming took place inChinchón, Spain, between August and October, 2021, with cinematographerRobert D. Yeoman. Several sets resembling a desert landscape and a mock train station were used. Post-production included editorBarney Pillingand amusical scorecomposed by frequent Anderson composerAlexandre Desplat, featuring country and western songs from many artists. The official title forAsteroid Citywas revealed in October 2021 at theBFI London Film Festival.
Asteroid Citypremiered at the76th Cannes Film Festivalon May 23, 2023, where it competed for thePalme d'Or. It began a limited theatrical release throughFocus Featuresin the United States on June 16, 2023, expanding to a wide release a week later.[8]It grossed $54 million worldwide on a $25 million budget,[9]and received generally positive reviews.
In aretro-futuristicversion of the 1950s, a television host introduces adocumentaryabout the creation and production ofAsteroid City, a play by the famed playwright Conrad Earp. The play's events are depicted in widescreen and stylized color, while the television special is seen in black-and-whiteAcademy ratio.
In the play, a youthastronomyconvention is held in the fictional desert town of Asteroid City.War photojournalistAugie Steenbeck arrives early to the Junior Stargazer convention with Woodrow, his intellectual teenage son, and his three younger daughters. When their car breaks down, Augie phones his father-in-law, Stanley, asking for his help. Stanley, who dislikes his son-in-law, persuades him to tell the children about their mother's recent death, which Augie had concealed. Augie and Woodrow meet Midge Campbell, a famous but world-weary actress, and her daughter Dinah, who, like Woodrow, will be honored at the convention. Augie and Midge, and Woodrow and Dinah, gradually fall in love throughout the play. The other convention participants arrive:
A local motel provides everyone's accommodations.
Gibson welcomes the attendees at the Asteroid City crater where the teenagers are to receive awards for various inventions. AUFOsuddenly appears above the crater; analienemerges and steals the remnant of the meteorite that created the crater. Augie manages to photograph the creature. Gibson, with instructions from the president, places the town under military quarantine, and everyone is subjected to medical and psychiatric examinations. Meanwhile, a romance blossoms between Montana and June, who assure the students that the alien is likely peaceful. The Stargazer honorees use Dr. Hickenlooper's equipment to attempt to contact the alien. Tricking the guard watching the pay phone, Ricky calls his school newspaper to relay the quarantine details and cover-up to the outside world.
The Asteroid City events become national news. A furious Gibson is about to be forced to end the quarantine when the UFO reappears, dropping the meteorite back into its former position; the General sees new markings on it and deduces that it has been "inventoried." Gibson then reinstates the quarantine; the children, scientists, and parents revolt, using the honorees' inventions to overpower the military. In the play's epilogue, Augie and his family are the last to leave Asteroid City after Gibson officially lifts the quarantine. Woodrow reveals he has won the fellowship funding, and Midge leaves Augie her mailing address. Augie and his family quietly drive away.
Throughout the film, the play's creation is interspersed with the play itself in the television documentary. Some time after Conrad Earp started writing, he meets with actor Jones Hall, who performs an audition in Earp's home and is immediately cast. During the same interaction, Earp and Hall kiss, establishing their relationship as lovers. Earp writes the play with help from a local acting school and recruits most cast members from it, including Mercedes Ford, a temperamental yet talented actress who plays Midge.
During the recorded performance of the play, Hall, who plays Augie, confronts the play's director Schubert Green, saying he "still doesn't understand the play", and asks Green if he is "doing him right". Green tells Hall to keep playing Augie the same way despite being uncertain, and that he is doing him right. After that interaction, while taking a smoke break on a balcony, Hall runs into the actress who was cast to play Augie's wife before her only scene was cut. She recites the deleted scene's text to him, and he appears to gain new insight from it.
Six months into the play's run, Conrad Earp dies in an automobile accident.
In September 2020, it was reportedWes Andersonwould write and direct a romance film, which he would produce withJeremy Dawsonof American Empirical Pictures andSteven RalesofIndian Paintbrush.[32][33]By February 2021,Michael CeraandJeff Goldblumentered negotiations to star; the film was then described as being about a "group of brainy teenagers".[34]Tilda Swintonwas the first person to officially join the cast, in June 2021.[14]In May 2023, Anderson talked about how theCOVID-19 pandemicinspired the film and its story, saying: "I don't think there would be a quarantine in the story if we weren't experiencing it. It wasn't deliberate...Writing is the most improvisational part of the whole process. It relies on having nothing."[35]
Bill Murraywas originally cast as the motel manager, but had to drop out of the role due to being infected withCOVID-19, leading to Carrell playing the part instead. However, after his recovery, he arrived at the film set inSpain, and while Anderson could not add another role to the film, he gave Murray the role of Tab Whitney, the actor playing Jock Larkings, business titan of the company bearing his name, which was an additional character created for a short promotional film trailer.[36]
Principal photography, originally planned for Rome, took place in Spain between August and October 2021, with COVID-19 safety precautions in place.[21][37][35]Several sets were built inChinchón, including a vast diorama resembling a desert landscape with the eponymous town of Asteroid City, including its train station, a diner, a garage and an observatory.[38][39]Cast memberFisher Stevenssaid the film would include "the wildest cast sinceThe Bridge on the River Kwai" and that the cast and crew "were all bubbled together in a hotel, which was an old monastery".[40]
Scarlett Johanssonwas paid $4,131 a week for her two months of work.[41]
The film's title was revealed byBill Murrayto beAsteroid Cityat theBFI London Film Festivalin October 2021.[42]Alexandre Desplatcomposed the score, his sixth collaboration with Anderson.[43]Costume design was by multiple Academy Award winnerMilena Canonero.[44]In July 2022, it was announced thatFocus Featureswould distribute the film, reuniting them with Anderson afterMoonrise Kingdom(2012).[1]It was also revealed that Murray would not be in the film as initially reported,[45]as a result of contracting COVID-19 before he could shoot his scenes, leading to him being replaced bySteve Carellfor the role of the motel manager.[46]
A teaser poster forAsteroid Citywas released on March 28, 2023. The first trailer was released the following day, which featured a rendition ofJohnny Duncan's 1957 song "Last Train to San Fernando".[47]Jazz Monroe ofPitchforkcalled the trailer "extremely Andersonian", while Charles Pulliam-Moore ofThe Vergewrote that the film "looks and feels exactly how you'd think a Wes Anderson coming-of-age movie about stargazing in the desert would".[48][49]
Asteroid Citypremiered at the76th Cannes Film Festivalon May 23, 2023.[50]It was given a limited theatrical release in New York City and Los Angeles in the United States on June 16, 2023, expanding to a wide release on June 23, 2023.[8]It had an earlier premiere in Sweden and a limited number of other countries on June 9, 2023.[51]

In the United States, theMotion Picture Association(MPA) initially gave the film an R-rating "for brief graphic nudity".[55]Focus Features successfully appealed the decision, and the film was re-rated PG-13 "for brief graphic nudity, smoking, and some suggestive material".[56]
Asteroid Citygrossed $28.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $25.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $54 million.[4][57]
In its limited opening weekend, it made $853,382 from six theaters, finishing in tenth. Its per-venue average of $142,230 was the best total since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the largest sinceLa La Landin 2016.[58][59]Expanding to 1,675 theaters in its second weekend, it was projected to gross $7–8 million.[60]It made $3.8 million on its first day of wide release, including $1.1 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to make $9 million, finishing sixth.[61]It also had the highest opening for aWes Andersonfilm in wide release.[62]Asteroid Citycompleted its theatrical run in the United States and Canada on September 7, 2023.[63]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 75% of 356 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Asteroid Cityis unlikely to win Wes Anderson many new converts, but those who respond to his signature style will find this a return to immaculately arranged form."[64]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 76 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[65]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 78% of filmgoers gave it a positive score, with 51% saying they would definitely recommend it.[61]
InThe Guardian,Peter BradshawcalledAsteroid City"terrifically entertaining and lightly sophisticated", and wrote: "The movie rattles cleverly and exhilaratingly along, adroitly absorbing the implications of pathos and loneliness without allowing itself to slow down. It is tempting to consider this savant blankness as some kind of symptom, but I really don't think so: it is the expression of style. And what style it is".[66]John Nugent ofEmpirecommended the film's unique visual and narrative style, writing: "[Anderson] remains cinema's most astonishing stylist, the rigour and detail in every frame never better", but warned: "It is occasionally a bit unfocused, and always a bit indulgent. If you don't like The Wes Anderson Film, you won't like this. But we others must hope he keeps making it."[67]
In his review forVulture,Bilge Ebiriwrote: "To the casual observer, Wes Anderson might seem like someone who either refuses to read his own press or has bought into his press to an absurd degree", alluding to criticism of Anderson's filmmaking style, but later argued: "There's a point to all this indulgence. Anderson's obsessively constructed dioramas explore the very human need to organize, quantify, and control our lives in the face of the unexpected and the uncertain [...]Asteroid Citymight be the purest expression of this dynamic because it's about the unknown in all its forms."[68]
In his review forThe New Yorker,Anthony Lanehighlighted Johansson's performance as what "cracks the movie's ordered surface", and wrote: "Even if you regard the latest movie as a box of tricks, you have to admire the nerve with which Johansson, as Midge, delves into that box and plucks out scraps of coolly agonized wit. More deftly than anyone else, she traffics in the to-and-fro between the real and the imagined".[69]Adam Mullins-Khatib of theChicago Readerhailed the film as "a true achievement from one of America's most unique cinematic voices", complimenting Anderson's direction and screenplay, as well as the cast's performances.[70]
FilmmakersRobert Eggers,Carlos López Estrada,Chad HartiganandJames Ponsoldtall citedAsteroid Cityas among their favorite films of 2023.[71]
More critical reviews ofAsteroid Citycame from those who cited its pacing and story.[72]Writing for theBBC, Nicholas Barber said "at no point does [Anderson] allow us to settle into any narrative in particular".[73]Owen GleibermanofVarietyfound the film similar to the "fussy, top-heavy, narratively batty yet stretched-thin concoctions" he saw inThe Darjeeling LimitedandThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and concluded: "...[the] extraterrestrial visit results in Asteroid City being placed under quarantine, which means that everyone who has come to town is trapped there. The audience will know just how that feels. 'Asteroid City' looks smashing, but as a movie it's for Anderson die-hards only, and maybe not even too many of them."[74]
In a year-end article,VarietylabeledAsteroid Cityas one of the worst movies of 2023, saying " ...[in this] claustrophobic dud of a movie, Anderson triples down on his fetishistic yet oppressive way of engineering a story, even as his most ardent fans triple down on their devotion to the idea that he's somehow expressing an arch humanity. This one, we kept hearing, is actually an aria of 'grief,' though the only grief I felt was that of being trapped in a stylized panorama so insistent it’s become a form of OCD".[75]
Mary Cox of theAlton Telegraphcriticized the script and plot, commenting, "The script was mind-numbing. I saw several people nod off because they were bored."[76]Time'sStephanie Zachareksaid, "Wes Anderson'sAsteroid Cityis what happens when a filmmaker's world of wonder and whimsy becomes a prison."[77]
The film appeared on multiple critics' lists of the best films of 2023, including:

Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Wesley Wales Anderson was born on May 1, 1969, inHouston, Texas, to Ann Anderson (née Burroughs), arealtorandarchaeologist,[6]and Melver Leonard Anderson, who worked in advertising andpublic relations.[7][8][9][10]He is the second of three boys; his parents divorced when he was eight.[10]His older brother, Mel, is a physician, and his younger brother,Eric Chase Anderson, is a writer and artist whose paintings and designs have appeared in several of Anderson's films, includingThe Royal Tenenbaums.[11]Anderson is of English, Swedish, and Norwegian ancestry.[12]
He graduated fromSt. John's Schoolin Houston in 1987, which he later used as a prominent location inRushmore.[13]As a child, Anderson madesilent filmson his father'sSuper 8 camera, which starred his brothers and friends, although his first ambition was to be a writer.[10][11]Anderson worked part-time as a cinema projectionist atHogg Memorial Auditorium[14]while attending theUniversity of Texas at Austin, where he met his roommate[15]and future collaboratorOwen Wilsonin 1989.[10][16]In 1991, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with a major in philosophy.[17][11]He describes being intrigued byTheMeaning of MeaningbyC. K. OgdenandI. A. Richards.
Anderson's first film wasBottle Rocket(1996), based on a short film of the same name that he made withLukeandOwen Wilson. It is acrime caperabout a group of young Texans aspiring to achieve major heists. It was well reviewed but performed poorly at the box office.[18][19][20]
His next film wasRushmore(1998), a quirky comedy about a high school student's crush on an elementary school teacher starringJason Schwartzman,Bill Murray, andOlivia Williams. It was a critical and financial success.[21]The film launched Murray's second act as a respected actor inindependent cinema. Murray appeared in many of Anderson's subsequent films. At the 1999Independent Spirit Awards, Anderson won the Best Director award and Murray won Best Supporting Male. Murray also earned a nomination forGolden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture.

Anderson's next comedy-drama,The Royal Tenenbaums, was released in 2001. The film focuses on a successful, artistic New York City family and its ostracized patriarch, played byGene Hackman.

The film also stars Owen Wilson,Cate Blanchett,Willem Dafoe,Jeff Goldblum, Anjelica Huston, andMichael Gambon. It is a classic example of Anderson's style, but its critical reception was less favorable than his previous films', and its box office did not match the heights ofThe Royal Tenenbaums.[25]
The Darjeeling Limited(2007) was about three emotionally distant brothers traveling together on a train in India. It reflects the more dramatic tone ofThe Royal Tenenbaumsbut faced criticism similar to those ofThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Anderson has acknowledged that he went to India to film the movie partly as a tribute to Indian filmmakerSatyajit Ray, whose "films have also inspired all my other movies in different ways" (the film is dedicated to him).[26]The film stars Anderson staples Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson in addition toAdrien Brody, and the script is by Anderson, Schwartzman, andRoman Coppola.[27]

The film is emblematic of Anderson's style and earned him another Academy Award nomination for his screenplay. The film was also a financial success, earning $68.3 million at the box office against a budget of only $16 million.
In 2014, Anderson's next film,The Grand Budapest Hotel, was released. It starsRalph Fiennes,Tony Revolori,Saoirse Ronan,Jeff Goldblum,Willem Dafoe,F. Murray Abraham, and several of Anderson's regular collaborators, including Murray, Owen Wilson, Swinton and Schwartzman.[30]It is mostly set in the 1930s and follows the adventures of M. Gustave, the hotel's concierge, making "a marvelous mockery of history, turning its horrors into a series of graceful jokes and mischievous gestures", according toThe New York Times.[31]The film is one of Anderson's greatest critical and commercial successes, grossing nearly $175 million worldwide and earning dozens of award nominations, including nine Oscar nominations with four wins forBest Production Design,Best Costume Design,Best Makeup, andBest Original Score.[32]These nominations also included his first forBest Director.

In March 2024, Anderson began production inGermanyfor a new film calledThe Phoenician Scheme, withBenicio del Toro,Michael Cera, andBill Murrayconfirmed to star, with some of Anderson's other regular stars expected to appear.[51]
Anderson's cinematic influences includeWoody Allen,[52]Pedro Almodóvar,[53]Satyajit Ray,[26]Hal Ashby,[54]andRoman Polanski.[55]In an interview withHoda KotbonToday,Bryan Cranstongave insight into Anderson's process (on the same day as one of hisAsteroid Cityco-stars,Jason Schwartzman, who built adarkroomin his house because he thought Anderson would approve of his character development). Schwartzman was onToday 3rd Hour. Cranston said:
"But it's also what surrounds it, where all the actors stay in the same hotel. We have dinner at one table every single night with Wes and all guests; it's like actor camp... On a Wes Anderson film there are no trailers, no dressing rooms... there's no hierarchy, no call sheet—you are just ready to go at about 9:30, 10:00 in the morning in your wardrobe. You hop in his golf cart with him or a van and you go to the set... you hang out with everyone so you never know if you are going to be called into a scene. He's such a kind and generous spirit... also in his personal life. Everyone makes the same amount of money. You just show up and off you go. Sometimes you might [be] just a small supporting role in a scene and then [in] others you'll be the lead in a movie.[56]
Anderson has a unique directorial style that has led several critics to consider him anauteur.[57][58][59][60]He is considered a central figure inAmerican eccentric cinema.[61]
A great many similarities have been noted between Anderson's work and the 1984 filmThe Hotel New Hampshire, a quirky and eccentric comedy-drama written and directed byTony Richardsonwhich featured an ensemble cast includingJodie Foster,Beau Bridges,Rob Lowe,Nastassja Kinski,Amanda Plummer,Matthew Modine, andSeth Greenin his film debut.[62]
TheSovietcomedy movieWelcome, or No TrespassingbyElem Klimov(1964) has been pointed out as one major source of inspiration for Wes Anderson, specifically its “camera work, storytelling devices, and charming whimsy".[63]
In 2010, Wes Anderson selected twelve of his favorite films from theCriterioncloset. Titles three through five were aboxset. They were:[64]
In 2022, Wes Anderson participated in theBritish Film Institute'sSight and Soundpolls. Held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, contemporary directors were asked to select ten films of their choice. Anderson's choices, all French, in chronological order, were:[65]
Anderson has namedRosemary's Babyas his favorite horror film.[66]His three favorite musicals areThe Pajama Game,Meet Me in St. Louis, andSadie McKee.[67]
Anderson's work has been classified aspostmodern, on account of his nostalgic attention to detail, his subversion of mainstream conventions of narrative, his references to different genres in the same film, and his love for eccentric characters with complex sexual identities.[68][69]
Anderson has mostly directed fast-paced comedies marked by more serious or melancholic elements, with themes often centered on grief, loss of innocence, dysfunctional families, parental abandonment, adultery, sibling rivalry and unlikely friendships. His movies have been noted as unusually character-driven and, by turns, both derided and praised with terms like "literary geek chic".[70][71]Their plots often feature thefts and unexpected disappearances, with a tendency to borrow liberally from thecapergenre.[72]
According to Alex Buono,[73]Anderson has been noted for extensive use of flat space camera moves (pans, tilts, and zooms within scenes that look two-dimensional),[74]symmetrical compositions,snap-zooms(rapid, shakey zooms onto subjects),[75]slow-motion walking shots, a deliberately limited color palette, and handmade art direction often using miniatures. These stylistic choices give his movies a distinctive quality that has provoked much discussion, critical study, supercuts, mash-ups, and parody. Many writers, critics, and Anderson himself have commented that this gives his movies the feel of being "self-contained worlds" or a "scale-model household".[76]According to Jesse Fox Mayshark, his films have "a baroquepopbent that is not realist, surrealist or magic realist", but rather might be described as "fabul[ist]".[77]In 2019, the company Murals Wallpaper launched a line of wallpapers inspired by the visual design of Anderson's films.[78]
SinceThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Anderson has relied more heavily on stop motion animation and miniatures, even making entire features with stop motion animation withFantastic Mr. FoxandIsle of Dogs.[79]
Anderson frequently uses pop music from the 1960s and '70s on the soundtracks of his films, and one band or musician tends to dominate each soundtrack.Rushmoreprominently featuredCat StevensandBritish Invasiongroups;The Royal TenenbaumsfeaturedNico;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,David Bowie, including both originals andcoversperformed bySeu Jorge;The Darjeeling LimitedandRushmore,the Kinks;Fantastic Mr. Fox,the Beach Boys; andMoonrise Kingdom,Hank Williams.Moonrise Kingdomis also filled with the music ofBenjamin Britten, which is tied to a number of major plot points.[80]The Darjeeling Limitedalso borrowed music styles from Satyajit Ray's films.
The Grand Budapest Hotel, which is mostly set in the 1930s, eschews pop music, instead using music byAlexandre Desplat. Its soundtrack won Desplat theAcademy Award for Best Original Score, theBAFTA Award for Best Film Music, andWorld Soundtrack Award for Best Original Score of the Year.
The soundtracks for his films have often brought renewed attention to the artists featured, most prominently in the case of "These Days", which was used inThe Royal Tenenbaums.[81]
Anderson's films feature many recurring actors, including the Wilson brothers (Owen,Luke, andAndrew),Bill Murray,Jason Schwartzman,Anjelica Huston,Willem Dafoe,Jeff Goldblum,Edward Norton,Adrien Brody,Bob Balaban,Tony Revolori, andTilda Swinton.[82][83]Robert Yeomanhas served as director of photography for all of Anderson's live-action films, whileMark Mothersbaughcomposed Anderson's first four films, andAlexandre Desplatthe next six, taking over withFantastic Mr. Fox.[84]Randall Posterhas served as music supervisor for all of Anderson's films sinceRushmore. Anderson has co-written films withNoah Baumbach,Roman Coppola, andHugo Guinness. His films have often been financed bySteven Ralesthrough his production companyIndian Paintbrush.[85]
Anderson is in a romantic relationship with Lebanese writer, costume designer, and voice actressJuman Malouf,[86][87]the daughter of novelistHanan al-Shaykh.[88]Malouf gave birth to the couple's daughter, Freya in 2016.[89]Bill Murray is the godfather.[90]
Anderson has maintained an apartment in Paris since 2005, after spending most of his adult life in New York City.[91][92][93]He is the brother of author, illustrator and actorEric Chase Anderson.[94]
Anderson's distinctive filmmaking style has led to numerous homages and parodies. Notable examples include:

Roman Coppola is the son of documentary filmmaker, artist, and writerEleanor Coppola(née Neil) and directorFrancis Ford Coppola.[2]
Coppola began his directing career by overseeingin-cameravisual effects and second unit direction for Francis Ford Coppola'sBram Stoker’s Dracula, which garnered aBAFTA Awardnomination for Visual Effects. He has continued to do second unit direction throughout his career, including his father'sJack,The Rainmaker,Youth Without Youth,Tetro, andMegalopolis; collaborator Wes Anderson'sThe Life Aquatic with Steve ZissouandThe Darjeeling Limited; and his sisterSofia Coppola'sThe Virgin SuicidesandMarie Antoinette.
In the 1990s, Coppola established himself as an influential music video and commercial director. Through his production company, The Directors Bureau, he directed all four music videos forThe Strokes' 2001 debut album,Is This It, as well as "12:51" forRoom on Fire. His other music videos include clips forDaft Punk,Lilys,Moby,The Presidents of the United States of America,Ween,Green Day, andFatboy Slim.

His first feature film,CQ,premiered at the2001 Cannes Film Festival[4]and was well-received critically. Set in Paris in 1969,CQcenters on a young film editor trying to juggle his personal and professional life while simultaneously juggling a science fiction adventure and his own personal art film. The film holds a 66% rating onRotten Tomatoes, based on 76 reviews. The site's consensus reads: "CQis a stylish and fun homage to campy 1960s flicks".[5]Metacriticgave the film a 56/100 "mixed or average" approval rating based on 26 reviews.[6]
Coppola's second feature,A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III, debuted in 2012 at the Rome Film Festival.Charlie Sheenstarred as the title character, a graphic designer dealing with a break-up. The cast also includedBill MurrayandJason Schwartzman.[7]Reviews for the film tended toward the negative. Nathan Rabin ofThe A.V. Clubgave the movie an F, saying that "it isn't a movie so much as a feature-length perfume commercial for a Charlie Sheen signature cologne with gorgeous packaging and absolutely nothing inside."[8]TheDallas Observersaid that the film "might generously be described as cut-and-paste – or more accurately as 'throw stuff to the wall and see what sticks'" and it was "a clunker".[9]The New York Daily NewsgaveCharles Swan IIIone star out of five, saying that "you want to swat it away" and that "maybe with this out of his [Coppola's] system, he'll think up something better."[10]Timesaid that the film "does not lead to a deeper understanding of Charlie Sheen. It does, however, demonstrate his compulsion for poor judgment and bad choices. But weren't we already convinced of that?"[11]Lisa Schwarzbaum, reviewer forEntertainment Weekly, gave the film a C and a milder response, writing, "The idea of this home-movie-with-higher-production-values directed by Roman Coppola is no less sweet for being unoriginal ... The execution, on the other hand, is perilously self-absorbed, a private party involving friends, family, too many fantasy sequences, and an abundance of costume and set design to create a notion of a stylized L.A. spritzed with eau dePlayboy."[12]
In 2009, he directed series of commercials for the T-Mobile MyTouch 3G mobile phone line.[13]
In 2015, he directed aState Farmcommercial.[14]
In 2018, he co-wrote the story forWes Anderson'sadultstop-motion animatedscience-fiction drama filmIsle of Dogs, which was released to critical acclaim for its animation, story, musical score, and deadpan humor.Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film three and a half stars out of four, praising it for taking risks, and saying: "It's smart and different and sometimes deliberately odd and really funny—rarely in a laugh-out-loud way, more in a smile-and-nod-I-get-the-joke kind of way."[15]
In 2021, he again collaborated withWes Andersonfor the filmThe French Dispatch, he co-wrote the story and served as an executive producer. It received generally positive reviews. David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterpraised the "hand-crafted visual delights and eccentric performances" and wrote: "WhileThe French Dispatchmight seem like an anthology of vignettes without a strong overarching theme, every moment is graced by Anderson's love for the written word and the oddball characters who dedicate their professional lives to it".[16]Writing forThe Guardian, Peter Bradshaw said: "It might not be at the very zenith of what he can achieve but for sheer moment-by-moment pleasure, and for laughs, this is a treat".[17]It was mentioned in lists of the best films of the year byThe New Yorker(#1),[18]The Forward(the best movie),[19]IndieWire(#6),[20]Esquire(#38),[21]New Musical Express(#11),[22]British Film Institute(#23)[23]andVogue(unlisted).[24]

His family nickname, adopted when Schreiber was a baby, is "Huggy".[12][8]
When Schreiber was one year old, his family moved to theunincorporated rural communityofWinlaw, in the southern interior ofBritish Columbia.[13]Over the next four years, his mother was hospitalized on several occasions and underwent therapy related to a bad experience onLSDthat she had near the beginning of her marriage (in San Francisco), according to Schreiber's father.[8]After Schreiber's father threatened to have Schreiber's mother admitted to amental institution, Schreiber was kidnapped by his mother, eventually leading to his mother gaining full custody of him.[14]Theysquattedon theLower East Sidein New York City.[15]
Schreiber has described his mother as a "far-outSocialist Labor Partyhippiebohemianfreakwho hung out withWilliam Burroughs".[8][16][17]She was "a highly cultured eccentric" who earned a living by splitting her time between driving a cab and creatingpapier-mâchépuppets." In 1983, his mother bought him amotorcycleon his 16th birthday to "promote fearlessness."[8]The criticJohn Lahrwrote in a 1999New Yorkerprofile that, "To a large extent, Schreiber's professional shape-shifting and his uncanny instinct for isolating the frightened, frail, goofy parts of his characters are a result of being forced to adapt to his mother's eccentricities. It's both his grief and his gift."[8]
Her bohemian proclivities led to actions such as making Schreiber take the Hindu name Shiva Das, wear yoga shirts, consume a vegetarian diet, and briefly attendSatchidanandaAshraminPomfret, Connecticut, when he was 12.[18]Schreiber's mother also forbade her son from seeing color films. As a result, his favorite actors wereCharlie Chaplin, Andrew Cartwright, andBasil Rathbone.

In his first of three film appearances in 1996, Dafoe made a cameo appearance as an electrician in the biographical dramaBasquiat.[51]Next, he played an operative in the romantic war dramaThe English Patient.The English Patientwas filmed inTuscany, where Dafoe said he particularly enjoyed the "quiet moments in the monastery between shoots".[52]In the period dramaVictory—which was filmed in 1994 and premiered in Europe in 1996, but was not released until 1998—Dafoe played a European living on an island in the Southeast Asia who becomes the target of redemption after preventing a woman, played byIrène Jacob, from being raped.[53]
"I really made a conscious effort to mix it up, not because in itself it's not the job of an actor to do all different things, but for me that's what I'm interested in. You've got to be careful because you've got to work with what you have, not just for vanity's sake, but I think the best part of being an actor sometimes is the opportunity to transform yourself superficially, and deeply."
In 1997, Dafoe returned to playing a villainous role in the action thrillerSpeed 2: Cruise Control, expressing the necessity of appearing in both independent andblockbusterfilms.[55]The film starredSandra BullockandJason Patricas a couple vacationing on a luxury cruise that has been hijacked by Dafoe's character, Geiger, a hacker that has programmed the ship to crash into an oil tanker.Speed 2was met with negative reviews from critics,[56]with Dafoe himself receiving aRazzie Awardnomination forWorst Supporting Actor.[57]For his next film,Affliction(1997), Dafoe worked with Paul Schrader for a second time, playing the brother ofNick Nolte's character and served as the film's narrator.[58]Also in 1997, Dafoe took on a voice acting role in an episode of the animated sitcomThe Simpsonstitled "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", voicing the commandant of a military academy thatBartandLisa Simpsonare attending.[59]Following a villainous supporting role in the romantic mystery dramaLulu on the Bridge,[60]Dafoe starred alongsideChristopher WalkenandAsia ArgentoinAbel Ferrara'scyberpunkdramaNew Rose Hotelin 1998.

Much of the film's critical praise went to Dafoe; Roger Ebert wrote that Dafoe "embodies the Schreck ofNosferatuso uncannily that when real scenes from the silent classic are slipped into the frame, we don't notice a difference".[69]TheChicago ReadercriticJonathan Rosenbaumfelt the film's "only redeeming quality" was Dafoe's "enjoyably over-the-top, eye-rolling performance".[70]Dafoe received numerous awards and nominations for his performance, including his secondAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actornomination.[71]Dafoe took on two leading roles in 2001, both of which were as priests.

O. Scottwrote that his performance was "uninspired and secondhand".[77]IGN'sRichard George commented that Green Goblin's armor, particularly the helmet, was "almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression".[78]Steven Scaife atVicewrote that Dafoe's Goblin "represents everything that's fun about superhero villains, as well as everything that's great about Raimi's campy films", also commending Dafoe's voice and body language, which helped overcome the bulky Green Goblin costume that he compared to that of aPower Rangersvillain.[79]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
