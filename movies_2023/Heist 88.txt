Showtime(also known asParamount+ with Showtime[a]) is anAmericanpremiumtelevision networkand the flagship property ofShowtime Networks, a sub-division of theParamount Media Networksdivision ofParamount Global. Showtime's programming includesoriginaltelevision seriesproduced exclusively for the linear network and developed for the co-ownedParamount+streamingservice,theatrically releasedandindependentmotion pictures,documentaries, and occasionalstand-up comedyspecials,made-for-TV movies, andsoftcoreadult programming.[citation needed]
Headquartered atParamount Plazain the northern part ofNew York City'sBroadwaydistrict, Showtime operates eight 24-hour, linearmultiplex channelsand formerly a standalone traditional subscriptionvideo on demandservice; the channel's programming catalog and livestreams of its primary linearEastandWest Coastfeeds are also available via an ad-free subscription tier of Paramount+ of the same name, which is also solda la cartethroughApple TV Channels,Prime Video Channels,The Roku ChannelandYouTube Primetime Channels. (Subscribers of Paramount+'s Prime Video add-on also receive access to the East Coast feeds of Showtime's seven multiplex channels.)[1][2]It is a sister premium television network toThe Movie ChannelandFlix.
In addition, the Showtimebrandhas been licensed for use by a number of channels and platforms worldwide includingShowtime Arabia(it has been merged intoOSN) in the Middle East andNorth Africa, and the now-defunctShowtime Movie ChannelsinAustralia. As of September 2018[update], Showtime's programming was available to approximately 28.567 million U.S. households which subscribed to a multichannel television provider (28.318 million of which receive Showtime's primary channel at a minimum).[3]
Showtime was launched on July 1, 1976, on Times-Mirror Cable systems inEscondido,Long Beach, andPalos Verdes, Californiathrough the conversion of 10,000 subscribers of the previous Channel One franchise. Exactly a week later Showtime launched on Viacom Cablevision's system inDublin, California;[4]the channel was originally owned byViacom.[5]The first program to be broadcast on Showtime wasCelebration, a concert special featuring performances byRod Stewart,Pink Floyd, andABBA. By the end of its first year on the air, Showtime had 55,000 subscribers nationwide.[4]On March 7, 1978, Showtime became a nationally distributed service when it was uplinked tosatellite, becoming a competitor withTime Inc.'sHBOand otherpay cablenetworks.[6]
In 1979, Viacom sold a 50% of Showtime to theTelePrompTer Corporation.[4]On July 4, 1981, Showtime began a 24-hour programming schedule (rival HBO followed suit in December of the same year).[7]In 1982,Group WCable, a subsidiary ofWestinghouse Electric Corporation(which acquired TelePrompTer the previous year), sold its 50% stake in Showtime back to Viacom for $75 million.[4]The sale of Group W's stake in the channel happened shortly after the company began a partnership with Walt Disney Productions (nowThe Walt Disney Company) to develop a competing premium service,The Disney Channel. Group W left thejoint venturein September, due to disagreements over creative control and financial obligations.[8]In 1982 Showtime broadcast its firstmade-for-cable movieFalcon's Goldand its first original series and children's programFaerie Tale Theatre.
In August 1982,MCA Inc.(then the owner ofUniversal Pictures),Gulf+Western(then the owner ofParamount Pictures) and Warner Communications agreed to acquireThe Movie Channel(TMC). The three companies combined acquired a controlling 75% interest in the service (with each holding a 25% ownership stake) from Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment.[9]The deal was spurred by the studios wanting to increase their share of revenue for licensing rights to their films to premium television services, as well as concerns that HBO's dominance of that market and its pre-buying of pay cable rights to films prior to their theatrical release would result in that service holding undue negotiating power for the television rights, resulting in a lower than suitable licensing fee rate the studios would be paid for individual films. The three companies announced an agreement in to acquire interests in TMC on November 11, 1982.[10][11][12]In late December of the same year, theU.S. Department of Justicelaunched a routine preliminary inquiry into the proposed partnership. The Department of Justice had blocked a similar attempt by MCA, Gulf+Western,20th Century Fox, andColumbia Picturesto create a competing pay service, Premiere, in anantitrustcase ruling two years earlier in January 1981.[13]
On January 7, 1983, Viacom International (adding itself as a partner) drafted an amendment to the proposal to consolidate The Movie Channel with Showtime. Under the revised proposal, the four studios would each own a 22.58% stake in the two networks, with American Express owning a 9.68% minority interest. In addition, the consortium would appoint a management team separate from those employed by the two channels–which continued to operate as separate services–to operate the joint venture. However the deal ran into regulatory hurdles because Warner, Universal, and Paramount received 50% of their respective total revenue from film releases and licensing fees from premium services. Also Showtime and TMC combined would control about 30% of the pay cable marketplace, creating anoligopolywith HBO (which in conjunction with Cinemax controlled 60% of the market).[11][12][14]
After a four-month investigation resulted in the Department of Justice filing a civil antitrust lawsuit against the five parties to block the Showtime-TMC merger on June 10, 1983, the Department asked Warner and American Express to restructure the deal during hearings for the case.[15]The Department's decision–citing concerns, including some expressed by HBO management, that combining the assets of Showtime and TMC would stifle competition in the sale of their programming and that of other pay cable services to cable providers–was despite the fact that under the original proposal, MCA, Gulf+Western and Warner had each agreed to continue licensing films released by their respective movie studios to competing pay television networks.[11][12]
The partners involved in the merger would also set standard prices for films that were acquired for broadcast on The Movie Channel and Showtime, either those produced by the studio partners or by unassociated film studios. To address the Justice Department's concerns over the deal, the four partners submitted a revised proposal for consideration on July 19 which included guarantees of conduct agreeing that Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros. would not receive higher residual licensing payments for films acquired by Showtime and The Movie Channel than those paid by other studios, and that all four partners would not permit the two channels in the venture to pay lower fees for films produced by three studio partners than those paid by smaller pay television services for the same films.[16]
After the revised proposal was rejected on July 28, Warner Communications and American Express restructured the purchase to include only Viacom as a partner, bowing Gulf+Western and MCA out from the partnership. The changes – which Justice Department officials acknowledged would "prevent any anti-competitive effect from arising" following the merger, by allowing other premium services to enter the market should the venture significantly raise licensing fee prices for films–led the Justice Department to drop its challenge to the merger agreement on August 12; the department formally approved the deal the following day on August 13.[11][12][17][18]When the deal was completed on September 6, 1983, the operations of The Movie Channel and Showtime were folded into a newholding company, Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc., which was majority owned by Viacom (controlling 50% of the venture's common stock as well as investing $40 million in cash), with Warner Communications (which owned 31%), and Warner-Amex (which owned the remaining 19% interest) as minority partners.[19][20]
As the consolidation of its operations with The Movie Channel was ongoing, in 1983, Showtime increased its national distribution on cable providers when competing premium serviceSpotlightceased operations, effectively absorbing that channel's subscriber base.[4]
In 1984 the network's first major promotional campaign, "We Make Excitement" (also referred to, particularly in bumpers and program introductions, as "Showtime Excitement") was created by the J. Walter Thompson company and utilizing an adapted version of thePointer Sisterssong "I'm So Excited". The campaign lasted into 1986 and coincided with both the exclusivity deal signed with Paramount for films (see below) and a graphical upgrade to the network's presentation to include computer-generated graphics.[21]
On August 10, 1985, afterTime Inc.and cable providerTele-Communications Inc.(TCI) jointly submitted a bid to buy the company for $900 million and the assumption of $500 million in debt as well as an earlier offer by American Express the previous month to buy out Warner's share of the company (under a clause in the agreement that allowed either company the option of buying out their partner's stake in Warner-Amex), Warner Communications exercised an option to acquire American Express' 50% share of Warner-Amex Cable Communications for $450 million. Among the options, barring that it chose to sell Viacom a 50% interest in the company for $450 million, the deal originally excluded Warner-Amex's 19% interest in Showtime-The Movie Channel, Inc.; that interest would have reverted to Warner, which intended to operate Warner-Amex as a wholly owned subsidiary.[22][23][24]
Two weeks later on August 26, Viacom acquired Warner Communications and Warner-Amex's combined 50% ownership interest in Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc. as well as full ownership of the Warner-Amex and public shareholder interests inMTV Networksfor $671.7 million, giving Viacom exclusive ownership of both networks and once again making it the sole owner of Showtime through its $500 million cash payment and acquisition of 1.625 million shares from Warner for the latter's 31% stake in Showtime/The Movie Channel and Warner-Amex's 19% interest in the unit and its 60% interest in MTV Networks (Viacom owned Showtime alone or jointly with other companies–TelePrompTer Corporation, and later briefly, its successor Group W Cable–from the time it launched in July 1976). The buyout, part of an option given by Warner in its purchase of American Express' interest in MTV, was exercised in part to finance much of the buyout of Showtime/The Movie Channel without borrowing any money (ironically, Warner Communications would eventually acquire rivals HBO andCinemax, when the company merged withTime Inc.in 1990 to formTime Warner, which is now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[25][26][27][28]The subsidiary was renamedShowtime Networks, Inc.in 1988.
Also in 1988, the company formed Showtime Event Television (now Showtime PPV) as apay-per-viewdistributor of special event programming. In 1990, Showtime ventured into acquiring and premieringindependent filmsexclusively for the channel as part of the30-Minute Movieshort filmanthology series. One of its first premieres,12:01 PM, was nominated for anAcademy Award;1992'sSession Manwon anAcademy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.[6]In the years that followed, Showtime expanded its acquisitions into the realm of feature-length fare, including theAdrian Lyne-directed 1997 remake ofLolita.
On March 1, 1994, Showtime and The Movie Channel in conjunction with rivals HBO and Cinemax implemented a cooperativecontent advisory systemto provide to parents specific information about pay-cable programming content that may be unsuitable for their children; the development of the system—inspired by the advisory ratings featured in program guides distributed by the major premium cable services—was in response to concerns from parents and advocacy groups about violent content on television, allowing Showtime Networks and other premium services discretionary authority to assign individual ratings corresponding to the objectionable content depicted in specific programs (and categorized based on violence, profanity, sexuality or miscellaneous mature material).[29]A revised system—centered around ten content codes of two to three letters in length—was implemented by Showtime and the other participating premium services on June 10, 1994.[30]
In 1997, the channel's first major rebrand since the 1980s was introduced, with a new logo emphasizing the "SHO" part of the network's name within a circle (intended to be a spotlight), playing into the channel's common acronym in listings services likeTV Guide. A new slogan, "No Limits" (in reference to the fact that as a premium channel, Showtime could push the boundaries of programming without censorship, as well as offer the type of exciting programming that appealed to subscribers), and a bold red-and-black color scheme was instituted, with promotions and bumpers feature surrealistic imagery; the campaign was created by the newly formed in-house marketing and advertising agency, "Red Group".[31]
In 2000, Showtime launched "Showtime Interactive 24.7", a service that providedDVD-style interaction of its entertainment offerings. The following year in 2001, Showtime became one of the first cable networks to launch ahigh definitionsimulcast feed (withStar Trek: Insurrectionbecoming the first film on the network to be broadcast in HD); Showtime also began to provideDolby Digital 5.1surround soundon select programs.[32][33]
On June 14, 2005, Viacom decided to separate itself into two companies (only five years after the company's acquisition ofCBS), both of which would be controlled by Viacom parentNational Amusements, amid stagnation of the company's stock price. When the split was completed on December 31, 2005, the original Viacom was restructured asCBS Corporationand kept Showtime Networks along with the original Viacom's broadcasting assets (which included the CBS television network,UPNand the company's broadcast group, which becameCBS Television Stations),Paramount Television(now the separate armsCBS Studiosfor network and cable production, andCBS Media Venturesfor production offirst-run syndicated programsand off-network series distribution), advertising firm Viacom Outdoor (renamedCBS Outdoor),Simon & Schuster, andParamount Parks(which was later sold toCedar Fair, L.P.on June 30, 2006). A new company that assumed theViacomname tookParamount Pictures, theMTV NetworksandBET Networkscable divisions, andFamous Music(the latter of which was sold toSony-ATV Music Publishing(CBS once ownedits sister company) in May 2007).[34][35]
On August 13, 2019, the announcement was made that CBS and Viacom wouldmerge into a new entityknown asViacomCBS(now known as Paramount Global). Viacom CEOBob Bakishwould be president and CEO of the new company, while Ianniello would become chairman and CEO of CBS and oversee CBS-branded assets.Shari Redstonewould also serve as chairperson of ViacomCBS.[36][37]On October 29, 2019, National Amusements approved the re-merger deal. It closed on December 4, 2019. As part of the new structure the Showtime Networks unit and its assets—Showtime, The Movie Channel andFlix—became part of the Premium Network Group division ofViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks, along withBETand temporarilyPop TV(which was transferred to the Youth & Entertainment Group division the following month, later named MTV Entertainment Group), to be overseen by SNI CEODavid Nevins.[38]ViacomCBS renamed itself as Paramount Global on February 16, 2022; the company's domestic networks division became Paramount Media Networks on the same day.[39][40]
On January 30, 2023, Paramount Global announced plans to fully integrate the Showtimedirect-to-consumer service(which was sold directly to streaming-only consumers) with the premium tier of theParamount+streaming service; the combined service would be branded asParamount+ with Showtime, replacing a streaming bundle of the same name that launched in August 2022.[41]The merger commenced on June 27, 2023,[42]with the cable-specific Showtime AnytimeTV Everywhereapp (which was offered to subscribers of the linear Showtime television service) ceasing operations on December 14, and the standalone Showtime app being discontinued on April 30, 2024;[43][44][45]the primary Showtime channel was rebranded as Paramount+ with Showtime on January 8, 2024, although the former name remains in use as a standalone brand for its multiplex channels and for marketing of the network's original programs.[46]
In 1991, afterHBOandCinemaxdebuted the first premium television multiplex service in the United States, Showtime followed with the testing of its own secondary service–Showtime 2–on October 1 of that year.[47]In April 1994, Showtime announced the creation of a new themed multiplex service, consisting of five channels: Spanish service Showtime En Espanol; family-oriented Showtime Family Television; action-oriented service Showtime Action Television; a service featuring comedy films and series called Showtime Comedy Television; and an all-movie channel called Showtime Film Festival.[48]This planned extension to the multiplex did not come to fruition–although a third multiplex service, Showtime 3, would make its debut in 1996.[49]
The multiplex would eventually expand over time with the launch of the action film channel Showtime Extreme on March 10, 1998, followed by the debut of thescience fictionchannel Showtime Beyond in September 1999; theShowtime Unlimitedname for the Showtime multiplex, TMC and Flix came into use around this time.[50]Three additional themed channels made their debut in March 2001: Showtime Family Zone (which carries films intended for family audiences), Showtime Next (a channel featuring films and series that appeal toward adults between the ages of 18 and 34 years old) and Showtime Women (a channel featuring movies, specials,
and Showtime original programs that appeal toward a female audience).[51][50]The programming format of Showtime 3 was overhauled five months later on July 1, 2001, to focus on theatrical movie releases and Showtime's original made-for-cable films, that under the new name Showcase.
Showtime Family Zone, Showtime Next and Showtime Women do not have distribution by most pay television providers as extensive as the other Showtime multiplex channels. The availability of either of the three channels on cable providers varies depending on the market;Dish Networkonly carries Showtime Family Zone, andDirecTVcarries Showtime Next and Showtime Family Zone, but not Showtime Women.
Depending on the service provider, Paramount+ with Showtime provides up to sixteenmultiplex channels–eight 24-hour multiplex channels, all of which are simulcast in bothstandard definitionandhigh definition–as well as avideo on demandservice (Paramount+ with Showtime On Demand).[52]Paramount+ with Showtime broadcasts its primary and multiplex channels on both Eastern andPacific Time Zoneschedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main Paramount+ with Showtime channel), resulting in thedifference in local airtimesfor a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.
Subscribers to the separate premium film service The Movie Channel, which is also owned by Paramount, do not necessarily have to subscribe to the linear Paramount+ with Showtime service in order to receive TMC; both The Movie Channel and co-owned fellow movie service Flix are typically sold together in a package (although in the case of Flix, this depends on the channel's provider availability), though DirecTV and Dish Network alternately sell TMC through a separate film tier. For unexplained reasons, live feeds of The Movie Channel and Flix have not been included alongside the other Showtime multiplex channels on its proprietary streaming services (including the Paramount+ premium tier) or its add-on tiers that are sold through live-TV streaming providers (such asHulu,YouTube TVandDirecTV Stream), restricting their distribution to traditional cable, satellite and telco/fiber optictelevision providers. From 1999 to 2005, the package encompassing Showtime and its sister networks was marketed as "Showtime Unlimited"; the broader tier sometimes included the Sundance Channel (nowSundance TV) during this period, by way of the stake Showtime Networks held in the network from its 1996 inception until Sundance's 2008 purchase byRainbow Media(now AMC Networks).
SHO×BET now focuses on programming aimed at African American audiences and incorporating original scripted content targeted at that demographic from Showtime andBET's respective libraries, in addition toBET+programming to drive viewers to that streaming service.
Showtime HDis ahigh definitionsimulcast feed of Showtime that broadcasts in the1080iresolution format. In addition to its main channel, all of Showtime's multiplex channels also broadcast in the format, though availability of all of the HD feeds varies by provider. Showtime HD is available through virtually all providers which carry Showtime, along with Showtime's streaming services. Films shown on Showtime's HD simulcast feeds are broadcast in their domesticaspect ratioif that version is provided by the studios that maintain pay television distribution rights with the channel.[53]
Showtime operates asubscription video-on-demandtelevision service calledShowtime on Demand, which is available at no additional charge to Showtime subscribers. Showtime on Demand offers feature films, episodes of Showtime's original series, adult programming and sports events. Showtime on Demand's rotating program selection incorporates select new titles that are added each Friday, alongside existing program titles held over from the previous one to two weeks. The service began to be test marketed in 2001 and was officially launched in July 2002.[54]
On October 27, 2010, Showtime launchedShowtime Anytime, a website that featured around 400 hours of streaming program content available instandardorhigh definitionthat was accessible to subscribers of the Showtime television service withTV Everywherelogin. Content available on the service included Showtime original programming, feature films, comedy specials, documentaries and sports programming.[55]It was available nationally to Showtime subscribers of satellite providerAT&T DirecTV, and regionally by Comcast Xfinity;Spectrum; Optimum; Cox Communications;CenturyLink Prism;Grande Communications;Mediacom;[56]AT&T U-verse;[57]andVerizon FIOS.[58]The Showtime Anytimeapp(which was offered as a free download) was initially released on theiOSApp Storefor theiPadandiPhoneon October 3, 2011.[59]On October 1, 2012, anAndroidapp became available through theGoogle Playplatform for Android devices.[60]
In September 2017, it was discovered that the Showtime Anytime website was injected with code that mined the cryptocurrencyMonerousing the viewer's CPU, which would potentially cause degraded performance for other websites and applications. The code was removed as soon as it was discovered.[61][62]
The Anytime app and website viewing were shut down in December 2023.[63]
On September 22, 2011, Showtime launchedShowtime Social, asecond screeninteractive app providing interactivity with Showtime programs including viewer-participant polls and trivia questions as well as real-time aggregation ofTwitter,Facebookand blog comments about particular Showtime programs; the app utilizes Automated Content Recognition technology to generate interactive content regardless of whether it is being watched live, on-demand or byDVR; the app also displaysheat mapsdepicting viewer reactions throughout the duration of an episode at the conclusion of the program. The app–which was renamedSHO Syncon September 13, 2012–was originally released for Apple iOS devices (iPad and iPhone), with an app forLG-manufacturedSmart TVsbeing released on August 15, 2013.[64][65][66][67]
On July 9, 2015, Showtime announced it would discontinue SHO Sync, immediately discontinuing support of the iPad app with the iPhone and LG apps to be discontinued at a later date. However, the channel hinted that the core interactive functions of SHO Sync may be restored in a different form, with the possibility of being incorporated into Showtime Anytime and the Showtime over-the-top streaming service.[68]
On June 3, 2015, then-Showtime parentCBS Corporationannounced that it would launch anover-the-topsubscription video on demand service that would be distributed as a standalone offering without the requirement of having an existing television subscription to use (in the manner of competitor HBO's OTT offering,HBO Now).[69][70]The service, which used the same branding as the linear television channel, was officially launched on July 7, 2015 (coinciding with the season premieres ofRay DonovanandMasters of Sexon July 12).[71][72][73][74]The service was initially available for purchase throughApple Inc.(toApple TVandiOSdevices),Hulu,Roku,PlayStation Vue, andAmazon Primeas well as through Showtime's website (SHO.com).[75][76][77][78]
The Showtime streaming service was identical to Showtime Anytime; it offered a back catalog of episodes of various past and present Showtime original series (with new episodes of Showtime original series being made available for streaming the same day as their original broadcast on the main linear Showtime channel), feature films and documentaries, and sports events and analysis programs. Subscriptions were also available over Amazon Prime (Amazon Channels), Hulu, The Roku Channel, and Apple TV (Apple TV Channels) as add-ons. Unlike HBO Now, Showtime also provided live streams of the East and West Coast television feeds of the linear Showtime channel (live streams of Showtime's multiplex services, and sister networks The Movie Channel, The Movie Channel Xtra, and Flix were not available on the service; live streams of Showtime's multiplex channels were available for Amazon Prime users as part of the Showtime add-on subscription).[79][80][81]
The Showtime streaming service co-existed with Paramount Global's flagship streaming serviceParamount+,[82]and became part of a bundle offer with the service.[83]In August 2022, the Paramount+ apps were updated with the ability to upgrade a subscription to the "Paramount+ with Showtime" bundle, and for subscribers to the bundle to access Showtime content from within the Paramount+ apps. Showtime would continue to be offered as a standalone service and application.[84][85][86]However, in September, the company was in talks of moving the entire Showtime content within Paramount+.[87][88]By December 2022, Paramount CEOBob Bakishsaid that it "didn't make sense to run Showtime as a 100% stand-alone organization".[89]
On January 30, 2023, Paramount Global confirmed the two services would be fully merged in the near future in the United States, with both the Showtime service and the current Paramount+ Premium tier to be rebranded "Paramount+ with Showtime", echoing similar integrations in other international markets. The "Showtime" brand will remain active as a distinct programming imprint.[41][90]On May 20, 2023, Paramount Global announced that the merger of both services would take place on June 27, with the standalone Showtime app being shut down on April 30, 2024.[91][45]The primary Showtime channel was rebranded as Paramount+ with Showtime on January 8, 2024, although the former name remains in use as a standalone brand for its multiplex channels.[46]
Paramount+ with Showtime's programming schedule currently consists largely of theatrically released feature films—which occupy much of the service's daily schedule, varying in quantity depending on channel—and original series targeted at adult audiences (including, as of June 2020[update], dramas likeShameless,Homeland,Yellowjackets,Billions,The Chi,The L Word: Generation Q, andPenny Dreadful: City of Angels; comedies such asBlack Monday,Our Cartoon PresidentandKidding; and docuseries includingThe CircusandVice). In addition, Showtime has documentary films, boxing matches, sports-centric magazine series, occasional originalstand-up comedyspecials, and short-form behind-the-scenes specials centered mainly on theatrical films (either running in their initial theatrical or Showtime Networks broadcast window).[citation needed]
Since the early 1980s, Showtime has run an adult-oriented late nightprogramming blockon its main channel called "Showtime After Hours" (which was briefly branded as "Showtime Late Night" during the mid-1990s) each night after 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time; programs featured within the block include feature films, series produced specifically for broadcast during the block and occasional stand-up comedy specials.[citation needed]Softcore eroticaprogramming has previously aired during the "After Hours" block, though adult films have been absent from Showtime's primary channel since the mid-2000s; the network began broadcasting a limited amount of original erotica series (such asBeach Heat: Miami) on its main channel in 2010, after having been removed for most of the previous decade.[citation needed]The network's multiplex channels Showtime 2 and Showtime Extreme also occasionally feature adult films during the overnight hours, though this has become less commonplace since late 2011.[citation needed]
Until the formation of Showtime Family Zone in 2001, Showtime heavily incorporated programming (both American and foreign) aimed at children and teenagers as part of its daytime schedule; in particular, the main channel ran a late afternoon block of teen-oriented series on Sundays (such asReady or Not,Chris CrossandDegrassi High), as well as a morning block of shows aimed at younger children (such asOWL/TV,A Bunch of MunschandThe Busy World of Richard Scarry) during the early and mid-1990s, and a weekday mid-afternoon and Sunday morning film block called "Showtime Familytime" that ran during the 1980s and 1990s.[citation needed]
The main Showtime network also carried, unusually for a premium channel, news programming; the now-defunctAll News Channel(partially owned by Viacom) produced 90-second long news updates that aired during Showtime's primetime promotional breaks in the early 1990s (ANC also produced news updates for fellow Viacom network VH1), in part as a response to the firstGulf War.[92]
Showtime has become known in recent years for the network's original television programs, the most popular of which include thecrime dramaDexter, thedarkcomedy dramaWeeds, family dramasRay DonovanandShamelessand the drama/thriller seriesHomeland. Other notable past and present original series includeStargate SG-1(which ran on Showtime for its first five seasons, before moving to the Sci-Fi Channel (nowSyfy) for the remainder of its run);Dead Like Me;Californication;Gigolos;Nurse Jackie;The Tudors;Brotherhood;Soul Food;Queer as Folk;The L Word;The Big C;Penn & Teller: Bullshit!; andUnited States of Tara. In mid-2017, the channel aired the critically acclaimed[93][94]third season ofDavid Lynch's TV seriesTwin Peaks. From 2007 to 2013, multiplex service Showtime 2 broadcast an original program exclusive to that channel, the seasonal late nightreality seriesBig Brother After Dark, a companion to sister broadcast networkCBS' American adaptation ofBig Brother; the program moved to TVGN (which has since been renamedPop) starting with the June 26, 2013, premiere ofBig Brother's15th season.[95]
Showtime formerly produced its own originalmade-for-cable movies, originally branded as "Showtime Original Movies" until 1994 and "Showtime Original Pictures" thereafter until the channel discontinued producing television films in 2007. Showtime is also one of only two premium cable services (alongside Disney Channel during its existence as a premium channel prior to 1997) that has produced original movies aimed at family audiences; these films were originally broadcast under the separate banner "Showtime Original Pictures for Kids" from 1995 to 1997 and "Showtime Original Pictures for All Ages" from 1997 to 2005.
A signature feature of Showtime was alate-nightblock known asShowtime After Hours, which featuredsoftcore pornographicfilms and original series. Showtime did not have set start or end times for the block, as they varied depending on the mainstream feature films–and original series on certain nights–that aired prior to and following it, and also depended on the number of programs and programs in particular that were scheduled to air within the block. Programs that aired under the Showtime After Hours banner carried either a TV-MA or R rating (usually the former), primarily forstrong sexual contentandnudity. The block had often been the subject of both scrutiny in the media and a source of humor inpopular culture, with references to Showtime's late night programming being featured in various films and television shows.
As of 2024[update], Showtime–and sister channelsThe Movie ChannelandFlix–maintains exclusive first-run film licensing agreements withAmblin Partners(including releases produced in conjunction withDreamWorks Pictures, which maintains a pay television licensing agreement for its other releases with Showtime rivals HBO and Cinemax, andParticipant),[96]A24,[97]andBleecker Street.[98]
Despite being corporately reunited with Paramount Pictures in 2019 as a result of the ViacomCBS merger, Paramount maintains an existing output deal withMGM+(formerly Epix, which Paramount co-owned with Lionsgate and MGM from its 2009 launch until 2018) until the end of 2025. New films from Paramount Pictures will not be able to air on Showtime until 2026 unless further negotiations are made.[99]
Showtime also shows sub-runs – runs of films that have already received broadcast orsyndicated televisionairings – of theatrical films distributed byIFC Films,Sony Pictures(including content fromColumbia Pictures,TriStar Pictures,Screen Gems,Revolution StudiosandMorgan Creek Productions),Warner Bros. Pictures(including content fromNew Line Cinema),Universal Pictures(including content from subsidiaryFocus Features),Open Road Films,Screen Media,Oscilloscope(select films),Summit Entertainment(for films released prior to 2013),Paramount Pictures(for films released prior to 2020),Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer(including content from subsidiaryUnited Artists),Lionsgate(sub-run rights with the latter two studios are for films released prior to 2015), andWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures(including content fromPixar,20th Century Studios,Walt Disney Animation Studios,Walt Disney Pictures, andMarvel Studios).
The window between a film's initial release in theaters and its initial screening on Showtime and sister channels The Movie Channel and Flix is wider than the grace period leading to a film's initial broadcast on HBO/Cinemax,Starz/Encore, andEpix.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
