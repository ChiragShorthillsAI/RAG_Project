It is directed byElizabeth Chai VasarhelyiandJimmy Chin(in their featurenarrative filmdirectorial debut) and written by Julia Cox on the basis of Nyad's 2015 memoirFind a Way. It starsAnnette Beningas Nyad,[2]withJodie FosterandRhys Ifansin supporting roles.[3]
Nyadhad its world premiere at the50th Telluride Film Festivalon September 1, 2023. Following its premiere at the2023 Toronto International Film Festival, it was released in select theaters on October 20, 2023, then streamed on Netflix on November 3.Nyadreceived positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for the performances of Bening and Foster. For their performances, Bening and Foster received nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively, at the96th Academy Awards, the29th Critics' Choice Awards, the81st Golden Globe Awards, and the30th Screen Actors Guild Awards.
In 2010, sixty-year-oldDiana Nyadresolves to accomplish the one thing that has eluded her—a 110-mile nonstop swim fromCubatoFlorida, which she unsuccessfully attempted thirty years prior. She appoints her best friend and former partner,Bonnie Stoll, to train her. Despite public skepticism because of her age, Diana relocates toKey Westwith Bonnie for her training and hiresnavigatorJohn Bartlett to accompany her on her swim. In lieu of ashark cage, Diana opts to swim with aShark Shield, a shark repellant electronic device.
In August 2011, Diana makes her first attempt at swimming theFlorida Straitssince 1978. However, an allergic reaction to painkillers, combined with unfavorable ocean currents pushing her off course, forces her to quit early. On her second attempt a month later, she gets stung bybox jellyfish. The lead medic jumps in to save her, but he is also ensnared by the jellyfish and has to be rescued. A shot is administered to Diana for the venom, but she insists on continuing to swim with her injury. After some initial resistance, Bonnie and John oblige her, but Diana gets stung again and briefly loses consciousness. She is resuscitated on the boat.
Diana recovers in a hospital, where Bonnie expresses her worry to Diana about the severity of the dangers and warns her she is letting her personal dream overtake the safety of the boat crew. Diana pleads for another try and consults with a box jellyfish expert, who gives her a specially designed protective suit. Diana's swims and training are interspersed with flashbacks that show her upbringing and her sexual abuse at the hands of her childhood swimming coach,Jack Nelson.
In August 2012, Diana makes another attempt, despite warnings from John about bad weather conditions. A thunderstorm breaks out during Diana's swim and John's boat starts to flood. Bonnie calls for Diana to abort the mission despite Diana's pleas to keep going. Back on land, Diana refuses to admit defeat and plans for another try, prompting a fight between her and Bonnie. Bonnie calls out Diana's self-centeredness and laments how she has put aside her own dreams just to support Diana, before quitting as trainer.
Some time later, Diana calls John and apologizes for her behavior. John accepts the apology but admits he can't do another run because of more pressing concerns, including financial stability. Diana visits Bonnie and the two reconcile. Bonnie informs Diana that Nelson passed away, and the news compels Diana to reflect on her trauma. Bonnie later decides to train Diana again after realizing the closeness of their bond. John also returns as navigator; he discloses to Bonnie that he is in ill health and wants one last opportunity to see what Diana can do.
Diana begins her fifth attempt on August 31, 2013; this time she is helped by more favorable currents. Danger arises when a shark approaches and the Shark Shield is not properly functioning. Assistants from the boat's crew jump in the water in time to ward off the shark, which swims away. Hours later, Diana's body is showing signs of exhaustion. She has hallucinatory visions of theYellow Brick RoadfromThe Wizard of Ozand theTaj Mahal. To help motivate her, Bonnie jumps into the water and implores Diana to give it one last push. When the coastline of Key West is in sight, the crew excitedly informs Diana that they are getting closer.
On September 2, Diana makes it to the shore of Key West, where hordes of spectators and fans are gathered to watch. She emerges from the water and gradually ascends onto the beach, prompting celebrations from the crowd. Asked by the press to speak, Diana says she wants to say three things: "One, never, ever give up. Two, you're never too old to chase your dreams. And three, it may look like a solitary sport…but it takes a team."
In January 2022, it was announced that Netflix will distribute the film.[7]In March 2022, it was announced that production was underway.[6]
Nyadhad its world premiere at the50th Telluride Film Festivalon September 1, 2023.[8][9]It had its international premiere on September 12, at the48th Toronto International Film Festival.[10][11]It was released in select theaters on October 20, 2023, then streamed on Netflix on November 3.[12]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 85% of 162 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7/10. The website's consensus reads: "Nyadis an uplifting sports biopic strictly on the merits of its story, but it's the outstanding performances from Annette Bening and Jodie Foster that really keep this picture afloat."[13]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 63 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[14]
Richard Roepercalled the film a "rousing biopic" and stated: "When Bening and Foster are onscreen together, it’s movie magic. They don’t just have chemistry; they’re chemistry professors."[15]Siddhant Adlakha ofMashablewrote, "It's a movie in which age is both obstacle and strength, and it allows Bening and Foster to play their ages gracefully, as actresses in their sixties. Whatever it struggles to say about bravery in the face of wounds from decades past, it manages to say tenfold about the way its characters choose to live now.Nyadbuilds to exuberant emotional crescendos that feel straight out of the schmaltzy Hollywood biopic playbook, but these scenes transcend cliché thanks to the emotionally resonant performances at their core."[16]He critiqued the handling of the abuse plot line as "narratively misplaced", but said "thanks to [the film's] unyielding focus on physical strain and suffering — it's the aquaticPassion of the Christ— it maintains enough stakes and sporadic intensity to get by".[16]Writing forThe New York Times, Amy Nicholson said Bening and Foster's scenes together "capture decades of camaraderie in effortless shorthand".[17]
Writing forVulture, Alison Willmore praised how the film eschews biopic conventions of making the protagonist likable, as well as Bening's commitment to the role and physical transformation.[18]She said, "Despite that dedication, there’s a hollowness to the way the film characterizes its protagonist, which means Bening’s performance never fully resonates", adding "we never see any of that or much of what [Diana's] life is like outside of training at all".[18]Christy LemireofRogerEbert.comwrote, "There's a thornier, messier, much more provocative story to be told here, so it's frustrating the filmmakers opt for easy inspiration instead."[19]She noted how the film curiously skips over Nyad's history of embellishment, but praised the acting in particular, saying "it’s a joy to watch Foster dig into this kind of amusing and meaty role once more. Bonnie is the one person who will call Diana out on her obnoxious behavior—at least until Rhys Ifans arrives later as the no-nonsense captain of the boat that cruises alongside Diana during troubled try after try."[19]Lemire concludedNyad"might not be the greatest film about…achievement, but it’s sufficiently entertaining".[19]
Rex Reedcalled it "a movie of uncommon exhilaration" that "resonates long after the final frame," and highly praised the performances of Bening and Foster.[20]Peter Traverssaid Bening's performance is "body-and-soul acting at its peak", and referred to Foster as "an exuberant blast", continuing: "Their teamwork is a thing of beauty."[21]Leonard MaltinnamedNyadas one of his favorite films of 2023: "Nyadis a compelling biopic that could have been bland, or didactic, or dull. Instead, in the hands of documentary filmmakers Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, with a smart script by Julia Cox, it soars. One of this year's great pleasures was watching Annette Bening and Jodie Foster together, inhabiting their characters so completely that it didn't seem like acting at all. I would also nominate Rhys Ifans for Best Supporting Actor."[22]
Nyad's crossing from Cuba to Florida took four attempts over four years but lost its formal recognition from theGuinness Book of World Recordsdue to controversy between leading swimming organizations about whether the swim could actually be authentic, based on the existing evidence.[45]
Nyad first sought formal recognition of her feat from leading figures in the marathon swimming community shortly after completing her swim in 2013, but she was immediately held to questioning about what kind of equipment she used, how much her crew assisted her in the water, and why her speed nearly doubled in some portions of the swim.[46]
According to a 2014 Openwaterpedia entry, the Florida Straits Open Water Swimming Association (FSOWSA), which did not exist at the time of the swim, was established to set rules and standards to ratify Nyad's 2013 swim to Cuba, but according to one of the leading marathon organizations, the World Open Water Swimming Association (WOWSA), founded in 2008,[46]there is limited evidence that FSOWSA exists.[47][48]
In 2018, according toTime, Nyad reached out to the World Open Water Swimming Association (WOWSA) to request official recognition of her swim, but at the time, no official standards for ratifying such a swim existed other than those followed by the English Channel Association.[49]
TheLos Angeles Timesreported that Nyad had lied about her swimming record previously.[50]She claimed to have placed sixth at the1968 Olympic trials, which she never actually attended. She also stated in her 2015 memoirFind a Way, which served as the basis of the film, that she was the first person to swim around Manhattan, when she was actually the seventh.[51]
Some Nyad supporters have dismissed scrutiny of the swimmer as a sexist response to a powerful woman, but her detractors have countered that marathon swimming is one of the few sports where women frequently best men in competition.[51][52]Athletes likeGertrude Ederle,Greta Andersen,Shelley Taylor-Smith, andCindy Nicholashave been celebrated by the swimming community for outperforming men in endurance and speed.[52][53]
Marathon swimmer and journalist Elaine K. Howley stated, “Nyad lovers always throw back at us that we’re anti-female, anti-gay, and that couldn’t be further from the truth. I have found marathon swimming to be incredibly LGBTQ+-friendly and welcoming to older women. That is all a straw man. Just because somebody is part of a marginalized group doesn’t mean you can’t ask questions when they make extraordinary claims.”[51]
In September 2023, immediately following the premiere ofNyadat the Telluride Film Festival,[54]the World Open Water Swimming Association (WOWSA) revisited its 2022 investigation and report[49][55]rejecting the validity of Nyad's 2013 Cuba-to-Florida swim and claimed that numerous pages had been "vandalized" by WOWSA founder Steve Munatones.[56]The WOWSA board once more announced that it could not recognize the swim. This judgment was based on nine hours that went undocumented in designated observer logs during the course of the swim,[57]conflicting accounts from crew members,[49][58]and GPS data showing unusually high speeds of up to 4.0 miles per hour.[59]For context, Michael Phelps's 2002 world-record Olympic 400-meter swim had a pace of about 3.7 miles per hour at a time of 4 minutes and 3 seconds.[60]Nyad was 64 at the time of the swim and claims this very high speed came from the help of ocean currents.[61]
WOWSA judged Nyad's swim by documentation standards established by the English Channel Association, which as founded in 1927.[62]According toNyadFactCheck.com, Nyad made three failed attempts to swim the English Channel, a struggle that was depicted in the 1978 documentary celebrating her ambition in the face of failure, "Courage to Succeed." The English Channel Association posts no record of her attempting the swim.[63]
Steve Munatones, founder of WOWSA, had been trying to push for ratification of Nyad's swim and was consequently restructured out of his own organization.[56]Munatones had served as an advisor for the filmNyadstarring Annette Bening and Jodie Foster[64]and, along with Evan Morrison of the Marathon Swimming Federation, had encouraged the marathon swimming community to embrace Nyad in order to bring more visibility to their sport.
Evan Morrison of the Marathon Swimming Federation (MSF), the other major organization for marathon swimming, has stated, "What the new WOWSA management doesn’t seem to understand, since they weren’t around at the time, is that in 2013, there was no system of ratification for independent solo swims, or generally accepted standards of documentation."[64]In 2022, the MSF had completed an extensive analysis of the swim and recognized it as an "assisted" swim, which indicates that the swimmer was touched by her crew and wore a special stinger wetsuit to protect her from jellyfish, rather than going untouched and wearing the everyday swim suit used for "unassisted" swims.[64]
In response to WOWSA's 2023 judgment, theGuinness Book of World Recordsrevoked its recognition of Nyad's achievement.[65]Nyad responded by saying "Maybe I had too much hubris, like, ‘I don’t need to prove this to anybody.’ That's my bad".[66]
Nyad believes if she had been more engaged with the marathon swimming before attempting the swim, she might have avoided the high level of controversy she faced. "Marathon swimmers are a special breed; it's a grueling sport, and they suffer," Nyad toldTime. The sport is filled with people who have committed impressive athletic feats, swimming day and night without stopping, exposed to extreme weather and dangerous marine life.[46]Literally hundreds of them have written books[67]and had documentaries[68]made about them—but Nyad, who with a decades-long career in broadcast and print journalism[69]"is perhaps the best known athlete in a sport few people know... with even fewer media-savvy representatives."[46]The benefits she enjoyed from her elite media connections, combined with her false statements about her achievements, triggered antagonism in a community that is filled with accomplished athletes.
The film simplifies Nyad's Cuba-to-Florida swim, showing her with only one vessel and aiming for an "unassisted" swim, which misrepresents the actual event's involvement of multiple vessels, a comprehensive crew, and the use of a stinger suit that contradicts the unassisted claim. The film dramatizes events that did not occur, such as a shark encounter, which never happened during the 2013 attempt but has affected documented marathon swims by other athletes.[70][71]It also inaccurately portrays her completing a swim of the English Channel, which official records show she never did,[63]and gives her the extraordinary English Channel crossing time of 7.5 hours, which would make her time 10 minutes faster than the current record-holder for fastest swim by a woman (or lady, per Channel Swimming Association parlance), the AmericanPenny Lee Dean.[72][73]

They arrived 10 days after the war ended, heading toPristina, where they met groups of passionate young journalists and activists and decided to center the documentary there.[6]This became a 25-minute work,Reconstructing Kosovo, that Vasarhelyi used in her thesis on comparative literature, but she and Berkeley then expanded it into an hour-long documentary for public release.[5]
The final documentary centers on seven youth: journalists Nebi Qena andGarentina Kraja; soloist from the Jericho group, Petrit Çarkaxhiu; director, Kaltrina Krasniqi; Ylber Bajraktari, Driton Bekqeli and Linda Gusia; as well as publisher of the newspaperKoha Ditore,Veton Surroi.[7][8]The documentary also brings in its two creators as characters, watching them learn about the war and relate to their subjects.[9]The film follows the group of activists for three years after the war, watching them make change and become leaders of the new state as they recover from trauma and despair.[10]A Normal LIfewas selected to show at 2003 documentary festivals likeTribeca,Woodstock,Montreal, andCopenhagen, and was also shown by theCarnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs.[11]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
