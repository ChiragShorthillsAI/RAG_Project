Fielding is a socially awkward college kid, who decides to adopt a puppy after being rejected by a girl. He finds a yellowlabpuppyat the local pound and adopts him. He names the dog Gonker, and they are inseparable for the rest of his college career. The dog often runs with him to class on campus without a leash. When college is done, all of Fielding's friends have jobs, but Fielding does not know what he wants to do with his life, which worries his father, John. Fielding moves in with his parents with Gonker. A few weeks later, Gonker is diagnosed withAddison's diseaseand needs a life-saving shot every month for the rest of his life.
Nate, his best friend from college, visits him a few weeks later, and they are out on a hiking trail with Gonker, who runs off chasing a fox. When he doesn't return, they start looking for him, but cannot find him. Panicked, they rush home and tell Fielding's parents that Gonker might be lost.
There are flashbacks of Fielding's mother Ginny having a dog, Oji, when she was a young girl, who was run over when she was at school. Her parents are shown to be cold and unfeeling and encourage her to not make a big deal about it. She buries the pain and trauma, but it gets triggered by Gonker's loss and bubbles up to the surface. She sets up a control room in their house, calling local newspapers, animal shelters, hospitals, and starts sending out flyers throughout the state. Local newspapers and then national newspapers pick up Gonker's story and there are now a lot of people looking for Gonker. They have to find him before he needs his next shot in three weeks.
During the extensive search, Fielding's health takes a turn for the worse. He is not eating much, barely sleeping, and getting weaker by the day. They receive a call about a dog with Addison's disease from an animal shelter and rush there only to find that it is not Gonker. They keep looking but are not having much luck. Seeing Fielding's deteriorating health, his father decides to drive him back home and call off the search and rescue. Just then, they receive a call of another sighting, and this time it is Gonker. They bring him back home which immediately perks Fielding up. But Fielding has to be rushed to the hospital where he is diagnosed withulcerative colitisand has an emergency operation, which is successful. The movie ends on an optimistic note with both Gonker and Fielding sleeping together in his hospital bed and recuperating. During the credits, it was revealed that Gonker never left the Marshalls again and Fielding now lives inChilegiving kayaking tours.

In his autobiographyStories I Only Tell My Friends, he wrote regarding Sheen, "We were both nerds [...] he wanted to be a baseball player."[12]On a March 25, 2019 episode of the ‘WTF!? With Marc Maron’ podcast, Lowe boasted that he was once capable of bench pressing 135 pounds as a senior member of Santa Monica High School's baseball team, which has become a reoccurring punchline on his ‘Literally’ podcast.
Lowe got his first professional acting role in 1976 when he was 12 and still living in Dayton.[13]He played an errand boy in a production ofSherlock Holmesat theWright State Universitysummer theater. He landed the part by calling every local theater and asking each if there was a part for a child in a play. Lowe was paid $150 for the role. In 1979, Lowe landed the part of Tony Flanagan in the short-lived television comedyA New Kind of Family.[14]
One of Lowe's earliest roles came in the 1983 television filmThursday's Child, for which he received his firstGolden Globe Awardnomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film.[15]He also appeared in the music video forThe Go-Go'ssong, "Turn to You".[16]His breakthrough role was his big-screen debut in 1983, when he andEmilio Estevezwere cast inFrancis Ford Coppola'sThe Outsiders.[17]Lowe played the role of Sodapop Curtis, the brother of the main characters Ponyboy Curtis (C.

He playedSam Seabornin the television seriesThe West Wingfrom 1999 to 2003 (and briefly in 2006). His performance in the show garnered Lowe aPrimetime Emmy Awardnomination[27]and two Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor in a Drama Series.[28]Lowe was drawn to the role because of his personal love of politics, and his longstanding friendship withMartin Sheen, who was cast as PresidentJosiah Bartlet.
When the show premiered, Lowe was considered the lead, and the pilot centered on his character. But as other members of the cast —includingAllison Janney,Richard Schiff,Janel Moloney,Dulé Hill,John Spencer,Bradley Whitford, Martin Sheen (who was initially scripted as a small role), andStockard Channing(whoseFirst Ladywas initially scripted as a guest role)— grew more popular, Lowe's character no longer served as the show's main focus. Lowe and series creatorAaron Sorkinsoon found themselves at odds over the network's meddling with the show, most notably the network demanding changes in Lowe's character. Eventually, Lowe left the series, not long before Sorkin and director/executive producerThomas Schlammeresigned over a dispute withNBC.
During the final season ofThe West Wing, Lowe returned to his role of Sam Seaborn, appearing in two of the final four episodes.

The average price of tract homes in Santa Barbara in early 2006 was US$1,100,000, which motivated some to propose denser housing on existing lots.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
