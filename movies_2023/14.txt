Fontaine is a drug dealer in a suburban neighborhood called the Glen. One night, after obtaining payment from one of his customers, Slick Charles, he is killed by an opposing drug dealer named Isaac.
The next morning, Slick is shocked when Fontaine shows up for the money once again, somehow alive and without any recollections of the previous night's events. The two find Slick's sex worker Yo-Yo, to confirm Slick's claims of his death, confusing Fontaine. Recalling a man, bleeding from a gunshot, who was kidnapped by a black SUV, Fontaine leads Slick and Yo-Yo to the vehicle which is now parked outside a house.
Investigating inside, they discover an elevator leading to an underground lab. Inside, a white scientist with an afro tells them that the operation has gone widespread before Slick accidentally kills him after snorting a mysterious white substance he thinks is cocaine which makes him laugh. Before they leave, the trio discovers a corpse lying on a table, identical to Fontaine.
After finding that the entrance to the lab has disappeared the following morning, the trio heads to a fried chicken restaurant, where the diners are all laughing, making Slick realize that the food contains the same substance that he consumed previously. Seducing the restaurant manager, Yo-Yo discovers that the entirety of the Glen is being surveilled and recorded and that the substance is also being used in grape drinks and hair products.
Finding a hidden elevator within a church altar, the trio enter an underground lab facility that spans the entire Glen area and witness Black people being subject to disturbing behavioral experiments. They find that the lab has clones of many Glen residents, including Fontaine and Slick. After Fontaine sets off an alarm, they exit through a strip club. The DJ brainwashes the clubgoers with a song and forces them to chase the trio. A white man named Nixon and a Fontaine clone named Chester show up to halt the clubgoers.
Nixon reveals that scientists conduct experiments on impoverished, predominantly Black populations such as the Glen, to allow the operation to go unnoticed and supposedly achieve peace in America. After briefly using a trigger word to force the entire crowd to follow his commands with the exception of Yo-Yo, putting them at risk, Nixon threatens to use it on the crowd again if the trio doesn't stop their investigation.
Despite this, Yo-Yo decides to take matters into her own hands, but her identity is exposed, and Nixon kidnaps her. Learning of this, Fontaine devises a plan with Isaac and Slick to rescue Yo-Yo, with Fontaine faking his death to sneak into the lab undetected. Fontaine then lets Slick and Isaac in to storm the lab with numerous residents of the Glen. They free the Black people being experimented on, including the clones, while Yo-Yo frees herself and finds Slick.
Chester overpowers and takes Fontaine to an older version of himself, the original Fontaine. He explains that he is helping scientists create "peace" by whitewashing black people into white people, through mind control andgenerational breeding. Fontaine's little brother's racially-motivated murder by a police officer prompted him to start making the clones. After the original Fontaine claims the country would be better with assimilation than annihilation, Fontaine uses Nixon's trigger word on Chester and has him shoot the original. Meanwhile, Yo-Yo stalls Nixon from killing her before Slick shoots him in the head.
The facility entrance to the church opens, spilling clones out to the public, exposing the secret operation. After Yo-Yo announces her retirement from her job, the trio decides to head toMemphis, to further expose and stop the operation.
Meanwhile, inLos Angeles, a man named Tyrone, identical to and living the same lifestyle as Fontaine, is watching TV with his friends, when they see one of Fontaine's clones appear on the news.

Teyonah Parris comes off as aBlaxploitationstar mixed withfuturism with her natural hair, faux fur yellow coat, leopard print pants, and thigh-high boots.

But, as ready as the audience might be to be transported to hitherto unvisited districts of the genre's potential universe,Tyronenever quite gets there".[36]Owen GleibermanofVarietywrote that despite its "good set-up", "the film is too sketchy and conceptual to work as a bad-dream thriller".[37]
In an essay about the new wave of Black, satirical, absurdist films, Maya Phillips inThe New York TimescriticizedGet OutandAmerican Fictionfor being limited by the way they "aimed at white liberal audiences so they can feel in on the joke. Black audiences, on the other hand, are left with a simplified representation of their race that doesn’t dare be too controversial." Phillips contrastedThey Cloned Tyronefavorably with those movies and suggested the film succeeds because it is "not just about the way characters speak or the exaggerated depictions of their lives; it’s also about their internal conflicts, whether they choose to submit to a racist narrative."[38]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
