It's Me, Margaret.is a 2023 Americancoming-of-agecomedy-dramafilm written and directed byKelly Fremon Craig, based on the 1970 novelof the same namebyJudy Blume.[5]The film starsAbby Ryder Fortsonas the title character, along withRachel McAdams,Elle Graham,Benny Safdie, andKathy Bates.
The film had its world premiere at theSan Francisco International Film Festivalon April 23, 2023, and was released theatrically in the United States on April 28, 2023, byLionsgate. It received positive reviews and grossed $21 million worldwide.
In 1970, eleven-year-old Margaret Simon is informed by her parents Barbara and Herb that the family is moving from New York City to a New Jersey suburb, as Herb has received a promotion. Margaret is upset about leaving her friends and her paternal grandmother, Sylvia, and begins to communicate with God about her concerns, anxieties, and hopes.
Upon moving to New Jersey, Margaret is quickly befriended by her neighbor and soon-to-be classmate Nancy Wheeler. Nancy welcomes Margaret into her friend group with two other girls, Gretchen Potter and Janie Loomis.
At the beginning of the school year, Margaret's teacher, Mr. Benedict, gives the class a year-long research assignment. When he wonders why Margaret dislikes religious holidays, she explains that since her mother is aChristianand her father isJewish, her family does not observe the holidays and has left it up to Margaret to decide on her own religious identity as she grows older. Mr. Benedict suggests that Margaret should have religion be her subject on her research assignment.
Prompted by her assignment, Margaret asks her mother why she has never met her maternal grandparents. Barbara reveals she is estranged from her devoutly Christian parents Paul and Mary, who disowned Barbara when she married a Jew. On a weekend visit to New York, Margaret asks Sylvia to take her totemple, which Sylvia gladly does. Meanwhile, Barbara attempts to fit in with thePTAand signs up for multiple committees, which draws her away from her love of painting and teaching art.
Margaret and her new friends anticipate the milestones of puberty, such as wearing a bra and having their first kisses. At classmate Norman Fischer's birthday party, Margaret enjoys her first kiss with Philip Leroy, a popular boy in her class, during a game ofspin the bottle. Margaret also attends respectivechurch serviceswith Janie and Nancy.
After viewing a video about menstruation at school, the girls become excited about starting their periods. Margaret grows impatient when other girls get their periods before her, including Gretchen and Nancy. One night while Margaret is in New York with Nancy and her family, Nancy gets her period for the first time, and Margaret realizes she had fibbed about getting her period earlier.
At school, Margaret is assigned a group project with Laura Danker, a classmate ostracized by her peers (including Nancy) for being taller andmore developed. While working together in the library, Margaret brings up rumors about Laura letting boys "feel her up", upsetting Laura and causing her to storm out. Following Laura to aCatholicchurch where she enters aconfessional, Margaret admits her guilt over how she treated Laura.
Forspring break, Margaret wants to join Sylvia on a trip to Florida, but these plans are interrupted when Paul and Mary reach out to Barbara and say they want to visit and meet Margaret. Upon learning of the cancelation, Sylvia arrives at the Simon house with a friend from Florida on the day of Paul and Mary's visit. After dinner, the evening becomes awkward when Paul and Mary question Margaret about possibly attendingSunday school. Sylvia retorts that Margaret had already chosen to become Jewish when they went to the temple together, sparking an argument between the parents and grandparents over what religion Margaret should follow. Margaret yells at the adults to stop fighting, proclaiming she does not care about religion and does not even believe in God.
Margaret hands in her research paper to Mr. Benedict, in which she expresses her disillusionment with religion. Soon, she reconciles with her parents and Sylvia. At the end of the school year, Margaret thanks Mr. Benedict for being a good teacher. She also befriends Laura and asks her to dance, with Janie joining them shortly afterward. Barbara, who has since returned to teaching painting, tells Nancy's mother Jan, the PTA president, that she will no longer volunteer for PTA committees.
Before leaving for summer camp, Margaret talks to Moose Freed, a friend of Nancy's older brother. Margaret secretly has a crush on Moose, and they agree to spend time together when she returns. At home, she discovers her first period has arrived and excitedly tells her mother, who is thrilled for her. Margaret then resumes her communication with God, thanking him.

Gracie Filmsis an Americanfilmandtelevision productioncompany founded byJames L. Brooksin 1986. The company is primarily responsible for producing its long-running flagship animated seriesThe Simpsons.
The company's headquarters is located on the Fox Studios lot at 10201 West Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles.[3]
James L. Brooks, who had previously foundedJohn Charles Walters Company, founded Gracie Films at20th Century Foxin 1986, withPolly Plattas executive vice president. Named for comedianGracie Allen, the company was established to "provide real writers with a vehicle to get their movies made".[4]Its primary distributor is currentlySony Pictures Entertainment, though it continues to produceThe Simpsonsat Fox's studio inCentury City,Los Angeles.
According toSimpsons Confidential, Brooks gaveThe Simpsons'writing staff free rein, as he firmly believed they were the most important part of the process,[5]and "in the legal battles overThe Simpsons, it was Fox that was being sued, not Gracie Films".[6]The company also coordinates international distribution and dubbing forThe Simpsons,[7]"[finding] voices for dubbing that would match those of the original American actors as closely as possible."[8]Gracie Films’ main production office is at theSidney Poitierbuilding on theSony Pictures Studioslot inCulver City, California. In 1989, Gracie Films had struck a deal with ABC.[9]
Gracie Films'production logodepicts noisy patrons in a movie theatre (which were the voices of then-CEO ofFoxGarth Ancierand music composer Jeffrey Townsend double-tracked to sound like there were more people) being shushed by a woman in the back row (with the shush sound being done byTracey Ullman). The company's name appears on the screen, accompanied by a brief passage played on keyboard. Audio variations exist onThe Simpsons, often with dialogue from the episode or characters such asHomerresponding to the shush. The most common audio variation is on the Treehouse of Horror episodes (excluding "Treehouse of Horror" which used the original logo audio and "Treehouse of Horror II" and "Treehouse of Horror III" which has the organ theme only), where the shushing sound was replaced by a woman screaming and the logo's music is played in a minor key on a synth-emulated pipe organ. Originally, theRoland D-50PN-D50-01 Pipe Organ preset was used for that particular variant and was composed byDanny Elfman. The music was composed by Jeffrey Townsend andAlf Clausenon a tiny Korg synth rack using a custom programmed preset. Starting fromTreehouse of Horror XXVIII, the music was rearranged byBleeding Fingers Music.

Since her universally acclaimed breakout role inMisery(1990), Bates has often been referred to by the media as one of America's most respected actresses.[48][49][50]
She has been praised for her ability to portray a wide range of characters across genres and performing media.[51][52]Bates ascribes this to her perceived lack of conventional beauty, which has allowed her to take on unconventional and interesting roles from the very beginning of her career.[53]Derek Malcolm ofThe Guardiannoted that Bates emerged as a new kind of a film actress unrestrained by the necessity to be glamorous, a standard that had hitherto been expected of female screen stars. Referring to her acting talent, Malcolm added that, "[Bates] is a fine actress who knows that less in the way of a ‘performance’ is often more and that strong moments have to be severely rationed."[54]Roger Ebertsuggested that her role ofAnnie Wilkesis a prime example of Bates' exceptional talent for versatility, commenting that she is "uncanny in her ability to switch, in an instant, from sweet solicitude to savage scorn".[55]
In addition to commending Bates for her versatility, critics have pointed to her remarkable talent for making her characters believable, no matter how strange or unconventional their personality may be.[56][57][58]Jacob Trussell ofFilm School Rejectsnotes how "truthful" Bates' performances are, observing that her ability to access a character's inner life enables her to "approach [them] from unique angles that can surprise even the writers who created them".[59]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
