In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
