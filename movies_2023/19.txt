The surrealexperimental filmtakes placepost-apocalypseand tells the story of a young filmmaker (Slade) and amilitary general(Young) trapped in a bunker with a mysterious threat.
Written as adark comedybody horrorfilm in 2016, the film was produced by Charybdis Pictures. Inspired by the threat of nuclear war and current political events, Butler also cited the works ofSamuel Beckett,Jean-Paul Sartre,John Carpenter, andDavid Cronenbergas influences.
Filming took place atGray Area Multimediaand other parts ofSan Diego Countyin May, 2017. It premiered August 15, 2020 at theOceanside International Film Festivaland was released onvideo on demandin 2021. The film was distributed byCineverseandTroma Entertainment.
Film critics compared it toNight of the Living Dead,Dr. Strangelove,The Lighthouse, and10 Cloverfield Lane. It has a 91% approval rating from 23 reviews onRotten Tomatoes, ranking in their best horror and science fiction films of 2021 and their 100 Best Zombie Movies.
Diane (Alexandra Slade) awakens in a bunker surrounded bydead bodiesafter a brutal massacre. After attempting to escape the structure, she eventually passes out at the bottom of anelevator shaftwhere she is rescued by a mysterious man who calls himself General Gore (Nick Young).
Though he playsmind gameswith her, Gore gives her food and water as he attempts to figure out who Diane is and how she got into the bunker. Still shaken, she has trouble piecing it together, but she can remember being taken there by force. She also tells him about thefilmshe had been creating.
Gore hints at a contingency plan for escaping the bunker. Without a good alternative, Diane decides to follow him through the toxic environment in hopes of reaching safety. Along the way they are attacked bymutatingcreatures that were allegedly poisoned byradiation. A tension and psychological confrontation slowly develops between the two survivors as they get nearer to their destination and Diane feels hersanitystart to slip.
Thescriptwas formulated in 2016. Butler said the film is a "universal story about conceptions of good, evil, corruption and the twisted passing of the generational torch from a fractured, wisened psyche to a self-righteous, still-developing one."[3]Inspiration came from issues at the time such as thethreat of nuclear warand the2016 United States presidential election.[4]
Pre-productionstarted around August 2016.[3]For casting,Nick Youngsaid he was stumbled upon while performing on stage[5]and was cast as Gore after being asked to audition by mobile video.[6]The character of Diane was originally written as a young man, but scheduling conflicts and delays led to rewrites and ultimatelyAlexandra Sladewas cast in the role.Kerry Rossallcontributed to the production asexecutive producer, funding the project directly.[3]
Principal photographybegan on May 13, 2017, inSan Diego Countyand lasted for ten days.[3]The majority of filming took place atGray Area Multimedia, an underground studio which doubled as abunker,[7]a key location Butler had intended to use for the production.[3]One of the exterior scenes was filmed atSunset Cliffs, a location Butler chose to resemble the beauty of the world before chaos.[6]Another location was theTierrasantaentrance toMission Trails Regional ParknearCamp Elliott. Thecinematographywas handled byRay Gallardo[3]and thespecial make-up effectsby C.J. Martinez.[8]Butler had arough cutof the film ready within months of wrapping but the final stages were not complete until 2019, after Daniel N. Butler edited thevisual effectsandsound. The production was Butler'sdirectorial feature length debutand the first film of his longer than a 15 minute runtime.[3]Upon completing the film, Butler said:
It is roughly an hour-longdark comedysci-fi with aTwilight Zonefeel and elements of body horror,absurd humorand satire.[9]
Corin Totin of Sick Flix mentioned the film has "a background score of an almost unrecognizably discordant version ofOde to Joy."[10]Celia Payne of Let's Talk Terror said "a surprisingly gleefulstring arrangementaccompanies scenes where humans-turned-monstrosities melt into themselves,shape-shift, and eat rats, bringing the audience into their world of insanity."[11]
Melissa Hannon at Horror Geek Life said "although it technically falls within thepost-apocalypticcategory,Friend of the Worlddefies any specific genre."[12]Mark Harris at Black Horror Movies mentioned it mixes horror and sci-fi with heady drama.[13]Several critics pointed out that it is abody horror film.[14][15][16][17]Others conclude that it is a strangeavant-gardeart film[18][19][20]filled withsubtext.[10][21]Lisa Marie Bowman at Through the Shattered Lens said it comes with "a hint ofKubrickiansatire" with scenes reminiscent ofAlien, concluding that surviving theend of the worlddoes not mean you'll have a choice on who remains with you.[22]
Joseph Perry at Horror Fuel mentioned it's likeThe Twilight ZoneifRod SerlingandCharles Beaumontate psychedelic material, or if ideas fromDr. Strangelove,Night of the Living DeadandApocalypse Nowwere merged.[23]Albert Valentin of World Film Geek claims it is azombie apocalypse filmin the realm of "RomeromeetsMuschiettimeetsCronenberg."[24]Redmond Bacon at Tilt Magazine said it blends thezombie filmgenre with theexistential filmdrama, acknowledging Butler, as if he had a "Raging Bull-like"David Lynchversion of10 Cloverfield Lane.[15]Sean Parker of Horror Obsessive mentioned it has similarities toThe Divine Comedy, withpolitical satireand doomsday conspiracies.[25]Paul Klein at Filmhounds Magazine said the "weird mix of horror and comedy" felt like a "companion piece" toThe Lighthouse.[26]
Butler chose to have the film mostly inblack-and-whiteto accentuate the perspective of Gore's world.[3]Alain Elliott at Nerdly said shooting in black and white helped its style andlow-budget filmconstraints.[17]Milana Vujkov at Lola on Film claims it has "a terrifyingly delightful string of corruptive catalysts, explosive apparitions of post-humanity, taken straight out ofBurroughs" and that the "unsustainability of the human condition in a genetically modified apocalypse is a mix of home movie andBrechtiantheatre play."[27]Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews said that the fifty minute film is split up into chapters which allows for viewers to ponder at thenonlinear narrative.[28]
Jeremie Sabourin at Cinema Smack mentions that some filmmakers will extend a narrative out to ninety minutes even if they don't have enough story to tell. "WithFriend of the Worldthough, it sometimes feels like there's ninety minutes of content compacted into its fifty minute runtime."[16]Celia Payne at Let's Talk Terror appreciated its shorter runtime, stating that "it shows the filmmakers know when their story is done and don't try to extend when not necessary."[11]Butler claims he structured the film to be around fifty minutes, like an episode ofTwilight ZoneorBlack Mirror.[3]Butler said:
In this day and age I think it would fit nicely within astreaming service– whether self-contained, part of ananthologyseries, or expanded into multiple episodes of a larger story.[3]
It is interesting to see the qualities of the film that retain their original effect, and those that have acquired additional meaning after the immediate passing of such an eventful chapter in our history.
Karla Peterson atThe San Diego Union Tribunesaid that Butler did not anticipate hisfeature-filmdebut to happen virtually during an actualpandemic, although "the surreal environment is a perfect match for an unsettling film where the source of chaos might just be acontagion." Being made available around a global conflict, during a pandemic andcontroversialelection year, it was received by critics as apropheticexperience.[29][10]
When we look back on thequarantine daysit will be films like this andHostthat will stand as an artistic representation of the anxieties of the time.
Jeremie Sabourin at Cinema Smack claims "Friend of the Worldalso feels like a natural continuation of our current world due to its characters."[16]Rebecca Cherry at Film Carnage said it makes a good attempt to identify "a more character drivenapocalypticstory pulling elements from a modern America."[29]Jim Morazzini of Voices From The Balcony claimed the characters as being "archetypesat opposite ends of American society" and compared the uncertain reality of the film to "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridgelike flight of a mind approaching death."[20]Brian Robertson of The Vista Press said "its characters echo a disturbing truth that is currently plaguing our nation today."[30]Conor McShane at Morbidly Beautiful said it's a film that brings up the ideological and racial divides in America.[31]
Diane (Alexandra Slade) is a youngmillennialfilmmaker.[13][19]She is a grounded, level-headed individual withliberalviews.[12][16]Joel Fisher of Battle Royale With Cheese points out that Diane being a filmmaker is Butler allowing the audience to "smile a little at the director mocking himself."[21]
General Gore (Nick Young) is an old, heavily builtmilitary officerwho seems increasingly unhinged.[13][32][8]S Dewhirst ofSet The Tapesaid he is "wild-eyed and larger than life, a big man with a big voice, big gut and big ideals."[33]Critics have compared him toSterling Hayden's Jack D. Ripper ofDr. Strangelove,[15][8]Powers Boothe's Senator Ethan Roark ofSin City,[16]Jack Nicholson'sJack TorranceofThe Shining,[33]and his voice toAnthony HopkinsandGerald Mohr.[34]
In an interview withTimes of San Diego, Butler stated thatFriend of the World's style was inspired by the works ofSamuel Beckett,Jean-Paul Sartre,John CarpenterandDavid Cronenberg. He mentioned that political anxieties andabsurdisttheatre helped inspire him to write.[3]The film is said to draw inspiration from films and television such asThe Twilight Zone,Dr. Strangelove,The ThingandLa Jetée, as well asplayssuch asNo ExitandKrapp's Last Tape.[2]It is atwo-handerfilm with "comicabsurdityand socialsatire"[2]that broadens the "body horror subgenre ofscience fictionandhorror."[35]
Therefore whoever wishes to be afriend of the worldmakes himself an enemy of God.[36]
When asked if the film's title had anybiblicalinfluence, Butler confirmed it did not.[3]
The film was to premiere in early 2020, but theCOVID-19 pandemicdelayed its release.[3][20]Friend of the Worldheld a seven day virtual worldpremiereat theOceanside International Film Festivalon August 15, 2020.[37][30]In December 2020, a second virtual screening was held at Another Hole in the Head Film Festival.[38]In 2021, it was released onPlexandAmazon Prime Videoand screened at San Diego Film Week.[35][39][40]In 2022, it released onTubiandXumoand was acquired byTroma Entertainmenton their streaming appTroma Now.[41][31][25]By 2023, the film was distributed byCineverse[42]and released to an international audience onApple TVandiTunes.[43]
Friend of the Worldreceived mostly positive reviews from critics. On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 91% of 23 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10.[44]On the aggregation websiteCherryPicks, the film received a 61% positive score by non-binary and women critics.[45]
I'd like people to walk away from our film not with answers, but hopefully feeling a profound connection with the characters.
Ally Ham at Video Librarian scored it 4.5 out of 5, stating that "Friend of the Worldis an evocative indie gem serving a little bit of science fiction, some dark comedy, and a healthy dose ofbody horror."[47]John Noonan atFilmInksaid "in some ways,Friend of the Worldis a black comedic theatre piece translated tocelluloid."[48]Rob Rector ofFilm Threatscored the film 6 out of 10 and said it "works more like astage playthan a film [...] but it does share a persistentdreadand discomfort" comparing it toPossumbyMatthew Holness.[14]
Douglas Davidson at Elements of Madness said it "has something real to say regarding interpersonal strife powered bymisinformationand the narrow view of only certain parts of humanity."[49]Melissa Hannon at Horror Geek Life awarded the film 3.7 out of 5 stars, writing "Friend of the Worldis truly anacid tripof a movie."[12]Jeremie Sabourin at Cinema Smack gave it 3.5 out of 5 and felt the tone matchedNight of the Living Deadas if done byTerry Gilliamclaiming that "itsnightmarishand claustrophobic setting will have viewers on edge."[16]Corin Totin of Sick Flix rated the film 4.5 out of 5, comparing it toTetsuo: The Iron Man, declaring "this is a piece of art that is very much of this moment and really taps into the surreal horror that we are experiencing in the world at large right now."[10]
Thisis how you take on a genre that has been done to death.
Film criticDaniel M. Kimmelof theBoston Online Film Critics Associationsaid "It makes for a disturbing 50-minute running time that is engaging but will likely leave you wondering what it was all about."[50]Cheryl Eddy atIo9says "there are flickers of humor along the way, as well as a slight story twist that explains the film's title."[43]Tim Brennan of About Boulder admittedarthouse filmscan be intimidating to watch, but called it a "strange littleart filmmade with intelligence and wit."[18]Anton Bitel at Projected Figures said the film "uses bunkered post-apocalyptic sci-fi/body horror to reconcile an imperfect, polarised world."[51]
When it comes down to it, the film's twisted, mind-bending journey really leads viewers back to themselves, and to what they would do if they were in Diane's bloody shoes.
Alain Elliott of Nerdly said the dialogue driven performances are good and that "when you think post-apocalyptic zombie movie, this movie and its script isn't what you expect."[17]Mitchell Brown at Slay Away said it is a "strange film that is at its best when it focuses on the dialogue and performances of the two leads."[53]Hugues Porquier from Battle Royale With Cheese called it "interesting writing" and "clean photography." They mentioned a possible reference toLeos Carax'sBoy Meets Girland said it reminded them ofVideodromeandExistenz, swinging "between realism andsurrealism."[54]Nils Gollersrud at Loud And Clear Reviews said "the film succeeds best in crafting an eerieparanoiaand unpredictability that keeps it watchable."[55]
Mark H. Harris of Black Horror Movies said "the articulate script is dialogue-heavy with aphilosophicalbent" and it "presents some thoughtful takes on identity,individualismand reconciling divergent worldviews."[13]S Dewhirst of Set The Tape said it has "themes ofgenetic engineering, world war,propaganda, paranoia and zombies" and that "fans of the off-beat, the weird, and the not-quite-mainstream will likely find plenty to enjoy in this strange, starkly-shot trip through the bunkers and cellars of a ruined world."[33]Kristy Strouse at Wonderfully Weird & Horrifying said that even though the film "sometimes meanders, the captivating performances, gnarlypractical effects, and intelligent direction make the most of its limited screen time."[56]
Corey Bulloch of UK Film Review claims it has "world-building that leaves more confusion than intrigue" and "constant ambiguity that it's hard for the audience to maintain invested interest."[8]Keri O'Shea at Warped Perspective said that it "needed to commit to something – oddness, aesthetics, or plot."[57]Rebecca Cherry at Film Carnage gave it 2 out of 5 and said "There's the classic theme ofsurvivalas with anyapocalypsefilm but the threat isn't sufficient enough to add the right amount of tension or suspense to keep you gripped or invested in the characters' fate."[29]MontiLee Stormer at Movie Reelist scored it 2 out of 5 and said to "save this one as a palette cleanser between aWaters filmand aLynch film."[58]
Lindsey Ungerman at Horror Buzz said it had "Tarantinovibes", was "attention-grabbing and engaging but loses steam quickly due to storyambiguityand spasmodic dialogue." They rated it 3 out of 10 concluding that the film was "definitely beautiful" but "too chaotic."[19]Marie Asner of The Phantom Tollbooth scored it 1 out of 5 and came to the conclusion that it "would have made a betterradio dramathan a film."[34]Josh Taylor at Nightmarish Conjurings said that "it's a clever film that never feels clever enough for its own premise."[59]
Characters and storylines were buried under the rubble of the apocalypse this film finds itself in.
Ranked by Tomatometer,Friend of the Worldis one ofRotten Tomatoes' best horror and science fiction films of 2021[61][62]and is ranked at 31 on their list of 100 Best Zombie Movies.[63]Bored Pandaincluded the film on their list of 50 Best Horror Comedies That Will Have You Confused Whether To Laugh Or Scream[64]and it is one of Video Librarian's Top 15 Best Narrative Films of 2022.[60]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902.

The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
