Xiao Ming "Bernard" Chang is a band geek sophomore in high school who expresses interest in basketball, with whom he shares a rivalry with star player Matt O'Neil, his former friend. One day, he meets his new bandmate Kristy and becomes smitten with her, only for Matt to start hitting on her. Chang continues to feel threatened by Matt, especially when his friends lock him in the basement at a house party. He escapes and confronts Matt over a prior basketball game and claims that he can dunk, but Matt puts him down and he's humiliated when he falls into a swimming pool.
Chang continues his quest to reinvent himself, especially since his mother Chen always judges his decisions. He finally confronts Matt at school and bets that he can make a dunk by homecoming. Should Chang win, Matt must shave his head and give him his prizedKobe Bryantjersey. Should Matt win, Chang must shave his head and give him his prized 1st editionPokémon Trading Card. Kristy knows full well what the bet is really about, but chooses to support Chang regardless. Chang's best friend Bo helps him train rigorously, but after a week, feels that he hasn't accomplished much. He goes online and discovers Deandre Cooke, a YouTuber who films himself dunking.
Chang meets Deandre and gets him to take him on as his protégé. Seeing as how they cannot pay him, Bo instead offers to improve the terrible production of his YouTube videos. He agrees. Chang improves significantly as Deandre films and uploads his exploits online and the two form a bond. At the same time, Chang and his mother start to feel distant. The day before the dunk, Chang feels that he's still off and sneaks into the school late at night. In the morning, everyone gathers to see Chang's dunk attempt and after large fanfare, succeeds, winning the bet and earning him school fame.
Despite his online recognition, Chen remains ignorant of her son's success. He's invited by ESPN to New York to talk about his win and he brings his friends with him. When he's asked to make the dunk again, he misses, claiming wind interference. However, Chang is consumed by his fame and nearly ditches his friends. At school the next day, Matt accuses Chang of cheating by lowering the basket on the court. Chang denies but Matt shows a video proving it. Chang accuses him of racism and they fight, resulting in both boys getting suspended. Chen finally learns what Chang has been up to and tells him that he doesn't need to prove himself to others, while Chang says he cannot talk to her because she's always unhappy and makes everyone else unhappy. Chang realizes that he cannot make a dunk and publicly apologizes for his cheating.
Chen confronts Deandre over the time he spent with Chang, but he tells her that he was a great kid whom he truly believes in. Realizing that her son has potential, Chen goes home and destroys her house's unfinished veranda from her separated husband. Chang helps her and repairs their relationship. Chang makes up with Bo and Kristy, the latter of whom he starts dating. He tries out for the school basketball team and makes up with Matt, with both of them becoming better people.
Sometime later, Chang is on the basketball team and his coach tells him to enter a game. While he briefly makes a mistake, he steals the ball from an opposing player and dribbles down the court, rising for a dunk before the film ends as the crowd cheers.

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle. Its first film appearance was with the release ofStrange World.[60]The logo received widespread praise from critics and audiences and won Gold in the "Theatrical | Film: Design" medium at the 2023Clio Entertainment Awardsin November 2023.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
