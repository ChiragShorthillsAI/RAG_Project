The Burialis a 2023 Americanlegal dramafilm directed byMaggie Bettsand written by Betts andDoug Wright. It is loosely based on the true story of lawyerWillie E. Garyand his clientJeremiah Joseph O'Keefe's lawsuit against theLoewen funeral company, as documented in the 1999New Yorkerarticle of the same name byJonathan Harr.[4]It starsJamie Foxxas Gary,Tommy Lee Jonesas O'Keefe,Jurnee Smollett,Mamoudou Athie, andBill Camp.
It premiered at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 11, 2023, and was released byAmazon MGM Studiosin alimited releaseon October 6, 2023, prior to streaming viaPrime Videoon October 13, 2023.
In 1995, financially troubled funeral home ownerJeremiah Joseph O'Keefeis forced to sell parts of his business to meet financial demands by the Mississippi State Insurance Commission after losing tons of money from a Ponzi scheme by one of his business associates. He makes a contract with Raymond Loewen of theLoewen Group, who offers to buy three funeral homes but O'Keefe demands that the Loewen Group must not sell funeral insurance to settle the deal. Four months later, the Loewen Group still delays their payment for the purchase of the three funeral homes. Furthermore, Raymond never honored the oral agreement between him and Jeremiah of not selling funeral insurance. His young lawyer Hal Dockins suggests that Loewen is intentionally trying to run O‘Keefe into bankruptcy by delaying the payment to snatch up his entire business at a cheaper cost.
An enraged O'Keefe hiresWillie E. Gary, a flashy Floridapersonal injury lawyer, at Dockins' suggestion, because he thinks that his whitecontract lawyerMike Allred will be unable to convince the presumably black jury. Initially, Allred wants a settlement of $8 million but Gary fires back confidently that they could get a $100 million settlement instead. With such a huge potential payout, O'Keefe names Gary as his lead attorney and even re-mortgages his own home to pay for his services. Upon receiving the offer, Loewen hires a black lawyer team fronted by Mame Downes for similar reasons.
In court, O'Keefe is cornered when Downes questions his character and points out his financial troubles stem from business deals with a now-convicted felon. Blaming Gary, O'Keefe replaces him with Allred as lead attorney. Dockins produces a valuable witness who insinuates that Loewen overcharges minority communities. Downes in turn questions Allred and reveals that his grandfather was a member of theKu Klux Klan. When Gary stands up for Allred, his angered black legal team leaves him. Allred realizes he is too compromised and retracts from the case to give the team a higher chance to win.
Just when O'Keefe decides to drop the case, Dockins digs up a lead to the black National Baptist Church, revealing that the Loewen group did exploit the church members to sell overpriced packages to other members of the black community. When Raymond Loewen is confronted with this in court and shows no remorse, the jury is swayed in O'Keefe's favor, awarding him $500 million in damages—$100 million in compensatory damages and $400 million inpunitive damages. Two years later, Ray Loewen gets fired from his position and the company eventually goes into bankruptcy.
After the closing credits Willie E. Gary in person appears in a cameo.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
