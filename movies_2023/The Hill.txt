The Hillis a 2023 Americanbiographicalsports dramafilm about baseball player Rickey Hill overcoming a physical handicap in order to try out for a legendary major league scout. It was directed byJeff Celentanofrom a screenplay byAngelo PizzoandScott Marshall Smith.  It starsDennis Quaid,Colin Ford,Joelle Carter,Randy Houser, Jesse Berry,Bonnie Bedelia, andScott Glenn.
The film was released in the United States in theaters byBriarcliff Entertainmenton August 25, 2023.
In a small town in Texas, a young Rickey Hill wears leg braces due to a degenerative spinal disease, but enjoys playing baseball and is regarded as a batting prodigy. James, his strict father and a pastor, dissuades Rickey from the sport, wanting to shield him from further injuries and urging him to pursue preaching. The family is evicted from their home and forced to move to Oklahoma. When their car breaks down, they are assisted by a family who offers James a position at a local church.
Rickey struggles to adapt to his new home until he encounters a group of children playing baseball. The pitcher harasses him over his disability until he connects on a pitch. He tries to join the local baseball team but is required to have a parent's permission, and his brother Robert decides to forge their father's signature. When James finds out, he lectures both for lying but refrains from beating Robert at the last minute. Rickey finally reassures him that he is capable of both preaching and playing baseball.
A few years later, Rickey is one of the top high school baseball players  but struggles to attract the interest ofMajor League Baseballscouts.Ray, his boss at his part-time job who watched Rickey bat as a child, invites scoutRed Murffto his upcoming game. Rickey plays against the bully from his youth, off whom he hits the go-ahead home run, but trips on a sprinkler while catching the game-winning out. A doctor diagnoses him with a fractured ankle and severed leg tendons, declaring his playing days to be over. Although an effort to fundraise to pay for his treatment fails, Ray provides him with money to help him recover in time for an MLB tryout. James forbids him from taking part and he despondently agrees, to the dismay of his childhood sweetheart Gracie.
Rickey's grandmother falls ill, and she urges James to let Rickey pursue baseball before dying. A motivated Rickey removes the cast from his foot and begins training with Robert.
On the first day of the tryout, Rickey runs drills alongside other prospects in front of scouts including Murff, during which underachieving players are sent off by scouts. He struggles with fielding and baserunning, and a scout tries to dismiss him until he convinces him to let him bat. Most of his hits land near Murff in the adjacent park. The tryout concludes without a word and he dejectedly goes home before returning to retrieve his glove, where he sees a motivational message from James. Rickey returns to the park, where Murff challenges him to be thedesignated hitterfor both teams in the prospects game.
During the game, Murff pressures each pitcher to strike out Rickey, though he hits off each of them with ease. Meanwhile, as he gives his sermon at church, James expresses regret for not properly supporting his son. After Rickey has hit on all ten of hisat bats, Murff summons major leaguer Jimmy Hammer to pitch against him. Hammer thenhits him in the rib on a pitch; Murff snidely tells him to take first base, but Rickey insists on staying and successfully connects on the ensuing pitch. After the game, Rickey and James reunite in the outfield, where the latter remarks he will "have to get used" to Rickey's newfound career.
In an epilogue, he signs with theMontreal Exposin 1975 and plays four seasons in theminor leaguesbefore his spine gives out.[4]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 44% of 36 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10.

He praised the writers, saying "Angelo Pizzo and the late Scott Marshall Smith inject plenty of warmth and humor into the tale, never letting the characters overly succumb to stereotypes" and "Fortunately, the film also includes enough light-hearted humor to compensate for its corniness".[20]
G. Allen Johnson writing for theSan Francisco Chroniclegave a negative review. He criticized the script as being a "cliched" Hollywood biopic, elaborating "The Hillis meant to be inspiring, of course, and to some, it might be, but the vibe is more reassuring in the way that it does not deviate from the standard-issue formula of such movies. It is a cinematic case of confirmation bias, designed to fulfill preexisting values and beliefs".  He described Celentano's direction as "aRockwellianpostcard vision of midcentury small-townAmerican South, where even the rusty cars and run-down houses have a golden nostalgic glow".[21]

There have been extensive stories about Quaid's past abuse ofcocaine. In a 2002 interview withLarry Kingon his talk show, after King asked about his motives for using drugs, Quaid responded, "Well, you got to put it in context. Back in the late 1960s, early 1970s. That was back during the time where, you know, drugs were going to expand our minds and everybody was experimenting and everything. We were really getting high, we didn't know it. And cocaine at that time was considered harmless. You know. I remember magazine articles inPeoplemagazineof doctors saying it is not addicting. It is just—alcohol is worse. So I think we all fell into that. But that's not the way it was."
When Quaid was asked if he believed he had ever been addicted to the drugs, Quaid responded, "It was a gradual thing. But it got to the point where I couldn't have any fun unless I had it. Which is a bad place to be." Later in the interview, he said, "But I saw myself being dead in about five years if I didn't stop."[58]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
