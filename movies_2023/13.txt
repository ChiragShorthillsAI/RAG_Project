Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour[a]is a 2023 Americanconcert filmproduced by the singer-songwriterTaylor Swiftand directed by Sam Wrench. It documents theLos Angelesshows ofthe Eras Tour(2023–2024), Swift's sixth headlining concert tour andthe highest-grossing tour of all time. Swift struck an unprecedenteddistributionagreement withAMC TheatresandCinemark Theatresfor the film after negotiations with themajor film studiosfell through.
Filming took place in August 2023 across three shows atSoFi StadiuminInglewood, California, with a budget of $10–20 million andSAG-AFTRApermitting production to proceed amidstits 2023 strike. Swift announced the film later that month, catching studios off guard and causing the release dates of several films that had been set for release on or near October 13 to be moved. The unconventional release strategy was a topic of media discourse; many journalists and industry personnel praised Swift's move to bypass the studios to directly partner with theaters and opined that the move defied the traditionalproducer–distributor–exhibitormodel of releasing films.
The film premiered atthe Grovein Los Angeles on October 11, 2023, and was released to theaters worldwide on October 13. It was met with significant ticket demand, amassing a record $37 million on its first day ofpre-salesin the U.S. and over $100 million in total global pre-sales.The Eras Tourbecame thehighest-grossing concert film of all time, earning $261.7 million in its limited theatrical run worldwide. It received acclaim from critics, most of whom praised the direction, spectacle, energy, and Swift's artistry and showmanship. An extended cut of the film, subtitled(Taylor's Version), includes performances withheld from the theatrical edit and was released on the streaming serviceDisney+on March 14, 2024.[4]
The film is a "cinematic rendering" ofthe Eras Tour, the sixth headlining concert tour by the American singer-songwriterTaylor Swift.[5][6]RepresentingSwift's discographyconceptually in 10 acts ("eras"), it depicts performances of most songs onthe tour's set list, with several songs and intermissions cut to condense the 3.5-hour show into a 2.75-hour film.[b][11][12][13]
Beginning with a 13-secondcountdownclock ticking down, the show opens with theLoveract. Hidden by dancers in giant fan-like tapestry, Swift emerges mid-stage in a sparkly pink and bluebodysuit, singing the chorus to "Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince", followed by "Cruel Summer". Accompanied by dancers, Swift sings "The Man" and "You Need to Calm Down" in a silver blazer and a set emulating office cubicles. She then performs "Lover" on a pink guitar. Swift ends the first act with "The Archer". The second act,Fearless, sees Swift in a gold fringed dress performing the songs "Fearless", "You Belong with Me" and "Love Story" with her band while her backup singers wore gold and silver jackets and black jumpsuits. The third act,Evermore, features a forest aesthetic. Swift dons an orange gown and a dark green cape and performs "Willow" with dancers holding glowing orbs, followed by "Marjorie", and then "Champagne Problems" at a moss-covered piano. She ends the act with "Tolerate It", where she and a male dancer, Raphael Thomas, play a troubled couple at a dinner table.
In the snake-themed fourth act,Reputation, Swift delivers a high-energy performance of "...Ready for It?" in a black and red asymmetrical catsuit accompanied by female dancers wearing black-dark red gothicleotards. She follows with "Delicate" as cracks appear on the stage. In "Don't Blame Me", Swift is surrounded by light beams. She transitions to "Look What You Made Me Do", with dancers dressed as Swift from the other album eras being trapped in glass boxes. In the purple-themed fifth act,Speak Now, she performs "Enchanted" in a purple ombreball gownas she is encircled by female dancers wearing lavender-colored dresses. The sixth act,Red, is colored accordingly. Accompanied by dancers, Swift performs "22" in a black hat and white T-shirt with the phrase "a lot going on at the moment", modified from the shirt from the song's music video. At every concert towards the end of the song she gives the hat to a fan pre-selected from the audience; in the film she gives the hat to Bianka Bryant, the daughter of the late American basketball playerKobe Bryant. Next, dressed in a red-to-black romper, she performs "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" and "I Knew You Were Trouble" with the male dancers. Donning a red and black ombre coat, she performs "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" on a guitar.Cottagecoretakes the stage in the seventh act,Folklore, which features a cabin and staircase setup onstage.

During "Midnight Rain", she performs aquick changeon-stage, shielded by her dancers' umbrellas, exchanging an oversized light purple and blue T-shirt for a rhinestone-adorned blue bodysuit. Swift and dancers perform "Vigilante Shit" in aburlesquechair dance, followed by "Bejeweled" and "Mastermind" in choreographed moves. They end the show with "Karma" with Swift and dancers in different colored tinsel fringed jackets, amidst confetti and fireworks. "Long Live (Taylor's Version)" plays during the end credits.
The Eras Tour began inGlendale, Arizona, in March 2023, and concluded inVancouver,British Columbia, in December 2024. Each show spans three and a half hours, with aset listof 44 songs divided into 10 distinctactsthat conceptually portraySwift's studio albums. The tour was a commercial success and received critical acclaim. It becamea cultural and economic phenomenon, bolstered by globally unprecedented ticket demand and fan frenzy.[5][15]
In 2023, Swift commissioned a recording of the Eras Tour to be theatrically released as afeature film. Sam Wrench, who previously helmedBillie Eilish: Live at the O2(2023) andLizzo: Live in Concert(2022), was hired as director,[16]and the film was recorded at the first three of six Los Angeles shows of the tour from August 3 to 5, 2023, atSoFi StadiuminInglewood, California.[17][18]Swift's in-house production company,Taylor Swift Productions,produced the film independentlyin collaboration with Silent House Productions.[19][20]Forgoing the involvement ofmajor American film studiosallowed Swift to reduce expenses;[21]Puckestimated that the film cost $10–20 million.[19]It was able to be produced, released, and promoted amidst the2023 SAG-AFTRA strikebecause it received special approval fromSAG-AFTRAas a non-AMPTPproduction that met "the same standards the unions are seeking in their negotiations with the studios".[22][23]SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland stated that Swift "came to [them] and said she wanted to do this, but only if she could do it the right way under a union contract".[24]Swift announced theconcert filmon August 31 through her social media accounts and during an appearance onGood Morning AmericaonABC. Tickets went on sale the same day in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.[17][25][26]On September 26, Swift announced that the film would be released globally.[27]
In the U.S.,AMC Theatresserved as both distributor andexhibitorofThe Eras Tour,[28]an unprecedented move in the American film industry,[29]and screened it at least four times per day from Thursday through Sunday during each week of its run.[17][26]Swift's parents negotiated theterm sheetdirectly withAdam Aron,CEOof AMC.[19]Ticket prices for standard screenings were preset at $19.89 for adults, a reference to Swift'sre-recorded album1989 (Taylor's Version), and $13.13 for children and seniors, a likely reference to Swift'slucky number, 13.[17][26][30]The film was also made available onpremium large formatssuch asIMAXandDolby Cinema.[30]Each initial ticket purchase included a free poster, while select locations advertised special-themed popcorn and drink containers.[31]In anticipation of high demand following the2022 Ticketmaster controversy, AMC upgraded its ticket sale systems to accommodate five times its original capacity and temporarily halted sales of most of its other films.[17][26]Nevertheless, the mobile app crashed shortly after the sales began,[32]and customers were placed in queues to access the website.[33]Within hours of tickets going on sale, the film surpassed $10 million inpre-sales, which box-office analysts likened to the performance of aMarvel film.[34][35]GlobalInternet searchesfor "AMC" spiked more than 100-fold,[36]while AMC'sstockexperienced a brief 9.2 percent surge.[37]Bloomberg Newswrote that news of the film's high ticket sales "boostedstock priceson both sides ofthe Atlantic".[38]
AMC also served as distributor in other territories, distributing the film internationally and to unaffiliatedtheater chainsfor the first time in its history.[27]Cinemark Theatresand other circuits were also granted distribution rights to the film.[28]Chains that screenedThe Eras TourincludeRegal,Cineplex,Cinépolis,Cinemex, andOdeon, in addition to AMC.Variance Films, via a sub-distribution deal, assisted AMC with U.S. bookings at non-AMC locations, and tickets were also available for purchase online viaFandango.[17][28][39][27]The film was reported to screen in 4,000 theaters in North America, as well as more than 8,500 theaters worldwide.[27][40]
According to media outlets, the terms of its distribution and financing were dictated by Swift rather than AMC. Industry personnel considered thefixed pricingmodel and unacceptance of theaterloyalty programsas highly unconventional and outside norms. No exhibitors or distributors except AMC were aware of the film's release plans until the morning of Swift's announcement; this frustrated executives, as distributors are expected to keep each other informed of their release schedules as a gesture ofgood faith.[28][41]Business Insiderstated that since theParamount Consent Decrees"were terminated in 2020", the distribution agreement was legal.[29]PuckjournalistMatthew Bellonireported that "disappointing" talks with the major film studios had led Swift to instead negotiate a distribution deal directly with Aron.[19][42]As part of the agreement, 43 percent of the box-office earnings will go to theaters, while Swift and AMC's distribution arm will split the remaining 57 percent.[19][21][43]Additionally, theaters will retain all concession revenue and can screen the film for up to 26 weeks, although Swift has the option to send the film tostreaming servicesafter 13 weeks.[43]The Hollywood Reporterwrote in late October 2023 that "practically every major service" was looking to securesubscription video on demand(SVOD) rights toThe Eras Tourfollowing its theatrical run.[44]
Trafalgar Releasing handled the film's global distribution and negotiated the release of the film in China,[45]withAlibaba PicturesandWanda Cinemassecuring the deal.[46]The film was later approved for release in China on December 31, 2023, whichThe Washington Postcalled a "rarity" due to the "stringent vetting process for foreign films released in China", which it attributed to Swift's status as the most popular foreign artist in the country with a dedicated fanbase and a favorable reception among Chinese media outlets.[47][48]
The Eras Tourhad its world premiere on October 11, 2023, atThe Grove at Farmers Market, an open-air mall complex in Los Angeles, California, with early preview showings on October 12.[49][50][51]It received a worldwide theatrical release in more than 100 countries and territories on October 13,[27][52]two weeks before the release of1989 (Taylor's Version),[53]while some countries and territories had a later premiere date of November 3,[54]and in China on December 31, 2023.[47]In the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Australia, the film was screened for four consecutive weekends beginning on October 13.[17][53]
Varietynoted that the film's four-weekend theatrical run and wide North American releases were "far from the kind of one- or two-night special engagement that music fans have become used to with filmed concert experiences" in theaters.[17]It also highlighted that limiting screenings to Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays would make the film feel like an event as audiences "will be able to watch the concert extravaganza with a packed crowd and not in half-empty theaters during a Monday matinee".[55]Deadline Hollywoodreported that as of October 9, 2023,[update]The Eras Tourhad 65,000 showtimes on opening day across the U.S., totaling around 11.5 million seats.[56]In China, the film opened across 15,000 screens.[57]
The Eras Tour'spremiere at The Grove was attended by celebrities, journalists, Swift's family, her personnel, and over 2,200 invitedSwifties. The mall and surrounding area ofWest Hollywoodwere closed for the premiere, with increased police presence. Swift delivered a welcome note in each of the mall's AMC theaters before the screening.[6][58]
On December 13, 2023, her 34th birthday, Swift released an extended version of the film in collaboration withUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment, featuring performances of "Wildest Dreams", "The Archer" and "Long Live".[8]It was available to rent onvideo on demandservices in select territories for a limited period.[59]
A longer, unabridged edit of the film, subtitled(Taylor's Version), was released toDisney+on March 14, 2024. It includes performances of "Cardigan" and four surprise songs, namely "I Can See You", "Maroon", "Death by a Thousand Cuts", and "You Are in Love".[10][14][60]Disney+ purchased the film's exclusive streaming rights for reportedly more than $75 million in abidding warwithNetflixandUniversal, negotiated by Swift's brotherAustin.[61][62]To coincide with the launch of the film, the platform temporarily revamped its homepage and genre categories to titles inspired by Swift's eras.[63]Varietyreported the film garnered 4.6 million views in its first three days of availability, breaking the record for the most-viewed music film in the history of Disney+.[64]On August 10, 2024, the Disney+ edit of the film was aired for free on the Austrian public television channelORF 1, after thecancellation of the Eras Tour's three Vienna concerts due to a terrorist plot.[65]
"It's scary that Taylor Swift can come in and become a hit without using conventional marketing routes [...] You have to be an enormous star to put out a single tweet and disrupt the entire industry."
The film's unorthodox strategy in theatrical release generated much commentary fromfilm,music, andentertainment journalists.Vanity Fairopined that the film arrived "just when moviegoing needs it most" and may boost theater earnings after the business was widely affected bythe then-ongoing Writers Guild of Americaand SAG-AFTRA strikes, whichaffected numerous Hollywood productions.[67]Many journalists expressed similar sentiments, believing the film would "save" the late 2023box office.[68][36][55]National Association of Theatre Ownerspresident Michael O'Leary believed the success ofThe Eras Tourindicates the potential of concert films in theaters.[36]CNBCcommented that Swift would reinvigorate the concert film genre that had first entered cinema theatres in the 1960s.[69]Rolling StonenamedThe Eras Tourone of the "42 Must-See Movies of Fall 2023".[70]
The Daily Telegraphpraised Swift as "the greatest tactician in showbusiness," writing, "Barbenheimershowed people will go to the cinema if they feel they are participating in acommunal experience. Hollywood refused to take advantage of this. So Swift has instead."[41]Analyses fromColliderandTheWrapconcluded that by successfully negotiating her deal and proving its profitability, Swift incentivized theaters to find programming without the help of the studios, "potentially changing the dynamics of cinema distribution."[42][66]British-American filmmakerChristopher Nolansupported her "unorthodox release model" and claimed concert films are the future of moviegoing.[71]Tony Vinciquerra, chairman and CEO ofSony Pictures, calledThe Eras Toura "massive, unexpected rescue" for theaters.[72]Varietyopined that the film saved the fall movie season.[73]
Media publications believed Swift and AMC's partnership "[had] the potential to rewrite the rules" offilm distribution.[21][55]Billboardnoted the "unusual deal" could influence AMC and other exhibitors to expand their distribution operations to include other concert films.[43]On October 1, 2023, American singerBeyoncéannouncedRenaissance: A Film by Beyoncé, a concert film of herRenaissance World Tour, in the advent ofThe Eras Tour'srelease.Renaissancehad the same distribution deal "forged by AMC and [Swift]" without the involvement of the major studios.[74][75]Beyoncé later attendedThe Eras Tour'spremiere.[6]Ray Nutt, CEO of live entertainment content providerFathom Events, opined that a "post-Erasconcert film boom" is imminent, with studios "reaching out in earnest, looking for partnership" and artists "already making calls and taking cues from Swift'sErasdeal."[44]AMCEntertainment CEOAdam Aronsaid, "The phone has been ringing off the hook since they have announced Eras tour concert film release, and a significant number of the world's best artists would like to explore doing things with AMC, after the success of Swift's deal."[76]Sarah Whitten of CNBC named the film "one of the most important of the year, for recreating a staple experience of attending live concerts."[77]Varietyalso remarked that "the concert film rewrote the box office rules in 2023 by changing concert film experience."[78]
According to AMC CEO Adam Aron, the popularity of the film's popcorn bucket inspired the company to market merchandise for more films, a practice also adopted by other theater chains likeCinemark,Marcus,RegalandB&Bto increaseconcessionsales, attract moviegoers on opening weekends, and enhance the theatrical experience.[79]
Various films moved their theatrical release dates to avoid competing with Swift. The hashtag "#Exorswift" trended onsocial mediaafter the concert film was announced, asThe Eras Tourhad the same release date asThe Exorcist: Believer, asupernatural horror film. This was in reference to the "Barbenheimer" phenomenon surroundingBarbie(2023) andOppenheimer(2023) earlier that year. In response,Universal PicturesandBlumhouse Productionsadvanced the release ofBeliever, originally on aFriday the 13th, by one week,[80][81]a moveIndieWireobserved likely did not come at a low cost consideringBeliever'sexpensive marketing campaign.[28]Paramount PicturesandApple Studiosalso abandoned plans for a two-weeklimited runof thewesterncrime dramafilmKillers of the Flower Moon, directed byMartin Scorsese, preceding its wide release on October 20.[82]
The Eras Tourwas met with unprecedented ticket demand. Given its unorthodox release model, various industry personnel attempted to predict the film's box-office gross.Comscoreanalyst Paul Dergarabedian told CNBC that "speculation [was] running rampant as to how massive the opening weekend will be."[89]Billboardopined, "While such concert docs have historically been fan-only fare, with limited box-office ceilings, news ofThe Eras Tourwas greeted as if it was the newMarvelblockbuster".[90]The U.S. projections for the opening weekend gross ranged from a record $70 million to $100 million among media outlets.[91][92][93]The Hollywood ReporterandDeadline Hollywoodreported that the film was vying for a global opening-week gross of $150–200 million ($100–125 million in North America and $50–75 million overseas), stating that its "truncated" theatrical run was an obstacle in predicting its gross.[94][95]The full gross from its theatrical run in the U.S. and Canada was projected byVarietyto be $200–250 million.[55]The New York Timesexpressed uncertainty regarding the film's box-office forecasts, claiming they are based on moviegoer surveys and marketing, and hence the ticket sales could either sustain or decline after the opening weekend.[96]
On September 1, 2023, AMC announced thatThe Eras Tourhad grossed $26 million within three hours on its platform, marking the highest-ever single-day advance ticket sales in the company's history, surpassing the previous record of $16.9 million bySpider-Man: No Way Home(2021).[97][98]Wanda Gierhart Fearing,chief marketing officerof Cinemark, reported they had booked an "unprecedented number of auditoriums" to meet demand.[99]Hence, AMC and Cinemark added more showtimes.[97][98][100]IMAX sold out more than 250 screenings of the film in one day, a number similar to that of "ablockbustertentpolefeature".[99]Fandango reported thatThe Eras Tourhad set a platform record for the highest first-day ticket sales in 2023, comparable toNo Way Home,Avengers: Endgame(2019), andStar Wars: The Force Awakens(2015).[92]Deadline Hollywoodreported that the film had earned over $37 million in first-day pre-sale revenue across the U.S., surpassingThe Force Awakens'$20 million and marking the second-highest pre-sale tally ever, behindEndgame's$50 million.[91]By September 15, the film's pre-sale revenue had reached $65 million, surpassingDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness(2022)'s $60 million andThe Batman(2022)'s $42 million.[101]

Lina Das ofThe Daily Telegraphand Keiran Southern ofThe Sunday Timespraised the film's energy and spectacle. Southern felt the film surpassed the live show in some aspects, with the camera work putting the audience "onto the stage with Swift".[129][130]Kristen Lopez ofTheWrapdubbed the film "a bombastic celebration of joy and color" and a "spectacle of sound",[131]whereasChristy LemireofRogerEbert.comcalled it a "technical spectacle" and a "dazzling achievement".[132]Reviews from Angie Han ofThe Hollywood Reporter,[20]Ann HornadayofThe Washington Post,[133]Ludovic Hunter-Tilney ofFinancial Times,[134]Rob SheffieldofRolling Stone,[135]and Bilal Qureshi ofNPRcalled the film an impressive and immersive work.[136]New York'sCraig Jenkins andLittle White Lies'Lillian Crawford praised the cinematography for its portrayal of Swift's musicianship.[137][138]Katie Campione ofDeadline Hollywoodemphasized the visuals, energy, and vibrance,[139]while Tim Grierson ofScreen Internationalfelt it was a both rousing and intimate view of Swift's musical dexterity.[140]Peter Travers, writing forABC News, said the film "beautifully accentuates [Swift's] gifts for artistic reinvention."[141]
On the film's structure, Savannah Walsh ofVanity Fairhighlighted that the film eschewed five songs and shortened the transitions between songs "to shave the 3-hour-and-15-minute concert into a still-supersized 2 hours and 45 minutes."[142]TheAssociated Press' Maria Sherman andThe Guardian's Adriana Horton agreed that the film highlights the details potentially "missed" in a stadium; Sherman called it a near replica of the concert with limited edits and "stage banter", while Horton felt that the "meticulous" camerawork directed by Wrench aptly featured the dancers, backing vocalists, and band, who are often "overshadowed" by Swift during live shows.[12][143]Cindy White ofThe A.V. Clubliked how the concert is concise in the film to allow a seamless "flow" between songs and appreciated the "expertly mixed" sound—the crowd noise diminished to focus on Swift's "energetic" vocals.[144]
Some critics faulted Wrench's camera direction.Wesley MorrisofThe New York TimescalledThe Eras Toura monumental and revelatory film; he praised Swift's "arresting stature" while criticizing Wrench for allowing shots "all over the place", but admitted accommodating the stage's scale and high-tech screen imaging into a cohesive film is an arduous task.[145]Similarly,Time'sStephanie Zacharekdisliked some of Wrench's "reckless" camerawork choices, but felt Swift's stage presence "instantaneously airbrushes every questionable filmmaking decision into oblivion."[146]Michael PhillipsofChicago Tribunedescribed Wrench as a director who typically employs conventional framing and editing approaches, but the film could have benefited from a more steady editing pace and reduced camera shifts to fan reactions.[147]Mike Shutt from/Filmthought that most of the film lacked meticulous shot compositions, and felt that Wrench relied on multi-camera footage and an expedited editing process.[148]Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkersaid the film increased his understanding of Swift's artistry but felt that the short and monotonous camera shots made the watching experience "wearying".[149]
Conversely, Alejandra Martinez ofThe Austin Chroniclesaid the shots offer a "great sense of scope", capturing the show's scale and emotion while "ramping up the excitement with every frame."[150]Alonso Duraldecalled it a "beautifully shot and edited" film spotlighting Swift's showmanship.[151]Melissa Ruggieri wrote inUSA Todaythat the film "offers a front-row seat to the grandeur", complimenting the camerawork for capturing the tour's detailed production and Swift's charisma.[11]In congruence,Uproxx'sPhilip Cosores andVariety'sChris Willman said the film prolifically emphasizes the performance and production details that "get easily obscured by the overwhelming nature of live music" from a concertgoer standpoint.[152][153]NME'sKevin EG Perry described the film as "three hours of slick, lovingly shot footage of a modern pop star operating at the very peak of her powers."[154]
Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film a rare average grade of "A+", while those polled atPostTrakgave it a 96% overall positive score, with 89% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[108]Rolling Stonecommented that cinemas were bracing for rowdy crowds after Swift encouraged her fans, theSwifties, to sing and dance at film screenings.[155]The Wall Street Journal,CNBCandThe Guardianreported that multiple cinemas were altering rules around audience behavior forThe Eras Toursuch as suspending evening age restrictions and allowing phone use, singing and dancing.[156][157][158]Some theaters worked to recreate the tour's atmosphere by encouraging fans to dress up, offeringfriendship bracelet-making stations, and selling themed refreshments and merchandise.[156]Audiences in some opening-day shows of the film were reported to have had highly enthusiastic andfanaticreactions.[159][160]
The Hollywood Reporterjournalists reported dancing, singing and cheering audiences at the premiere,[20]and that some screenings on the official release date "felt more like a concert" in terms of behavior while others "were more muted".[161]The A.V. Club's Emma Keates felt it was jarring to attend a screening with no fan frenzy.[162]Hornaday, who attended a screening where the audience was chanting, shouting and singing, opined "one of the delights ofThe Eras Touris that it makes moviegoing a contact,call-and-responsesport, with audiences literally dancing in the aisles and waving at the screen as if their idol can see them."[133]Insider's Eve Crosbie and NBC's Emilie Ikeda noted that videos of such audiences "divided" social media users who debated on audience etiquette; some felt it was a communal experience while some others felt it was excessive and disruptive.[163][164]
The film marked the first, official Swift-related activity in India, where the film was released on November 3, 2023, and was met with fan frenzy, "delightful chaos", "loud cheers", group singing and dancing.India Todayreported that the theatre staff across India were unprepared for the energy and excitement of Indian Swifties. Local media drew comparisons with prominent Indian actors such asSalman KhanandVijay, while internet users were critical of "the love Indians were showering on an American pop star, saying they were obsessed withWestern culture." Indian Swifties on social argued that "if it was acceptable for fans to stand outsideShah Rukh Khan's house to watch him wave at them for a few minutes, they should not be criticised for enjoying the theatre experience they paid for." According to journalist Chingkheingambi Mayengbam, Swift and her concerts "provide a space for celebration without conflict—she's not fighting goons, revelling as theanti-hero, but fighting her own demons. Fans feel empowered without suppressing others, and her music serves as a medium for catharsis and emotional expression."[165]In China, where the film was released on December 31, 2023, it was met with "jubilation and frenzied planning—as thousands of fans have mobilized across the country", as perThe Washington Post. The Chinese messaging platformWeChatreported an influx of groups in various cities dedicated to purchasing tickets before they sell out. InBeijing, people "scoured Imax theaters to secure commemorative popcorn cups and drinkware printed with Swift's face" ahead of the theatrical release.[48]
Critics emphasized thatThe Eras Touris a straightforward concert film and not a standard musicdocumentary. They highlighted the absence of "docu-style elements"—such as interviews, behind-the-scenes or archived footage—in the film, calling it a concert film "in the true sense".[44][154]
Several publications interpretedThe Eras Touras a cinematic tribute to Swift's music and her fandom. They attributed the film's success to its emphasis oncommunal experienceand observed itsfeministaspects, celebratingfemininityand the female movie-going experience. JournalistJo Ellison, writing forFinancial Times, said that Swift's "supremacy" over the entertainment industry has resulted in much discourses over what her "secret sauce" could be, and opined that Swift "infuriates male criticsby not looking like a sexpot".[179][180][135][181]

AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.(doing business asAMC Theatres, originally an abbreviation forAmerican Multi-Cinema; often referred to simply asAMC) is an Americanmovie theaterchain founded inKansas City, Missouri, and now headquartered inLeawood, Kansas. It is the largest movie theater chain in the world. Founded in 1920, AMC has the largest share of the U.S. theater market, ahead ofRegal CinemasandCinemark Theatres. After acquiringOdeon Cinemas,UCI Cinemas, andCarmike Cinemasin 2016, it became the largest movie theater chain in the world.[3]It has 2,807 screens in 353 European theaters and 7,755 screens in 593 American theaters.[2][4]
The company is listed on theNew York Stock Exchange; from 2012 to 2018, the Chinese conglomerateWanda Groupowned a majority stake in the company. Private equity firmSilver Lake Partnersmade a $600 million investment in AMC in September 2018, but the voting power of AMC shares was structured so that Wanda Group still controlled the majority of AMC's board of directors. Amid financial downturns caused by theCOVID-19 lockdowns, in January 2021, Wanda's ownership was increasingly diluted due to new financing by AMC, as well asshort squeezesthat resulted in Silver Lake converting its $600 million debt holding to equity. In early-February 2021, Wanda converted itsClass B sharestoClass A shares, thus reducing its voting power to less than 50%.
AMC Theatres was founded in 1920 by Maurice, William, Irvin, Edward, and Barney Dubinsky, sons of Russian Jewish immigrants Simon and Sarah Dubinsky. The Dubinsky brothers had been traveling the Midwest performing melodramas and tent shows with actressJeanne Eagels. They purchased the Regent Theatre on 12th Street between Walnut and Grand in downtownKansas City, Missouri.[5]Maurice, the oldest brother, died in 1929, and Barney left the company in 1936 after being injured in an auto accident.[6]Edward, the youngest brother, eventually changed his last name to Durwood, and the company they formed eventually became known as Durwood Theatres, after a legal fight with his brothers.[6]The chain also had theaters inSt. JosephandJefferson City, MissouriandLeavenworthandTopeka, Kansas.[7]
When Edward's sonStanleyleft theU.S. Air ForceafterWorld War II, he joined the company in 1945. He persuaded his father to builddrive-in theatersin St. Joseph, Jefferson City, and Leavenworth. In 1947 they expanded further with the acquisition of the Liberty Theater in downtown Kansas City which they remodeled and renamed the Roxy.[8]They won anantitrustsuit to enable them to show first-run product at the Roxy and went on to acquire all of the downtown cinemas in Kansas City includingThe Empire Theater, theCapri Theatre, theMidland Theatreand the Paramount Theatre.[7]
In 1961, after Ed died, Stanley took control of Durwood Theatres, a small ten-theatre chain. With aninterstateplanned around Kansas City, Durwood looked to sites outside downtown and acquired two sites at a shopping center on Kansas City'sWard Parkwayto build a 700-seat theater. As the sites could not be combined, they opened two theaters side-by-side as the Parkway Twin Theatre in 1963.[7]This was the company's first foray into using themultiplexmodel.  According toVariety, Stanley Durwood later claimed in 1962 that he "was standing in the lobby of his 600-seat Roxy in Kansas City mulling over its poor grosses, when he realized he could double his box office by adding a second screen and still operate with the same size staff."[9]
Following the success of the Parkway Twin, AMC followed up with the Embassy 3 triplex at theCountry Club Plaza; the Metro Plaza, a four-screen theater in Kansas City in 1966; and a six-screen theater inOmahain 1969.[10][11][7]
The industry quickly embraced the multiplex concept, where additional screens meant very little difference in staff and operating costs but resulted in a significant profit increase. The concept also provided more film choices at one location, drawing bigger crowds. It also gave owners the flexibility to show big hits on more screens and less reliance on any individual film that could turn out to be a bust.[12]
Stanley renamed Durwood Theatres as American Royal Cinema on October 1, 1968, after theAmerican Royallivestock and horse show, but the latter's producers sought an injunction, and the name was changed to American Multi-Cinema, Inc.[13][7]
Stanley began to apply military management and the insights ofmanagement scienceto revolutionize the movie theatre industry.[14]As he later explained toVarietymagazine, "We needed to define what our company was doing in the (exhibition) business. My dad wasn't that organized."[15]It was structured under the belief that every customer was a "guest".
By the 1980s, the company was experiencing strong growth; in 1983, it had itsinitial public offering.[16]AMC Theatres built its first multiplex overseas in 1985, the 10-screen multiplex atThe Point, Milton Keynesin theUnited Kingdom,[16]and later opened additional sites in the UK such as inDudleyandTamworth, Staffordshire. In October 1988, they announced a joint venture withUnited Artists TheatersandCinema International Corporation(a partnership ofParamount PicturesandUniversal Studios) to run their combined cinemas in the UK, Ireland under the AMC name, however, AMC pulled out of the joint venture in December 1988, and sold their U.K. assets, including their 12 cinemas, to the new entity (later calledUnited Cinemas International) for $98 million and withdrew from the UK market.[17][18][19]
In 1988,Kinepolis Brussels, the firstmegaplexin the world,  with 25 screens and 7,600 seats, was opened byKinepolis, the European chain.[20][21][22][23]
In 1995, AMC Theatres opened the first North American megaplex, the AMC Grand 24 inDallas, Texas, a theater complex that could accommodate thousands.[24]AMC continued to open other megaplex theaters, such as the AMC Hampton Towne Center 24 in Hampton, Virginia, and the chain's busiest theater in the US, theAMC Empire 25inNew York CitynearTimes Square.
On December 13, 1996, AMC opened theOntario Mills30, a 30-screen theater inOntario, California, which at the time was the largest multiplex in the world.[25][16]AMC Theatres' megaplex theatres were a success overseas as well. In April 1996, they opened Canal City 13 inFukuoka, Japan, which was followed on December 20, 1996, by the AMC Arrábida 20 inPorto, Portugal.[19]In January 2002, the 16-screen Great Northern theatre was opened inManchesterin the U.K., marking the chain's return to the UK market after 14 years. This was later supplemented by the opening of a 12-screen cinema on the Broadway Plaza site inBirminghamin October 2003. AMC Theatres sometimes serve a dual function; in addition to the regular cinema functions, they also cater to companies' business conferences that can make use of their projectors for displaying presentations.[26]
In 2004, AMC Theatres was acquired by Marquee Holdings Inc., an investment vehicle controlled by affiliates ofJ.P. Morgan Partners, LLC, the private equity arm ofJPMorgan Chase, andApollo Global Management, a private investment firm.[27]At the time, AMC was publicly traded onAMEXunder the code AEN.[28]
In 2006, the company announced a newinitial public offering(IPO) expected to be worth approximately $789 million;[29]however, adverse market conditions convinced the company's management to withdraw from such an offering on May 3, 2007.[30]The company filed for a $450 million IPO in its third such filing since 2006 on July 14, 2010.[31][32]
Stanley Durwood died in 1999, and his successor was Peter Brown, the first non-Dubinsky/Durwood family member to head the company.[9]Gerardo I. Lopezsucceeded Brown as president and CEO of AMC Theatres on March 2, 2009.[33]Previously, Lopez was the Executive Vice President of President Consumer Products Group,Seattle's Best Coffee, and Foodservice atStarbucks.[34]Under new leadership, one of the first major announcements came in March of the same year; the company announced that it would equip 1,500 of its screens withReal Dprojectors.[35]In the same month, AMC Theatres announced it had closed on a $315 million deal withSonyto replace all of itsreel projectorswithdigital cinemaprojectors, starting in the second quarter of 2009 and completing in 2012.[36]
The company was formerly headquartered in downtown Kansas City. In September 2011, AMC Theatres announced plans to move its headquarters to a new $30 million four-story building designed by360 Architecturein the Park Place development at 117th Street and Nall Avenue inLeawood, Kansasin suburbanKansas City. Kansas had offered $47 million in incentives to get the 400 jobs to move across the Kansas/Missouri border.[37]
After reaching a settlement with the state of Illinois regarding complaints from adisability rightsorganization in April 2012, AMC pledged to equip all of its theaters in the state with captioning and description services by 2014. The disability rights group had accused the company of only providing closed captioning or audio description systems at some of its locations in the state.[38]
In May 2012, AMC Theatres was acquired by Chinese conglomerateWanda Group, headquartered inDalian, who paid $2.6 billion to acquire AMC's 5,048 screens in 347 theaters in the U.S. and Canada.[39]The deal was finalized on September 4, 2012.[40]The acquisition made Wanda the world's largest cinema chain.[41]Wang Jianlin, CEO of Dalian Wanda Group, announced that the company would plan to spend $500 million renovating AMC locations.[40]
AMC Theatres had eight movie theatres in Canada. In July 2012, four locations were sold toCineplex Entertainment, and two more locations were sold toEmpire Theatresand later acquired byLandmark Cinemas. The two remaining locations have since closed.[42]
Gerardo I. Lopezannounced his resignation as CEO of AMC in August 2015. Craig Ramsey was appointed as the interim CEO by the company board.[43]In December 2015, AMC announced thatAdam Aronwould be the company's president and chief executive officer, as well as a member of the company's board of directors, beginning on January 4, 2016.[44]
In March 2016, AMC Theatres announced it would acquire competitorCarmike Cinemas.[45]In July 2016, Carmike's management accepted a revised offer, pending regulatory and shareholder approval.[46]The deal was closed on December 25, 2016, making AMC the largest cinema chain in the United States.[47]
On March 1, 2017, AMC Theatres CEO Adam Aron stated that the company would rebrand Carmike Cinemas locations under the AMC name; smaller locations were rebranded under the new banner AMC Classic (which repurposes trademarks associated with Carmike). Aron also announced a plan to rebrand its kitchen-equipped theaters as AMC Dine-In.[48][49]
In July 2017, AMC Theatres announced they would cut $30 million in expenses by the end of the year. This cost reduction would be accomplished by reducing operating hours, cutting staffing levels, and other measures.[50]
In September 2018,Silver Lake Partnersmade a $600 million investment in AMC Theatres, whose proceeds were used to repurchase approximately 32% of Wanda Group's class Bcommon stock.[51]However, the voting power of AMC's shares is structured in such a way (granting three votes per-share for each Class B share if its stake in the company is above 30%)[52]that, even after reducing its ownership of AMC common stock to just under 50% by the end of 2019, Wanda Group continued to retain majority control over AMC's board of directors.[53]
In October 2019, AMC began to offer on-demand rentals and purchases of digital film releases under the banner AMC Theatres On Demand. The service is tied to the company's Stubs loyalty program.[54][55][56]
On March 18, 2020, AMC announced the closure of all of its theaters due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, in compliance withCDCguidance against any gathering of over ten people. AMC said this shutdown would last for at least six to twelve weeks.[57]On March 25, 2020, AMC furloughed all of its 600 corporate employees, including CEO Adam Aron. All furloughed corporate AMC employees and associates retained active employment status, including all health benefits.[58]
On April 28, 2020, AMC announced they would no longer carry films fromUniversal PicturesafterNBCUniversalCEOJeff Shellcommented inThe Wall Street Journalthat the studio wanted to release films via premium video-on-demand simultaneously with theatrical releases. The company threatened that this will also be done with any other studio "who unilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us, so that they as distributor and we as exhibitor both benefit and neither are hurt from such changes."[59]
On June 3, 2020, AMC stated that it had "substantial doubt" that it would remain in business.[60]On July 28, 2020, AMC and Universal were able to resolve their dispute, with AMC agreeing to a shorter theatrical window of 17 days before Universal could release their films via premium VOD, as well as revenue sharing on the premium VOD window.[61]
On August 20, 2020, AMC began the process of reopening selected locations in the United States where allowed under local health orders. In honor of the company's centennial year, AMC also offered a special 15-cent ticket promotion that day, promoted as "Movies in 2020 at 1920 Prices." The company aimed for at least two thirds of its locations to be open in time for the September 3 release ofTenet.[62]The company upgraded itsair filtrationsystems to four times the rates before the pandemic and installed electrostatic sprayers in the auditoriums.[63][64]In October 2020, the company reported that its existing cash resources "would be largely depleted by the end of 2020 or early 2021."[65]
On January 26, 2021, AMC stated that it had raised $917 million in new funding, including $506 million in equity and new common shares, and commitments for $411 million in debt financing. The company stated that this new funding "should allow the company to make it through this dark coronavirus-impacted winter".[66][67]The next day, as part of a wider series ofshort squeezescoordinated by theRedditcommunityr/wallstreetbets(whichprimarily targetedvideo game retailerGameStop), AMC experienced a major, 300% surge in its share price to a peak of $20.36.[68][69]The surge triggered Silver Lake Partners'convertible bonds; on January 28, it reached an agreement to convert $600 million of its debt holdings in AMC to equity at $13.51 per-share.[70]Mudrick Capital Managementmade nearly $200 million in profit off its holdings of AMC debt.[71]
On February 5, 2021, a U.S.-based subsidiary of Wanda Group issued a filing with the SEC, stating that it had converted its Class B common stock toClass A sharesto permit their sale. While Wanda remained AMC's largest single shareholder, the conversion, as well as AMC's financing efforts taking its stake below 37%, effectively surrendered its majority control since Class A stock only provides one vote per-share.[52][72]On May 21, 2021, Wanda filed a 0.002% stake with the SEC, largely confirming the end of their involvement in AMC.[73]
During its fourth-quarter earnings call in March 2021, the company reported that its revenue had fallen by 88% year-over-year. CEOAdam Aronstated that AMC was facing the "most challenging market conditions in the 100-year history of the company", but cited progress on COVID-19 vaccinations, decisions to allow cinemas in New York City and Los Angeles to re-open, and a "significant" number of upcoming blockbuster films as signs of optimism.[72]Aron also confirmed that Wanda no longer had majority control, and the company would now "be governed like most other publicly traded companies with a wide array of shareholders".[52][74]
In June 2021, retail investors once again poured into AMC stock, propelling shares to an all-time high of $77.26 in another alleged short squeeze.[75]Short sellers betting against AMC incurred losses of over $2.8B as a result.[76]AMC issued more shares during the surge, but warned potential investors against buying the shares "unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment". The cinema chain operator said it believed current prices reflected "market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business".
In the year to date, shares in AMC had soared 2,421% – despite its cinemas being largely shut during the pandemic.[77]
In August 2021, the company revealed plans to begin acceptingcryptocurrenciessuch asBitcoinfor purchases in the future,[78]which it did in November 2021 for online purchases viaPayPal.[79][80]In April 2022, AMC added integration withBitPayas a payment provider to its mobile app, allowing customers to use crypto payments such asDogecoinandShiba Inu.[81]
On August 4, 2022, AMC took Wall Street by surprise with the announcement of its "AMC Preferred Equity Units" after market close, a new preferred share class. The units were to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "APE," a nod to the individual investors who turned the company into ameme stock, who often refer to themselves as "apes". Over 516 million APE units were subsequently issued to AMC shareholders in a 1:1 special dividend, with the units wielding similar economic properties as common shares.[82]AMC stock gained 19% to $22.18 at the close on Friday after initially falling following the announcement of the new units on Thursday. The preferred shares started trading under the "APE" ticker on the New York Stock Exchange starting Aug. 22.[83]AMC CEO Adam Aron stated "We are making great strides on our path towards pandemic recovery".[citation needed]
In February 2023 AMC announced plans to test adynamic pricingmodel for tickets for showings that occur after 4pm based on seat location. Seats located near the front of the theatre and select ADA seats will be priced less than other seats and will only be made available to members of the Stubs rewards program and seats in the middle of the theatre will be priced more than the other non-front row seats. In addition, AMC Stubs A-List members will be able to reserve the expensive middle seats at no additional charge.[84][85]In July 2023 AMC chose to abandon dynamic pricing after testing showed that customers were still not likely to choose front-row seats despite their lower prices, with most customers still sitting in the middle of the theatre or other non-front seats despite the upcharge. This made AMC believe that this made their prices less competitive as competitors did not also adapt dynamic pricing. The company also stated that it would test seats that recline further back in the front rows that would potentially allow better views.[86]
On July 31, the company reported their highest single-week admissions revenue in company history due to theBarbenheimercraze.[87]On September 6, AMC announced that it had planned to sell up 40 million shares.[88]
AMC patentedcup holderarmrestsin 1981.[16]AMC also introduced stadium-style seating. The seats are placed on risers so that each person has an unobstructed view of the screen. In 1995, they introduced "Love Seat" style seating with retractable armrests so that there can be no barrier between two seats.[16]In July 1994, AMC signed an agreement with Sony to begin installing SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound) in auditoriums,[89]and began upgrading selected older auditoriums in 2003. On March 26, 2009, AMC announced an agreement to convert 1,500 existing auditoriums to fully digital 3D screens usingRealDtechnology.[90][non-primary source needed]
On March 30, 2009, they announced they would convert all 4,500 screens in their chain to4Kdigital projectors provided by Sony.[91]In April 2022, AMC also announced an agreement with Cinionic to install laser projectors at 3,500 of its screens in the United States through the end of 2026.[92]
Selected AMC locations offer premium screens and features for a higher ticket price, includingpremium large formats.
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. invested $20 million in virtual-reality arcades and productions: $10 million to virtual reality entertainment company Dreamscape Immersive and another $10 million in a content fund.[102]
AMC Theatres created the now-defunct MovieWatcher program[when?]that rewarded frequent movie-goers similar to other rewards programs but featured innovative aspects. It was based on a points-per-movie-ticket-purchased system, with rewards varying from concessions to movie passes based on point-based level. However, points were limited to a maximum of four points per three-hour time period, which was equal to two tickets.[103]For the AMC cinemas that were not part of the Loews Cineplex acquisition and therefore ticketed byMovieTickets.com, the website's surcharge was waived for MovieWatcher members.[citation needed]
On April 1, 2011, AMC started a new rewards program known as AMC Stubs,[104]which could be purchased for a fee of $12 for an entire year. For that initial fee, members would receive $5 on every $50 spent between the box office and the concession stand at any AMC theater nationwide. AMC Stubs members also received a free size upgrade with every popcorn and drink they purchase (for example, an AMC Stubs member can get a large popcorn for the price of a regular).
Other perks include birthday gifts and waived ticketing fees for online ticketing sites such asMovieTickets.comandFandangoand also online ticket purchases through AMC's own website and mobile app. Receipts or ticket stubs were required for manual adjustments. No more than four manual adjustments would be allowed per account in a single calendar month. Manual adjustments would be made for purchases made within 30 calendar days from date of original purchase.[105]
As of March 29, 2012, AMC Stubs had 3.2 million members, which represents approximately 18% of AMC attendance during fiscal 2012.[104]In July 2018, AMC Stubs was split into three programs that are currently still in-place: the free AMC Stubs Insider; the yearly fee-based AMC Stubs Premiere, which costs $15 annually and provides the same benefits as the original Stubs plus an expedited line at tickets and concessions; and the monthly fee-based AMC Stubs A-List, which includes up to 3 movie tickets a week to any film in any format for $19.95 to $23.95 a month, depending on the state the member plans to watch movies in.[106][107]Discount Tuesdays is another feature every Tuesday for members to purchase tickets typically for just $6 to any film in most locations, with occasional exclusions, plus surcharges for premium formats such as 3D, IMAX, and Dolby Cinema, as well as special events.
Some AMC locations have a bar service under the MacGuffins brand. These are primarily offered at AMC and AMC Dine-in locations, but some AMC Classic locations with liquor licenses offer their alcoholic beverages under this brand. Drinks can be ordered to be consumed in the bar and lounge area or taken into the theater. Some AMC Dine-in theaters have their MacGuffins set up as a full-service restaurant that can be accessed without having to pay for a movie ticket.[108]
Several types of vouchers may be used at AMC Theatres.
Following the acquisition of Carmike Cinemas, AMC began to unify its cinemas under one of three main banners in 2017:[112][113][114][115]
AMC also formed a short-lived partnership withPlanet Hollywoodthat failed due to that company's bankruptcy. The Planet Movies by AMC venture planned to open complexes worldwide with the objective of having icon locations in major metropolitan and other select areas, likeOrlandoandColumbus. Initially, seven existing, unnamed AMC megaplex theaters with more than 150 combined screens were to be re-branded under a license arrangement to incorporate certain elements of the new concept. The initial seven re-branded locations were to include markets such asOrlando, Florida. The AMC Pleasure Island 24 megaplex in Orlando, situated directly across from Planet Hollywood's most successful restaurant and retail unit and adjacent to Disney'sPleasure Island(nowDisney Springs) was to be the first Planet Movies location.
After the initial seven, the joint-venture planned to own and operate all subsequent units including 8 to 10 complexes with 200 to 250 screens planned to open over the next 18 to 24 months. Over the longer term, the venture anticipated rolling out units at the rate of 5 to 10 per year. From almost the very start, the well-publicized financial strains on Planet Hollywood hindered the project. The only Planet Movies location to actually open, a 30 screen megaplex, did so in the summer of 1999 atEaston Town CenterinColumbus, Ohio. The location was also located alongside anOfficial All Star CaféandPlanet Hollywoodrestaurant.
The continued poor financial performance of Planet Hollywood led the company to declare bankruptcy in December 1998, and even before the first location had opened stated that "the joint venture has no definitive plans to expand this concept once the Columbus site is completed". As Planet Hollywood was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy in October 1999 their re-organization plan emphasized focus back on their core restaurant business and away from side-ventures like Planet Movies and their Cool Planet ice cream chain.  The Planet Hollywood restaurant and All Star Café in Columbus were closed in late 2000, and the film memorabilia were also removed from the theater as it was rebranded AMC Easton 30, and continues to operate.  The Planet Movies by AMC joint venture was formally dissolved on January 9, 2001.
Both of theDisney Parksin the United States at one time included AMC movie theaters at their Downtown Disney sections: AMC Dine-In Disney Springs 24 all-stadium-seating megaplex with Dolby Cinema and Dine-In Theatres (opened in 1996) (formerly AMC Pleasure Island 24) atWalt Disney World Resortand AMC Downtown Disney 12 atDisneyland Resortstadium-seating multiplex (opened in 2001, closed in 2018). The AMC CityWalk Stadium 19 located onUniversal Studios Hollywood'sCityWalkwas relaunched after a renovation as "Universal Cinema, an AMC Theatre", on April 21, 2017. This location includes a seven-story IMAX screen with IMAX Laser and IMAX 70mm film, as well as "Black Box"–inspired auditoriums.  It has one Christie Laser Projector per auditorium, with Dolby Atmos speakers.[119]AtUniversal Orlando Resort, AMC had the Universal Cineplex 20 (also a former Cineplex Odeon), until September 2018 when it became aCinemark.[120][121][122]
AMC Independent (also known as AMCi) is an AMC film distribution program that aims to help independent films reach a theatrical audience. The program was announced in 2010 via the AMC Blog,[123]and has been responsible for promoting and distributing all independent films to AMC theaters since.[124][125][126]
In July 2021, AMC Theatres partnered with American artistChance the Rapperand his content production company House of Kicks in a trailblazing internationaldistributionagreement to bring his concert filmMagnificent Coloring Worldto cinemas internationally, marking the first time an individual recording artist distributed a film through AMC.[127]This deal was revisited in 2023 when AMC partnered withTaylor SwiftandBeyoncéto release their respectiveconcert filmsTaylor Swift: The Eras TourandRenaissance: A Film by Beyoncé. In all three cases, AMC acted as both the distributor and exhibitor of the films, bypassing the involvement of major film studios.[128][129]

In January 2017,Nordic Cinema Group, the leading movie theater operator in theNordicandBalticarea, was sold to AMC for approximately $929 million.[148][149]The deal was completed in March 2017 after AMC received clearance from the European Commission.[150]
In July 2021, AMC Theatres announced that it would acquire the leases to theAmericana at Brandin downtown Glendale andThe Grove at Farmers Marketin Los Angeles locations, formerly owned byPacific Theatres, and that they would reopen in August as part of the AMC chain. The company has not ruled out acquiring the leases of other Pacific Theatres locations.[151]In December 2021, AMC Theaters also announced that they had acquired the leases to the former Pacific Theaters location atNorthridge Fashion CenterinNorthridge, Los Angelesand theArclightChicago 14 inLincoln Park, Chicago, which both opened in 2022.[152]In February 2022, AMC Theaters reached a deal to acquire the leases to the Arclight Montgomery 16 atWestfield MontgomeryinWashington D.C.and theWestfield UTC mall's Arclight UTC 14 inLa Jolla, with the former reopening that month and the latter in March of that year.[153]During the same month, the company reached an agreement to acquire the lease to the Century 12 Evanston, previously owned byCinemark Theatres, inEvanston, Illinois.[154]In December 2022, the company reached a deal on the acquisition of the former Arclight Cinemas located atThe Hub on CausewayinBoston.[155]
In April 2022, AMC Theaters acquired sevenBow Tie Cinemaslocations in Connecticut, New York, and Maryland.[156]
The early versions of stadium-style seating as built by AMC in 1995 had auditoriums configured with an entrance to a flat area immediately in front of the screen for wheelchair users.  People seated there had to either lean back or look up at an uncomfortable angle to see the screen. Able-bodied guests had to ascend the stairs to sit in the middle of the risers in order to have a comfortable line-of-sight with the screen. Since some wheelchair users have limited neck movement range, this configuration made AMC a popular target forAmericans with Disabilities Act(ADA)lawsuits.[157]AMC subsequently solved the problem in newer theaters by building full-stadium auditoriums where the main entrance is through a ramp that emerges onto a platform in the middle of the risers so that wheelchair users can enjoy optimal line-of-sight. However, theU.S. Department of Justicesued the company, and obtained an order requiring AMC to retrofit over 1,990 screens in 95 multiplexes and megaplexes across the United States.
The company successfully appealed the order to theU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled on December 5, 2008[158]that the order was excessive and violated AMC'sdue processrights under theConstitution of the United States.[157]AMC won by pointing out that theUnited States Access Boardhad not yet amended its guidelines for movie theaters to specifically require them to provide wheelchair guests sightlines that were as good as those from elevated risers, versus merely providing an unobstructed view of the screen. Therefore, the court ruled that it was unfair to AMC to retroactively hold it to a standard that did not exist at the time it began building stadium-style theaters.
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., and some of its executives and underwriters of federal securities law charges had agreed to settle in 2017 for $18 million. The case charged AMC with defrauding investors about the financial health of the acquired theater operators and integration challenges, artificially inflating the stock prices of its secondary public offering (SPO).[159]
When AMC announced that most of their theaters would reopen in mid-July 2020 during theCOVID-19 pandemic, the initial announcement said masks would be recommended but not mandatory. AMC CEO Adam Aron stated, "We are strongly encouraging our guests to wear masks all across the country, but not requiring it" and "We did not want to be drawn into a political controversy... We thought it might be counterproductive if we forced mask wearing on those people who believe strongly that it is not necessary."[160]After massive pushback from the public, Aron changed the policy to require masks: "This announcement prompted an intense and immediate outcry from our customers, and it is clear from this response that we did not go far enough on the usage of masks," Aron said.[161]

Cinemark Holdings, Inc.(stylized asCineMarkfrom 1998 until 2022 and inall capssince 2022) is an Americanmovie theaterchain that started operations in 1977 and since then it has operated theaters with hundreds of locations throughout theAmericas. It is headquartered inPlano, Texas, in theDallas–Fort Wortharea. Cinemark operates 497 theaters and 5,653 screens in the U.S. and Latin America as of March 2025. It is also the largest movie theater chain inBrazil, with a 30 percent market share.[4]
Cinemark operates theaters under several brands, including its flagship Cinemark,Century Theatres, Tinseltown, CinéArts andRave Cinemas.[5]
In May 2021, Cinemark struck agreements to show films from some of its major Hollywood studio partners, includingWarner Bros.,Walt Disney Studios,Paramount, andSony Pictures.[6]The goal of the move is to establish how long movies will play in theaters before being available for home video.[7]
Cinemark was started byLee Roy Mitchellas a chain of theatres inCalifornia,TexasandUtah.[8][citation needed]The roots of the company date back to the 1960s when brothers J.C. and Lee Roy Mitchell created Mitchell Theatres, Inc.[9]By 1972, the company was named Texas Cinema Corporation. Lee Roy Mitchell then formed a group of theaters under the Cinemark name beginning in 1977. Cinemark Corporation and Texas Cinema Corporation merged operations in June 1979 creating a portfolio of 25 theaters in Texas and New Mexico under the Cinemark brand.[10]On March 26, 1980,Henry G. PlittofPlitt TheatresHoldings purchased the Cinemark circuit of theaters.[11]But Cinemark Corporation continued operations acquiring existing theaters and began to build new theaters. In 1987, Cinemark acquired all of the Plitt Theatres.
With the opening of the Movies 8 on 3912 Hampton Road inTexarkana, Texasin 1987, Cinemark began building theaters with colorful interiors and largevideo gamearcades. Legal advertisements indicate that the company known as Cinemark USA, Incorporated, officially began December 31, 1987.[12]
The following year, Cinemark introduced itsFront Row Joemascotcreated bySan Antonio-based independent animation studio Wilming Reams Animation. Thisanimatedcatappeared in policy trailers and on kids' concession products.[13]The mascot was retired in 1998 when Cinemark had begun to openArt Deco-style theatres, and was revived in 2004 for its 20th anniversary, and again in 2018 with a CGI look, darker orange color and the beige color being added. In 1992, Cinemark opened a new theater concept called Hollywood USA inGarland, Texas; this concept was subsequently refined into the Tinseltown USA brand of theaters, which were much bigger than what Cinemark had previously built.
The following year, Cinemark expanded toLatin Americawith the opening of a six-screen theater inSantiago,Chile. The next year, they opened four theaters in Mexico and in 1997 opened their first theater in Brazil. By 2000, it was the largest exhibitor in Brazil (180 screens), Chile (89 screens; 50% market share) and El Salvador (25 screens; 60–70% market share) and had 192 screens in Mexico, as well as theaters in Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru.[14]
In 1998, Cinemark announced that it would replace its bright color interiors with what Cinemark characterized as a more classic Art Deco design.[15]Through new theatre construction and acquisitions, it became the third largest theatre chain in the United States and the second largest theatre chain in the world.[citation needed]Mitchell's son Kevin Mitchell worked with the company as an executive until leaving in 2007 to found ShowBiz Cinemas.[16][17][18]In 2013, Cinemark decided to sell all of its Mexican theaters toCinemex.[19]
Cinemark has a deal withUniversalin which movies that gross more than $50 million domestically during their first weekend in theaters will continue to be shown in theaters exclusively for five weekends, or 31 days.[7]After that, while theaters can continue to screen a film, the title becomes available on online rental platforms such asApple TVandAmazon Prime Video.[7]
Cinemark introduced a new premium offering, Cinemark XD, standing forExtreme Digital Cinemain 2009. The first XD screen opened at the Century San Francisco Centre 9 theater inSan Francisco, California. This auditorium features a giant, wall-to-wall display,Barco4K digital projection with 2D andRealD 3Dcapabilities, surround sound audio systems and premium seats.[20]On May 4, 2017, it was announced that aTHXsound system would be coming to the XD locations as part of a partnership with Cinemark. TheRazer-owned company was hired to certify over 200 XD auditoriums in the United States andLatin America. It took a year to finish the certification update.[21]Finally on May 2, 2018, Cinemark confirmed that the XD screens were now THX certified as the progress was completed.[22]Cinemark Holdings Inc (CNK) Reports Robust Revenue Growth and Solid Profitability in FY 2023.[23]
In the 1990s, Cinemark Theatres was one of the first chains to incorporate stadium-style seating into their theatres.[24]In 1997, several disabled individuals filed a lawsuit against Cinemark, alleging that their stadium style seats forced patrons who used wheelchairs to sit in the front row of the theatre, effectively rendering them unable to see the screen without assuming a horizontal position. The case was heard in El Paso district court asLara v. Cinemark USA, where a judge ruled that the architecture of Cinemark's theatres violated theAmericans with Disabilities Act(ADA). The ruling was later overturned by theFifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that Cinemark only had to provide an "unobstructed view" of the screen, and that since disabled patrons' view was only awkward and not actually obscured, Cinemark was not violating the law.[25]
In response, theUnited States Department of Justice(DOJ) filed their own suit against Cinemark while appealing the appellate court's decision. The DOJ argued that, while Cinemark was not technically violating the ADA, it was nevertheless discriminating against disabled patrons by relegating them to the worst seats in the auditorium.[26]Cinemark responded by filing a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, alleging misconduct on the DOJ's behalf.[27]Cinemark's lawsuit was thrown out, and the Department of Justice proceeded with its lawsuit. Cinemark ultimately agreed tosettle out of courtbefore the court came to a ruling, agreeing with the DOJ that it was in the company's best interest to end litigation before a ruling was issued.[26]Per the terms of the settlement, Cinemark agreed to renovate all existing theatres to provide patrons who used wheelchairs access to rows higher in its theatres, and also agreed that all future theatres would be constructed so as to allow handicapped patrons better access to higher rows. In turn, the Department of Justice agreed not to bring further litigation against the company in relation to the architecture of stadium seating as it applies to the ADA.[26]
On July 20, 2012, a gunman opened fire during themidnight premiereofThe Dark Knight Risesin a Century theater inAurora,Colorado, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others.[28]The gunman, later identified asJames Eagan Holmes, who was believed to be acting alone, entered the theater dressed inprotective clothing, set offtactical grenades, then opened fire with multiple firearms on the theatergoers. Counting both fatalities and injuries, the attack was the largest mass shooting in terms of number of casualties in United States history at the time.[29]The theater was reopened on January 17, 2013.[30]
The theater was sued by families of the victims, who alleged the theater should have taken greater measures to prevent the shooting. In May 2016, after years of legal debate, a jury took three hours to deliver a unanimous verdict that the theater chain was not liable.[31]As the prevailing party in the judgment, Cinemark sought nearly US$700,000 from the plaintiffs to recover litigation expenses. In September 2016, after objections from the victims, Cinemark dropped all claims for reimbursement of legal fees.[32]A separate group of victims were also dismissed in federal court when US District Judge R. Brooke Jackson ruled: "[James Holmes'] own premeditated and intentional actions were the predominant cause of the plaintiffs' losses."[33]
In the wake of the2018 school shootinginParkland,Florida, Cinemark announced that it would no longer allow bags larger than 12 in × 12 in × 6 in (30 cm × 30 cm × 15 cm) in its theaters as a safety precaution.[34]
On March 18, 2020, Cinemark temporarily closed all 345 of its theaters in the United States due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[35]Cinemark released a statement describing the temporary closure "as a proactive measure in support of the health and safety of its employees, guests and communities."[35]In light of the pandemic, a few dozen locations have upgraded their box office stands, replacing them with digital kiosks for ticket purchases, including the lay offs of many ushers working up front-end. Another reason is due to the plunging revenue in Q3 2020. The process of entirely replacing ushers with kiosks has been pushed back to January 1, 2028.[36]
In May 2021, CEO Mark Zoradi said that 98 percent of Cinemark's theaters in the United States had reopened. Due to government restrictions in Latin America, only half of the theaters in the region are operating.[7]More recently, the company signed a new deal with the major movie studios.[37]
In 2008, CEO Alan Stock donated US$9,999 toward the successful passage ofCalifornia'sProposition 8, an initiative restricting the definition of marriage to opposite-sex couples and overturning theCalifornia Supreme Court'sruling that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. An ensuing campaign, launched by opponents to the Prop 8 passage, encouraged patrons to see showings of the filmMilk, based on the life of gay-rights activistHarvey Milk, at a competing theater in protest instead of at Cinemark showings.[38]Others called for a more generalboycott.[39]
On August 8, 2006, Cinemark purchasedCentury Theatreswith a combination of cash and stock bonds.[40][41]This acquisition added over 80 theatres and many more screens. Some of these theatres were subsequently shut down either being phased out as under performing or replaced with new complexes. The transaction was completed on October 5, 2006. With this purchase, Cinemark heavily strengthened their presence in Northern California and entered Alaska, Nevada, South Dakota, and Washington state, though at the transaction both of their locations in Washington state were still under construction. However, Cinemark retains the Century banner and continues to open new locations under that banner.
In 2009, in order to save the company from a potential bankruptcy,Muvico Theaterssold four theatres to Cinemark:Arundel MillsEgyptian 24 in Hanover, Maryland; Paradise 24 in Pembroke Pines, Florida; Palace 20 in Boca Raton, Florida; and Boynton Beach 14 in Boynton Beach, Florida.[42][43]Muvico was bought by another theater chain (Carmike Cinemas) in 2013,[44]which was bought by yet another (AMC Theatres) in 2016.[45]
In November 2012, Cinemark announced it was acquiring Rave Cinemas, the Dallas, Texas–based chain that operates the former Bridge theater with IMAX inCulver City, Californiafor US$240 million. The deal included 32 theaters located in 12 US states, representing 483 screens. Tim Warner, Cinemark's CEO said in a statement "The acquisition of these high quality assets will further enhance Cinemark's diversified domestic footprint, including the expansion of our presence in the New England market".[46]The sale was closed on May 29, 2013, but Cinemark was required to sell the Rave Stonybrook 20 + IMAX theater in Louisville, Kentucky, the Rave Ritz Center 16 in southern New Jersey, and either the Rave Hickory Creek 16 in Hickory Creek, Texas or the Cinemark 14 in Denton, Texas. In addition, Cinemark's chairman Lee Roy Mitchell was also required to sell the Movie Tavern Inc. toSouthern Theatres.[47]On July 18, 2013, Cinemark found a buyer,Carmike Cinemas, for the Stonybrook 20 & IMAX, Rave Ritz Center 16, and the Rave Hickory Creek 16. With this change, National CineMedia has been replaced with Screenvision at the Stonybrook 20 and Ritz Center 16. Screenvision is already at Hickory Creek, Texas at the time of the announcement of the sale.[48]The sale was closed on August 16, 2013.[49]On September 12, 2013,Southern Theatresannounced that they acquired The Movie Tavern from Lee Roy Mitchell after he was required to sell The Movie Tavern after Cinemark boughtRave Cinemason May 29, 2013. In 2018, Southern sold the Movie Tavern chain to theMarcus Corporation. As part of Southern Theatres' long-term deal with National CineMedia, The Movie Tavern switched fromScreenvisiontoNational CineMediain June 2014. Also, Cinemark purchased Rave Cinemas Baldwin Hills Crenshaw 15, inLos Angeles, in June 2014.[50]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
