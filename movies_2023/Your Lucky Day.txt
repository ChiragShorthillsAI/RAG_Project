A young man, Sterling, is mugged at night. He later enters a store, where a customer, Mr. Laird, freely brags about winning a $156 million lottery ticket. Sterling puts on a mask and points a gun and asks for the ticket. However, Cody, a cop in the bathroom hears the commotion and by mistake shoots Mr. Laird, upon which Sterling shoots Cody.
Sterling orders the store-keeper Amir to move the bodies and delete the camera footage. Other customers include Abraham with his pregnant girlfriend Ana. Amir, Abraham, Ana and Sterling decide a way to split the money. Amir's brother-in-law and a security guard arrive to check on him, but are made to leave without arousing suspicion.
The four unlock Mr. Laird's phone and make it appear to the world that he has taken a long vacation. They think about leaving Cody in his car with the murder weapon, but unknown to them, Cody regains consciousness to find the dead body of Mr. Laird near him and calls his dad to tell him about the lottery ticket.
Abraham drives the car with the dead body of Mr. Laird and stops at a railway crossing. The security guard sees him and tries to restrain him, but is subdued. Meanwhile, Cody's dad arrives at the store parking lot with two other members of the police SWAT team and kill Sterling and Amir. Cody's dad enters the store and sees an unmoving Ana with a plastic bag over her head, but she was only pretending to have committed suicide, as she gets up to kill him with a hammer. Another cop enters the store and she kills him with a broken bottle.
She then sets off the sprinkler fire alarm to alert the fire station. Cody arrives in the store and shoots Ana, but is killed by the last remaining cop, Captain Rutledge. Ana hands Rutledge the winning ticket, but he hands it back to her saying, "All you remember is me saving your lives", as firemen and cops arrive on the scene.
Outside, the $156 million sign for the lottery changes to a mere $20 million, indicating that the ticket has been claimed. In a TV interview, Rutledge is told his share was $78 million. Ana is in the hospital with Abraham, celebrating their newborn baby.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
