Mary Harron(born January 12, 1953) is a Canadian film director and screenwriter.[1][2][3]
She co-wrote the screenplay and directedAmerican Psycho,[4][5][6]The Notorious Bettie Page[7], andI Shot Andy Warhol.
Born inBracebridge, Ontario, Canada,[8]Harron grew up with a family with numerous connections to the arts. She is the daughter of Gloria Fisher andDon Harron, a Canadian actor, comedian, author, and director. Her parents divorced when she was six years old.[9]Harron spent her early life residing between Toronto andLos Angeles.[2]Harron's first stepmother,Virginia Leith, was discovered byStanley Kubrickand acted in his first film,Fear and Desireand was also featured in the 1962 cult classicThe Brain That Wouldn't Die. Leith's brief acting career partly inspired Harron's interest in makingThe Notorious Bettie Page.[citation needed]Harron's stepfather is the novelistStephen Vizinczey. Harron's second stepmother is the Canadian singerCatherine McKinnon.
Harron moved to England when she was thirteen and later attendedSt Anne's College,Oxford University, where she received a Bachelors in English.[9][10]While in England, she datedTony Blair, later thePrime Minister of the United Kingdom, andChris Huhne, another Oxford student who later became a prominent politician.[11][12][13][14][15]She then moved toNew York Cityand was part of its 1970spunkscene.
During her adolescence, Harron was exposed to many different forms of art and film. In a 2020 interview withThe New School, Harron states: "My parents took us to whatever films they wanted to see so I saw a lot of art films that would not be considered suitable for a child." She goes on to explain that her largest influences, especially as a child around the age of ten, were Alfred Hitchcock, Bergman, and Satyajit Ray. After she had moved to London in her teen years she began attending theNational Film Theatrewhere she was exposed to other international filmmakers likeFritz Lang,Howard Hawks,Claude Chabrol, andRoman Polanski. She was also exposed to noir films, namelyDouble Indemnity.
As an adult she was inspired by the filmsBlue Velvet,Drugstore CowboyandThe Piano, directed byJane Campion. While she said that she had plenty of exposure to Hollywood films, she was enticed by these types of films because they were, in her words, the "forerunners of independent film."[16]
In New York, Harron helped start and write forPunkmagazine as a music journalist; she was the first journalist to interview theSex Pistolsfor an American publication. She grew up in the early punk scene of America. She found the culture easy for her to fit into and was constantly evolving and spreading into new demographics.[9]During the 1980s, she was a drama critic forThe Observerin London for a time, as well as working as a music critic forThe Guardianand theNew Statesman. In the late 1980s, Harron participated and began her film career writing and directing BBC Documentaries.[9]
During the 1990s, Harron moved back to New York where she worked as a producer forPBS'sEdge, a program dedicated to exploring American pop culture. It was at this time that Harron became interested in the life ofValerie Solanas, the woman who attempted to killAndy Warhol. Harron suggested making a documentary about Solanas to her producers, who in turn encouraged her to develop the project into what would be her first feature film.[17]Harron says she owes her success with her first film to Andy who helped to sell the controversial focus on the attempted murderess, Solanas.[18]
Harron's feature filmdirectorial debut,I Shot Andy Warhol, released in 1996, is the partially imagined story of Valerie Solanas' failedassassination attempt on Andy Warhol.[19]She explains her interest in Solanas' life:
For Solanas, there was this fierce, outsider quality to her unhappiness and frustration. That was a time in my life when I was frustrated myself in my work. I wanted to direct. I had the idea years before I got to direct myself. So I think there were elements of my own frustration and elements of what it was like growing up with an unfair attitude towards women ... and Valerie was an extreme example of that. There was also the intellectual interest of how someone can be so brilliant and her life goes so wrong, and also, that she was so forgotten and misunderstood. In both cases, I felt like Valerie had been consigned to history as this lunatic, almost nothing written about her.[20]
In an interview Harron did for CBC’s Newsworld’sOn the Artsin 1996, she told film critic Christopher Heard that "It was Valerie that really impelled [her] to make this film, because of the mystery of her story. [...] Not knowing who she was ... the lack of information about her."[21]Solanas's existence was "a real piece of lost history" and an "unknown story" that she sought to explore deeper.[21]
As far as Harron's amusement with Warhol went, she stated "As I was growing up, Warhol was the most famous artist in the world, apart from Picasso [...] My mother [disapproved] of him, so that made him even more interesting."[21]Also regarding her interest in Warhol’s story, she felt that he, before and after the shooting, were two vastly different people. This is her reason for viewing Warhol’s shooting as a “turning point” in his life.”
The film opened the “Un Certain Regard” section of the Cannes Film Festival and received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for best first feature film.[22]It also won the sole acting award at that year'sSundance Film FestivalforLili Taylor's performance as Solanas.[23]
Harron's second film,American Psycho, released in 2000, is based on thebook of the same titlebyBret Easton Ellis, which is notorious for its graphic descriptions of torture and murder.[24][25]The protagonist, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), is an investment banker who goes on a killing spree.The New York Times'Stephen Holden wrote of the film:
From the opening credits, in which drops of blood are confused with red berry sauce drizzled on an exquisitely arranged plate of nouvelle cuisine, the movie establishes its insidious balance of humor and aestheticized gore.[26]
The film was mired in controversy before production began,[27][28][29]due in large part to the legacy of the book's release.[30]Harron has a liking for darker and more controversial topics, such as Valerie Solanas, but it was the satirical nature of the book that "inspired her film about perfunctory violence and obsessive consumption."[31]As Harron began production, the crew had to contend with threats of protest, as the issue of violence in the media became crystallized by theColumbine shootings. Campaigns against the film continued throughout production, theFeminist Majority Foundationcondemning the film as misogynist, and the Canadians Concerned About Violence in Entertainment (C-CAVE) convincing restaurant owners to deny Harron permission to film in their establishments.[32]When returning to work with co-writerGuinevere Turner, Harron felt they were best suited for the job ofAmerican Psychoas they needed no hesitation on feminist values, especially after Turner's successful lesbian filmGo Fish.[8]
Although some criticizedAmerican Psychofor its violence against women, Harron and Turner made conscious decisions that project the female influence on this adaption. Harron's adaptation of this film changes the focus from purely Bateman's perspective to showcase the faces of the women as "the perspective in those murder scenes wasn't through Patrick Bateman but the women."[33]
The Notorious Bettie Page, released in 2005, starredGretchen MolasBettie Page, the 1950s pinup model who became a sexual icon. The film shows Page as the daughter of religious and conservative parents, as well as the fetish symbol who became a target of a Senate investigation of pornography. About the film, Harron said in 2006:
Clearly Bettie is a very inspiring figure to young women because she had a strong independent streak. She did what she wanted to do and she wasn't just doing it for men ... But I think it's a huge mistake to think of her as a conscious feminist heroine. As far as I can see, she didn't have an agenda, ever. She just followed her own path unconsciously. I don't think she thought of herself as a rebel in any way. She was kind of in her own world of dress-up.[34]
Harron later stated that the film suffered from false expectations, in that many male critics and male viewers expected and wanted the film to be "sexy", but that the film instead portrayed "what it's like to be Bettie", and Page herself did not get a "sexual charge" out of her modelling.[35]
The Moth Diaries(2011), Harron's fourth feature film, is another adaption of an American novel, being based onRachel Klein's 2002novel of the same name. The film follows a group of girls living together at Brangwyn, a boarding school. A new student arrives, Ernessa (Lily Cole) and the girls begin to suspect that she is a vampire. Harron has described the film as a "gothic coming-of-age story"[36]that explores the nuanced friendships of teenage girls as they are repeatedly confronted with the prospect of adulthood.
Harron directed the 2018 independent filmCharlie Says, with a screenplay by Turner, which tells the real-life story of how three ofCharles Manson's female followers (Susan Atkins,Patricia Krenwinkel, andLeslie Van Houten) came to terms with the magnitude of their crimes while incarcerated in the 1970s.Matt Smithplayed Manson in flashbacks. The film had initially been intended for another director, but when that director was no longer available Harron took over. Harron stated that she was fascinated by the psychological aspects of how the women ended up committing murder as a result of both manipulation by Manson and feelings of solidarity with one another.[37]
Dalílandis a 2022 film directed by Harron, from a screenplay by her husbandJohn Walsh. The film, set in the 1970s, follows the marriage between painterSalvador Dalíand his wifeGala Dalí, played byBen KingsleyandBarbara Sukowa.[38]The film was shot inLiverpooland released at the2022 Toronto International Film Festival.[39][40]
In addition to her films, Harron was also the executive producer ofThe Weather Underground, a documentary looking at theWeathermen(political activists and extremists of the 1970s). She has also worked in television, directing episodes ofOz,Six Feet Under,Homicide: Life on the Street,The L WordandBig Love. Working on the episode ofSix Feet Under"The Rainbow of Her Reasons", Harron was brought back together withI Shot Andy Warholactress,Lili Taylor.[18]
Harron has been at times labelled a feminist filmmaker, in part due to her film on lesbian feministValerie Solanas,I Shot Andy Warhol, as well as a lesbian storyline within her 2011 teenage Gothic horror filmThe Moth Diaries(2011).[18]She has consistently denied this label, although she considers herself afeminist. In a 2006 interview, and then again during an interview in 2012,[41]she stated:
I feel that without feminism, I wouldn't be doing this. So I feel very grateful. Without it, God knows what my life would be. I don't make feminist films in the sense that I don't make anything ideological. But I do find that women get my films better. Women and gay men. Maybe because they're less threatened by it, or they see what I'm trying to say better.[42]
She is a member ofFilm Fatales, a women's independent filmmaker collective.
Asked about her Canadian identity in a 2014 interview, Harron stated that she mostly felt "just not American". She stated that, to her, being Canadian meant "You don't think you're at the center of things." She also felt that, unlike American directors, she was not "a moralistic filmmaker. I'm not trying to tell people what to do, and I'm not trying to lead... I'm interested in ambiguity."[35]
Although her films deal with controversial materials, likeAmerican Psycho, in the opinion of director Buffy Childerhose, she does not put emphasis on gore and violence.[31]
Harron lives in New York with her husband, filmmakerJohn C. Walsh, and their two daughters.[43]

She was born out of wedlock and "was loath to speak of her background".[7][8][9]His father, Rahimtulla Harji Bhanji (1914–1968), was born inZanzibar(now part ofTanzania) to a family originating from the Indian city ofJamnagar, ofKhojaGujaratidescent.[10][11]Kingsley's paternal grandfather, Harji Bhanji, was a successfulspice traderwho had moved from India to theSultanate of Zanzibar, where Kingsley's father lived until moving to the United Kingdom at the age of 14.[12][13][14]Kingsley's maternal grandfather was believed by the family to have been of Russian- or German-Jewish descent, while his maternal grandmother was English and worked in the garment district ofLondon's East End.[15]Kingsley stated in 1994, "I'm not Jewish, and though there might be some Russian-Jewish heritage way back on my mother's side, the thread is so fine there's no real evidence."[16]In a 2016 interview, he indicated that his maternal grandmother was impregnated by a Russian-Jewish immigrant who later abandoned her, which led her to become a "vile anti-Semite."[17]
Kingsley grew up inPendlebury, Lancashire. Although his father was aGujaratiKhoja who practisedIsma'ili Shia Islam, Kingsley was not raised in his father's faith, and identifies as aQuaker.[18][17]He was educated at theManchester Grammar School, where one of his classmates was actorRobert Powell.[19]Kingsley went on to study atDe La Salle CollegeinSalford, which later became home to The Ben Kingsley Theatre. While at college, he became involved in amateur dramatics inManchester, making his professional stage debut on graduation, aged 23.
After graduating, in 1966, Kingsley was approached by music producer and managerDick James. James, who was the publisher ofThe Beatles, offered to mould Kingsley into a pop star.

In the 1960s, Kingsley changed his name to Ben Kingsley, fearing that a foreign name would hamper his career.[22][23]He told theRadio Times, "As soon as I changed my name, I got the jobs. I had one audition as Krishna Bhanji and they said, 'Beautiful audition but we don't quite know how to place you in our forthcoming season.' I changed my name, crossed the road, and they said when can you start?"[24]In 1971 Kingsley made hisBroadwaydebut playing Demetrius in the revival ofWilliam Shakespeare'sA Midsummer Night's Dreamacting withPatrick Stewart,Frances de la TourandMartin Best.[25]He played Mosca inPeter Hall's 1977 production of Ben Jonson'sVolponefor theRoyal National Theatre.

The film was a critical and financial success with film criticRoger EbertofThe Chicago Sun-Timespraising the casting of Kingsley in the lead role writing, "makes the role so completely his own that there is a genuine feeling that the spirit of Gandhi is on the screen. Kingsley's performance is powerful without being loud or histrionic; he is almost always quiet, observant, and soft-spoken on the screen, and yet his performance comes across with such might that we realize, afterward, that the sheer moral force of Gandhi must have been behind the words."[28]Kingsley went on to win numerous accolades for his performance including theAcademy Award for Best Actor, theBAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Dramafor his performance.[22]The following year he acted in the British drama filmBetrayal(1983), an adaptation of the1978 play of the same titlebyHarold Pinter.

The film was based on the1975 novel of the same titleand was adapted for the screen byHarold Pinter. Sheila Benson ofThe Los Angeles Timespraised their performances writing, "No filmic cliches, no swelling musical score; these are no "littul peeple" who melt into each other's arms, but blessedly real people, who get exhausted and don't talk all the time."[31]He acted in theMerchant-Ivorycostume dramaMaurice(1987). The film was adapted from the1971 novel of the same titlebyE. M. Forster. Kingsley acted alongsideHugh Grant,Rupert Graves,Simon Callow, andDenholm Elliott.[32]He played the Russian composerDmitri ShostakovichinTestimony, and the main character of Basil Pascali inPascali's Island(1988), and went on to portrayDr. John WatsonalongsideMichael Caine'sSherlock HolmesinWithout a Cluethat year.

The film was a critical and commercial success, and Kingsley received a nomination forBAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Todd McCarthy ofVarietywrote of his performance, "Kingsley must act within much more rigid constraints as his trusted accountant Stern, a man who feels he must never make a misstep. Role is reminiscent ofAlec Guinness' deluded Col. Nicholson inThe Bridge on the River Kwai; in his compulsion to do a perfect job for Schindler, he often seems to forget that he's working for the enemy."[33]Further roles include theBBCadaptation ofSilas Marner(1985) as the titular character. Kingsley starred alongsideSigourney WeaverinRoman Polanski'sDeath and the Maiden(1994), having previously acted with her inDave.

In 1998, he was the head of the jury at the48th Berlin International Film Festivaland starred in the family filmSpooky House, saying he had chosen a role in a lighter film after acting in roles that left him feeling traumatised.[35][36]
Kingsley took on the role of Don Logan, a violent psychopath and recruiter for London's underworld, inJonathan Glazer'sSexy Beast(2000), apsychologicalblack comedycrime filmacting withRay WinstoneandIan McShane.[37]CriticPeter BradshawofThe Guardianpraised his performance writing, "The role of Don Logan is perfectly suited to Ben Kingsley's gifts for control and stillness. There is something a little baroque and stylised about his approach – it is arguably a little actorly and unlike the behaviour of any real villain. But it is a very funny, intelligent performance nonetheless, beautifully scripted and acted, and Kingsley tops it off with a bravura show of pure sociopathic cunning".[38]Kingsley's role as Logan earned him another Academy Award nomination forBest Supporting Actor. A year later, he won aCrystal Globeaward for having an outstanding artistic contribution toworld cinemaat theKarlovy Vary International Film Festival.[39]In 2003 he portrayed Colonel Massoud Amir Behrani in theVadim PerelmandirectedHouse of Sand and Fogacting oppositeJennifer ConnellyandShohreh Aghdashloo. Critic Owen Gleiberman ofEntertainment Weeklywrote of his performance, "Kingsley, carrying his body like armor, sculpting each line into a bitter dart of pride, plays fierceness with a powerful tug of sorrow."[40]For his role he earned nominations for theAcademy Award,Golden Globe Award, andIndependent Spirit Awardfor Best Actor.[41][42]The following year he played a supporting role as Benjamin O'Ryan in the psychological thrillerSuspect Zero(2004). Although the film received negative reviews from critics, reservations were made for Kingsley's performance.

Kingsley plays himself in the episode asChrisandLittle Carminepitch him the role of a mob boss in the filmCleaver, which he turns down. In 2007, Kingsley appeared as aPolish Americanmobster in theMafia comedyYou Kill Me, and a hitman inWar, Inc.The following year he acted in the romantic dramaElegy(2008) directed byIsabel Coixet. He starred alongsidePenélope Cruz,Peter Sarsgaard,Patricia Clarkson, andDennis Hopper.[44]CriticRoger Ebertwrote of the film and his performance, "Ben Kingsley, who can play just about any role, seems to be especially effective playing slimy intellectuals. "Elegy" is a film that could have been made for him, although by the time it's over, Penélope Cruz has slipped away with it, and transformed Kingsley's character in the process. It's nicely done."[45]Kingsley received a nomination for theLondon Film Critics Circle Awardfor Best British Actor of the Year.[46]
The years 2010 and 2011 contained several big roles for Kingsley. In 2010, he worked voicing a character named Sabine in theLionhead StudiosgameFable IIIand starred alongsideLeonardo DiCaprioinShutter Island(2010), directed byMartin Scorsese.

Pejić was born inTuzla,Yugoslavia(now part ofBosnia and Herzegovina), and has one older brother, Igor. Her mother, Jadranka Savić,[8]is aSerb, and her father, Vlado Pejić, is aBosnian Croat. The couple divorced shortly after Pejić's birth. During theBosnian War, the siblings fled toSerbiawith their mother and grandmother, settling in a refugee camp nearBelgrade. After the refugee camp, the family settled in theVojskavillage nearSvilajnac.[9]
Following the1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Pejić's mother felt unsafe and decided to initiate the process of immigration to Australia. In 2000, the family moved toMelbourne, Victoria, Australia, aspolitical refugeeswhen she was eight years old.[10][3]
While attending high school atUniversity High, Pejić was described as being "academically brilliant".[11]
Pejić was scouted as a model just before her 17th birthday while working atMcDonald's,[12]though she has also said in an interview that she was scouted at a swimming pool while still in high school in Melbourne.[13]
Pejić was initially notable for modelling both masculine and feminine clothing. In the Paris fashion shows of January 2011, Pejić walked both the men's and women's shows forJean-Paul Gaultierand the men's shows forMarc Jacobs. In May 2011, her magazine cover for the New York-based magazineDossier Journal—in which Pejić, with long blond locks in curlers, is pictured taking off a white shirt —was ruled too risqué by US bookstoresBarnes & NobleandBorders, which covered the image with an opaque sleeve.[14]Concerns were expressed that customers would read Pejić, who at the time was presenting as gender fluid, as a topless woman.[15]
At theStylenitein July 2011, Pejić appeared on the catwalk both in masculine and feminine clothes fromMichalsky.[16]The following year, she modeled bridal creations by Spanish designer Rosa Clara at Barcelona's Bridal Week 2013.[17]

Pejić made her major film debut in the 2018 crime thriller filmThe Girl in the Spider's Weband has since gone on to act in multiple short films and features,[28]most notably playing the supporting role of Nino in the 2022 filmThe Other Me. After shootingThe Other Me, Pejić spent six months working as a waitress. Pejić shared withGamerantMagazine, "I just got a job as a waitress, and I was working in this restaurant called El Nido in Santa Fe. I just wanted to ground myself a little bit and explore human beings. Since 18, I was working as a model and traveling the world and I was like, this is a good opportunity to do something normal."[29]
In 2022 Pejić appeared as French singer and artistAmanda Lear, in the biographical filmDalíland, based on the later life ofsurrealistartistSalvador Dalí.
In a 2022 interview Pejić gave an update on her forthcomingautobiographicaldocumentary:[30]"I'm trying to finish my documentary, which I've been filming over the past seven years, and I've decided to take control of it and tell my own story and direct it myself. I've always felt, from the beginning of my career, the media didn't really understand me and interviews made me quite uncomfortable. Things have progressed a lot more in, say, the past five years, in terms of how we approach gender."[29]
In late 2013, Pejić underwentsex reassignment surgery. In September 2014, Pejić announced plans on the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform to create a film about her reassignment surgery and life as a woman.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
