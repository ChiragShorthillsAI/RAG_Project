Ideas for a thirdTrollsfilm began prior to the release ofTrolls World Tourin April 2020, when Timberlake expressed interest in participating during hisApple Musictakeover. DreamWorks Animation officially confirmed the third film's development in November 2021.  Despite being predominantly CGI animation, with some additional animation byDNEG, the film includes some 2D animation sequences with animation styles inspired byYellow Submarine(1968) andFantasia(1940).Theodore Shapiroreturned to compose the score for the film.
Trolls Band Togetherwas theatrically released in Denmark on October 12, 2023, and in the United States on November 17. The film grossed $209 million worldwide and received mostly positive reviews from critics.
In a flashback, an infant Branch and his four older brothers John Dory, Spruce, Clay, and Floyd perform as aboybandcalled BroZone. When they failed to perform the "Perfect Family Harmony", a powerful ability that Trolls can achieve when they are in complete sync, the brothers argue and go their separate ways. Branch is left alone to be raised by his grandmother Rosiepuff.
In the present, Branch and Poppy attend Bridget and Gristle's wedding in Bergen Town. They are interrupted by John Dory, who reveals that Branch's closest brother Floyd has been captured by Velvet and Veneer, two Mount Rageon teenagers who wish to be pop stars. The siblings have trapped Floyd in a diamond perfume bottle, which they use to extract his essence and improve their singing, although the process could eventually kill him. As the Perfect Family Harmony is the only thing that can destroy diamond, Branch reluctantly agrees to help John Dory find their brothers and rescue Floyd. Along with Poppy and Tiny Diamond, they set out in John Dory's armadillo-like portable van named Rhonda.
They find Spruce at the Vacay Island resort, where he has changed his name to Bruce and started a family. Bruce is reluctant to help, until his wife and kids convince him to do so. The group later finds Clay at an abandoned Bergen miniature golf course, inhabited by a hidden colony of Pop Trolls who do not know that the Bergens are no longer their enemies, having been separated from the other Pop Trolls when they fled the final Trollstice.[a]They also meet the colony's leader, Viva, who reveals herself to be Poppy's long-lost sister. At first, Poppy is delighted, but the visit turns sour when Viva refuses to believe the Bergens have changed, and tries to stop Poppy's group from leaving the golf course. They manage to escape thanks to Clay, who has agreed to help, and Poppy and Viva sadly part.
Meanwhile, Velvet and Veneer continue to strip Floyd of his essence, and Velvet reveals that she forged Floyd's handwriting and sent a letter to John Dory, in order to bait Floyd's brothers to come and rescue him. Furthermore, the siblings' assistant Crimp invents shoulder-pad suits that enhance the extraction, which they plan to use when they capture all of BroZone.
The Trolls almost made it to Mount Rageous, but once again argue and fail to perform the Perfect Family Harmony. When his brothers decide they will split up again after saving Floyd, Branch scolds them for still treating him like a baby, revealing to them that he lived his whole life alone after their grandmother got eaten. Poppy and Tiny help Branch make it to Mount Rageous and locate Floyd on their own, but Velvet and Veneer capture John Dory, Clay, and Bruce, making a rescue even more difficult. Branch and Poppy confront Velvet and Veneer when they start mingling with their fans, prompting them to drive away in their luxury vehicle. During the ensuing chase, Velvet and Veneer begin using the shoulder-pads to extract the essence from Branch's brothers in order to put on a show. Branch and Poppy are soon helped by Viva, who joined forces with Bridget and Gristle after they stumbled onto the golf course during theirhoneymoon. The three rescue Branch's brothers, except for Floyd.
Seeing that Floyd is just about out of essence, Branch tells his brothers that they all simply need to be in harmony. They, along with Poppy and Viva, perform thePerfect Family Harmonyand break free of their prisons just as Floyd loses the last of his essence, killing him, but he is quickly revived. Veneer, who had been second-guessing Velvet's machinations, publicly confesses everything, and the siblings are sent to prison as Branch and Poppy kiss.
The Trolls return to Vacay Island and witness BroZone's comeback concert, joined by Kismet, another band Branch was once part of.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
