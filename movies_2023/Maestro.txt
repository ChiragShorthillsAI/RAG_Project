Plans for a Leonard Bernstein biopic began in 2008, but languished indevelopment hellfor nearly a decade atParamount Pictures. At various points both Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg were attached to direct, but both eventually dropped out but remained on the project as producers. Cooper, who had already signed on to star in 2017, was then named as director following an early screening of hisdirectorial debutA Star Is Born(2018), and he rewrote Singer's original script. The rest of the cast joined between 2020 and 2023, and filming took place between May and October 2022, inLos Angeles,Massachusetts, Bernstein's home inConnecticut, and England.
Maestropremiered at the80th Venice International Film Festivalon September 2, 2023, where it was nominated for theGolden Lion. The film received alimited theatrical releaseon November 22, 2023, before being released onNetflixon December 20. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise given to the direction and the performances, especially those of Cooper and Mulligan, but criticism to the writing and presentation. The film was named one of the top 10 of 2023 by theNational Board of Reviewand theAmerican Film Institute.[5][6]It received sevenAcademy Awardnominations, includingBest Picture,Best Actor(Cooper), andBest Actress(Mulligan), as well as nominations for sevenBAFTA Awards, fourGolden Globe Awards, and twoScreen Actors Guild Awards.
In 1987,Leonard Bernstein, at the age of nearly 70, plays a sequence on a piano from his operaA Quiet Placewhile being interviewed in his home.[7]After he finishes, he shares brief details regarding the significant impact left on him byFelicia, his wife of many years, and mentions seeing her ghost.
In 1943, Leonard—then the 25-year-old assistant conductor of theNew York Philharmonic—makes his conducting debut at short notice when guest conductorBruno Walterfalls ill. His exceptional performance receives a rapturous reception from the audience and catapults him to fame. Despite being in an intermittent relationship with clarinetistDavid Oppenheim, he falls for aspiring actress Felicia Montealegre at a party and the two begin dating. He breaks up with David, who is heartbroken but reluctantly accepts Leonard's choice. Leonard and Felicia ultimately marry and have three children: Jamie, Alexander, and Nina. Throughout their marriage, they are seen supporting each other in their careers.
By the mid-1950s, the Bernsteins live a highly affluent life in the public eye, with Leonard having composed several successful operas andBroadwaymusicals, includingCandideandWest Side Story. Felicia combats concerns raised about Leonard's affairs with men, insistent that she holds rein over him as his wife. As the years pass, however, Leonard's dalliances—as well as his alcohol and substance abuse—take a deep toll on their marriage. These issues are compounded when Jamie hears whispers of her father's infidelity. Leonard attempts to deny the rumors as fueled by "jealousies".
OneThanksgiving, after Leonard returns home to their apartment inThe Dakotalate from a bender, he and Felicia have an explosive argument where she insists that he has hate in his heart, and will "die a lonely old queen" if he continues on his current path.[8]Despite the breakdown of their relationship, the couple remains married through Leonard's composition ofMassin 1971. In 1973, Leonard conductsMahler'sResurrection Symphonywith theLondon Symphony Orchestrain a legendary performance atEly Cathedral, England. Amidst the uproarious reception, Felicia reconciles with Leonard, insistent that "there's no hate in [his] heart".
Felicia is diagnosed with breast cancer which has metastasized to the lung; despite surgeries and an aggressive chemotherapy regimen, her condition deteriorates, and she dies in Leonard's arms in 1978. Overcome with grief, Leonard and the children abandon their lavish home shortly afterward. Leonard is shown once again in 1987, teaching the art of conducting and still partying, as well as having affairs with his much younger male students. Returning to the interview, Leonard admits that he misses Felicia terribly, before his mind flashes back to an image of her, back in their youth, walking into their yard.
In 2008, producersFred BernerandAmy Durning[de]approached the Bernstein family to negotiate Leonard Bernstein's life and music rights. Once retaining rights, Berner and Durning approachedJosh Singerto develop and write a screenplay and attachedMartin Scorseseas a director. The project went into development atParamount Pictures.[9]
In 2017, Scorsese stepped down as director to work onThe Irishman. Briefly, Steven Spielberg considered directing the film and approached Bradley Cooper to star. When Spielberg decided not to direct the film, Cooper said he wanted to "throw his hat in the ring" as a possible director. In May 2018 Cooper was firmly attached as both director and to star as Bernstein, after Spielberg saw a pre-release screening ofA Star Is Born.[10]Berner, Durning, and Scorsese continued on as producers alongside Spielberg andKristie Macosko KriegerofAmblin Entertainment. In January 2020, the project was moved toNetflix.[11]

Those pieces were performed by theLondon Symphony Orchestrawith a few choral performances by theLondon Symphony Chorus, conducted byYannick Nézet-Séguinwho also served as Cooper's conducting coach. The soundtrack was preceded with an excerpt from the finale ofMahler's Symphony No. 2"Resurrection" as a single on October 20. The full soundtrack was released byDeutsche Grammophondigitally on November 10 and was released physically on December 1.[26]The music played by Bernstein at the piano during the prologue comes from his 1983 operaA Quiet Placewhich depicts a dysfunctional family, including an estranged gay son whose mother has just died.[7]
Maestropremiered at the80th Venice International Film Festivalon September 2, 2023, where it was nominated for theGolden Lion.[27]It received a gala screening as part of theNew York Film Festival's spotlight program on October 2, 2023, making it the first film to hold a premiere at the newDavid Geffen Hall.

Although Netflix does not publicly report box office grosses,IndieWireestimated the film made about $200,000 from eight theaters in its opening weekend (and a total of $300,000 over the five-dayThanksgivingframe), which would make it the most successful debut for the company since at least 2019.[34]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 78% of 330 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "Led by a pair of powerful performances,Maestroserves as a stirring overview of a tremendous talent's life and legacy."[35]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 77 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[36]
The performances and Cooper's direction received praise, withBBC Culture's Nicholas Barber complimenting Cooper's "technical virtuosity" and ability to "fulfill [his] ambitions with flair",[37]and David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterlauding the film's depiction of marriage and describing Mulligan's role as "heartbreaking".[38]Adam Graham ofDetroit Newswrote, "Maestrocomes alive as Cooper filters Bernstein's passion for life and all its grand indulgences into an intensely physical performance, which peaks in a sweat-drenched conducting sequence that bursts off the screen."[39]
Conversely,Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkercriticized the film for disregarding parts of Bernstein's life, writing that "The movie's general lack of candor matches its scrupulous avoidance of controversy and complexity, which does no justice to the complex and controversial characters at the center of the film."[40]
In a review forEl País,Carlos Boyerowrote: "Cooper whimsically uses color and black and white to portray his life, and exotic planning to recount Bernstein’s present and past. And in the way he describes him, I fail to figure out where his appeal and genius lies. I’m getting confused. I just don’t like him, I don’t care about him, I’m not bothered about his achievements and his failures."[41]while laLa Repubblicacalled the film "a non-conventional biopic, part musical, part melodrama".[42]
FilmmakersA. V. Rockwell,Chloe Domont,Chad Hartigan,Don Hertzfeldt,Laurel ParmetandPaul Schraderall cited it as among their favorite films of 2023.[43]
Cooper's use of a largeprosthetic noseto portray Bernstein, who was Jewish, was criticized by some as an example of "Jewface", following the release of photographs from the set of the film in May 2023 and the subsequent release of the trailer in August.[44]The chief television critic ofThe Hollywood Reporter, Daniel Fienberg, criticized the casting of Cooper in a Twitter post, along with the British gentile Mulligan as a Costa Rican-Chilean converted Jew, as "a LOT of ethniccosplayfor one movie".[45]English Jewish actressTracy-Ann Obermanwrote that if Cooper "can't [play the role] through the power of acting alone then don't cast him – get a Jewish actor". She felt that as Cooper had portrayedJoseph Merrick, a 19th-century British man who had severe facial deformities, without prosthetics, "then he should be able to manage to play a Jewish man without one".[44]
Bernstein's children defended Cooper's use of prosthetic makeup to portray him, stating that they worked with Cooper throughout the filmmaking process and that their "dad would have been fine with it".[46]TheAnti-Defamation Leaguenoted historical media portrayal of Jews as "evil caricatures with large, hooked noses" but said that "this film, which is a biopic, ... is not that".[47]In September 2023,Kazu Hiro, who created the prosthetic, said that he was surprised by the criticism but was "sorry if [he] hurt some people's feelings". He added that "our only intention" was to portray Bernstein "as authentically as possible".[48]
The New Yorkerpublished an essay defending the special effects make-up used by Hiro in the film and numbered him as among the top three or four special effects make-up artists of the past fifty years stating the film's background intentions as: "In the beginning, Hiro worked on a prosthetic treatment that was, in Cooper's words, 'totally Lenny'. But Cooper felt that it didn't look real. 'We wanted to find a medium between Lenny and me', he explained, 'so we created this hybrid.' The most difficult years for Hiro to re-create were Bernstein's final ones. Even late in life, Bernstein was flirtatious. Cooper felt that the seventy-something Bernstein still needed to look a bit 'sexy'."[49]
With this film, co-producerSteven Spielbergextended his record for the mostBest Picturenominations for an individual to 13.[50]Bradley Cooper, who became the fifteenth person to direct himself to aBest Actornomination forA Star Is Born(2018), has now become the fifth person to have done so more than once.[51]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
