Aardman Animations Limitedis a Britishanimation studiobased inBristol. It is known for films and television series made usingstop motionandclay animationtechniques, particularly those featuring itsplasticinecharacters fromWallace & Gromit,Chicken Run,Shaun the Sheep, andMorph. After some experimental computer-animated short films during the late 1990s, beginning withOwzat(1997), Aardman entered thecomputer animationmarket withFlushed Away(2006). As of February 2020, it had earned $1.1 billion worldwide, with an average $135.6 million per film.[2]Between 2000 and 2006, Aardman partnered withDreamWorks Animation.
Aardman's films have been consistently well received, and their stop-motion films are among the highest-grossing produced, with their 2000 debut,Chicken Run, being their top-grossing film,[3]as well as thehighest-grossing stop-motion film of all time.[4]A sequel,Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, was released in 2023.[5]
Aardman was founded in 1972 as a low-budget project byPeter LordandDavid Sproxton, who wanted to realise their dream of producing an animated motion picture. The partnership provided animated sequences for theBBCseries for deaf childrenVision On. The company name originates from the name of their nerdish Superman character in that series.[7]The process of using clay animation to produce a segment called "Gleebees" (1975) became the inspiration for creatingMorph, a simple clay character. Around the same time, Lord and Sproxton made their first foray into adult animation with the shortsDown and OutandConfessions of a Foyer Girl, entries in the BBC'sAnimated Conversationsseries using real-life conversations as soundtracks.
Aardman also created the title sequence forThe Great Egg Race[8]and supplied animation for the multiple award-winning music video ofPeter Gabriel's song "Sledgehammer".[9]They produced the music video for the song "My Baby Just Cares For Me" byNina Simonein 1987. Also in the 1980s, they created the trombone-playing character "Douglas" in a television commercial forLurpakbutter.[10][11]
Later Aardman produced a number of shorts forChannel 4, including theConversation Piecesseries. These five shorts worked in the same area as theAnimated Conversationspieces, but were more sophisticated. Lord and Sproxton began hiring more animators at this point; three of the newcomers made their directorial debut at Aardman with theLip Synchseries. Of the fiveLip Synchshorts, two were directed by Lord, one byBarry Purves, one byRichard Goleszowskiand one byNick Park.
In 1990, Park's short,Creature Comforts, was the first Aardman production to win anAcademy Award. Park also developed the clay modelled shorts featuring the adventures ofWallace & Gromit, a comical pair of friends: Wallace being a naive English inventor with a love of cheese, and Gromit his best friend, the intelligent but silent dog. These films includeA Grand Day Out(1989),The Wrong Trousers(1993) andA Close Shave(1995), the latter two winningAcademy Awards.[12][13]
In December 1997, Aardman,DreamWorks(laterDreamWorks Animation) andPathéannounced that their companies were teaming up to co-finance and distributeChicken Run, Aardman's first feature film, which had already been in pre-production for a year.[14]On 27 October 1999, Aardman and DreamWorks signed a $250 million[15]deal to make an additional four films that were estimated to be completed during the next 12 years.[16]Along with the deal their first project was announced, titledThe Tortoise and the Hare. Intended to be based onAesop's fable and directed byRichard Goleszowski,[17]it was paused two years later because of script problems.[18]On 23 June 2000,Chicken Runwas released to a great critical and financial success. In 2005, after ten years of absence, Wallace and Gromit returned inAcademy Award-winningThe Curse of the Were-Rabbit. The following yearFlushed Away, Aardman's first computer-animated feature, was released.
On 10 October 2005, a serious fire at a storage facility used by Aardman and other Bristol-based companies destroyed over 30 years ofprops, models, and scenery often built by the Bristol-basedCod Steaks. This warehouse was used for storage of past projects and so did not prevent the production of their current projects at the time. In addition, the company's library of finished films was stored elsewhere and was undamaged. An electrical fault was determined to be the cause of the blaze.[19]Referring to the2005 Kashmir earthquake, Park was quoted as saying, "Even though it is a precious and nostalgic collection and valuable to the company, in light of other tragedies, today isn't a big deal."[20][21][22]
On 1 October 2006, right before the release ofFlushed Away,The New York Timesreported that due to creative differences,DreamWorks Animationand Aardman had decided to end their contract.[23]The deal was officially terminated on 30 January 2007.[24]According to an Aardman spokesperson: "The business model of DreamWorks no longer suits Aardman and vice versa. But the split couldn't have been more amicable."[24]Unofficial reasons for departure were weak performances of the last two movies, for which DreamWorks had to take writedowns,[24]and citing the article, "Aardman executives chafed at the creative control DreamWorks tried to exert, particularly withFlushed Away..."[23]The studio had another film in development,Crood Awakening(eventuallyThe Croods), which had been announced in 2005, withJohn Cleeseco-writing the screenplay.[25]With the end of the partnership, the film's rights reverted to DreamWorks.[24]
From 2006 to 2007, theGhibli MuseuminMitaka, Tokyo, Japan, had an exhibit featuring the works of Aardman Studios. Sproxton and Lord visited the exhibit in May 2006 and met with animatorHayao Miyazakiduring the visit.[26]Miyazaki has long been a fan of Aardman Animations' works.[27]
In April 2007, Aardman signed[28]and in 2010 renewed[29]a three-year deal withSony Picturesto finance, co-produce and distribute feature films. The next year, Aardman released a newWallace and Gromitshort film calledA Matter of Loaf and Death. The first film made in partnership with Sony was the computer-animatedArthur Christmas(2011), Aardman's first3Dfeature film. 2012 saw the release ofThe Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!(known internationally in America asThe Pirates! Band of Misfits), Aardman's first 3D stop-motion film and Lord's first film as a director sinceChicken Run. Two additional films were announced in June 2007:The Cat Burglars, a stop-motion animated heist comedy film directed bySteve Box, about cat burglars that steal milk and their plans to pull off 'the great milk float robbery'; and an untitledNick Parkproject (which would later becomeEarly Man).[30]
The studio is also known to provide generous resources and training to young animators by providing awards at various animation festivals. For example, The Aardman Award at the UK'sAnimexFestival in Teesside provides story consultation to a promising young animator for their next film.[31]
In 2008, Aardman joined withChannel 4and Lupus Films to launch auser-generated contentanimation portal called4mations.[32]They also designed theBBC OneChristmas Idents for that year, which featured Wallace and Gromit to tie in with the showing of the new Wallace and Gromit film calledA Matter of Loaf and Deathon Christmas Day at 8:30pm. In April 2008, Aardman launched the AardmanYouTubechannel, which is a YouTube Partner channel featuring the entireCreature ComfortsTV series, the Morph series,Cracking Contraptionsand clips from the Wallace and Gromit films.[33]From December 2008, Aardman also started posting variousflash gamesonNewgrounds, the majority of which are based onWallace and GromitandShaun the Sheep.[34]
In 2009,Nintendoannounced that Aardman would make twelve short films using onlyFlipnote Studio. The films were posted on Flipnote'sHatenaweb service provider. The first film was calledThe Sandwich Twinsand was released on 16 September 2009. The remaining eleven films were released on a weekly basis until Christmas, and can also be downloaded using Hatena.[35]In the same year, the headquarters of the studio moved into a new building, designed by Alec French architects, in Gas Ferry Road, Bristol, although work needing large-scale sets is still carried out in sheds inAztec WestandBedminster.[36]In April 2009, Aardman Animations edited the existingWatchidentity byUKTVto make the inflatable eyeball (called "Blinky") in the idents blink.
In October 2013, Lord (co-founder of Aardman Animations) created a fundraising project on the crowdfunding siteKickstarter. The campaign has a target of £75,000 which would be used to fund 12 new one-minute episodes of Morph. Lord was hoping to start production in January 2014 using the original stop-frame animation. Backers of the project would receive a variety of rewards, including early access to the new animations and a small box of clay used in the production, depending on the individual's level of funding.[37][38]
In 2015, the studio bought a majority share in New York-based animation studio Nathan Love,[39]announcing the merger with a short film calledIntroducing: Aardman Nathan Loveon 25 September of the same year[40]of that being that the British stop-motion animated seriesDigby Dragondebuted onNick Jr. UKin 2016.

Narrated byJulie Walters, this career retrospective includes commentary by the company's founders and staff, as well as various friends, fans and colleagues includingTerry Gilliam,John Lasseter, andMatt Groening.[41][42]
From 29 June 2017 to 29 October 2017, an exhibition entitled "Wallace and Gromit and Friends" was shown at theAustralian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI)inMelbourne. A report on this exhibition was shown on AustralianABC News Breakfaston Wednesday, 28 June, featuring an eight-minute interview with producers Lord and Sproxton.[43]The exhibition revealed that in Park's very early sketches, Gromit was originally a cat, but Park soon changed him into a dog, since it was generally agreed that a dog was clearly more suitable as a loyal pet/companion than a cat and also because a dog would be easier to make and animate in Plasticine. Embedded in the ABC News article is a video interview with Lord and Sproxton,[44]which gives information not only on Wallace and Gromit, but also Shaun the Sheep and others.
On 9 November 2018, Aardman Animations announced that Lord and Sproxton would be transferring majority ownership of the company to its employees in order to keep the studio independent.[45]In January 2019, Lord and Sproxton released a book detailing the history of the studio, calledA Grand Success!

The factory that made Lewis Newplast, themodelling clayused by Aardman, shut down in March 2023; Aardman purchased enough remaining clay to cover the 2024Wallace and Gromitfilm.[58]The Daily Telegraphinitially reported that the studio may not be able to produce new films afterwards due to a lack of clay, but Aardman later released a statement clarifying that it would find a new supplier.[59][60]

The company name is taken from one of its early characters, a superhero created forVision Onin 1972.[68]Unlike the claymation productions that the company are famous for, Aardman was cel-animated.[69]Peter Lord has stated that the most interesting thing about the company name is that it "means nothing" and is only a joke that two teenagers found funny. He has stated that the name came from a combination of "Aardvark" and "Superman" for the reason that they foundaardvarkto be a particularly funny word. Aardman Animations became their company name when the BBC asked them to whom they should make their first cheque out.[70]Co-founder David Sproxton has claimed that the name was a result of being unable to "find another word with more A's in it than 'aardvark'" as a schoolboy.[71]
A number of Aardman directors have worked at other studios, taking the distinctive Aardman style with them.
Aardman'sSteve Boxdirected the animated music video for theSpice Girls' final single as a five-piece, "Viva Forever". The video took over five months to produce, considerably longer than the group's box office hit movie,Spice World. He is also the co-creator of the Finnish-British animated seriesMoominvalley, based on theMoominsbooks.
Barry Purves, director of the Aardman shortNext, also directedHamilton Mattressfor Harvest Films.

Its sequel,Robbie the Reindeer in Legend of the Lost Tribe, was directed by Peter Peake, whose directorial credits for Aardman includePib and PogandHumdrum.
Aardman alumni also produced many of the claymation shorts used in the 1986–1990 American television seriesPee-wee's Playhouse.[72][73]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
