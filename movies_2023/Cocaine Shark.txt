Cocaine Sharkis a 2023 English-language Japanesehorror filmdirected byMark Polonia. Originally released in Japan under the titleKanizame Shakurabu, it was renamed in order to profit from the release ofCocaine Bear.
A drug lord creates a new drug called HT25, which is derived from sharks kept in a secret laboratory. The extraction of the drug causes unexpected mutations in the sharks, and after an explosion in the laboratory, the mutated sharks are released and begin wreaking havoc.[1]The film features various mutated creatures, none of which are actually sharks on cocaine as the title suggests.[2]
After the announcement of the filmCocaine Bear, which was based on atrue story, users on social media discussed a potential sequel film called "Cocaine Shark" based on a story reporting that cocaine was intercepted in the Pacific Ocean by New Zealand authorities.[1][3]When asked about the  possibility of the film,Elizabeth Banks, the director ofCocaine Bear, expressed interest in directing it.[4][5][6]
Before Elizabeth Banks had an opportunity to create the film, it was created by Mark Polonia. The film debuted on January 29, 2023, in Japan under the titleKanizame Shakurabu, orCrab Shark. The film was rebranded toCocaine Sharkin order to profit from the release ofCocaine Bear.[7][8]In the United States, the film was distributed by Wild Eye Releasing[9]and released on July 7, 2023.[1][3]
Cocaine Sharkwas received negatively by critics. It has been described as "terrible and lazy", with criticism aimed at the plot, camerawork, acting, lighting, and special effects.[10]It has also been criticized as uninteresting, with dialogue taking up far more time than the creatures.[10][11]

Twin brothers and filmmakersMark PoloniaandJohn Polonia(born September 30, 1968) founded Polonia Bros Entertainment and Cinegraphic Productions. Between them they have written, directed and produced over 40 feature films, oftenshot-on-videoand mostly in thehorrorandscience fictiongenres, making themlow-budget  or even no-budget filmcult icons.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
When John Polonia died suddenly at the age of 39 on February 25, 2008,[7]Mark Polonia continued to make films.
The youngest of five siblings, the brothers were interested in and making films from a very early age. Their first commercial release wasSplatter Farm, released on VHS by Donna Michele Productions in 1987,[8]a shot-on-video offering, written, acted, directed and filmed by the teenage brothers and a high school friend.[9]
In 1996 the brothers'alien invasionfilmFeederswas picked up by Blockbuster in the aftermath of the commercial success ofIndependence Day, and became Blockbuster's No. 1 independent-film rental for the year.[10]Starring John Polonia and fellow-B-movie makerJon McBride(Cannibal Campout,Woodchipper Massacre) in their first foray together, this film about an invasion of Earth by small rubbery flesh-eating monsters with no mouths marked the Polonias' first wide distribution and paved the way for future releases – perhaps 20 more of them before John's death in 2008.
Jon McBridebecame a regular collaborator with the brothers.[11][12]The themes approached in their collaborations include killerpiranhas, killerEaster bunnies,haunted houses, trips toMars, assorteddemons,
In 2007 they released a new and improved cut ofSplatter Farm, on DVD through Camp Motion Pictures.[13]The new version is missing a couple of the more outrageous scenes that made the original a 'cult classic'.[14]
Within theindiefilm community, the brothers were known for their kindness and generosity to aspiring film-makers.[15]
Polonia Brothers Entertainment and Cinegraphic Productions releasedHalloweenight, based on a screenplay by, and dedicated to the memory of, the late John Polonia, in October 2009.
According toFilm Threat”Mark Polonia is best known (if he is at all) for his ridiculous, though insanely fun, output such asShark Encounters Of The Third KindandDeadly Playthings. These productions intentionally trade on their low-budget schtick with absurd premises that ask the viewer to laugh and have fun, as the movie is in on the joke."[16]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
