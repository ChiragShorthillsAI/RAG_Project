In December 1970, Paul Hunham is a teacher at Barton Academy, aNew Englandall-maleboarding schoolthat he once attended on scholarship. His students and fellow teachers despise him for his strict grading and stubborn personality. Dr. Woodrup, Barton's headmaster and Hunham's former student, scolds him for costing the academy money by flunking a major donor's son, causingPrinceton Universityto rescind his offer of admission. As punishment, Hunham is forced to supervise five students left on campus during the Christmas holiday break, including Angus Tully, whose mother cancelled a family trip toSaint Kittsto instead honeymoon with her new husband. Also staying behind is cafeteria manager Mary Lamb, whose late son, Curtis, attended Barton and recently died in theVietnam Warafter beingdrafted. Unlike most Barton students, Curtis did not get astudent defermentbecause he could not afford to go to college. To the students' chagrin, Hunham forces them to study and exercise on their break. After six days, a student's wealthy father arrives by helicopter and agrees to take all five students on the family's ski trip with their parents' permission. Angus, unable to reach his parents for permission, is left alone at Barton with Hunham and Mary.
When Hunham catches Angus trying to book a hotel room, the two argue about Hunham's disciplinarian policies. Angus runs through the school halls and defiantly leaps into a pile of gym equipment, dislocating his shoulder. Hunham takes Angus to the hospital. To protect Hunham from blame, Angus lies to the doctors about the circumstances of his injury. At a restaurant, Hunham and Angus encounter Lydia Crane, Woodrup's assistant. Hunham flirts with Lydia, who invites the pair to herChristmas Eveparty. Angus, Hunham, Mary, and Barton's janitor, Danny, attend Lydia's party. There, Angus and Lydia's niece Elise share a kiss, while Hunham discovers that Lydia has a boyfriend. As Mary gets drunk and has an emotional breakdown over Curtis's death, Hunham insists on leaving early; as Hunham and Angus argue, Angus says that his father is dead and Mary scolds Hunham for his unsympathetic behavior.
Feeling remorseful, Hunham arranges a small Christmas celebration. Mary persuades Hunham to grant Angus's wish for a "field trip" toBoston. After dropping off Mary inRoxburyto spend time with her pregnant sister, Angus and Hunham walk through Boston, ice skate and visit theMuseum of Fine Arts. The two encounter a classmate of Hunham's fromHarvard College, who has become a successful academic. Hunham lies about his career, and Angus plays along. Angus learns that Hunham was expelled from Harvard after alegacydonor's son accused him ofplagiarismand Hunham semi-deliberately hit him with a car. Although the incident nearly ruined Hunham's career prospects, the old Barton headmaster took pity on him and offered him an adjunct teaching job.
When Hunham and Angus see a movie at theOrpheum Theatre, Angus sneaks away and Hunham catches him entering a taxi. Angus explains that he wants to see his father, and Hunham agrees to accompany him, assuming that they are going to a cemetery. However, Angus's father is alive and confined in apsychiatric hospital. Following the visit, Angus (who takesmedicationfordepression) expresses concern that his future behavior will echo his father's. Hunham comforts Angus, affirming that Angus is not the same person as his father. Hunham, Angus, Mary and Danny celebrateNew Year's Evetogether.
In January, when school resumes, Hunham is summoned to Woodrup's office; Angus's mother and stepfather are there. They tell Hunham that Angus is not allowed to see his father and that asnowglobeAngus gave to him led to a violent outburst. Angus's mother and stepfather threaten to withdraw Angus from Barton and send him to amilitary academy. However, Hunham defends Angus and blames himself, lying that he persuaded Angus to visit his father. Woodrup allows Angus to remain at Barton but fires Hunham.
Mary, who has come to better terms with Curtis's death, gives Hunham a notebook for themonographhe wants to write. Hunham and Angus share a farewell. In his car, Hunham takes a sip of the expensive cognac he stole from Woodrup's office, spits it out toward the school, and drives away.
The Holdoversis the second collaboration between directorAlexander Payneand actorPaul GiamattiafterSideways(2004). Payne conceived it after watchingMarcel Pagnol's 1935 filmMerlusse,[5]and contacted screenwriterDavid Hemingson, whose boarding-school television pilot he had read.[6]In 2018, Hemingson was running his show,Whiskey Cavalierfor ABC and was surprised to receive a call from Payne. The television pilot,Stonehaven, was set in present time, but Payne suggested a film using an older setting instead like 1958 or 1970. Hemingson agreed on 1970 because it had more in common with the present time and 1958 was too close toDead Poets Society's timeline.[7]In 2024, Hemingson revealed that the film is partiallysemi-autobiographical, with some of the dialogue and scenes taken verbatim from his own life, such as words from his own real-life uncle. The scene with the sex worker was inspired by a real-life incident that he said actually "happened to me on First Avenue and 30th Street with [my uncle] when I was seven years old. This woman walked up on an incredibly cold day and solicited and said, 'The kid can wait around the corner.' That is an actual incident from my life. The cherries jubilee thing is something that happened to me with my mother. So many of the things in the movie are just a love letter to my mom and my uncle and my dad."[8]In June 2021,Miramaxacquired the distribution rights.[9]In early 2022,Da'Vine Joy RandolphandCarrie Prestonjoined the cast.[10][11]
Filming began in Massachusetts on January 27, 2022, and wrapped in late March.[12][13][14]Location manager Kai Quinlan, who had worked on other films set in New England likeSpotlightandBlack Mass, drew on her Massachusetts upbringing for the film.[15]Similarly, Giamatti drew on his experience attendingChoate Rosemary Hallin the 1980s, including his memories of a strict teacher whom he described as "not a happy man."[16]To create the fictional Barton Academy, the film crew shot on location at five real-life Massachusetts schools:Groton School(the chapel and theNashua River),Northfield Mount Hermon School(the chapel and building exteriors),Deerfield Academy(the front lawn and building exteriors),St. Mark's School(the dining hall, gymnasium, and headmaster's office), andFairhaven High School(the study hall and auditorium).[17][18]To play prep school student Angus, Payne cast Deerfield student Dominic Sessa; it was Sessa's first film role.[19]The film crew also shot at the historicSomervilleand Orpheum theatres and on theBoston Common. Payne later said that capturing the 1970s aesthetic was relatively easy because "change comes slowly to New England".[20]
One of the film's plot points involves Paul Hunham’samblyopia(sometimes called lazy eye), one of several health problems the character suffers from. To create the illusion that actor Paul Giamatti had this condition, the makeup and effects artist Cristina Patterson was hired to create special hand-painted soft contact lenses for the actor. Patterson toldVanity Fairwriter Katey Rich that each lens required multiple attempts to get the color correct. Originally, Giamatti was to wear a lens only in his left eye, but after filming began, director Alexander Payne decided that he wanted to be able to create the effect in either of Giamatti's eyes so that the character's condition would be apparent with a variety of camera angles and shots. Rich reported that Payne "wanted to keep the audience guessing about which eye was the 'right' one, just as Angus Tully does." When Giamatti was wearing one of the lenses, he was unable to see out of the eye wearing the lens. Giamatti told Vanity Fair that "adjusting to the ways the lens limited me physically gave me a lot to work with imaginatively that I can’t even articulate. And I suppose the eye is one factor among several that makes Paul Hunham feel like he’s kind of an outsider."[21]
To make the film look and feel like it was actually made during the 1970s, Alexander Payne hiredEigil Bryldto serve as cinematographer and camera operator. On being selected, Bryld remarked, "There's a sense of a spirit of the '70s movies — breaking away from your studios. And all the DPs of the period that I really admired would push the film stock or they would do handheld or whatever. And then I started thinking, 'That's really what I should be going for.'" Both digital and film formats were tested prior to filming, before it was decided to shoot the film digitally with anArri AlexawithPanavisionH series lenses, particularly a 55mm lens, creating a "vintage portrait look." "It's a movie about people who are forced into the frame together, and they don't necessarily want to be in the same frame," Bryld added. "Gradually over time, they come together more and more ... And that was one arc we were looking for — how we would reflect that, how we framed it and where we put the camera."Film emulsion[further explanation needed]andcolor gradingwere added to the footage during post-production to complete the look.[22]
The crew added to the film's 1970s stylization by creating a retro-style title card and logo variants forFocus Featuresand Miramax to open the film. Graphic designer Nate Carlson, who worked with Payne onElection(1999), was responsible for creating these, using the film's color palette from the set designs and visual style, as well as inspiration from the way film studio logos looked in the 1970s, to make them look as authentic and true to the time period as possible. Although the film's international prints (distributed byUniversal Pictures) could simply use the 1963 Universal logo to open the film, neither Focus Features nor Miramax (the American distributor and production company) existed in the 1970s, so Carlson had to invent an original symbol for Focus Features (that involved lowercase "ff" initials with animated text moving into place on a red background) and a looped zoom-in animation for Miramax. Film emulsion was then added to make the logos look realistic for the time period. Miramax was so enthusiastic about Carlson's take on their logo that it hired him to design the studio's new permanent logo for their future films, debuting withOperation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre(2023) andThe Beekeeper(2024). For the film's title card, Carlson kept things simple, using a custom font of his own design while staying in line with Payne's vision. He also designed the crest for Barton Academy and created two versions, one dating back to the 1800s to reflect its history and a modern, updated version.[23]
Original music forThe Holdoverswas composed byMark Orton.Peter Krasinskiwas the Choral Music Arranger,Organistproviding on-screen music ten minutes into the movie, and Off-Screen Music Advisor, in addition to his on-screen role as the Choir Leader directing singers in "O Little Town of Bethlehem" and whose voice opens the movie.[24]The soundtrack also features several classicChristmas songs, and other songs from the 1970s byThe Allman Brothers Band,Tony Orlando and Dawn,Labi Siffre,Badfinger,Shocking Blue,Damien Jurado,Herb Alpert,Gene Autry,Temptations,Chet Baker,Artie Shaw, andCat Stevens. A piece used in the score is by the bandKhruangbin. The soundtrack was released digitally byBack Lot Musicon November 10, 2023, and on compact disc andvinylon November 17.[25]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 97% of 360 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Beautifully bittersweet,The Holdoversmarks a satisfying return to form for director Alexander Payne."[43]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 82 out of 100, based on 61 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[44]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled byPostTrakgave it an 80% overall positive score.[41]
Wesley MorrisofThe New York Timespraised Giamatti's performance and Payne's direction, writing: "Even as the story accrues the heft of personal tragedy, each scene seems to float or bob."[45]Patrick Ryan, writing forUSA Today, compared it toFrank Capra'sIt's a Wonderful Life, noting that both films grapple with troubled pasts and shattered dreams at Christmastime.[46]Critics have also compared it to the films ofHal Ashby, such asHarold and MaudeandThe Last Detail.[47][48]
Reviews inThe Boston GlobeandBoston.comboth praised the film's 1970s New England setting.[48][49]Ann HornadayofThe Washington Postwrote that it "doesn't only have the look and feel of that time period, it resuscitates the finest elements of its narrative traditions".[50]Richard Brody, writing forThe New Yorker, describedThe Holdoversas "a pile of clichés", but one realized "with such loving immediacy that it feels as if Payne were discovering them for himself". Brody was more critical of the time period, arguing that the "hermetically sealed, historically reduced drama" ignored the politically fraught setting of the 1970s.[51]Nonetheless, Michael Schulman, another writer forThe New Yorker, included Giamatti, Sessa and Randolph in his list of the year's best performances, and considered the last "in a prime position for theBest Supporting Actressrace".[52]
Justin Changof theLos Angeles Timespraised the film's "enveloping sense of time and place", but as a whole, criticized it as "a flat, phony, painfully diagrammatic movie masquerading as a compassionate, humane one". Chang also wrote that Mary Lamb, despite Randolph's affecting performance, was "somehow the movie's most under-developed role".[47]
FilmmakerJames Graypraised the film, saying: "The film takes place in 1970, the first year of American history's greatest hangover. And the rhythms and look, precisely rendered, lend a bracing authenticity to the proceedings. More important, the movie recalls vividly both that era's glorious dreams and the stinging cost of idealism. These lonely souls may seem doomed, but they're still trying. And though bearing witness may not always be pretty, it is beautiful. So isThe Holdovers."[53]Other filmmakers, includingJoe Dante,Robert Eggers,Matt Johnson,Raine Allen-MillerandRachel Morrisonand even former U.S. PresidentBarack Obama, also cited it as among their favorite films of 2023.[54]
In March 2024,Varietyreported that screenwriterSimon Stephensonhad lodged a complaint with theWriters Guild of America, accusing the film's screenplay of plagiarizing an unproduced script he wrote titledFrisco.[2]Stephenson said that Payne had been sent his script on at least two occasions in the 2010s, and accused Hemingson's final script of being "forensically identical" to his, alleging similarities in "story, characters, structure, scenes [and] dialogue" across the "meaningful entirety" of the film.[2]Friscoproducer Tom McNulty questioned Stephenson's claims.[55]
The Holdoverswas nominated in five categories at the96th Academy Awards, includingBest Pictureand with Randolph winning for her performance. The film was named one of the year's top ten Films by theAmerican Film Instituteand theNational Board of Review.[56][57]

Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Miramax, LLC, formerly known asMiramax Films, is an American independentfilmandtelevision productionanddistributioncompany owned bybeIN Media GroupandParamount Global. Based inLos Angeles,California, it was founded on December 19, 1979, by brothersBobandHarvey Weinstein.
It was a leading producer and distributor of independent films until it was acquried byThe Walt Disney Companyon June 30, 1993. In 2010, Disney sold it toFilmyard Holdings, a joint venture ofColony NorthStar,Tutor-Saliba CorporationandQatar Investment Authority.[1][2]In March 2016, the company was sold to thebeIN Media Group, which later sold a 49% stake toParamount Global(previously known as ViacomCBS) on April 3, 2020.
Miramax was founded as Miramax Films by the Weinstein brothers, Bob and Harvey along with executive Corky Burger inBuffalo, New York, in 1979, and was named by combining the first names of their parents, Miriam and Max.[3]It was created to distributeindependent filmsdeemed commercially unfeasible by themajor studios.
The company's first major success came when the Weinsteins teamed up with British producerMartin Lewisand acquired the U.S. rights to two concert films Lewis had produced ofbenefit showsforhuman rightsorganizationAmnesty International. The Weinsteins worked with Lewis to distill the two films into one film for the American marketplace. The resulting film, the American version ofThe Secret Policeman's Other Ball, was a successful release for Miramax in the summer of 1982. This release presaged amodus operandithat the company would undertake later in the 1980s of acquiring films from international filmmakers and reworking them to suit American sensibilities and audiences. In its early years, Miramax Films had to focus primarily as a catalyst for music and decided to do a licensing agreement withThorn EMI Videoto release several of Miramax's early films.[4]
Among the company's other breakthrough films as distributors in the late 1980s and early 1990s werePulp Fiction,Scandal,Sex, Lies, and Videotape,Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!,The Crying Game,andClerks. The company also made films such asFlirting with Disaster,Heavenly Creatures, andShakespeare in Love.
Miramax Films acquired and/or produced many other films that did well financially. The company became one of the leaders of the independent film boom of the 1990s. Miramax Films produced or distributed seven films with box office grosses totaling more than $100 million; its highest grossing title,Chicago, earned more than $300 million worldwide.[5]
The company was also successful in securingAcademy Awardnominations for its releases, many of which resulted inOscarwins.
On June 30, 1993,The Walt Disney Companypurchased Miramax Films for $60 million and assumed all of the company's debt, which was more than $40 million. The acquisition gave Disney entry to the independent film market.[6]Harvey and Bob Weinstein continued to operate Miramax Films until they left the company on September 30, 2005. During their tenure, the Weinstein brothers ran Miramax Films independently of other Disney subsidiaries and, as a result, had more autonomy than the other Disney-owned companies. Disney, however, had the final say on what Miramax Films could release (for example, Disney had banned Miramax Films from releasingKids,DogmaandFahrenheit 9/11).[7]Disney'sBuena Vista Home Entertainmentdivision released Miramax output on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray Disc under the nameMiramax Home Entertainmentin some countries, including the United States; elsewhere, the overall distribution of Miramax Films' output was passed to the regional licensees of Miramax International, a distribution arm of Miramax Films that was fully autonomous from Disney's own distribution operations.
With a more stable budget, Miramax Films began moving beyond acquisitions and distribution and into film production. Until September 30, 2005, the company also operated the labelDimension Films, which was solely founded by Bob to specialize in teen, horror, and other genre films,[8]and created theScreamandScary Moviefilm franchises. Harvey funded larger projects from up-and-coming directors, includingRobert Rodriguez,Gus Van Sant, andQuentin Tarantino. Some of the films earned Oscars.[8]At times the studio tried to release a film almost weekly.[9]
In 1997, Miramax Films joinedPeter Jacksonas a primary financial backer in attempting to get theLord of the Ringsfilms produced. Disney disliked the cost of a two-parter, requesting that it be produced as a single film. Jackson andSaul Zaentzrejected Disney's request and looked for another studio or financier. Thus, Miramax Films sold the rights forThe Lord of the RingsandThe HobbittoNew Line Cinemain August 1998 for about $12 million, which ledThe Lord of the Ringsto be produced as a trilogy. Miramax Films retained a 5% stake in the films' gross and then gave 2.5% to the Weinsteins.[10]
Through Miramax Films, Harvey foundedTalkmagazine withTina Brownin 1998 (it shut down in 2002), albeit without the approval of then-Disney chiefMichael Eisner, which upset Eisner. Also that year, 30 former employees filed suit over unpaid overtime wages.[8]
By 2003, Miramax Films was less operative in the independent film market and became more of a mini-major as the company only acquired 3 films while producingCold Mountainfor $80 million. The Weinsteins claimed the company was profitable, but Walt Disney Company presidentRobert Igerindicated in June 2004 that they were not properly accounting for "account standard overhead, distribution fees, bonuses that we pay Harvey and Bob. Nor are they applying current accounting rules."[8]
After extensive negotiations and much media and industry speculation, on March 30, 2005, Disney and the Weinsteins announced that they would not renew their contractual relationship when their existing agreements expired at the end of September 2005. The primary source of dispute was over distribution ofFahrenheit 9/11by Michael Moore.[11]Disney's film studio consortium,Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, assumed control of Miramax Films, which was projected to have a smaller annual production budget. The Weinsteins started a new film production company calledThe Weinstein Company(TWC) and took theDimension Filmslabel with them. The Miramax Films name remained with the film studio owned by Disney. Production at Miramax Films was taken over byDaniel Battsek,[11]who had been head ofBuena Vista Internationalin theUK. Battsek refocused Miramax Films to produce films of high quality but low budget.Maple Picturesheld the rights to distribute Miramax films in Canada from 2008 up until August 10, 2011, when Maple Pictures was acquired byAlliance Films.[12]At the time, the company was criticized for delaying or withholding release of Asian films to which it acquired the U.S. distribution rights.[13]Previously, in 2003, the company was criticized for trying to bar retailers from legally exporting authentic DVDs of the films.[14]
On October 3, 2009, Disney announced that the staff of Miramax Films was to be reduced by 70%, and the number of releases would be reduced by half to just three films per year. The label's marketing, distribution, and administrative functions, which had operated independently, would be folded into the parent studio in Burbank. The move became effective in January 2010.[15]On October 30, 2009, Disney announced the resignation of Daniel Battsek as President of Miramax Films, effective when the transition from the studio in New York toBurbankwas completed.[16]The company merged its operations with The Walt Disney Studios on January 28, 2010, shutting down Miramax Films' separate New York and Los Angeles offices.[11][17]
Though Disney Studio ChairmanDick Cookwas a staunch supporter of Miramax Films, the brand was less of a priority for CEOBob Iger, whose strategy was to focus on Disney's branded mass entertainment that could be exploited across Disney's theme parks, television, and consumer products. Following Disney's $4 billion acquisition ofMarvel Entertainmentin 2009, Cook was succeeded byRich Ross.[18]As a result, Miramax Films was relegated to the status of distribution label within the Walt Disney Company.[19]The company confirmed that it was looking into selling the Miramax label on February 9, 2010, with Bob Iger explaining "We determined that continuing to invest in new Miramax movies wasn't necessarily a core strategy of ours".[20]
On December 3, 2010, Disney closed the sale of Miramax for US$663 million toFilmyard Holdings, an investment group and joint venture ofColony NorthStar,Tutor-Saliba Corporation, andQatar Investment Authority. The sale included 700 film titles, books, development projects, and the "Miramax" name.Mike Lang, the formerNews Corporationbusiness development executive who was selected as the CEO of Miramax,[21]indicated that the company would focus on their existing library, though they would continue making original content.[22][23]
After the sale was closed, some films already developed at Miramax, includingThe TempestandGnomeo & Juliet, were eventually released by Disney under itsTouchstone Picturesbanner, and theatrical distribution ofDon't Be Afraid of the Dark[24]andThe Debt[25]were shifted toFilmDistrictandFocus Featuresrespectively.

Payne was born inOmaha, Nebraska, to Peggy and George Payne, restaurant owners.[3][1]He is the youngest of three sons[4]and grew up in theDundeeneighborhood.[5]He is of Greek ancestry.[6][7]Payne's paternal grandfather, Nicholas "Nick" Payne,anglicizedthe last name from "Papadopoulos".[8]His family comes from three areas in Greece: the island ofSyros,Livadia, andAegio.[9]Payne's family was part of the fabric of Omaha, which he refers to as part of his upbringing.[10][11]His grandfather was a founder of The Virginia Cafe, with Payne's father taking over the restaurant. Payne went there regularly as a child. The restaurant was destroyed in a fire in 1969; theW. Dale Clark Librarywas later built on the site.[10]Payne's paternal grandmother, Clara Payne (née Hoffman), was from a German Nebraska family fromLincoln, Nebraska.[11]
In Omaha, Payne attendedBrownell-Talbot School, Dundee Elementary School, and Lewis and Clark Junior High.[1]He graduated fromCreighton Prepfor high school in 1979.[12]At Prep, Payne wrote a humor column for his high school newspaper and was the editor of the high school yearbook.[13]Payne then attendedStanford University, where he majored in Spanish and History.[8]As a part of his Spanish degree, he studied at Spain'sUniversity of Salamanca. He later lived a few months inMedellin, Colombia, where he published an article about social changes between 1900 and 1930.[14]Payne received hisMFAin 1990 from theUCLA Film School.
In the 1960s, Payne's father received aSuper 8mmprojector from Kraft Foods as a loyalty reward,[1][15]and eventually passed it on to his son when Alexander was about 14 years old.[13][16][17]

The ensuing screenplay, which was turned down, ultimately becameAbout Schmidt.[8]He says that he cleared about $60,000, which was enough to fund his simple lifestyle at the time for about five years.[7]Payne has said he sees his talent as being one of learned economy, referring to the essay written byTennessee WilliamsonThe Catastrophe of Success.[17]During this time Payne worked in various capacities on films and television including directing several films for thePlayboychannel.

InJanet MaslinofThe New York Timesreview she wrote, "There's no easy way out of this predicament, though Mr. Payne does beg the question with skill. AndCitizen Ruthcan easily be forgiven for not finding a fully satisfying ending. It delivers more than enough lively, gutsy satire along the way."[18]
His second film,Election, starringMatthew BroderickandReese Witherspoon, which takes aim at politics and education in America, attracted attention whenNew Yorkerfilm criticDavid Denbynamed it the best film of 1999. Payne received his firstAcademy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplaynomination forElection.Roger Ebertgave the film three and a half stars out of four, praising Witherspoon and Payne, and saying, "...here is a movie that is not simply about an obnoxious student, but also about an imperfect teacher, a lockstep administration, and a student body that is mostly just marking time until it can go out into the world and occupy valuable space".[19]The film became a cult classic, ranking at #61 onBravo's"100 Funniest Movies" and #9 onEntertainment Weekly's list of the "50 Best High School Movies", while Witherspoon's performance was ranked at #45 on the list of the "100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time" byPremiere.

Critics also hailed George Clooney's performance with many citing it as his best.Peter BradshawofThe Guardianpraised Payne as a director writing, "Payne knows the difference between lightness and frivolity, between seriousness and solemnity, between different kinds of cloud...Within a single scene the film can tap into deep feelings of pain, switch into comic modes as various as farce and satire, and confront and evade moral challenges."[24]Payne also co-wrote the screenplay along withNat Faxon, andJim Rashwho all won theAcademy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.
Payne executive produced the short filmRun Fast. Anna Musso, his long-time assistant and protégé, wrote and directed the film, which shot in March 2014.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
