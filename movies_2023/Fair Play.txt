As Emily settles into her new job, Luke's resentment over not being promoted becomes apparent, leading to tensions in their relationship. Luke becomes consumed with the work of aself-help gurucoaching people on how to assert themselves in the workplace. When Emily questions his spending $3,000 on the course, Luke suggests she could benefit from becoming more assertive, to which she becomes defensive. He rebuffs her attempts to initiate sex and goes to bed.
While out for drinks with Campbell and Paul, a senior executive at the fund, Emily learns that Campbell wants to get rid of Luke, considering him ineffectual. She attempts to advocate more for Luke in the workplace, but it backfires when he makes a poor trading call that loses the company $15 million, leading to Campbell insulting her. Luke attempts to recover by feeding Emilyinsider informationconfirming the alleged collapse of a company whose stock the fund canshort. Concerned about the trade being illegal, she recommends Campbell short another company, which works. When the short sale is closed, Emily receives a $575,000 commission check.

That night, Emily learns that her mother had planned a surprise engagement party for them that Friday. A drunken Luke accuses her of stealing his job, but she reveals Campbell wanted to fire him, leading him to storm out. The next day, while Emily, Campbell, and Paul pitch to overseas investors, Luke barges into the conference room intoxicated and causes a scene, berating Campbell for denying him a promotion and revealing his relationship with Emily, which has violated company policy since her promotion.

They argue in front of their families, and she smashes a bottle on Luke's head when he suggests she had traded sexual favors for the promotion. Emily retreats to a bathroom where Luke finds her; the two get into a heated argument that quickly escalates into Luke raping Emily. During this, he slams her forward twice, causing her to bash her face against the bathroom counter. Emily tells Luke to stop, but he does not. The next morning, to protect her job, she tells Campbell that she was being stalked by Luke and they were never in a relationship.
Emily returns home to find Luke there, having packed up his belongings and planning to move in with his brother. Infuriated by his nonchalant attitude and demanding an apology for raping her, she threatens him with a knife. Emily attacks Luke with the knife until he apologizes and breaks down crying. Once he sincerely begs for her forgiveness, she orders him to leave before dropping the knife and smiling.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
