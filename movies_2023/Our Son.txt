The reader finds herself drawn into the poetry "movie," drawn into the fluid "camera work" of the "director's cut" — and then drawn past all these elements to the heart of the poem, the place where form, all form, becomes superfluous and the poem itself speaks unforgettably to the reader."[4]In Goodreads.comKevin Killianwrites: "Cinema Vernacularis a stunning new collection of poetry by Peter Nickowitz. Using forms like screenplays and even films in his poetics,Cinema Vernacularis porous, deft, concerned with our relationship to the intangible and how desire filters through image and text. These poems mark, with recognizable pathos and sharp turns of hilarity, the arrival of a major voice."[5]

Burton's first screen appearance was in the 1969 filmAnne of the Thousand Days, starring her father, with whom she later appeared as Alice opposite his White Knight in the 1983Great Performancesbroadcast ofAlice in Wonderland, and in the 1984 CBS miniseriesEllis Island. Other films includeBig Trouble in Little China,The First Wives Club,Life with Mikey, andThe Ice Storm. Burton has said of these roles that she usually plays "the sweet wife, or the sweet dead wife."[17]
Burton has been perhaps most prolific in her work on television. She made many television appearances in the late 1980s and 1990s on such episodic shows asSpenser: For Hire,All My Children, andBrooklyn Bridge. About playing the mother, in her late thirties, ofDavid Schwimmer's character in the short-lived 1994FOXsitcom,Monty, she said, "you don't really start playing moms in Hollywood until you're in your 40s, and usually the kids are almost your age! When I played Schwimmer's mother, I was 37 and he was, I think, 28. . . that happens a lot in TV and film; you really do end up being close in age to your child, which is nonsensical."[18]In 1996, Burton won aDaytime Emmy awardfor her performance as a mother dying of breast cancer in theABC Afterschool Special, 'Notes for my Daughter'. More recently, she made guest appearances as recurring characters onLaw & Order,The Practice,The West Wing,Judging AmyandMedium. She also appeared on theHBOminiseriesEmpire Falls.
Some of her recurring television roles have involved subplots concerningAlzheimer's disease. OnFXnetwork'sRescue Me, she played the role of Rose, a friend and possible romantic interest to Chief Jerry Reilly. Reilly, whose wife is in a facility suffering from Alzheimer's, hires Rose, a caregiver for her husband who was also a victim, to provide assistance and emotional support. Burton's most visible and well-known role to date is the mysterious and difficult mother of Dr.Meredith Grey(Ellen Pompeo), the titular character onABC'smedical dramaGrey's Anatomy. Burton plays Dr. Ellis Grey, the former trailblazing surgeon, and a two-time winner of the fictionalized, prestigious Harper Avery Award. Her character's battle and death of Alzheimer's is central to Meredith's story in all seasons of the series, as Meredith fears both getting the disease and resembling her mother as she ages. The character is also revealed to be the birth mother of Meredith's half-sister, Dr.Maggie Pierce(Kelly McCreary) through her love affair with Dr.Richard Webber(James Pickens, Jr.).
Like Schwimmer's character inMonty, Burton and Pompeo (who portrays Meredith) also have a small age gap, with Pompeo being 12 years her junior. In-universe, Meredith (born 1978) is 25 years younger than Ellis (born 1953), with Pompeo aged down 11 years and Burton aged up 4 years. (Though the character's exact ages were not determined until aretconwas established inseason 11). In 2008, the New York City Chapter of theAlzheimer's Associationsingled her out for her compelling performances in both shows.[19]In 2006 and 2007, Burton receivedEmmynominations for herGrey's Anatomyrole.[20]Burton's character dies in thethird seasonepisode "Some Kind of Miracle", which aired in 2007; she returned to the role five years later, in theseason 8alternate reality episode. It depicts a version of her life where Richard did not leave her and she did not have Alzheimer's. Burton's character is central to theeleventh season, as Meredith's marital struggles begin to parallel her own mother's struggles, something she feared. She reprised her role in flashbacks for theeleventh season, showing Ellis briefly before her Alzheimer's diagnosis. Inseason 14's landmark 300th episode, Burton's Ellis is shown as a dream-sequence figure, clapping for Meredith, who has also now won a Harper Avery award. She re-appears twice as a dream sequence figure in thefifteenth season. Burton will return to the role in theeighteenth season, beginning with its season premiere.
In 2011, Burton appeared as Marie Kessler, a veteran monster hunter, and the aunt of Nick Burkhardt in the opening episodes of the NBC supernatural dramaGrimm. Since 2012, she plays the recurring role of Vice President Sally Langston in the ABC hit showScandal, for which she again received an Emmy nomination.[21][20]In 2015, it was reported that Burton was cast in a leading role in the U.S.remakeof the French-language filmMartyrs, which opened theatrically in January 2016.[22][23]In March 2017, she reprised her role as Aunt Marie Kessler in the series finale ofGrimm.
Burton has narrated numerousaudiobooks, including works by:Patricia Cornwell,Lisa Scottoline,Iris Johansen, andDean Koontz.[24]
In 1985, Burton marriedMichael Ritchie,[25]Artistic Director of theCenter Theatre Groupin Los Angeles and one of the producers of the Broadway musicalsThe Drowsy ChaperoneandCurtains.[26]They met in 1982, while Ritchie was stage manager of a revival ofNoël Coward'sPresent Laughterat theCircle in the Square Theatrein New York City in which Burton was playing the character Daphne.[27]They have two children, a son, Morgan Ivor[28][29]and a daughter, Charlotte Frances.[30][31]Burton became a U.S. citizen in 2005, and also holds a U.K. passport.[32]

I found a little bit of it off-putting to tell you the truth, because it was so angry when I saw it. And I thinkTyler Perryhas added an element here that wasn't in the original stage production, and that is the necessity for taking responsibility for one's own self otherwise you are just living to die.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
