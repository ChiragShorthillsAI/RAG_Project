Set in 1985, the film comprises five found footage segments linked together by a sixthframe narrativedirected by Mike P. Nelson,Gigi Saul Guerrero,Natasha Kermani,Scott Derrickson, andDavid Bruckner.[4]The film is an international co-production between the United States and Mexico.[5]
The film premiered atFantastic Feston September 22, 2023, and was released as aShudder Original Filmthrough the streaming serviceShudderin the United States on October 6, 2023.[6]A sequel,V/H/S/Beyond, was released on October 4, 2024.
The film is presented as ananthologyof five short horror films, built into aframe narrativewhich acts as its own sixth short horror film. Each short is linked together with the concept offound footageas each segment is fromVHStapes.
V/H/S/85is the first installment in the franchise to have two segments directly connected with each other—"No Wake" and "Ambrosia"—, as well as having a segment related to its filmmaker's most recent work—Scott Derrickson's "Dreamkill" is directly connected toThe Black Phone(2021).
The frame narrative, presented as a documentary, focuses on a team of scientists—Dr. Pike Spratling, Dr. Gary Newell, Dr. Margaret Porter, and Dr. Sarah Greyson— at Stamer University as they study a shapeshifting being named "Rory".
Seven friends—Rob, Anna, Jared, Drew, Robin, Kevin, and Kelly—travel in arecreational vehicleto camp at a nearby lake. The group, except for Anna and Jared, ignore several signs that warn visitors against swimming and enter the water.
While water skiing, Rob, Drew, Robin, Kevin, and Kelly are shot and killed by an unseen sniper on the shore. Moments later, the group regain consciousness despite their fatal injuries and return to the shore, where they find Anna and Jared dead, and that their vehicle has theRoman numeralfor seven painted on it with blood.
The survivors conclude that the lake has theability to bring the dead back to lifeand, since they were the only ones to go swimming, only they were resurrected. They decide to enact their revenge on their attackers as the footage ends.
Back in the frame narrative, it is revealed that Rory was found on the top of abutteand brought to the university to be studied under Spratling's supervision. In hopes to educate the being about human culture, the scientists contain Rory in a small room with a television—which broadcasts exercise videos—as Spratling is convinced that they can communicate with it.
In a fictional depiction of the actual1985 Mexico City earthquake, a Mexican news crew is preparing for the morning news until a massive earthquake strikes during the broadcast, which kills the entire crew except for cameraman Luis. He is assisted by a rescue team—Eddie, Karla, Javier, and Miguel—as they attempt to make their way out of the building.
Javier is mortally wounded in anaftershockand forces Karla to expedite his death; the remaining quartet notice a crawl space and enter a room withwalls made of skulls, where they find a statue of anAztec godnamedMictlantecuhtli. Eddie is suddenly possessed by Mictlantecuhtli, who then kills Miguel. Mictlantecuhtli also materializes behind Eddie and rips out his heart, which he proceeds to eat.
Karla succumbs to Mictlantecuhtli's influence and kills Luis,ripping out his heart as an offering. She is eventually killed when the room collapses, and a surviving news reporter broadcasts from outside the building explaining that "Today, September 19th, approximately 7:20 a.m., will be a day to remember" as the footage ends.
Rory has begun to displaythe ability to mutate into—and vaguely resemble—a human body; the footage is then interspersed with Greyson's interview. She says that when Rory's shapeshifting abilities were discovered, Spratling should have exhibited caution.
Performance artist Ada Lovelace opens a show for a small audience in a theater. She explains that the world has killed God and replaced him with the "God of Technology", and introduces a demonstration video of avirtual realitysoftware device that allows its user to exist simultaneously on thephysicaland digital plane.
When Ada adorns herself with a virtual reality headset, gloves, and a full body suit, another video is projected and shows what Ada sees through her headseat, depicting an electronic landscape. Ada performs an incantation to awaken the "God of Technology" and taunts it as a "myth" until a mysterious entity appears on the screen.
An unnerved Ada tries to remove the headset, but the entity attacks her; her real life body mimics her virtual one as she is lifted, strangled, and thrown. Ada's hand is bitten off in the virtual world and, though she is able to remove the gloves, she finds that her real hand is gone. The entity then breaks Ada's leg, tears away her skin, and rips her other leg off entirely.
Ada screams and succumbs to her injuries; the shocked audience, who believe it was all part of Ada's performance, clap as her cameraman approaches her. He is able to lift the visor, where it is revealed that Ada's now exposed brain and facial tissue has fused with the headset as the footage ends.
Seeing that the scientists are distracted, Rory has continued his mutation now sporting several tentacle-like limbs called slime arms with spikes at the end.
The Wrigley family host a celebration in honor of their teenage daughter Ruth, who films the occasion with her cousin James. Ruth's young relative Adam shoots her with a water gun, which he reveals was given to him by a "lady in a recreational vehicle". That evening, the Wrigleys reveal that they are celebrating an old family tradition as a rite of passage that Ruth has completed.
She produces her passage's recording, in which she shot seven people dead at a lake shore.[a]When police officers surround the house, the family rushes to fight back. As the police raid the house and shoot Ruth's family dead, Ruth kills James after he confesses he is too frightened to fight. Ruth then begins ashootoutwith the police, but is killed.
As a coroner examines the bodies, Ruth regains consciousness despite her fatal injuries and, in shock, shoots the coroner. She shoots herself in the head, but remains alive and is arrested in great distress. It is revealed that Robin—one of Ruth's victims from the lake shore massacre—filled a water gun with the lake's water and gave it to Adam as the footage ends.
Newell becomes disturbed when Rory takes on his appearance, as he is the only one that has never had a face-to-face with the being, and Greyson calls for an emergency meeting. She explains that Newell has never been in the chamber, then deduces that Rory can see through the one-way mirror that divides its containment chamber and the study room.
While Greyson expresses concern, Spratling sees it as a miracle and argues that Rory is breaching beyond its restraints to make contact with them. Greyson, in another interview, explains that Spratling did not deserve what happened to him.
In a first-personpoint-of-view, a serial killer enters a woman's house, ties her up, and brutally murders her while she is on the phone withemergency services. Lead detective Wayne Johnson recognizes the scene from a previous video of a similar murder. Another video shows the killer as he enters another house, fights the man inside, and brutally murders him as well.
The police come to the house and Wayne tells his partner Bobby Blake that he had already seen the murder on a tape he received earlier. Wayne investigates and finds out that Bobby's son Gunther is the one sending the tapes. Gunther claims that he saw the murders in his dreams and that they were being recorded on the tapes, but Wayne is skeptical. Bobby explains that their family has apsychic abilityto see the future—Gunther's cousin Gwen had similar dreams when her brother Finney was kidnapped and his aunt committed suicide after having a series of disturbing dreams.[b]
A new tape is discovered, showing another murder where the victim was dismembered and beheaded. Bobby and Wayne recognize the location and decide to investigate. Outside the house, Wayne confronts Bobby about his involvement in the previous murders as it is revealed that Bobby had a connection with the victims—the woman from the respective first and last video tapes accused him of sexual assault and stalking, and the man from the second video tape was their attorney.
Wayne also reveals that Bobby lost his job as a result of these accusations; he pleads with Bobby to tell the truth, but Bobby kills him and then enters the house to carry out the murder depicted in Gunther's dream. In the police station, Gunther discovers that his dream is being replayed on the camera in the interrogation room. Bobby returns to the station and encounters Gunther, who then realizes his father is the killer. Gunther shares that he had a dream predicting the outcome of the situation. The police arrive and Bobby easily takes them down, only to get shot in the head by Gunther as the footage ends.
Rory is unresponsive to stimuli, which Spratling interprets as it being sick. Greyson disagrees and says that if Rory is as intelligent as Spratling says, then Rory could be manipulating him. Later, on that evening, Greyson abandons the study; she tries to convince Newell and Porter to follow her, but is unsuccessful.
In another interview, Greyson reveals that, while authorities have shared footage of what happened at the university, the documentary will not show it due to the images' disturbing nature and a concern for the well-being of viewers. The tape then cuts to a black screen, revealing that the following footage is property of Stamer University, leased to the show with no intention of distribution.
After Greyson leaves, Spratling sends Newell into Rory's room to give it an adrenaline shot. Before he can do so, Rory exposes his tentacle and wraps it around Newell's arm. While Spratling is able to get Newell out of the room, Rory sprouts another tentacle that uses to drag both Newell and Porter back to its room to kill them.
Spratling and the cameraman attempt to escape but, due to Newell's blood on Spratling's hand, the door scanner cannot read his handprint. Rory's tentacles extend to the hallway and kill them both. Rory then uses its tentacles to grab the cameraman's corpse and drags him back to its room, where it begins to manipulate the corpsesin an imitation of the exercise videosit previously watched.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
