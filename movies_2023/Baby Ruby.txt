In a review forSan Francisco Chronicle, Bob Strauss wrote: "Playwright Bess Wohl’s feature-directing debut is a sly, mutant meld of horror thriller, feminist satire and subjective, postpartum paranoia study. It’s serious about how the demands of baby care can overwhelm, and skeptical of societal pressures on women to not just accept but love motherhood’s burdens."[11]Guy Lodge ofVarietycalled the portrayal of mental breakdown after a traumatic childbirth "evocative and appropriately aggravating", and cited Merlant's portrayal of "agonized internal plight" as a factor in keeping the audience "emotionally rooted" in the film.[12]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
