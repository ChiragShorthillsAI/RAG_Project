Flamin' Hotis a 2023 Americanbiographicalcomedy-drama filmdirected byEva Longoriain her feature-length directorial debut. Written by Linda Yvette Chávez andLewis Colick, it is based on the memoirA Boy, a Burrito and a Cookie: From Janitor to ExecutivebyRichard Montañez, who claims to have inventedFlamin' Hot Cheetos. The film starsJesse Garcia, Annie Gonzalez,Dennis Haysbert, andTony Shalhoub.
The film had its world premiere atSouth by Southweston March 11, 2023. It was released on June 9, 2023, byHuluandDisney+to mixed reviews from critics. At the96th Academy Awards,Flamin' Hotreceived a nomination forBest Original Songfor “The Fire Inside” written byDiane Warren, but lost to “What Was I Made For?” fromBarbie.
In 1966Southern California, Richard Montañez grows up as a hard working child with a strict father and supportive grandfather. He meets his future wife Judy in school where he begins selling burritos to other children. He is arrested at a young age when nobody believes that he earned his money honestly. As adults, Richard and Judy marry but live ashoodlumsin a gang, hustling to survive. They make an effort to turn their lives around once Judy gets pregnant with their first child. After one last arrest, the judge tells him to change his way of life. A second child later, Richard and his family still struggle to make ends meet as Richard searches for honest work. He eventually turns to his friend, former hoodlum Tony Romero, who helps him get a job at Frito-Lay. Despite lying on his resumé, floor head Lonny Mason hires him.
Richard begins paying attention to all the nuances of the factory and starts pursuing engineer maintenance leader Clarence C. Baker to teach him about the machines. Despite some reluctance, Baker agrees and teaches Richard how to operate all the machinery in the factory. Unfortunately, theReagan administrationbegins to severely affect low-paying jobs and Frito-Lay's stocks begin to go down. This eventually results in some of the workers getting laid off. Frito-Lay CEORoger Enricoreleases a video encouraging the workers to "think like a CEO" which inspires Richard.
After picking up his kids from school, Richard takes them out forelotes(Mexican street corn). Noticing that his youngest son Steven likes the spicy flavor, saying it "burns good", he realizes that the way to save Frito-Lay is to pitch the brand to the Latino market. He convinces Baker and the rest of his coworkers to let him take some unflavored Cheetos home, but Judy offers that he talk to his father Vacho first about a job. Vacho ends up belittling Richard's plans, causing Judy to support Richard even more. The Montañezes work tirelessly trying to find the perfect spicy flavor for Cheetos, eventually getting the right concoction. Richard attempts to pitch his idea to Lonny only to be turned down, forcing Richard to sneak in and copy Enrico's phone number.
Richard manages to get through to Enrico who, while perplexed over being called by a janitor, is intrigued to learn that he saw his video and asks that he send his flavored Cheetos. He tastes them and is immediately hooked, setting up a meeting at the factory right away. While Lonny is upset with Richard, Richard prepares himself for the pitch, finally getting the approval of his father to back him up. Richard proceeds to speak from the heart and his pitch is accepted with the Flamin' Hot Cheetos being put into production. While this results in more jobs, the new flavor is not flying off the shelves. Disappointed, Richard's children point out that there are no advertisements for the flavor. Richard returns to work and orders everyone to use their skills to sell the new flavor from the street. The tactic works and Enrico calls to ask that the factory produce an even bigger order.
While Baker gets the promotion he always desired, Richard is still a janitor, though Baker gives him some support. Lonny asks Richard to clean upstairs, only to find Enrico who tells him that he understands his struggles growing up, before revealing that he has been promoted to Director of Multicultural Marketing. Richard is applauded by all his coworkers for his success and he happily calls Judy to tell her the good news.
In August 2019, it was reportedEva Longoriawould directFlamin' Hot, a film aboutRichard Montañezwho claimed to have inventedFlamin' Hot Cheetos, withDeVon Franklinproducing under hisFranklin Entertainmentbanner alongside Samuel Rodriguez, who served as the executive producer.Searchlight Picturesalso contributed to the making of this film.[1]
Prior to the announcement, in April 2019, Franklin Entertainment was informed byFrito-Laythat Montañez's account of inventing Flamin' Hot Cheetos was disputed after an internal investigation had been prompted the previous year, but the producers elected to continue with the original premise.[2][3]The script received rewrites prior to shooting due to the publication of aLos Angeles Timesarticle in May 2021 disputing Montañez's account.[4]
In May 2021,Jesse Garciaand Annie Gonzalez joined the cast of the film.[1]The film completed production in August 2021, and the cast was announced at that time.[5][6]
ThoughFlamin' Hotisadvertisedas a true story,[7][8][9]the authenticity of Montañez's account became doubtful after theLos Angeles Timespublished an in-depth article scrutinizing his claim,[2]with later corroboration byNPR.[10]
As portrayed in the movie, Montañez claims to have been encouraged by Roger Enrico's "think like a CEO" message and invented the Flamin' Hot seasoning with his wife Judy as aDIYproject, taking home unflavored Cheetos in garbage bags to experiment with when the machine broke and left them unseasoned.[11][12][13]Montañez previously stated Enrico's phone number was listed in the company directory. He called Enrico, pitching his idea for a product aimed atLatinos, and arranged asales presentationwhere he handed out homemade bags sealed with a clothing iron and hand-drawn logos. The presentation and a test market in Los Angeles happened in 1991, before a nationwide release in 1992.[14][15]Reporting by theLA TimesandNPRcontradicts this account. Frito-Lay told theLA Times, "We value Richard's many contributions to our company, especially his insights into Hispanic consumers, but we do not credit the creation of Flamin' Hot Cheetos or any Flamin' Hot products to him,"[2]NPRwas told, "We do not credit the product creation to him and him alone."[10]McCormickdeveloped the Flamin' Hot seasoning and sent initial samples to Frito-Lay on Dec. 15, 1989. Frito-Lay filed a trademark forFlamin' Hotin June 1990[16]and started testing spicyLay's, Cheetos,FritosandBakenetsinChicago,DetroitandHoustonbeginning in August 1990, and Roger Enrico joined Frito-Lay at the start of 1991.[2][17][18]Lynne Greenfeld is credited with managing the team that developed Flamin' Hot Cheetos, with contributions from Fred Lindsay. According to Al Carey, a former executive at Frito-Lay, and Patti Reuff, Enrico's former assistant, Montañez pitched a similar product, but this could not have been before 1992.[2][10]Carey stated the product was approved and sold inCaliforniausing seasoning from theMidwest.[10]Montañez did in fact rise from a floor-level position to marketing executive, and he was involved in pitching new products such as Flamin' Hot Popcorn in 1993 followed by two types ofFritos— Flamin' Hot and Lime and Chile Corn Chips.[2][19]Roberto Siewczynski, who worked with Frito-Lay as a Latino-focusedconsultant, clarified that events Montañez has described actually took place during the Sabrositas test market in 1994.[2]
Montañez has said he was a janitor during the development of Flamin' Hot Cheetos and is portrayed as such in the movie,[14][20][21]but he had actually been a machinist operator since 1977.[2][19]The movie presents an economic downturn duringRonald Reagan's presidencyleading tolayoffsand prompting Enrico's message.[14]In reality, theUnited Statesexperienceda recession in the early 1980sthat began prior to the1980 presidential election, followed by consistent economic growth and decreasing unemployment until July 1990.[22][23]Roger Enrico joined Frito-Lay in early 1991, two years after Reagan left office.[2][17][18]Frito-Lay cut 1800 jobs later that year.[19][24]
Clarence Baker, played by Dennis Haysbert, was based on a co-worker Montañez had at the plant. Hediedseveral years before production of the movie and a different name was used for the character.[8]
Montañez initially responded to the controversy by claiming he was pushed out of development before the test markets and his contributions were not documented due to his low level position at the time. He stated, "I think that [the film is] going to inspire people to do the right thing. Don't make the mistake Montañez made. Document everything."[15]The week of the movie's release,Varietypublished an article where Montañez stated, "I've got letters, notes, and presentations, proving their faith in me and my creation," but did not make any documentation public.[4]Co-writer Lewis Colick has stated, "I think enough of the story is true," adding, "I've written a lot of true stories, likeOctober Sky. Not every single thing in the story is exactly true. I always stand behind the essence of the story."[25]Director Eva Longoria responded to criticism of the movie's accuracy, "We've always been telling Richard Montañez's story, and we're telling his truth. We weren't making a movie about the history of the Flamin' Hot Cheeto. We're telling the story of Richard Montañez."[26]She separately admitted that the scene where Montañez's coworkers clap and cheer for his promotion is "the one thing that did not happen."[27]Addressing a screening of the movie at theWhite House, an official speaking anonymously stated it is not adocumentary, and was shown to reflect Americans ofdifferent backgrounds.[28]
Flamin' Hothad its world premiere atSouth by Southwest(SXSW) on March 11, 2023.[29][30]It was released in select theaters and on bothHuluandDisney+on June 9, 2023.[31][32]The movie was screened on theSouth Lawnof theWhite Houseon June 15, 2023.PresidentJoe Bidenand director Eva Longoria, a notableDemocratcampaigner, delivered remarks at the event, promoting it as the first White House screening of a movie focused on Hispanic characters.[33][28]
Whip Media, which tracks viewership data for the more than 25 million worldwide users of itsTV Timeapp, calculated thatFlamin' Hotwas the seventh most-streamed film in the U.S. during the week of June 11, 2023.[34]The film moved to ninth place a week later.[35]The streaming aggregator Reelgood, which monitors real-time data from 5 million users in the U.S. for original and acquired streaming programs and movies across subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) and ad-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) services, reported thatFlamin' Hotwas the tenth most-streamed program during the week of June 8, 2023.[36][37]Reelgood later reported that the film placed ninth the following week.[38]Searchlight Pictures announced thatFlamin' Hotbecame the studio's most-watched streaming movie of all time in June 2023.[39][40]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 69% of 127 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's consensus reads: "Flamin' Hotmay have a little more than its share of empty calories, but this fun feel-good story is still a decent cinematic snack."[41]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 58 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[42]
Carlos Aguilar ofLos Angeles Timessaid, "Flamin' Hotturns out to be a surprisingly enjoyable crowd-pleaser. It mostly works because Garcia, Gonzalez and Longoria agree on a poignant, yet not sanctimonious approach that crystallizes the specific fortitude of mining hope from dire struggle."[43]Brian Lowry ofCNNsaid that Eva Longoria did an "admirable job of wringing as much mileage as she can out of this underdog tale," and wrote, "Playfully presented, it's the kind of mildly tasty cinematic snack that doesn't exactly stick to your ribs."[44]
John Nugent ofEmpiregave the film a grade of three out of five stars, praised the performances ofJesse Garciaand Annie Gonzalez, and complimented Eva Longoria's direction.[45]Clarisse Loughrey ofThe IndependentgaveFlamin' Hota grade of three out of five stars, complimented the chemistry between Jesse Garcia and Annie Gonzales, and stated that the film " keep its audience on their toes" owing to Eva Longoria.[46]
Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comwrote: "Flamin' Hothas so much to say about culture that it never gives its characters room to breathe outside the movie's 'message.' It makes for a film that doesn't seem to tell a true story as much as one that came off a product line from a Frito-Lay factory."[47]Monica Castillo, also writing forRogerEbert.com, gave the movie two out of four stars: "Overall,Flamin' Hotis more cheesy than spicy. Its focus on the 'Si, se puede ... trabajar y ganar dinero' mantra dulls the flavors of what makes the movie enjoyable: the family at the center of Richard's drive to survive."[48]

It was launched on October 29, 2007, initially as ajoint venturebetweenNews Corporation(later21st Century Fox) andNBC Universal, which was laterbought byComcast. Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initiallybrandedas "Hulu Plus," which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and un-delayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—anover-the-topstreaming television service offering access tobroadcast televisionchannels.

In 2019, Disney acquired a majority stake in Hulu as part of itsacquisition of 21st Century Fox, and subsequently acquired the remaining stakes held by AT&T and Comcast in 2019 and 2023, respectively, giving it full ownership. After the acquisition, Disneysoft launchedan integration of Hulu into Disney+ as a content hub in December 2023, allowing subscribers of both services to access Hulu content from within the Disney+ app. Hulu is one of the three streaming services in the Disney Bundle, alongside Disney+ andESPN+.

The combined company will remain publicly traded on theNew York Stock Exchange, but will be controlled by Disney executives. As part of the deal, Fubo settled a lawsuit againstESPN Inc.(majority-owned by Disney),Fox Corporation(21CF's successor), andWarner Bros. Discovery(WarnerMedia's successor after its merger withDiscovery, Inc.) over a joint venture known asVenu Sports, with Fubo being granted a preliminary injection to stop its launch in August 2024. The merger will take 12 to 18 months according to Disney and Fubo. Venu Sports was discontinued a few days later.
The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

Comcast, the only other shareholder, announced on May 14, 2019, that it had agreed to cede its control to Disney, and reached an agreement for Disney to purchase its 33% stake in the company as early as 2024.[38]
On May 14, 2019, Comcast relinquished its control in Hulu to Disney effective immediately. As a result, the streaming service became a division ofWalt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International(DTCI) with Comcast effectively becoming asilent partner. Under the agreement, Comcast's 33% stake can be sold to Disney atfair market valueas early as 2024. The fair market value will be determined at that time, but Disney guaranteed a minimum valuation of the entire company at $27.5 billion (valuing the Comcast stake as worth at least $9.075 billion).[39]Randy Freer would report to Disney executiveKevin Mayer.[39]

According to research done in 2010 byHarvardprofessor andFaces of AmericahostHenry Louis Gates Jr., Longoria's oldest identifiable Spanish immigrant ancestor is her ninth great-grandfather, Lorenzo Suárez de Longoria (b.Oviedo, 1592), who was a colonist of theViceroyalty of New Spain(modern-day Mexico) in 1603. His family was based in a small village called Llongoria,Belmonte de Miranda, Asturias, Spain.Longoriais the Castillanized form of thisAsturian-languagesurname.
In 1767, her seventh great-grandfather received almost 4,000 acres (16 km2) of land along theRio Grandein a land grant from KingCharles III of Spain. The family retained this land for more than a century. After the US-Mexican border was moved southwards in the aftermath of theMexican–American War, the land ended up on the American side of the border. Her family had to deal with the influx of United States settlers following the Mexican–American War and theAmerican Civil War.[140]
According toDNA testing, Longoria's overall genetic ancestry is 70% European, 27%Indigenous American, and 3%African.[141]A computer analysis of the DNA results of Gates's dozen guests showed that Longoria has the same genetichaplogroupas cellistYo-Yo Ma, who is of Chinese heritage.[141]As women have two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, Longoria did not inherit her father'sY-DNA, but she did inherit her mother'smitochondrial DNA(genetic information passed from mother to child). Longoria's mtDNA belongs to theHaplogroup A2, making her a direct descendant of a Native American woman, aMayanfrom the territory of Mexico long before it was Mexico. Her ancestors include many other Maya on both sides of her family.[142][143]
Longoria identifies as a "Texican"—a Mexican-American Texan.[142]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
