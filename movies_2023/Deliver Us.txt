Father Fox and Cardinal Russo are sent to Saint Petersburg, and extract Yulia to Estonia when a sect called Vox Dei attempts to murder the babies. They take refuge at a remote estate belonging to Laura, the priest's fiancé, who he intends to marry after resigning from the Church. Several strange occurrences caused by the evil twin lead to the deaths of Laura and Cardinal Russo. Father Fox tries to murder the baby he believes to be the evil one, but is stopped by Yulia. Realizing they were meant to be a family, Fox and Yulia raise the twins as their own, in the hopes that the Messiah will have the strength to fight his brother when the time comes.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 65% of 20 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.10/10.[8]
Simon Abrams ofRogerEbert.comgave the film 3 stars out of 4 stars and he wrote: "Grey, the color of winter frost, dimmer-switch lighting, and moody cinematography. "Deliver Us," a loopy "The Omen"-style Antichrist horror-thriller, is also grey. Just look at the movie's poster and trailer. Grey isn't just a color or an aesthetic—it's a whole dire vibe."[9]
Nathaniel Muir ofAipt Comicsgave the film a positive review and he wrote: "As things progress,Deliver Usrelies less on jump scares and fosters distrust. The lack of a strong villain is noticeable, but the methodical take on nun horror is a nice change of pace."[10]
A reviewer fromScreen Anarchy, Kyle Logan satisfied at the film and its atmosphere and he wrote: "Deliver Usdoesn't quite stick the landing in its final moments. But it's so effective as an atmospheric religious horror movie punctuated by fantastic practical gore that it's difficult to complain about it not meeting its full potential."[11]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
