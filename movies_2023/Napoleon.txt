Napoleonpremiered atSalle Pleyelin Paris on November 14, 2023, and was released in the United States and United Kingdom on November 22 byColumbia Pictures(viaSony Pictures Releasing) before streaming onApple TV+on March 1, 2024. The film grossed $221.4million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the battle sequences and performances but criticized its uneven tone, rushed pacing, and lack of historical accuracy. At the96th Academy Awards, the film received nominations forBest Production Design,Best Costume Design, andBest Visual Effects.
In 1793, amid theFrench Revolution, young army officerNapoleon BonapartewatchesMarie Antoinettebeheaded by theguillotine. Later that year, Revolutionary leaderPaul Barrashas Napoleon manage theSiege of Toulon; he storms the city and repels the British ships with artillery. AfterMaximilien Robespierreisdeposed and executedat the end of theReign of Terror, French leaders, including Napoleon, attempt to restore stability. Again employing artillery, Napoleon suppresses the royalist insurrection on13 Vendémiairein 1795.
Napoleon woos aristocratic widowJoséphine de Beauharnaisand the two eventually marry. Despite their vigorous sex life, they bear no children. InEgypt, he prevails again at theBattle of the Pyramidsin 1798, but rushes home when he hears Joséphine has an almost 10-year younger lover,Hippolyte Charles. TheDirectorycriticises him for abandoning his troops, but he condemns them for their poor leadership of France and with several collaborators such asTalleyrand,Fouché,SieyèsandDucos, overthrows them in theCoup of 18 Brumaireand becomesFirst Consul.
Napoleon iscrownedEmperor of the Frenchby thepopein 1804, during which he audaciously puts the crown on his own head. Foreign Minister Talleyrand suggests toAustriaan alliance, though the Austrians dismiss the idea. A year later, Napoleon outmanoeuvres and defeats the Austrians and the Russians at theBattle of Austerlitz, forcing them to retreat over frozen lakes before bombarding the ice and drowning them. Afterwards, he invites Austrian EmperorFrancis IIfor wine—which Russian TsarAlexander Ideclines to attend—and tells Francis that since he did not totally destroy their armies, he expects the latter to be grateful.
Napoleon's motherhas him impregnate a mistress, proving that Joséphine is infertile. He divorces her in 1810, publicly slapping her in the face when she initially refuses to read her portion of the decree, but the two remain on good terms and continue exchanging friendly letters. Napoleon marriesMarie Louise of Austria, who bearsa sonone year later.
In 1812, Napoleoninvades Russiaafter Alexander reneges on theTreaties of Tilsit. He prevails, despite bloody guerrilla resistance byDon Cossacks, and then fighting the hugeBattle of Borodino, but findsMoscowempty and laterset aflame. Napoleon retreats during the winter to France, having lost about half a million men. In 1814, theCoalitionforces Napoleon's abdication and exiles him toElba.
In 1815, upon hearing that Joséphine is unwell, Napoleon escapes the island and in theHundred Daysreturns to power in France. She, having been forced into reclusion at theChâteau de Malmaison, dies before he arrives. KingLouis XVIIIsends the Fifth Regiment to stop Napoleon, but he charms them into joining him.
At theBattle of Waterlooin June, Napoleon, having amassed more troops, confronts theBritish armyunderArthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington. French cavalry charges are repulsed by Britishinfantry squares, and a desperate Napoleon urges his remaining soldiers forward, but this advance is defeated by re-formed lines of enemy infantry. The forces ofPrussianMarshal Blücherarrive to reinforce Wellesley, and the French are broken. As Napoleon retreats, he salutes Wellesley.
Napoleon is exiled, this time to the island ofSaint Helenain the middle of theAtlantic Ocean, and is seen bantering with children, writing hismemoirsthat would become read all over the world and presenting to his listeners a version of history where he is always right. An unwell Napoleon collapses, hearing Joséphine beckon him to meet her again. Napoleon dies in 1821. An epilogue notes that roughly 3 million people died in his wars.
On October 14, 2020, the same day his filmThe Last Duel(2021) wrapped filming,Ridley ScottannouncedNapoleon, at that point provisionally calledKitbag, as his next project for20th Century Studios, based onNapoleon's life. He would direct and produce, while the screenplay was written by Scott'sAll the Money in the World(2017) collaboratorDavid Scarpa. The film's working title was derived from the saying that "There is a general's staff hidden in every soldier's kitbag".[21]During the same year, Scott also consulted withUniversity of Oxfordscholar Michael Broers regarding Napoleon's life, particularly collaborating with him in deconstructing the geography of theBattle of Waterloo. He also receivedStanley Kubrick's script for his planned Napoleon film, which never materialized.[22]By January 2021,Apple Studiosannounced its commitment to finance and produce the film, with filming scheduled to begin in the United Kingdom in 2022.[23]
Scarpa had been approached by Scott to write a film based on Napoleon following production ofAll the Money in the World. As he initially had a "high school basic knowledge" of his life, he conducted research regarding Napoleon and after realizing that writing a film encompassing his entire life was impractical, he decided to focus on Napoleon's relationship with his wife, Josephine.[24]He began by readingNapoleon: A Concise BiographybyDavid A. Bell, but did not understand it and opted to conduct further research by reading more books and watching YouTube videos. When researching Josephine, he citedAmbition and Desire: The Dangerous Life of Josephine BonapartebyKate Williamsas his primary influence.[25]He took inspiration from Scott'sThe Duellists(1977) andMilos Forman'sAmadeus(1984), wanting to portray Napoleon as an "irreverent" figure similar to how Mozart was depicted inAmadeus, and told Scott he envisioned Napoleon as being competent "in the realm of battle", and "incompetent in the realm of love". Scott proposed the idea of beginning the film with Marie Antoinette being under the guillotine, wanting to focus on the "ambivalence about where democracy leads".[24]Scott's writing process also involved hand-drawingstoryboards, with him sending Scarpa the illustrations once Scarpa sent him pages from the script.[26]
In August 2024, it was reported that Phoenix had threatened to leave the film unlessPaul Thomas Anderson(with whom Phoenix previously worked onThe Master) was recruited to rewrite the script. Eventually, the situation calmed down and Phoenix remained involved in the production.[27]Later that year, Scott confirmed that Anderson had indeed been brought in for rewrites, saying: "It turned into a lot of fun, actually. Three of us in this room screaming with laughter."[28]
Joaquin Phoenixwas reportedly attached to star as the French general and emperorNapoléon, reuniting him with the director afterGladiator(2000).[29]Scott had Phoenix and another actor in mind to play Napoléon, but felt "blown away" by Phoenix's performance inJoker(2019) and concluded that Phoenix could be an "amazing asset" forNapoleon, both creatively and commercially.[30]
The Last DuelactressJodie Comerwas reportedly Scott's first choice to play Joséphine. She entered negotiations to star in March 2021, confirmed her casting in September, and said: "I just jumped at the chance to work with Ridley and his team again and the idea of working with Joaquin, who's someone who I hugely admire... I'm so excited to delve into that world."[31][32]In November, she said her role was "going to be another huge challenge, but what I love about period dramas is that kind of transformation. Even now, doing some costume and hair tests forKitbag, it's just so exciting because it becomes so much easier to step out of yourself and into somebody else."[33]The same month,Youssef Kerkourwas confirmed to star.[34]On January 4, 2022, Comer revealed her departure from the film due toscheduling changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemicand described the situation as "rubbish".[35]Vanessa Kirbywas announced as her replacement later that day.[36]On January 18, 2022, producerKevin J. Walshsaid the film had been retitledNapoleon.[37]In February,Tahar Rahimwas added to the cast, in the role ofPaul Barras.[38]The historian Lorris Chevalier, who worked onThe Last Duel, became the historical advisor.[39]
Production began in February 2022.[38]The film features six major battle sequences, unlikeWaterloo(1970), another film featuring Napoleon, that focused on a single battle.[40]Napoleonwas shot under the working titleMarengo, a reference to theBattle of Marengo(1800).[41]Filming took place in Lincoln, England in March 2022.[42]The crew reportedly spent a week to prepareLincoln Cathedral, which stood in forNotre-Dame de Paris. Shooting took place in the cathedral on March 17 and 18, between 7am to 7pm.[43][44][45]
Filming also took place at other English locations:Stowe House,Buckinghamshire;[46]West Wycombe Park, Buckinghamshire;[47][48]Blenheim Palace,Oxfordshire;[49]Petworth House,West Sussex;[50]Boughton House,Northamptonshire;[51]and theOld Royal Naval College,Greenwich,London.[52]The execution of Marie Antoinette was filmed atSomerset Housein London.[53]
It was also shot inMaltafor three weeks, starting in May 2022.Fort RicasoliinKalkarawas transformed into the site of 1793'ssiege of Toulon, where Napoleon had his first victory.[54][55][56]The desert in the area ofMerzougainMoroccostood in for Egypt.[57][58]The film was shot in just 62 days.[59]
Napoleonpremiered atSalle Pleyelin Paris on November 14, 2023.[60]For the film's theatrical release,Apple Original Filmspartnered withSony Pictures Releasing, under theirColumbia Picturesbanner, to help exhibit the film worldwide.[61][62][63][64]It was released in cinemas first in the United States and the United Kingdom on November 22, 2023. In August 2023, Ridley Scott revealed that he had planned a director's cut ofNapoleonthat explored more of Empress Joséphine, and hoped that he would be able to release it in theaters and on Apple TV+, after the initial theatrical release.[65]Scott indicated that the director's cut would run four hours and ten minutes.[66]Napoleonwas released on digital platforms on January 9, 2024,[67]before streaming on March 1, 2024 on Apple TV+.[68][69][70]On August 29, 2024, the extended director's cut was released on streaming with an additional 48 minutes of footage,[5]which suggests that the planned director's cut was shortened.
Napoleongrossed $61.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $159.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $221.4 million.[8][9]In February 2024,Deadline Hollywoodreported that this gross fell short of covering the film's marketing budget, with revenues falling about $16 million behind. This shortfall was made up by home rentals, but according to the publication that still left an estimated a loss of around $165 million, equivalent to the production budget, for Apple.[71]In contrast, Apple insisted the film was profitable.[72]
In the United States and Canada,Napoleonwas released alongsideWishand the wide expansion ofSaltburn, and was originally projected to gross around $22 million from 3,500 theaters over its five-dayThanksgivingopening weekend.[73]After making $7.7 million on its first day (including $3 million from Tuesday night previews), estimates were raised to $29–33 million. It made $4.4 million on Thanksgiving Day and $8.4 million on Friday. The film went on to debut to $20.4 million in its opening weekend (and a total of $32.5 million over the five days), finishing second behind holdoverThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes.[74]It fell 65% in its second weekend to sixth place, grossing $7.1 million.[75]
Rebecca Rubin ofVarietynoted that under a traditional theatrical release, the film would need to gross $500–600 million worldwide in order tobreak-evengiven its $200 million budget. However, the success of the film could not be based solely on the box office, and would hinge on subscribers driven to Apple TV+ and "on-demand rentals and other revenue streams that wouldn't have been possible by going directly to streaming". Stephen Galloway, dean ofChapman University's film school, stated: "Apple making a $200 million movie is like you buying a cup of coffee and spilling it, but it's not making their brand look good if films [likeKillers of the Flower MoonandNapoleon] underperform at the box office."[76]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 58% of 336 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's consensus reads: "Ridley Scott is intent on proving the emperor has no clothes inNapoleon, a slyly funny epic with bravura set pieces and a divided runtime that keeps it from outright conquering."[77]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[78]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B−" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled byPostTrakgave it a 72% overall positive score, with 46% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[74]
Critics praised the film's epic scale, battle scenes, and Phoenix and Kirby's performances, while some took issue with the length and Scott's "bloated" direction.[79]French critics had a less enthusiastic view than those from Britain and America, consideringNapoleon"lazy, pointless, boring, migraine-inducing, too short and historically inaccurate."[80]A review inLe Figarostated that the film could have been called "BarbieandKenunder the Empire", and another in the French edition ofGQdeemed it to be "deeply clumsy, unnatural and unintentionally funny".[81]Patrice Gueniffey, a leading historian inNapoleonic studies, called the movie "anti-French and very pro-British" in an interview toLe Point.[82][83]
Writing inThe Guardian,Peter Bradshawgave the film a full five stars and called it a "thrilling biopic", concluding that Scott "doesn't withhold the old-fashioned pleasures of spectacle and excitement. Phoenix is the key to it all: a performance as robust as the glass of burgundy he knocks back: preening, brooding, seething and triumphing."[84]Writing inThe Observer, Wendy Ide gave it three out of five, calling it a "sturdy epic" that struggled to "show us what drove the military mastermind". She continued, "A man, even a man as combative as Napoleon, amounts to more than the battles he has fought. And it is in this respect that the film is less successful."[85]TheBBC's Nicholas Barber found the film's battle sequences "spectacular", and also praised the performances of Kirby and Phoenix.[86]Johnny Oleksinski of theNew York Postwrote: "[...] it's too bad Scott could not deliver a brilliant character study of one of the world's great military leaders — and instead settled for letting a self-indulgent Phoenix fly over the cuckoo's nest".[87]Time Out's Phil de Semylen gave the film three out of five, writing that "Ridley Scott's beefy account of Napoleon's rise to power looks great, is served with some panache, but crucially lacks flavour."[88]
FilmmakersReinaldo Marcus GreenandAdam Wingardboth citedNapoleonas among their favorite films of 2023, with Green describing it as "Classic and powerful filmmaking."[89]
Many critics of the film's historical aspects, including historiansAdam ToozeandAndrew Roberts, believed it ignored Napoleon's numerous non-military achievements, as well as his popularity with the French people.[106][107]Roberts, a Napoleon biographer, said his portrayal as a proto-Hitlerwas "as tired as it is absurd".[108][109]Historian Zack White agreed, arguing the film "swallowed old British propaganda" which depicted Napoleon as a "Corsican ruffian".[109]Ellin Stein, writing forSlate, pointed out that Napoleon was known for his passion for literature andEnlightenmentthought – a far cry from the boorish, loutish soldier that Scott depicts.[110]French historianPatrice Gueniffeycalled the movie "anti-French" and full of historical inaccuracies, while fellow historian Romain Marsily found the portrayal of Napoleon "lackluster" and “mediocre” while disregarding Napoleon's positive legacies such as theNapoleonic Code.[111][112]Spanish historian Francisco Gracia Alonso called the film "a crime".[113]Historian Joan Tumblety wrote that the movie ignored French atrocities such as those committed after theSiege of Jaffa.[114]
Napoleon did not attend the execution ofMarie Antoinette, as he was commanding forces atToulonat the time. The film additionally depicts a defeated Napoleon meeting Wellington, whereas in actuality, the two men never met.[115][116][117]OxfordhistorianMichael Broers, who worked on the movie, noted several inaccuracies in Napoleon and Josephine's relationship, including the timing of their divorce (1809, not 1807), its nature (Napoleon did not slap Josephine during their divorce), and its rationale (Josephine is portrayed as accepting the inevitability of the divorce, whereas in reality, she was fearful of it).[118]The historical Josephine also died the day before Napoleon's exile toElba, not a year later during theHundred Days, and thus was not a factor in Napoleon's return.[115]
The film presents Napoleon as firing on thePyramids of Giza, which never happened.[110]CairoegyptologistSalima Ikram pointed out that Napoleon held theSphinxand the pyramids in high esteem and used them as motivation for his troops. "He definitely did not take pot shots at them."[119]In an interview withThe Times, Scott defended his depiction of the attack on the pyramids as being "a fast way of saying [Napoleon] took Egypt".[120]
Major events of Napoleon's reign such as thePeninsular War, theSaint-Domingue expedition, theHaitian Revolution, theAustrian campaign of 1809and thecampaigns of 1813 and 1814are entirely omitted. The depiction of theBattle of Waterloosilences the roles of Dutch and German armies. Napoleon'smarshals, who played a key role in his campaigns, are almost entirely absent.[113]The film was criticized for ignoring Napoleon's decision toreinstate slaveryin France'soverseas coloniesin 1802 after it had been abolished by the National Convention following the French Revolution.[121]
HistorianPaul du Quenoycriticized the depiction of Napoleonic erabattlefield tactics, especially theAusterlitzsequence, "one of the few battles that the film depicts in detail". He noted that historians consider the ambush on the ice to be a myth of theAusterlitz campaign, "a minor detail whose significance has been doubted almost since the time of the battle".[115]Napoleon, an artillery officer by training, never personally led acavalry charge, as is shown atBorodinoandWaterloo.[116][122][123]Franz-Stefan Gady, writing forForeign Policy, described the battle sequences as "a Hollywood mishmash of medieval melees, meaningless cannonades, andWorld War I-styleinfantryadvances". "For all of Scott’s fixation on Napoleon’s battles, he seems curiously disinterested in how the real Napoleon fought them."[116]
Scott dismissed criticisms of these historical inaccuracies. "Napoleon dies then, ten years later, someone writes a book. Then someone takes that book and writes another, and so, 400 [sic] years later, there's a lot of imagination [in history books]. When I have issues with historians, I ask: 'Excuse me, mate, were you there? No? Well, shut the fuck up then.'"[120][124]Scott also declared, responding to French critics, that "the French don't even like themselves".[125]

Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.,doing business asColumbia Pictures, is an Americanfilmproductionanddistributioncompany that is the flagship unit of theSony Pictures Motion Picture Group,[2]a division ofSony Entertainment'sSony Pictures, which is one of the"Big Five" film studiosand a subsidiary of the multinational conglomerateSony Group Corporation.[3]
On June 19, 1918, brothersJackandHarry Cohnand their business partnerJoe Brandtfounded the studio asCohn-Brandt-Cohn (CBC) Film Sales Corporation.[4]It adopted the Columbia Pictures name on January 10, 1924 (operating as Columbia Pictures Corporation until December 23, 1968), went public two years later, and eventually began to use the image ofColumbia, the female personification of the United States, as its logo.
In its early years, Columbia was a minor player in Hollywood, but began to grow in the late 1920s, spurred by a successful association with directorFrank Capra. With Capra and others such as the most successful two reel comedy series,The Three Stooges, Columbia became one of the primary homes of thescrewball comedy. In the 1930s, Columbia's major contract stars wereJean ArthurandCary Grant. In the 1940s,Rita Hayworthbecame the studio's premier star and propelled their fortunes into the late 1950s.Rosalind Russell,Glenn FordandWilliam Holdenalso became major stars at the studio.
It is one of the leading film studios in the world, and was one of the so-called "Little Three" among the eight major film studios ofHollywood'sGolden Age.[5]Today, it has become the world's third largest major film studio.
The company was also primarily responsible for distributingDisney'sSilly Symphonyfilm series as well as theMickey Mousecartoon series from 1929 to 1932. The studio is presently headquartered at theIrving ThalbergBuilding on the formerMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(currently known as theSony Pictures Studios) lot inCulver City, California, since 1990.
Columbia Pictures is a member of theMotion Picture Association(MPA), under Sony Pictures Entertainment,[6]and is currently one of the five live-action labels of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, alongsideTriStar Pictures,Screen Gems,Sony Pictures Classics, and3000 Pictures. Columbia's most commercially successful franchises includeSpider-Man,Jumanji,Bad Boys,Men in Black,The Karate Kid,Robert Langdon, andGhostbusters, and the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwideisSpider-Man: No Way Home, which grossed $1.92 billion worldwide.
The studio was founded on June 19, 1918, as Cohn-Brandt-Cohn (CBC) Film Sales by brothersJackandHarry Cohnand Jack's best friendJoe Brandt, and released its first feature filmMore to Be Pitied Than Scornedon August 20, 1922. The film, with a budget of $20,000, was a success, bringing in $130,000 in revenue for the company.[7]Brandt was president of CBC Film Sales, handling sales, marketing and distribution from New York along with Jack Cohn, while Harry Cohn ran production in Hollywood. The studio's early productions were low-budget short subjects:Screen Snapshots, theHallroom Boys(the vaudeville duo ofEdward FlanaganandNeely Edwards), and theCharlie Chaplin-imitatorBilly West.[8]The start-up CBC leased space in aPoverty Rowstudio on Hollywood's famously low-rentGower Street. Among Hollywood's elite, the studio's small-time reputation led some to joke that "CBC" stood for "Corned Beef and Cabbage".[4]
CBC was reorganized asColumbia Pictures Corporationby brothersHarryandJack Cohnand best friendJoe Brandton January 10, 1924.[9]Harry Cohn became president in 1932 and remained head of production as well, thus concentrating enormous power in his hands. He would run Columbia for a total of 34 years, one of the longest tenures of any studio chief (Warner Bros.'Jack L. Warnerwas head of productionorCEO longer but did not become CEO until 1956). Even in an industry rife with nepotism, Columbia was particularly notorious for having a number of Harry and Jack's relatives in high positions. HumoristRobert Benchleycalled it the Pine Tree Studio, "because it has so many Cohns".[10]
Brandt eventually tired of dealing with the Cohn brothers, and in 1932 sold his one-third stake to Jack and Harry Cohn, who took over from him as president.
Columbia's product line consisted mostly of moderately budgeted features and short subjects including comedies, sports films, various serials, and cartoons. Columbia gradually moved into the production of higher-budget fare, eventually joining the second tier of Hollywood studios along withUnited ArtistsandUniversal. Like United Artists and Universal, Columbia was a horizontally integrated company. It controlled production and distribution; it did not own any theaters.
Helping Columbia's climb was the arrival of an ambitious director,Frank Capra. Between 1927 and 1939, Capra constantly pushed Cohn for better material and bigger budgets. A string of hits he directed in the early and mid 1930s solidified Columbia's status as a major studio. In particular,It Happened One Night, which nearly swept the 1934 Oscars, put Columbia on the map. Until then, Columbia's business had depended on theater owners willing to take its films, since it did not have a theater network of its own. Other Capra-directed hits followed, including the original version ofLost Horizon(1937), withRonald Colman, andMr. Smith Goes to Washington(1939), which madeJames Stewarta major star.[citation needed]
In 1933, Columbia hiredRobert Kallochto be its chief fashion and women's costume designer. He was the first contract costume designer hired by the studio,[11]and he established the studio's wardrobe department.[12]Kalloch's employment, in turn, convinced leading actresses that Columbia Pictures intended to invest in their careers.[13]
In 1938, the addition ofB. B. Kahaneas vice president would produceCharles Vidor'sThose High Grey Walls(1939), andThe Lady in Question(1940), the first joint film ofRita HayworthandGlenn Ford. Kahane would later become the President ofAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciencesin 1959, until his death a year later.
Columbia could not afford to keep a huge roster of contract stars, so Jack Cohn usually borrowed them from other studios. AtMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the industry's most prestigious studio, Columbia was nicknamed "Siberia", asLouis B. Mayerwould use the loan-out to Columbia as a way to punish his less-obedient signings. In the 1930s, Columbia signedJean Arthurto a long-term contract, and afterThe Whole Town's Talking(1935), Arthur became a major comedy star.Ann Sothern's career was launched when Columbia signed her to a contract in 1936.Cary Grantsigned a contract in 1937 and soon after it was altered to a non-exclusive contract shared withRKO.
Many theaters relied onwesternsto attract big weekend audiences, and Columbia always recognized this market. Its first cowboy star wasBuck Jones, who signed with Columbia in 1930 for a fraction of his former big-studio salary. Over the next two decades Columbia released scores of outdoor adventures with Jones,Tim McCoy,Ken Maynard,Jack Luden, Bob Allen (Robert (Tex) Allen),Russell Hayden,Tex Ritter,Ken Curtis, andGene Autry. Columbia's most popular cowboy wasCharles Starrett, who signed with Columbia in 1935 and starred in 131 western features over 17 years.[citation needed]
At Harry Cohn's insistence, the studio signedthe Three Stoogesin 1934. Rejected byMGM(which kept straight-manTed Healybut let the Stooges go),[14]the Stooges made 190 shorts for Columbia between 1934 and 1957. Columbia's short-subject department employed many famous comedians, includingBuster Keaton,Charley Chase,Harry Langdon,Andy Clyde, andHugh Herbert. Almost 400 of Columbia's 529 two-reel comedies were released to television between 1958 and 1961; to date, all of the Stooges, Keaton,Charley Chase,Shemp Howard,Joe Besser, andJoe DeRitasubjects have been released to home video.[15]
Columbia incorporated animation into its studio in 1929, distributingKrazy Katcartoons, taking over fromParamount. The following year, Columbia took over distribution of theMickey Mouseseries from Celebrity Productions until 1932. In 1933, The Mintz studio was re-established under theScreen Gemsbrand; Columbia's leading cartoon series wereKrazy Kat,Scrappy,The Fox and the Crow, and (very briefly)Li'l Abner.[16]Screen Gems was the last major cartoon studio to produce black-and-white cartoons, producing them until 1946. That same year, Screen Gems shut down but had completed enough cartoons for the studio to release until 1949. In 1948, Columbia agreed to release animated shorts fromUnited Productions of America; these new shorts were more sophisticated than Columbia's older cartoons, and many won critical praise and industry awards. In 1957, two years before the UPA deal was terminated, Columbia distributed theHanna-Barberacartoons, includingLoopy De Loopfrom 1959 to 1965, which was Columbia's final theatrical cartoon series. In 1967, the Hanna-Barbera deal expired and was not renewed.
According to Bob Thomas' bookKing Cohn, studio chief Harry Cohn always placed a high priority on serials. Beginning in 1937, Columbia entered the lucrative serial market and kept making these weekly episodic adventures until 1956, after other studios had discontinued them. The most famous Columbia serials are based on comic-strip or radio characters:Mandrake the Magician(1939),The Shadow(1940),Terry and the Pirates(1940),Captain Midnight(1942),The Phantom(1943),Batman(1943), and the especially successfulSuperman(1948), among many others.
Columbia also produced musical shorts, sports reels (usually narrated by sportscasterBill Stern), and travelogues. Its "Screen Snapshots" series, showing behind-the-scenes footage of Hollywood stars, was a Columbia perennial that the studio had been releasing since the silent-movie days; producer-directorRalph Staubkept this series going through 1958.
In the 1940s, propelled in part by the surge in audiences for their films duringWorld War II, the studio also benefited from the popularity of its biggest star,Rita Hayworth. Columbia maintained a long list of contractees well into the 1950s;Glenn Ford,Penny Singleton,William Holden,Judy Holliday,The Three Stooges,Ann Miller,Evelyn Keyes,Ann Doran,Jack Lemmon,Cleo Moore,Barbara Hale,Adele Jergens,Larry Parks,Arthur Lake,Lucille Ball,Kerwin MathewsandKim Novak.
Harry Cohn monitored the budgets of his films, and the studio got the maximum use out of costly sets, costumes, and props by reusing them in other films. Many of Columbia's low-budget"B" picturesand short subjects have an expensive look, thanks to Columbia's efficient recycling policy. Cohn was reluctant to spend lavish sums on even his most important pictures, and it was not until 1943 that he agreed to use three-stripTechnicolorin a live-action feature. Columbia was the last major studio to employ the expensive color process. Columbia's first Technicolor feature was the westernThe Desperadoes, starringRandolph ScottandGlenn Ford. Cohn quickly used Technicolor again forCover Girl, a Hayworth vehicle that instantly was a smash hit, released in 1944, and for the fanciful biography ofFrédéric Chopin,A Song to Remember, withCornel Wilde, released in 1945. Another biopic, 1946'sThe Jolson StorywithLarry ParksandEvelyn Keyes, was started in black-and-white, but when Cohn saw how well the project was proceeding, he scrapped the footage and insisted on filming in Technicolor.
In 1948, theUnited States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.anti-trustdecision forced Hollywood motion picture companies to divest themselves of the theater chains that they owned. Since Columbia did not own any theaters, it was now on equal terms with the largest studios. The studio soon replacedRKOon the list of the "Big Five" studios.
In 1946, Columbia dropped theScreen Gemsbrand from its cartoon line, but retained the Screen Gems name for various ancillary activities, including a 16 mm film-rental agency and a TV-commercial production company. On November 8, 1948, Columbia adopted theScreen Gems name for its television production subsidiarywhen the studio acquired Pioneer Telefilms, a television commercial company founded by Jack Cohn's son, Ralph.[17]Pioneer had been founded in 1947, and was later reorganized as Screen Gems.[17]The studio opened its doors for business in New York on April 15, 1949.[17]By 1951, Screen Gems became a full-fledged television studio and became a major producer ofsitcomsfor TV, beginning withFather Knows Bestand followed byThe Donna Reed Show,The Partridge Family,Bewitched,I Dream of Jeannie, andThe Monkees.
On July 1, 1956, studio veteran Irving Briskin stepped down as manager of Columbia Pictures and formed his own production company Briskin Productions, Inc. to release series through Screen Gems and supervise all of its productions.[18]On December 10, Screen Gems expanded intotelevision syndicationby acquiring Hygo Television Films (a.k.a. "Serials Inc.") and its affiliated company United Television Films, Inc. Hygo Television Films was founded in 1951 by Jerome Hyams, who also acquired United Television Films in 1955 that was founded by Archie Mayers.[19]
In 1957, two years before its parent company Columbia dropped UPA, Screen Gems entered a distribution deal withHanna-Barbera Productions, which produced classic animated series such asThe Flintstones,The Quick Draw McGraw Show,The Huckleberry Hound Show,The Yogi Bear Show,Jonny Quest,The JetsonsandTop Catamong others. Screen Gems distributed the company's shows until 1967, when Hanna-Barbera was sold toTaft Broadcasting. In 1960, the animation studio became a publicly traded company under the name Screen Gems, Inc., when Columbia spun off an 18% stake.
By 1950, Columbia had discontinued most of its popularseries films(Boston Blackie,Blondie,The Lone Wolf,The Crime Doctor,Rusty, etc.) OnlyJungle Jim, launched by producerSam Katzmanin 1949, kept going through 1955. Katzman contributed greatly to Columbia's success by producing dozens of topical feature films, includingcrime dramas,science-fictionstories, androck'n'rollmusicals. Columbia kept making serials until 1956 and two-reel comedies until 1957, after other studios had abandoned these mediums.
As the larger studios declined in the 1950s, Columbia's position improved. This was largely because it did not suffer from the massive loss of income that the other major studios suffered from the loss of their theaters (well over 90 percent, in some cases). Columbia continued to produce 40-plus pictures a year, offering productions that often broke ground and kept audiences coming to theaters. Some of its significant films from this era include the studio's adaptation of the controversialJames JonesnovelFrom Here to Eternity(1953),On the Waterfront(1954), andThe Bridge on the River Kwai(1957) withWilliam HoldenandAlec Guinness, all of which won theBest Picture Oscar. Another significant film of the studio was the free adaptation ofGeorge Orwell'sdystopian novelNineteen Eighty-Four(1956).
Columbia also released the productions of the English studioWarwick Films(by producersIrving AllenandAlbert R. Broccoli), as well as many films by producerCarl Foreman, who resided in England. Columbia distributed some films made byHammer, which was also based in England.
In December 1956, Jack Cohn, co-founder and executive vice-president, died.[20]In 1958, Columbia established its own record label,Colpix Records, initially run by Jonie Taps, who headed Columbia's music department, and laterPaul WexlerandLester Sill. Colpix was active until 1966 when Columbia entered into a joint agreement withRCA Victorand discontinued Colpix in favor of its new label,Colgems Records.
Shortly after closing their short subjects department, Columbia presidentHarry Cohndied of a heart attack in February 1958. His nephew Ralph Cohn died in 1959, ending almost four decades of family management.[21]
The new management was headed by Abe Schneider, who had joined the company as an office boy out of high school and become a director in 1929, rising through the financial side of the business.[22]In 1963, Columbia acquired music publisherAldon Music.[23]
By the late 1960s, Columbia had an ambiguous identity, offering old-fashioned fare such asA Man for All SeasonsandOliver!along with the more contemporaryEasy RiderandThe Monkees. After turning down releasingAlbert R. Broccoli'sEon ProductionsJames Bondfilms, Columbia hired Broccoli's former partnerIrving Allento produce theMatt Helmseries withDean Martin. Columbia also produced aJames Bondspoof,Casino Royale(1967), in conjunction withCharles K. Feldman, which held the adaptation rights forthat novel.
By 1966, the studio was suffering from box-office failures, and takeover rumors began surfacing. Columbia was surviving solely on the profits made from Screen Gems, whose holdings also included radio and television stations.[24]On December 23, 1968, Screen Gems merged with Columbia Pictures Corporation and became part of the newly formed Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. for $24.5 million.[25]Schneider was chairman of the holding company andLeo Jaffepresident.
Following the merger, in March 1969, CPI purchasedBell Recordsfor $3.5 million (mainly in CPI stock), retainingLarry Uttalas label president.
Nearly bankrupt by the early 1970s, the studio was saved via a radical overhaul: the Gower Street Studios (now called "Sunset Gower Studios") were sold and a new management team was brought in. In 1972, Columbia and Warner Bros. formed a partnership called The Burbank Studios, in which both companies shared theWarner studio lotinBurbank.
In 1971, Columbia Pictures established sheet music publisher Columbia Pictures Publications, with vice president and general managerFrank J. Hackinson, who later became the president.[26]
In 1973,Allen & Cotook a financial stake in Columbia Pictures Industries andAlan Hirschfieldwas appointed CEO,[27]succeedingLeo Jaffewho became chairman. Stanley Schneider, son of Abe Schneider (who became honorary chairman before leaving the board in 1975) was replaced as head of the Columbia Pictures studio byDavid Begelman, who reported to Hirschfield. Some years later Begelman was involved in a check-forging scandal that badly hurt the studio's image.
On May 6, 1974, Columbia retired theScreen Gemsname from television, renaming its television division to the name ofColumbia Pictures Television. The name was suggested byDavid Gerber, who was then president of Columbia's television division.[28]The same year, Columbia Pictures acquired Rastar Pictures, which included Rastar Productions, Rastar Features, and Rastar Television. Ray Stark then founded Rastar Films, the reincarnation of Rastar Pictures, which was acquired by Columbia Pictures in February 1980.[29]
Columbia Pictures also reorganized its music and record divisions.Clive Daviswas hired as a record and music consultant by Columbia Pictures in 1974 and later became temporary president ofBell Records. Davis's real goal was to revitalize Columbia Pictures' music division. With a $10 million investment by CPI, and a reorganization of the various Columbia Pictures legacy labels (Colpix,Colgems, and Bell), Davis introduced Columbia Pictures' new record division,Arista Records, in November 1974, with Davis himself owning 20% of the new venture. Columbia maintained control of the label until 1979, when it was sold toAriola Records. In addition, Columbia sold its music publishing business (Columbia-Screen Gems) toEMIin August 1976 for $15 million.[30]Both would later be reunited with Columbia Pictures under Sony ownership.
In December 1976, Columbia Pictures acquired the arcade game companyD. Gottlieb & Co.for $50 million.[31]
In 1978, Begelman was suspended for havingembezzledmoney from Columbia. Hirschfield was forced out for his refusal to reinstate him.[32][33]Begelman later resigned and was replaced byDaniel Melnickin June 1978.[34]Fay Vincentwas hired to replace Hirschfield.
Frank Pricebecame president of production in 1978. In March 1979, he would become president of Columbia Pictures, succeeding Melnick.[34]During Price's tenure he was responsible for turning out 9 of the top 10 grossing films in Columbia's history.[35]
In the fall of 1978,Kirk Kerkorian, a Vegas casino mogul who also controlledMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, acquired a 5.5% stake in Columbia Pictures.[36]He then announced on November 20, that he intended to launch a tender offer to acquire another 20% for the studio.[36]On December 14, a standstill agreement was reached with Columbia by promising not to go beyond 25% or seeking control for at least three years.[36]
On January 15, 1979, theUnited States Department of Justicefiled anantitrustsuit against Kerkorian to block him from holding a stake in Columbia while controlling MGM.[36]On February 19, 1979, Columbia Pictures Television acquired TOY Productions; the production company founded byBud Yorkinand writersSaul TurteltaubandBernie Orensteinin 1976.[37]In May, Kerkorian acquired an additional 214,000 shares in Columbia, raising his stake to 25%.[36]On August 2, the trial began; on August 14, the court ruled in favor for Kerkorian.[36]In 1979, Columbia agreed with Time-Life Video to release 20 titles onvideocassette.[38]
On September 30, 1980, Kerkorian sued Columbia for ignoring shareholders' interest and violating an agreement with him.[36]Columbia later accused him on October 2, of scheming withNelson Bunker Huntto gain control of Columbia.
In 1981, Kerkorian sold his 25% stake in Columbia back to CPI.[36]Columbia Pictures later acquired 81% ofThe Walter Reade Organization, which owned 11 theaters; it purchased the remaining 19% in 1985.
Around this time, Columbia putSteven Spielberg's proposed follow-up toClose Encounters of the Third Kind,Night Skies, intoturnaround. The project eventually became the highest-grossing film of the time,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Columbia received a share of the profits for its involvement in the development.[39]
On May 17, 1982, Columbia Pictures acquiredSpelling-Goldberg Productionsfor over $40 million.[40][41]With a healthier balance-sheet (due in large part to box office hits likeKramer vs. Kramer,Stir Crazy,The Blue Lagoon, andStripes) Columbia was bought by beverage companyThe Coca-Cola Companyon June 22, 1982, for $750 million.[42]Studio head Frank Price mixed big hits likeTootsie,Gandhi,The Karate Kid,The Big Chill, andGhostbusterswith many costly flops. To share the increasing cost of film production, Coke brought in two outside investors whose earlier efforts in Hollywood had come to nothing. In 1982, Columbia,Time Inc.'sHBOandCBSannounced, as a joint venture, "Nova Pictures"; this enterprise was to be renamedTri-Star Pictures.[43]In 1983, Price left Columbia Pictures after a dispute with Coca-Cola and went back to Universal.[44]He was replaced byGuy McElwaine.[45]
In the early 1980s, Columbia and Tri-Star Pictures set up a film partnership with Delphi Film Associates and acquired an interest in various film releases. In 1984, Delphi Film Associates III acquired an interest in the Tri-Star and Columbia film slate of 1984, which would make a $60 million offering in the financing of film production.[46]Also that year, Columbia Pictures had bought out the rights toHardbodies, which was once premiered onThe Playboy Channel.[47]
Columbia Pictures expanded its music publishing operations in the 1980s, acquiring Big 3 Publishing (the former sheet music operations of Robbins,Feist, andMiller) fromMGM/UA Communications Co.in 1983, Belwin-Mills Publishing fromSimon & Schusterin 1985, and Al Gallico Music in 1987.[48][49][50]
On June 18, 1985, Columbia's parent acquiredNorman LearandJerry Perenchio's Embassy Communications, Inc. (includingEmbassy Pictures, Embassy Television,Tandem Productions, and Embassy Home Entertainment), mostly for its library of television series such asAll in the FamilyandThe Jeffersons, for $485 million.[51]On November 16, 1985, CBS dropped out of the Tri-Star venture.[52]
Many changes occurred in 1986. Expanding its television franchise, on May 5, Columbia's parent also boughtMerv Griffin Enterprisesfor $250 million. The company was notable for:Wheel of Fortune,Jeopardy!,Dance Fever, andThe Merv Griffin Show.[53][54]Months later on August 28, the Columbia Pictures Television Group acquiredDanny Arnold's Danny Arnold Productions, Inc.. The deal included Arnold's rights to the sitcomBarney Miller(Four D Productions) among other produced series such asFish(The Mimus Corporation),A.E.S. Hudson Street(Triseme Corporation), andJoe Bash(Tetagram Ltd.). Arnold had dropped the federal and state lawsuits against the television studio, who was accusing them ofantitrustviolations, fraud, and breach offiduciary duty.[55][56][57]
Coca-Cola sold the Embassy Pictures division toDino de Laurentiis, who later folded Embassy Pictures into Dino de Laurentiis Productions, Inc. The company was renamed asDe Laurentiis Entertainment Group. Coca-Cola also sold Embassy Home Entertainment toNelson Entertainment. Coca-Cola, however, retained the Embassy Pictures name, logo, and trademark. HBO was the last partner to drop out of the Tri-Star venture and sold its shares to Columbia[58]Tri-Star later expanded into the television business with its new Tri-Star Television division.
The same year, Columbia recruited British producerDavid Puttnamto head the studio. Puttnam attempted to defy Hollywood filmmaking by making smaller films instead of big tentpole pictures. His criticism of American film production, in addition to the fact that the films he greenlit were mostly flops, left Coke and Hollywood concerned.[clarification needed]
Puttnam then discontinued multi-picture pacts with various filmmakers, includingNorman Jewison, which was permitted to expire before all of the promised product could be delivered.[59]Under Puttnam's control, he set up a $270 million package of in-house pictures and acquisitions, and the average lineup of 25 features was expected to be $10.78 million, about $4 million less of the cost at Columbia before Puttnam came on board, and a number of low-cost acquisitions such asSpike Lee's $5 million pictureSchool Daze.[60]
On October 22, 1986, Greg Coote was appointed by Columbia Pictures as key executive of the studio, to complement David Puttman's pledge on Columbia Pictures to fix its sights over its international market.[61]On December 17, 1986, the company acquired a 30% share in Roadshow, Coote & Carroll, a company Greg Coote headed, and decided that they would pick up films and miniseries to put an effort to add it up to Columbia's shares, and listed dozens of theatrical and television films and dozens of miniseries throughout the addition of the Columbia slate.[62]
On June 26, 1987, Coca-Cola sold The Walter Reade Organization toCineplex Odeon Corporation.[63]On October 14, 1987, Coca-Cola's entertainment division invested in $30 million inCastle Rock Entertainmentwith five Hollywood executives. Coke's entertainment business division owned 40% in Castle Rock, while the execs owned 60%.[64]
The volatile film business made Coke shareholders nervous, and following the critical and box-office failure ofIshtar, Coke spun off its entertainment holdings on December 21, 1987, and sold it to Tri-Star Pictures for $3.1 billion. Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. (CPE), with Coke owning 80% of the company.[65]Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names.[66]
Puttnam was ousted from the position after only one year.[67]Puttnam was succeeded byDawn Steel. Other small-scale, "boutique" entities were created:Nelson Entertainment, a joint venture with British and Canadian partners,Triumph Films, jointly owned with French studioGaumont, and which is now a low-budget label, andCastle Rock Entertainment.
On January 2, 1988, Columbia/Embassy Television and Tri-Star Television were formed into the new Columbia Pictures Television and Embassy Communications was renamed as ELP Communications to serve as a copyright holder of the Embassy television productions. In early 1988, CPE relaunchedTriumph Filmsas Triumph Releasing Corporation, which handled administrative services related to distribution of Columbia and Tri-Star's films for the North American market, while Triumph was responsible for the sales, marketing and distribution of Columbia andTri-Starfilms under the direction of each individual studio internationally, with Patrick N. Williamson serving as head of Triumph.[68]
On January 16, 1988, CPE's stock fell slightly in the market on its first day trading in theNew York Stock Exchange. Coke spun off 34.1 million of its Columbia shares to its shareholders by reducing its stake in CPE from 80% to 49%.[69]On April 13, 1988, CPE spun off Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. as a reformed company of the Tri-Star studio.[70]In April 1988, CPE sold its music publishing operations to the British company Filmtrax.[71](Filmtrax was acquired byThorn EMIin 1990.)[72]In June 1988, CPE announced the sale of Columbia Pictures Publications (consisting of the print music operations) to the investment firm Boston Ventures and was renamed CPP/Belwin.[73]CPP/Belwin was acquired byWarner Chappell Musicof Warner Bros. in 1994.[74]
On February 2, 1989, Columbia Pictures Television formed a joint-venture with Norman Lear's Act III Communications called Act III Television (now Act III Productions) to produce television series instead of managing.[75][76]
On September 28, 1989, the Columbia Pictures empire was sold to the electronics giantSony, one of severalJapanese firms then buying American properties, for the amount of $3.4 billion.[77]The sale netted Coca-Cola a profit from its investment in the studio.[78][79]Sony then hired two producers,Peter GuberandJon Peters, to serve as coheads of production when Sony also acquired the Guber-Peters Entertainment Company (the former game show production company,Barris Industries) for $200 million on September 29, 1989.[80]Guber and Peters had just signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros. in 1989, having been with the company since 1983. Warner Bros., then a subsidiary ofWarner Communications, sued Sony for $1 billion.[81]Sony completed CPE's acquisition on November 8, and the Guber-Peters acquisition was completed on the following day.
On December 1, 1989, Guber and Peters hired a longtime lawyer of GPEC, Alan J. Levine, to the post of president and COO of Columbia's newly formed company Filmed Entertainment Group (FEG).[82]FEG consisted of Columbia Pictures, Tri-Star Pictures, Triumph Releasing, Columbia Pictures Television, Columbia Pictures Television Distribution, Merv Griffin Enterprises, RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video (internationally known as RCA/Columbia Pictures International Video), Guber-Peters Entertainment Company, and ancillary and distribution companies.
In 1990, Sony ended up paying hundreds of millions of dollars, gave up a half-interest in itsColumbia House Records Clubmail-order business, and bought fromTime Warnerthe formerMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) studio lot in Culver City, which Warner Communications had acquired in its takeover ofLorimar-Telepicturesin 1989, thus ending the Burbank Studios partnership. Initially renamedColumbia Studios, Sony spent $100 million to refurbish the rechristenedSony Pictures Studioslot.
Guber and Peters set out to prove they were worth this fortune, but though there were to be some successes, there were also many costly flops. The same year,Frank Pricewas made the chairman of Columbia Pictures. His company Price Entertainment, Inc., which he founded in 1987, was merged with Columbia in March 1991. Price left Columbia on October 4, 1991, and was replaced by Warner Bros. executiveMark Cantonand reactivated Price Entertainment as Price Entertainment Company with a nonexclusive deal with SPE.[83]Peters was fired by his partner Guber in 1991, but Guber later resigned in 1994 to formMandalay Entertainmentthe following year.[84]The entire operation was reorganized and renamed Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) on August 7, 1991,[85]and at the same time, TriStar (which had officially lost its hyphen) relaunched its television division in October. In December 1991, SPE createdSony Pictures Classicsfor arthouse fare and was headed byMichael Barker,Tom Bernard, and Marcie Bloom,[86]who previously operatedUnited Artists ClassicsandOrion Classics. Publicly humiliated, Sony suffered an enormous loss on its investment in Columbia, taking a $2.7 billion write-off in 1994.John Calleytook over as SPE president in November 1996, installingAmy Pascalas Columbia Pictures president andChris Leeas president of production at TriStar. By the next spring, the studios were clearly rebounding, setting a record pace at the box office.[87]On December 7, 1992, Sony Pictures acquired the Barry & Enright game show library.[88]
On February 21, 1994, Columbia Pictures Television and TriStar Television merged to formColumbia TriStar Television(CTT),[89][90][91]including the rights toWheel of FortuneandJeopardy!after CTT folded Merv Griffin Enterprises in June.[92][93]That same year, the company also purchasedStewart Television, known for producing game shows such asPyramidandChain Reaction, among others. On July 21, 1995, Sony Pictures teamed up withJim Henson Productionsand created the joint venture Jim Henson Pictures.[94][95]
In the 1990s, Columbia announced plans for a rivalJames Bondfranchise since they owned the rights toCasino Royaleand were planning to make a third version ofThunderballwithKevin McClory. MGM andDanjaq, LLC, owners of the franchise,sued Sony Pictures in 1997, with the legal dispute ending two years later in an out-of-court settlement. Sony traded theCasino Royalerights for $10 million, as well as theSpider-Manfilming rights.[96]The superhero became Columbia's most successfulfranchise:[97]The first moviecame out in 2002, and as of 2021, there have been seven follow-up movies with US grosses in excess of $2.5 billion.[98]Between the releases of the first and second sequels in 2004 and 2007, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, giving it distribution rights to theJames Bondfranchise.
In 1997, Columbia Pictures ranked as the highest-grossing movie studio in the United States, with a gross of $1.256 billion. In 1998, Columbia and TriStar merged to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group (a.k.a. Columbia TriStar Pictures), though both studios still produce and distribute under their own names. Pascal retained her position as president of the newly united Columbia Pictures, while Lee became the combined studio's head of production.[99]On December 8, 1998, Sony Pictures Entertainment relaunched the Screen Gems brand as a horror and independent film distribution company after shutting down Triumph Films.[100]In 1999, TriStar Television was folded into CTT. Two years later, CPT was folded into CTT as well.
In the 2000s, Sony broadened its release schedule by backingRevolution Studios, the production/distribution company headed byJoe Roth. On October 25, 2001, CTT and Columbia TriStar Television Distribution (CTTD) merged to form Columbia TriStar Domestic Television.[101]On September 16, 2002, Columbia TriStar Domestic Television was renamedSony Pictures Television.[102]Also in 2002, Columbia broke the record for biggest domestic theatrical gross, with a tally of $1.575 billion, coincidentally breaking its own record of $1.256 billion, set in 1997. The 2002 gross was primarily raised by such blockbusters asSpider-Man,Men in Black II, andXXX.[103]
The studio was also the most lucrative of 2004,[103]with over $1.338 billion in the domestic box office with films such asSpider-Man 2,50 First Dates, andThe Grudge,[104]and in 2006. Columbia's box office successes of 2006 included such blockbusters asThe Da Vinci Code,The Pursuit of Happyness,Monster House,Casino Royale, andOpen Season. The studio not only finished the year in first place, but also reached an all-time record high sum of $1.711 billion, which was an all-time yearly record for any studio. It was surpassed by Warner Bros. in 2009.[105]
On October 29, 2010,Matt Tolmach, the copresident of Columbia Pictures, stepped down to produceThe Amazing Spider-Manandits sequel. Doug Belgrad, the other copresident of Columbia, was promoted to sole president of the studio. Belgrad and Tolmach had been copresidents of the studio since 2008 and had been working together as a team since 2003.[106][107]The same day, Hanna Minghella was named president of production of Columbia.[106][107]
On November 18, 2012, Sony Pictures announced it has passed the profit line of $4 billion worldwide with the success of Columbia's releasesSkyfall,The Amazing Spider-Man,21 Jump Street,Men in Black 3, andHotel Transylvaniaand Screen Gems' releasesUnderworld: Awakening,The Vow, andResident Evil: Retribution.[108]
On July 16, 2014, Doug Belgrad was named president of the Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group.[109]He exited the post in June 2016. On June 2,Sanford Panitch, who had been the head of international local language production at the studio, was named president of Columbia Pictures.[110]
In April 2021, Sony signed a deal withNetflix, Inc.andThe Walt Disney Companythat allows Sony's titles from 2022 to 2026 to stream onNetflix,HuluandDisney+. Netflix signed for exclusive "pay 1 window" streaming rights, which is typically an 18-month window following its theatrical release,[111]and Disney signed for "pay 2 window" rights for the films, which would be streamed onDisney+andHuluas well as broadcast on Disney's linear television networks.[112]
On December 17, 2021, Columbia releasedSpider-Man: No Way Home. The movie grossed over $1 billion in the box office, being the first film since the start of theCOVID-19 pandemicto gross a billion.[113][114]The film became Sony Pictures' highest-grossing release.[115]tom 2 2022
On January 10, 2024, Sony Pictures celebrated the centennial anniversary of the founding of Columbia Pictures with a new motion logo; the centennial print logo was previously revealed on November 14, 2023.[116][117]The motion logo, which was used throughout Columbia's 2024 slate, made its theatrical debut in the 2024 re-release ofSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse(2023).[118]
The Columbia Pictures logo, featuring the Torch Lady, a woman carrying a torch and wearing a drape (representingColumbia, apersonificationof the United States), has gone through five major changes.[119][120][121]It has often been compared to theStatue of Liberty, which was an inspiration to the Columbia Pictures logo.[121]
Originally in 1924, Columbia Pictures used a logo featuring a female Roman soldier holding a shield in her left hand and a stick of wheat in her right hand, which was based on actressDoris Doscher(known as the model for the statue on thePulitzer Fountain) as theStanding Liberty quarterused from 1916 to 1930, though the studio's version was given longer hair.[122]The logo changed in 1928 with a new woman wearing a drapedflagand torch. The woman wore aheaddress, thestolaand carried thepallaofancient Rome, and above her were the words "A Columbia Production" ("A Columbia Picture" or "Columbia Pictures Corporation") written in an arch. The illustration was based upon the actressEvelyn Venable, known for providing the voice of theBlue FairyinWalt Disney'sPinocchio.
An alternative logo in tandem with the 1924 and 1928 versions that used the slogan "Gems of the Screen"; itself a takeoff on the song "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean", later inspired the renaming of the Charles Mintz Studio intoScreen Gems.[citation needed]
In 1936, the logo was changed into the well known classic look: the Torch Lady now stood on a pedestal, wore no headdress, and the text "Columbia" appeared in chiseled letters behind her. A new form of animation was used on the logo as well, with a torch that radiates light instead of flickers.Pittsburghnative Jane Chester Bartholomew, whomHarry Cohndiscovered working as an extra at Columbia, portrayed the Torch Lady in the logo. There were several variations to the logo over the years—significantly, a color version was done in 1943 forThe Desperadoes.[121]Two years earlier, the flag became just a drape with no markings.[119][120]The latter change came after a federal law was passed making it illegal to wear an American flag as clothing. In the 1950s, the woman's robe was redrawn and shaded with a plunging neckline and an exposed slipper-clad foot. 1976'sTaxi Driverwas one of the last films released before the "Torch Lady" was revamped.
From 1955 to 1963, Columbia used the woman from the 1936 logo under the Screen Gems banner, officially billing itself as part of "the Hollywood studios of Columbia Pictures", as spoken at the end of some Screen Gems series.
From 1976 to 1993,[119]Columbia Pictures used two logos. The first, from 1976 to 1981 (or from 1975 for promotional material until 1982 for international territories) used just a sunburst representing the beams from the torch, although the woman appears briefly in the opening logo. The score accompanying the first logo was composed bySuzanne Ciani. The studio hired visual effects pioneerRobert Abelto animate the first logo.[123]The image was created with over fifty light exposures that included streak and special filter passes. The woman returned in 1981, but in a much smoother form described as resembling aCoke bottle.[119]During the studio's run with Coca-Cola, a golden version of the Torch Lady was used for the Columbia Pictures Television logo with the byline "A unit of the Coca-Cola Company" from 1982 to 1987 until it was replaced with the 1981 version and the byline was removed after Coke sold Columbia to Sony. The slogans for the 1976 and 1981 logos were "Let us entertain you" and "Movies That Matter", respectively.
From 1982 to 1985, Columbia used the 1981 logo for Triumph Films, with the woman under theArc De Triomphein the logo. The 1981 logo along with the 1936 and 1976 versions would be later used in 21st century Columbia releases, generally to match the year a given film is set in.
In 1992, the longest-running, and perhaps best known, iteration of the logo was created; the television division was the first to use it. Films began to use the new logo the year after, when Scott Mednick and the Mednick Group were hired by Peter Guber to create logos for all the entertainment properties then owned by Sony Pictures.[124]Mednick hired New Orleans artistMichael Deas,[125]to digitally repaint the logo and return the woman to her "classic" look.[126]An urban legend is that actressAnnette Beningwas the model for the current logo. Bening's face was later superimposed onto the Torch Lady in the opening intro ofWhat Planet Are You From?(2000) as an inside joke.
Michael Deas hired Jennifer Joseph, a 28-year-old graphics artist forThe Times-Picayune, as a model for the logo.[127]Due to time constraints, she agreed to help out on her lunch break. It was the first and only time she ever modeled. Joseph had recently discovered she was pregnant at the time.[128]Deas also hiredThe Times-Picayunephotographer Kathy Anderson to photograph the reference photography.[129]The animation was created by Synthespian Studios in 1993 by Jeff Kleiser andDiana Walczak, who used 2D elements from the painting and converted it to 3D.[130]The studio being part of Sony would not be referenced on-screen until 1996. VHS promos featured the current logo with a stylized "75" behind the Torch Lady, commemorating the studio's 75th anniversary in 1999 with the slogan, "Lighting Up Screens Around the World".
In 2012, the current logo was displayed as a painting at theOgden Museum of Southern Artin New Orleans. Deas gave an interview toWWL-TV: "I never thought it would make it to the silver screen and I never thought it would still be up 20 years later, and I certainly never thought it would be in a museum, so it's kind of gratifying."[131]On November 14, 2023, Sony unveiled a special centennial logo ahead the studios’ 100th anniversary, consisting of the current Torch Lady within a stylized “100” and later posted an animation that showcases the older logos in the same vein as theSpider-Versefilms on January 10, 2024, the 100th anniversary of the founding of Columbia Pictures. This logo was used on Columbia's 2024 releases.[132]
The current logo was also used forScreen Gems Networkand Columbia Showcase theatre, both now defunct programming blocks that featured syndicated airings of Sony Pictures-owned shows and films, respectively.

My mum brought three boys up: my dad was in the army and so he was frequently away. Duringthe warand post-war, we tended to travel following him around so my mum was the boss. She laid down the law and the law was God. We just said, "Yup, okay" – we didn't argue. I think that's where the respect has come from, because she was tough.
Scott was born on 30 November 1937 inSouth Shields, to Francis ("Frank") Percy Scott, a partner in a commercial shipping business based in Newcastle who would serve as aColonelin theRoyal Engineersduring theSecond World War, and Elizabeth, née Williams, a miner's daughter.[12][13]His grand-uncle Dixon Scott was a pioneer of the cinema chain and opened many cinemas aroundTyneside. One of his cinemas,Tyneside Cinema, is still operating inNewcastleand is the last remainingnewsreelcinema in the UK.[14]
Born two years before theSecond World Warbegan, Scott was brought up in a military family. His father, as a senior officer in the Royal Engineers, was absent for most of his early life. His elder brother, Frank, joined theMerchant Navywhen he was still young and the pair had little contact.[15]During this time the family moved around; they lived inCumberlandas well as other areas in England, in addition toWalesand Germany, where Colonel Scott was part of the post-warAllied Control Council.[12]After the war, the Scott family moved back toCounty Durhamand eventually settled onTeesside.[citation needed]
His interest in science fiction began by reading the novels ofH. G. Wellsas a child.[16]He was also influenced by science-fiction films such asIt! The Terror from Beyond Space,The Day the Earth Stood Still, andThem!He said these films "kind of got [him] going a little" but his attention was not fully caught until he sawStanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odyssey, about which he said, "Once I saw that, I knew what I could do."[16]He went toGrangefield Grammar SchoolinStockton on Teesand obtained a diploma in design atWest Hartlepool College of Art.[17]The industrial landscape in West Hartlepool would later inspire visuals inBlade Runner, with Scott stating, "There were steelworks adjacent to West Hartlepool, so every day I'd be going through them, and thinking they're kind of magnificent, beautiful, winter or summer, and the darker and more ominous it got, the more interesting it got."[18]
I use everything I learned every day at art school. It's all about white sheets of paper, pens and drawing.
Scott went on to study at theRoyal College of Artin London, contributing to the college magazineARKand helping to establish the college film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film,Boy and Bicycle, starring both his younger brother and his father (the film was later released on the "Extras" section ofThe DuellistsDVD). In February 1963, Scott was named in the title credits as "Designer" for the BBC television programmeTonight.
After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police seriesZ-Carsand science fiction seriesOut of the Unknown. He was originally assigned to design the secondDoctor Whoserial,The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the serial'seponymous alien creatures. Shortly before he was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant he was replaced byRaymond Cusick.[20]In 1965, he began directing episodes of television series for the BBC, only one of which, an episode ofAdam Adamant Lives!, is available commercially.[21]
In 1968, Ridley and his younger brotherTony Scott– who would also go on to become a film director[22]– founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.[23]Working alongsideAlan Parker,Hugh Hudsonand cinematographerHugh Johnson, Ridley Scott made many commercials at RSA during the 1970s, including a 1973Hovisbread advertisement, "Bike Round" (underscored by the slow movement ofDvořák's "New World" symphonyrearranged for brass), filmed inGold Hill, Shaftesbury, Dorset.[1][24]A nostalgia themed television advert that captured the public imagination, it was voted the UK's favourite commercial in a 2006 poll.[25][26]In the 1970s theChanel No. 5brand needed revitalisation having run the risk of being labelled as mass market and passé.[27]Directed by Scott in the 1970s and 1980s, Chanel television commercials were inventive mini-films with production values of surreal fantasy and seduction, which "played on the same visual imagery, with the same silhouette of the bottle."[27]
Five members of the Scott family are directors, and all have worked for RSA.[28]His brother Tony was a successful film director whose career spanned more than two decades; his sonsJakeandLukeare both acclaimed directors of commercials, as is his daughter,Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles; Luke is based in London. In 1995,Shepperton Studioswas purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds.[29]
The Duellists(1977) marked Ridley Scott's first feature film as director. Shot in continental Europe, it was nominated for the main prize at theCannes Film Festival, and won an award for Best Debut Film.The Duellistshad limited commercial impact internationally. Based onJoseph Conrad's short story "The Duel" and set during theNapoleonic Wars, it follows two FrenchHussarofficers, D'Hubert and Feraud (Keith CarradineandHarvey Keitel) whose quarrel over an initially minor incident turns into a bitter extended feud spanning fifteen years, interwoven with the larger conflict that provides its backdrop. The film has been acclaimed for providing a historically authentic portrayal of Napoleonic uniforms and military conduct.[30][31]The 2013 release of the film on Blu-ray coincided with the publication of an essay on the film in a collection of scholarly essays on Scott.[32]
Scott had originally planned next to adapt a version ofTristan and Iseult, but after seeingStar Wars, he became convinced of the potential of large scale, effects-driven films. He accepted the job of directingAlien, the 1979 horror/science-fiction film that would win him international success. Scott made the decision to switchEllen Ripleyfrom the standard male action hero to aheroine.[33]Ripley (played bySigourney Weaver), who appeared in the first fourAlienfilms, would become a cinematic icon.[33]The final scene ofJohn Hurt's character has been named by a number of publications as one of the most memorable in cinematic history.[34]Filmed atShepperton Studiosin England,Alienwas thesixth highest-grossing film of 1979, earning over $104 million worldwide.[35]Scott was involved in the 2003 restoration and re-release of the original film. In promotional interviews at the time, Scott indicated he had been in discussions to make a fifth film in theAlienfranchise. However, in a 2006 interview, Scott remarked that he had been unhappy aboutAlien: The Director's Cut, feeling that the original was "pretty flawless" and that the additions were merely a marketing tool.[36]Scott later returned toAlien-related projects when he directedPrometheusandAlien: Covenantthree decades after the original film's release.[37]
OutsideStar Wars, no sci-fi universe has been etched into cinematic consciousness more thoroughly thanBlade Runner. Ridley Scott's definitive 1982 neo-noir offered an immersive dystopia of rain-soaked windows and shadowy buildings adorned with animated neon billboards, where flying cars hum through the endless night.
After a year working on the film adaptation ofDune, and following the sudden death of his brother Frank, Scott signed to direct the film version ofPhilip K. Dick's novelDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?Re-titledBlade Runnerand starringHarrison Ford, the film was a commercial disappointment in cinemas in 1982, and was criticised by Pauline Kael in theNew Yorkerwho wrote "...Scott doesn't seem to have a grasp of how to use words as part of the way a movie moves. "Blade Runner" is a suspenseless thriller; it appears to be a victim of its own imaginative use of hardware and miniatures and mattes. At some point, Scott and the others must have decided that the story was unimportant; maybe the booming, lewd and sultry score by Chariots-for-Hire Vangelis that seems to come out of the smoke convinced them that the audience would be moved even if vital parts of the story were trimmed."[39]
In response to the review, Scott said: "...It was four pages of destruction. I never met her. I was so offended. I framed those pages and they've been in my office for 30 years to remind me there's only one critic that counts and that's you. I haven't read critiques ever since. Because if it's a good one, you can get a swollen head and forget yourself. And if it's a bad one, you're so depressed that it's debilitating."[40]The movie is now widely regarded as a classic.[41][42]In 1991, Scott's notes were used byWarner Bros.to create a rusheddirector's cutwhich removed the main character's voiceover and made a number of other small changes, including to the ending. Later Scott personally supervised a digital restoration ofBlade Runnerand approved what was calledThe Final Cut. This version was released in Los Angeles, New York City andTorontocinemas on 5 October 2007, and as an elaborate DVD release in December 2007.[43]
Today,Blade Runneris ranked by many critics as one of the most important and influential science fiction films ever made,[44]partly thanks to its much imitated portraits of a future cityscape.[45]It is often discussed along withWilliam Gibson's novelNeuromanceras initiating thecyberpunkgenre. Stephen Minger, stem cell biologist at King's College London, states, "It was so far ahead of its time and the whole premise of the story – what is it to be human and who are we, where we come from? It's the age-old questions."[46]Scott has describedBlade Runneras his "most complete and personal film".[47]
In 1985, Scott directedLegend, a fantasy film produced byArnon Milchan. Scott decided to create a "once upon a time" tale set in a world of princesses, unicorns and goblins, filming almost entirely inside the studio. Scott castTom Cruiseas the film's hero, Jack;Mia Saraas Princess Lili; andTim Curryas theSatan-horned Lord of Darkness.[48]Scott had a forest set built on the007 StageatPinewood Studiosin Buckinghamshire, with trees 60 feet high and trunks 30 feet in diameter.[49]In the final stages of filming, the forest set was destroyed by fire;Jerry Goldsmith's original score was used for European release, but replaced in North America with a score byTangerine Dream. Rob Bottin provided the film's Academy Award-nominated make-up effects, most notably Curry's red-coloured Satan figure. Despite a major commercial failure on release, the film has gone on to become acult classic. The 2002 Director's Cut restored Goldsmith's original score.[50]
Scott madeSomeone to Watch Over Me, a romantic thriller starringTom BerengerandMimi Rogersin 1987, andBlack Rain(1989), a police drama starringMichael DouglasandAndy García, shot partially in Japan. The latter was very well received at the box office.Black Rainwas the first of Scott's six collaborations with the composerHans Zimmer.[51][52]
In 1984, Scott directed a big-budget ($900,000) television commercial, "1984", to launchApple Computer'sMacintoshcomputer.[53]Scott filmed the advertisement in England for about $370,000;[54]which was given a showcase airing in the US on 22 January 1984, duringSuper Bowl XVIII, alongside screenings in cinemas.[55]Some consider this advertisement a "watershed event" in advertising[56]and a "masterpiece".[57]Advertising Ageplaced it top of its list of the 50 greatest commercials.[58]
Set in a dystopian future modelled afterGeorge Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Four, Scott's advertisement used its hero (portrayed by English athleteAnya Major) to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by her whitetank topadorned with a picture of the Apple Macintosh computer) as a means of saving humanity from "conformity" (Big Brother), an allusion toIBM, at that time the dominant force in computing.[59]
The road filmThelma & Louise(1991) starringGeena Davisas Thelma,Susan Sarandonas Louise, in addition to the breakthrough role forBrad Pittas J.D, proved to be one of Scott's biggest critical successes, helping revive the director's reputation and receiving his first nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Director.[60][61]His next project, independently funded historical epic1492: Conquest of Paradise, was a box office failure. The film recounts the expeditions to the Americas byChristopher Columbus(French starGérard Depardieu). Scott did not release another film for four years.
In 1995, Ridley and his brother Tony formed a production company,Scott Free Productions, in Los Angeles. All Ridley's subsequent feature films, starting withWhite Squall(starringJeff Bridges) andG.I. Jane(starringDemi Moore), have been produced under theScott Freebanner. In 1995 the two brothers purchased a controlling interest in the British film studioShepperton Studios. In 2001, Shepperton merged withPinewood Studiosto becomeThe Pinewood Studios Group, which is headquartered in Buckinghamshire, England.[62]
Scott's historical dramaGladiator(2000) proved to be one of his biggest critical and commercial successes. It won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for the film's starRussell Crowe, and saw Scott nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Director.[2]Scott worked with British visual effects companyThe Millfor the film's computer-generated imagery, and the film was dedicated toOliver Reedwho died during filming – The Mill created a digital body double for Reed's remaining scenes.[63][64]Some have creditedGladiatorwith reviving the nearly defunct "sword and sandal" historical genre. The film was named the fifth best action film of all time in theABCspecialBest in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time.[65]
Scott directedHannibal(2001) starringAnthony Hopkinsas Hannibal Lecter. The film was commercially successful despite receiving mixed reviews. Scott's next film,Black Hawk Down(2001), featuringTom Hardyin his film debut, was based on a group of stranded US soldiers fighting for their lives inSomalia; Scott was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director.[2]In 2003, Scott directed a smaller scale project,Matchstick Men, adapted from the novel byEric Garciaand starringNicolas Cage,Sam RockwellandAlison Lohman. It received mostly positive reviews but performed moderately at the box office.
In 2005, he made the modestly successfulKingdom of Heaven, a film about theCrusades. The film starredOrlando Bloom, and marked Scott's first collaboration with the composerHarry Gregson-Williams.[66]The Moroccan government sent the Moroccan cavalry as extras for some battle scenes.[67]Unhappy with the theatrical version ofKingdom of Heaven(which he blamed on paying too much attention to the opinions of preview audiences in addition to relenting when Fox wanted 45 minutes shaved off), Scott supervised a director's cut of the film, the true version of what he wanted, which was released on DVD in 2006.[68]The director's cut ofKingdom of Heavenhas been met with critical acclaim, withEmpiremagazine calling the film an "epic", adding: "The added 45 minutes in the director's cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle."[69]"This is the one that should have gone out" reflected Scott.[69]Asked if he was against previewing in general in 2006, Scott stated: "It depends who's in the driving seat. If you've got a lunatic doing my job, then you need to preview. But a good director should be experienced enough to judge what he thinks is the correct version to go out into the cinema."[70]
Scott teamed up again withGladiatorstarRussell CroweforA Good Year, based on the best-selling book byPeter Mayleabout an investment banker who finds a new life inProvence. The film was released on 10 November 2006. A few days laterRupert Murdoch, chairman of studio20th Century Fox(who backed the film) dismissedA Good Yearas "a flop" at a shareholders' meeting.[71]
Scott's next film wasAmerican Gangster, based on the story of real-life drug kingpinFrank Lucas. Scott took over the project in early 2006 and had screenwriterSteven Zaillianrewrite his script to focus on the dynamic between Frank Lucas andRichie Roberts.Denzel Washingtonsigned on to the project as Lucas, with Russell Crowe co-starring as Roberts. The film premiered in November 2007 to positive reviews and box office success, and Scott was nominated for aGolden Globe for Best Director.[2]
In late 2008, Scott's espionage thrillerBody of Lies, starringLeonardo DiCaprioand Russell Crowe, opened to lukewarm ticket-sales and mixed reviews. Scott directed a revisionist adaptation ofRobin Hood, which starred Russell Crowe asRobin HoodandCate BlanchettasMaid Marian. It was released in May 2010 to mixed reviews, but a respectable box-office.
On 31 July 2009, news surfaced of a two-part prequel toAlienwith Scott attached to direct.[37][72]The project, ultimately reduced to a single film calledPrometheus, which Scott described as sharing "strands ofAlien's DNA" while not being a direct prequel, was released in June 2012. The film starredCharlize TheronandMichael Fassbender, withNoomi Rapaceplaying the leading role of the scientist named Elizabeth Shaw. The film received mostly positive reviews and grossed $403 million at the box office.[73][74]
In August 2009, Scott planned to direct an adaptation ofAldous Huxley'sBrave New Worldset in adystopianLondon withLeonardo DiCaprio.[75]In 2009, the TV seriesThe Good Wifepremiered with Ridley and his brotherTonycredited as executive producers.
On 6 July 2010, YouTube announced the launch ofLife in a Day, an experimental documentary executive produced by Scott.

Scott directedThe Counselor(2013), with a screenplay by authorCormac McCarthy.[80][81]On 25 October 2013,Indiewirereported that "Before McCarthy sold his first spec script for Scott's (The Counselor) film, the director was heavily involved in developing an adaptation of the author's 1985 novelBlood Meridianwith screenwriterBill Monahan(The Departed). But as Scott said in aTime Outinterview, '[Studios] didn't want to make it. The book is so uncompromising, which is what's great about it.' Described as an 'anti-western'..."[82]Scott directed thebiblically inspiredepic filmExodus: Gods and Kings, released in December 2014 which received negative reviews from critics (particularly for the casting of white actors asMiddle Easterncharacters) and grossed $268 million worldwide on a $140 million budget, making it afinancial disappointment.

We cannot let one person's action affect the good work of all these other people.

Scott's first television directing role in 50 years,Raised by Wolves, was released onHBO Maxin 2020.[130][131]Scott said his "tendency was to think, 'I don't want to go down that road of androids again'", but decided to take on the project after he read the script and liked it.[131]The show revolves around androids Mother and Father, who attempt to save humankind on planet Kepler-22b after earth is demolished by war between the Mithraic, who follow a god called Sol, and militant atheists.[132]
In August 2022, it was announced Scott would executive produce theApple TV+seriesDope Thief, written byPeter Craigand starringBrian Tyree Henry, and would also direct an episode.[133]
Scott was married to Felicity Heywood from 1964 to 1975. The couple had two sons,JakeandLuke,[134]both of whom work as directors in Scott's production company, Ridley Scott Associates. Scott later married advertising executive Sandy Watson in 1979, with whom he had a daughter,Jordan Scott, also a director, and divorced in 1989.[135]In 2015 he married actressGiannina Facio,[136]whom he has cast in all his films sinceWhite SquallexceptAmerican GangsterandThe Martian.[137]He divides his time between homes in London, France, and Los Angeles.[83]
His eldest brother Frank died, aged 45, of skin cancer in 1980.[138]His younger brotherTony, who was also his business partner in their companyScott Free, died on 19 August 2012 at the age of 68 after jumping from theVincent Thomas Bridgewhich spans Los Angeles Harbor, after an originally disputed long struggle with cancer.[139]Before Tony's death, he and Ridley collaborated on aminiseriesbased onRobin Cook's novelComaforA&E.

In 2013, Scott stated that he is anatheist.[143]Although when asked by theBBCin a September 2014 interview if he believes in God, Scott replied:
I'm not sure. I think there's all kinds of questions raised... that's such an exotic question. If we looked at the whole thing practically speaking, the Big Bang occurred and then we go through this evolution of millions, billions of years where, by coincidence, all the right biological accidents came out the right way. To an extent, that doesn't make sense unless there was a controlling decider or mediator in all of that. So who was that? Or what was that? Are we one big grand experiment in the basic overall blink of the universe, or the galaxy? In which case, who is behind it?[144]
Scott's frequent collaboratorRussell Crowecommented, "I like being on Ridley's set because actors can perform [...] and the focus is on the performers."[145]Paul M. Sammon, in his bookFuture Noir: The Making ofBlade Runner, commented in an interview with Brmovie.com that Scott's relationship with his actors has improved considerably over the years.[146]More recently during the filming of Scott's 2012 film,Prometheus,Charlize Theronpraised the director's willingness to listen to suggestions from the cast for improvements in the way their characters are portrayed on screen. Theron worked alongside the writers and Scott to give more depth to her character during filming.[147]When working on epics, Scott states, "there's always the danger that the characters can get swamped" on a large canvas, before adding, "My model isDavid Lean, whose characters never got lost in the proscenium."[148]
Scott's work is identified for its striking visuals, withheroinesalso a common theme.[2][11][149][150]Los Angeles Timesfilm editor Joshua Rothkopf wrote "Scott may be the movies' most consistent stealth feminist".[109]His visual style, incorporating a detailed approach to production design and innovative, atmospheric lighting, has been influential on a subsequent generation of filmmakers.[2][3]James Cameroncommented, "I love Ridley's films and I love his filmmaking, I love the beauty of the photography, I love the visceral sense that you're there, that you're present."[151]Scott commonly uses slow pacing until the action sequences. Examples includeAlienandBlade Runner; theLos Angeles Timescritic Sheila Benson, for example, would call the latter "Blade Crawler" "because it's so damn slow". Scott claims to have aneidetic memory, which he says aids him in visualising and storyboarding the scenes in his films.[152]
Scott has developed a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: "I like working, always, with a minimum of three cameras. [...] So those 50 set-ups [a day] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up. So you're finished. I mean, if you take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and – whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up – then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on."[145]
Artificial intelligenceis a theme that appears in several of Scott's films, includingBlade Runner,Alien, andPrometheus.[153]The 2013 bookThe Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scottidentifies pioneering computer scientistAlan Turingand the philosopherJohn Searleas presenting relevant models of testing artificial intelligence known as theTuring testand theChinese RoomThought Experiment, respectively, in the chapter titled "What's Wrong with Building Replicants", which has been a recurring theme for many of Scott's films.[154]The chapter titled "Artificial Intelligence inBlade Runner,Alien, andPrometheus," concludes by citing the writings ofJohn Stuart Millin the context of Scott's Nexus-6 Replicants inBlade Runner(Rutger Hauer), the androidAsh(Ian Holm) inAlien, and the androidDavid 8(Michael Fassbender) inPrometheus, where Mill is applied to assert that measures and tests of intelligence must also assess actions and moral behaviour in androids to effectively address the themes which Scott explores in these films.[155]
Scott providesaudio commentariesand interviews for all his films where possible. In the July 2006 issue ofTotal Filmmagazine, he stated: "After all the work we go through, to have it run in the cinema and then disappear forever is a great pity. To give the film added life is really cool for both those who missed it and those who really loved it."[70]
The positive reaction to theBlade RunnerDirector's Cutencouraged Scott to re-cut several movies that were a disappointment at the time of their release (includingLegendandKingdom of Heaven), which have been met with acclaim.[69]Today the practice of alternative cuts is more commonplace, though often as a way to make a film stand out in the DVD marketplace by adding new material.
Scott wasknightedin the2003 New Year Honoursfor services to the British film industry.[156]He received his accolade fromQueen Elizabeth IIat an investiture ceremony atBuckingham Palaceon 8 July 2003.[5]Scott admitted feeling "stunned and truly humbled" after the ceremony, saying, "As a boy growing up inSouth Shields, I could never have imagined that I would receive such a special recognition. I am truly humbled to receive this treasured award and believe it also further recognises the excellence of the British film industry."[157]He was appointed aKnight Grand CrossbyKing Charles IIIin 2024.[158]
He has been nominated for threeAcademy Awards for Directing—Thelma & Louise,GladiatorandBlack Hawk Down—as well as threeBritish Academy Film Awardsfor Best Director, fourGolden Globe Awardsfor Best Director, and twoPrimetime Emmy Awards. In 1995, Ridley and his brotherTonyreceived theBAFTAforOutstanding British Contribution To Cinema.[7]In 2018 he received the highest accolade from BAFTA, theBAFTA Fellowship, for lifetime achievement.[4][7]
Scott was inducted into theScience Fiction Hall of Famein 2007.[159]In 2017 the German newspaperFAZcompared Scott's influence on the science fiction film genre to SirAlfred Hitchcock's onthrillersandJohn Ford's onWesterns.[160]In 2011, he received astaron theHollywood Walk of Fame.[161]
Scott has received threeHugo Awardsin the category ofBest Dramatic PresentationforAlien,Blade RunnerandThe Martian.[162][163]In 2012, Scott was among the British cultural icons selected by artist SirPeter Blaketo appear in a new version of his most famous artwork, theBeatles'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Bandalbum cover, to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires to mark his 80th birthday.[164]On 3 July 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by theRoyal College of Artin a ceremony at theRoyal Albert Hallin London at which he described how he still keeps on his office wall his school report placing him 31st out of 31 in his class, and how his teacher encouraged him to pursue what became his passion at art school.[165][166]

Soon after their second child was born, they joined the religious cultChildren of Godand travelled throughout theCaribbeanandSouth Americaas missionaries, where the next two children were born. They eventually became disillusioned with the group and left in 1977, being opposed to the cult's increasingly distorted rules, particularly the practice offlirty fishing.[13]The fifth child was born in Florida where the family settled; around this time they legally adopted the surname Phoenix, inspired by themythical birdthat rises from its own ashes, symbolizing a new beginning.[1]When Joaquin was three, he and his older siblings witnessed fish being stunned as "they were throwing them against the side of the boat", prompting the whole family to convert to aveganlifestyle.[14]At this time, Phoenix first referred to himself as "Leaf", having been inspired by spending time outdoors raking leaves and wanting a nature-related name like his siblings'.[2]He reverted to his birth name, Joaquin, at age 15.[1]
In 1979, when Phoenix's father had to stop working because of an old spinal injury, the family moved to Los Angeles where the mother met a high-profile child agent namedIris Burton, who got the children into commercials and bit parts on TV.[15]Phoenix made his acting debut alongside his brother in the television seriesSeven Brides for Seven Brothersin the 1982 episode "Christmas Song".[16]He has said of his first acting experience:
Instantaneous joy. The most enjoyable thing. For some kids, it's the first time they crack a ball or score a goal. For me, it was this. I was eight years old, and I remember the first scene on the TV set so vividly. And I knew that I loved it – the physical sensation; how powerful it was. That's the feeling I've been chasing ever since.[17]
In 1984, Phoenix starred opposite his brother River in theABC Afterschool SpecialentitledBackwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia, for which they shared a nomination for Best Young Actor in a Family Film Made for Television at the6th Youth in Film Awards.[18]He also made guest appearances in theMurder, She Wroteepisode "We're Off to Kill the Wizard", and individual episodes ofThe Fall GuyandHill Street Blues.[19][20]A year later, he appeared in the television filmKids Don't Tell.

The film premiered at the1995 Cannes Film Festivaland became a financial and critical success, withNew York TimescriticJanet Maslinpraising Phoenix's performance, writing "So pity poor Jimmy. Rivetingly played by Mr Phoenix with a raw, anguished expressiveness that makes him an actor to watch for, Jimmy is both tempted and terrified by Suzanne's slick amorality. In that, he speaks for us all."[30][31]
In 1997, Phoenix played a small-town troublemaker inOliver Stone'sU Turn, and a poor man in love with a rich woman inInventing the Abbotts. The films were received with mostly mixed and negative reviews, respectively, and neither performed well at the box office.[32][33]The following year, Phoenix starred inClay Pigeonsas a young man in a small town who befriends a serial killer.

To this date, they are the only brothers to hold this distinction.[39]

The filmpremieredat theTelluride Film Festivaland was a modest art house success grossing a total of$17 millionat the box office.[42]It was received with critical praise withPeter TraversofRolling Stonepraising Phoenix and his chemistry with Winslet, stating "Phoenix, on a roll this year with Gladiator and The Yards, excels at making the priest a seductive figure—a neat trick considering the real Abbe was a four-foot hunchback. Winslet and Phoenix generate real fire, notably when Abbe dreams of ravishing Madeleine on the altar."[43]For his combined roles of that year, Phoenix was awarded theBroadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actorand theNational Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor.[44]
The following year, Phoenix starred in the satirical filmBuffalo Soldiersas aU.S. Armysoldier. The world premiere was held at the 2001Toronto International Film Festivalin early September.

The science fictionthrillerSigns(2002) marked Phoenix's first collaboration with directorM. Night Shyamalan. In the film, he played Merrill Hess, a formerMinor League baseballplayer who, along with his older brother Graham (Mel Gibson), discovers that Earth has been invaded byextraterrestrials. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but Phoenix's performance was praised, with critic Peter Travers writing that Phoenix "registers impressively, finding the humor and the pain in this lost boy [...] never making a false move as a helpless Merrill watches his rock of a brother crumble into a despairing crisis of faith."[48]The film was a commercial success, grossing$408.2 millionworldwide.[49]
In 2003, Phoenix played the irresolute husband of a superstar-skater (Claire Danes) inThomas Vinterberg's romance-dramaIt's All About Love,[50]and voiced Kenai in theDisneyanimated filmBrother Bear.

He admitted that he was afraid of heights before he started making this film, recalling "I got to the pole and I looked down and I couldn't do it. But you go through the training and it exposes your fears and helps you to overcome them. We ended up rappelling off a six-story tower and that really helped."[59]The film earned$102.3 millionat the box office[60]despite receiving generally mixed reviews.[61]Roger Ebertgave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the performances in the film.[62]Phoenix's final film of 2004 wasTerry George'sHotel Rwanda, playing cameraman Jack Daglish.

The closing credits make it clear it's Joaquin Phoenix doing the singing, and I was gob-smacked".[69]For his portrayal of Johnny Cash, he won theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedyand theGrammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Mediafor the film's soundtrack.[70]Phoenix also received a second Academy Award nomination, his first in theBest Actorcategory as well as a second BAFTA nomination.[71]Earlier that year, he narratedEarthlings(2005), a documentary about the investigation of animal abuse infactory farms, and pet mills, and for scientific research.

Phoenix's first producing task was the action thrillerWe Own the Night(2007), in which he played nightclub manager Bobby Green/Grusinsky who tries to save his brother (Mark Wahlberg) and father (Robert Duvall) fromRussian mafiahitmen. The James Gray-directed film premiered at the2007 Cannes Film Festivalto mixed reviews;[74]Roger Ebert praised Gray's direction and the acting, but criticized its screenplay for lack of originality.[75]David EdelsteinofNew Yorkmagazine commended Phoenix for elevating the film's conflict, writing that it "might be heavy-handed without Phoenix's face—his irresolution somehow more powerful than other actors' resolve. There is no artifice. He's not an actor disappearing into a role but a man disappearing into himself [...] Phoenix homes in on the truth of this person. It's the paradox of the greatest acting".[76]
Later that year, he played a father obsessed with finding out who killed his son in ahit-and-run accidentin his second feature with Terry George, the crime drama filmReservation Road. The film received mixed reviews from critics;[77]Peter Travers praised Phoenix's acting stating "Even the best actors—and I'd rank Joaquin Phoenix andMark Ruffaloamong their generation's finest—can't save a movie that aims for tragedy but stalls at soap opera."[78]Phoenix also executive produced the television show4Real, a half-hour program which began airing in 2007. The series showcased celebrity guests on global adventures "in order to connect with young leaders who are creating social and economic change".[79]
In 2008, Phoenix starred as a suicidal bachelor torn between the family friend his parents wish he would marry and his beautiful but volatile new neighbor in Gray'sTwo Lovers. The romantic drama premiered at the2008 Cannes Film Festival. Reviews for the film and Phoenix's performance were positive;The New York Times Magazine's chief critic called it his best performance to date[80]and Ray Bennett ofThe Hollywood Reporterfelt that Phoenix led the film with "great intelligence and enormous charm, making his character's conflict utterly believable".[81]During the promotion ofTwo Lovers, Phoenix had started to film his next performance for themockumentaryfilmI'm Still Here(2010), which the media felt overshadowed the former's theatrical release.[82]I'm Still Herepurports to follow the life of Phoenix, from the announcement of his retirement from acting, through his transition into a career as ahip hopartist managed by rap iconSean "Diddy" Combs.[83]Directed by Phoenix's then brother-in-lawCasey Affleckand co-written by Affleck and Phoenix, the little-seen film premiered at the67th Venice International Film Festivalto mixed reviews;[84]critics were divided on whether to interpret the film as documentary or performance art.[85]After its release, Phoenix explained that the idea for the feature arose from his amazement that people believed reality television shows' claims of being unscripted. By claiming to retire from acting, he and Affleck planned to make a film that "explored celebrity, and explored the relationship between the media and the consumers and the celebrities themselves" through their film.[86][87]
In 2011, it was announced that Phoenix would star inPaul Thomas Anderson's drama filmThe Master, which traces the relationship between Freddie Quell (Phoenix), aWorld War IInavy veteran struggling to adjust to a post-war society and Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a leader of a religious movement known as "The Cause". To create the character, Phoenix lost a significant amount of weight and went to a dentist to help force his jaw shut on one side; a trait his own father had.[88]The film premiered at the2012 Venice Film Festivalwhere he won theVolpi Cup for Best Actor.[89]Theart house filmonly grossed$28 million[90]but was received with critical acclaim, with Phoenix's performance receiving high praise.[91]Peter Travers called it the performance of his career writing "Acting doesn't get better or go deeper[...]Phoenix wears the role like a second skin. You can't take your eyes off him." His performance as Freddie was described as "career-defining" byTodd McCarthyofThe Hollywood Reporter, who was impressed that Anderson and Phoenix collaboratively were able to build such complex work around such a derelict figure.[92][93]Fellow actorDaniel Day-Lewispublicly lauded the "remarkable" Phoenix while accepting the Screen Actors Guild Award, apologizing for the fact that Phoenix hadn't been nominated for the same award.[94]Despite this, Phoenix received his third Academy, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for his leading role.[95]
Phoenix and Gray's fourth collaboration came withThe Immigrant(2013), a drama film in which he played the supporting role of apimpwho prostitutesPolishimmigrant Ewa (Marion Cotillard) and ends up falling for her.The Immigrantand his performance premiered to highly positive reviews at the2013 Cannes Film Festival.[96]In his review,Ignatiy VishnevetskyofThe A.V. Clubthought the film featured one of his best performances and commended Phoenix's and Gray's developing work, writing of that "the two are so perfectly in sync, that it's hard to tell where Phoenix's performance ends and Gray's visual style[...]—begins", further lauding their development of Bruno into "a fully fledged tragic character, even though he is neither the protagonist ofThe Immigrantnor the main driving force behind its plot".[97]
His next feature film of that year was theSpike Jonze-directed romantic science-fiction dramaHer. He played Theodore Twombly, a man who develops a relationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), an intelligent computer operating system personified through a female voice. Released to critical acclaim, critic A.A. Dowd ofThe A.V. Clublabeled Phoenix as "one of the most emotionally honest actors in Hollywood", impressed at how he effortlessly unleashes waves of vulnerability in the film's many tight, invasive close-up images, calling it a "tremendous performance, one that rescues this character—a mess of insecurities, regrets, and desires—from the walking pity party he could have been".[98]Herearned more than double of its production budget,[99]and Phoenix received his fourth nomination at the Golden Globes.[100]Several journalists expressed disappointment over his failure to receive an Oscar nomination for it,[101]withPeter KnegtofIndieWirenaming it of one of ten worst Oscar actingsnubsof the last decade in 2015.[102]
In 2014, Phoenix took on the role of Doc Sportello, aprivate investigatorandhippie/dope headtrying to help his ex-girlfriend solve a crime in the crime comedy-dramaInherent Vice, based onThomas Pynchon's detectivenovel of the same name. Reviews toward the film were positive; critics praised Phoenix's performance and Paul Thomas Anderson's direction, while some were frustrated by its complicated plot.[103]Robbie CollinofThe Daily Telegraphtermed Phoenix as Anderson's "perfect leading man" and his work as "the kind of quietly dazzling performance that rarely wins awards but will be adoringly dissected and quoted for decades".[104]Phoenix earned his fifth Golden Globe nomination for the film.[105]
After narrating the sequel toEarthlings, the 2015animal rights' documentaryUnity,[106]Phoenix teamed with directorWoody AllenandEmma Stonein the crime mystery filmIrrational Man. He played Abe Lucas, a philosophy professor experiencing anexistential crisis. The film was released to mixed reviews at the2015 Cannes Film Festival;The Hollywood Reporterfelt that the film was too similar to Allen's previous films, but praised Phoenix's chemistry with Stone and Phoenix for playing the character "with a wonderful baggy, lived-in quality that makes us want to climb inside the character's whiskey-sozzled head".[107]
The thrillerYou Were Never Really Here, written and directed byLynne Ramsayand based on the novella of the same name byJonathan Ames, ranks among the most acclaimed films of Phoenix's career.[108]The film is about Joe (played by Phoenix), a traumatized formerFBI agentandGulf Warveteran who tracks down missing girls for a living. To prepare for the film, Phoenix was advised by a former bodyguard who goes on international missions to rescue children suffering sexual exploitation and abuse by human traffickers; he gained a significant amount of weight and muscle for the part.[109]Phoenix was Ramsay's first and only choice to play the veteran, with Ramsay calling him "my soulmate in making movies".[110]The film premiered at the2017 Cannes Film Festival, where earned Phoenix theCannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor.[111]Justin Changof theLos Angeles Timesdescribed Phoenix's performance as "the most rivetingly contained" work of his career[112]and Dominick Suzanne-Mayer ofConsequencenoted that his evocative manners in the film, led to him giving career-high work and "the kind of haunting turn that only comes around a few times every decade or so".[113]
In 2018, Phoenix portrayed Jesus in the biblical dramaMary Magdalene, written byHelen Edmundsonand directed byGarth Davis. The film, and his performance, received mixed reviews; a reviewer forEntertainment Weeklythought that Phoenix lacked the quiet compassion and grace that was required for the role, while Nick Allen of Roger Ebert's website described his performance as "a human being who is visibly tormented by the power and wisdom that works through him", deeming it one of the best portrayals of Jesus ever.[114][115]His next two features — the biopicDon't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Footand the crime dramaThe Sisters Brothers— were much better received. In the former, Phoenix reunited with hisTo Die Fordirector Gus Van Sant to portrayquadriplegiccartoonistJohn Callahan. Barry Hertz ofThe Globe and Mailwrote that there's no better leading actor producing better work than Phoenix, stating "The actor—never a simple chameleon, but someone who disappears into a role entirely with a frightening conviction—continues to display new and tremendous range here" and David Hughes ofEmpirethought that in a more conventional film, Phoenix would be the favorite to win an Academy Award.[116][117]
The third film of 2018 wasThe Sisters Brothers,Jacques Audiard's adaptation of thenovel of the same namebyPatrick deWitt. The film starredJohn C. Reillyand Phoenix as the notorious assassin brothers Eli and Charlie Sisters respectively and chronicles their chase after two men who have banded together to search for gold. Writing for Roger Ebert's website, Tomris Laffly commented on Phoenix's and Reilly's "tremendous chemistry" and Lindsey Behr of theAssociated Pressopined that the duo "excellently manage all the various tones in the film" they also shared credit withJake GyllenhaalandRiz Ahmed.[118][119]Also in 2018, he collaborated with Rooney Mara andSiato narrate Chris Delforce's documentaryDominion.[120]Animal rights activists have called it one of the most powerful documentaries ever made.[121]For his contribution to the documentary, Phoenix was granted the 2018 Award of Excellence for Narration by Hollywood International Independent Documentary Awards.[122]
In 2019, Phoenix starred as theDC ComicscharacterJokerinTodd Phillips's psychological thrillerJoker; an alternativeorigin storyfor the character. Set in 1981, the film follows Arthur Fleck, a failed clown and stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent counter-cultural revolution against the wealthy in a decayingGotham City. Phoenix lost 52 pounds (24 kg) in preparation,[123]and based his laugh on "videos of people suffering frompathological laughter" they also shared credit withRobert De Niro.[124]Released to critical acclaim at the76th Venice International Film Festival,[125]the film experienced a polarized critical reception after its theatrical release. While Phoenix's performance received rave reviews, the dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided opinions and generated concerns of inspiring real-life violence; the movie theater where the2012 Aurora, Colorado, mass shootingoccurred during a screening ofThe Dark Knight Risesrefused to show it.[126]Despite this,Jokerbecame a box office success grossing over$1 billion(against its$55 millionproduction budget), the firstR-rated filmto do so, becoming Phoenix's highest-grossing film.[127]Pete Hammond ofDeadlinewrote of Phoenix's "extraordinary" performance, describing it as "dazzling risky and original"[128]andThe Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called his performance the "must-see factor" of the film, writing "he inhabits [the character] with an insanity by turns pitiful and fearsome in an out-there performance that's no laughing matter[...]Phoenix is the prime force that makes Joker such a distinctively edgy entry in the Hollywood comics industrial complex."[129]The film earned him numerous awards, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, aSAGand aCritic's Choice Awardfor Best Actor.[130]
In 2020, Phoenix served as an executive producer onGunda, directed byViktor Kossakovsky. The acclaimed documentary follows the daily life of a pig, two cows, and a one-legged chicken.[131]That same year, Phoenix was named on the list of the 25 Greatest Actors of the 21st Century byThe New York Times. The list was compiled by famed criticsManohla DargisandA.O. Scottand Phoenix's paragraph was written by his frequent collaborator, director James Gray.[132]
In 2021, he starred inMike Mills' dramaC'mon C'mon, as Johnny, a radio journalist who embarks on a cross-country trip with his young nephew. TheA24film premiered at the48th Telluride Film Festivalwhere it scored the best per-venue average for a limited release since the start of theCOVID-19 pandemicupon its release.[133][134]Angelica Jade Bastién ofVulturepraised Phoenix, writing "a tremendous showing from Joaquin Phoenix, operating at a register he's rarely found before. It's a career best for him—lovely, empathetic, humane[...]He possesses a warmth that glows from beginning to end. As Johnny, Phoenix listens to people and the world around him with full-bodied curiosity. This is where the bravura lies in the performance: his ability to seemingly just be."[135]
Phoenix starred as Beau Wassermann, thetitle characterinAri Aster'ssurrealistblacktragicomedyBeau Is Afraid(2023), which was released on April 14, 2023, before a wide release the following week. In it, he portrays a mild-mannered butparanoia-ridden man who embarks on a surreal odyssey to get home to his mother, confronting his greatest fears along the way.[136]The actor shared the cast withAmy Ryan,Nathan LaneandPatti LuPone. The film received generally favourable reviews, with critics crediting Aster's direction and Phoenix and his "sheer commitment" to the role, for giving the film its "undeniable power".[137]Tomris Laffly ofTheWrapcalled his performance as Beau "one of his best performances", praising his ability to act with "a startling level of vulnerability[...]both enigmatic and translucently bare".[138]Phoenix received his seventh Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the film.[139]
Phoenix portrayedNapoleon BonaparteinNapoleon, his second collaboration with director Ridley Scott, released in November 2023, withVanessa KirbyasJoséphine de Beauharnais. The film grossed over$200 millionand received mixed reviews (though mostly negative reviews in France), mostly criticized for its pacing and historical inaccuracies. For example, the French GQ magazine called the film "deeply clumsy, unnatural, and unintentionally awkward."[140]In 2024, Phoenix reprised his role as Joker in Phillips' sequelJoker: Folie à DeuxwithLady GagaasHarley Quinn.[141]Unlike the first film, it emerged as a critical and commercial failure.[142]
Phoenix will next reunite with Lynne Ramsay inPolaris, co-starring Rooney Mara, and with Ari Aster in the contemporary Western filmEddington.[143][144]He was originally set to star alongsideDanny Ramirezin a film byTodd Haynes, a sexually explicit "love story between two men" set in 1930s Los Angeles.[145]Phoenix had co-written it with Haynes, advising him to "go further" with the explicit material, which Haynes said would have likely made it anNC-17rated film.[146]The project was cancelled when Phoenix abruptly exited five days before filming began.[147][148]
"When I was 15 or 16 my brother River [Phoenix] came home from work and he had a VHS copy of a movie calledRaging Bulland he sat me down and made me watch it. And the next day he woke me up, and he made me watch it again. And he said, "You're going to start acting again, this is what you're going to do." He didn't ask me, he just told me. And I am indebted to him for that because acting has given me such an incredible life".
At the beginning of his career, Phoenix was often referred to as "the second most famous Phoenix", his name associated most closely with the death of his brotherRiver Phoenix.[8]The media would often compare the two, withThe New York Timesdescribing Joaquin as "sweetly unsettling and endlessly vulnerable" compared to his brother's "pure all-American blond boyishness".[150]After his brother died, Phoenix gained a reputation for his distrust of the media, with many speculating that it is derived from how River's death was covered by the press. He was often asked about the day River died, and still is to this date. Phoenix has described these interviews as "insincere" and has felt that they impeded on the mourning process.[8][151]
Caroline Frost ofThe Huffington Posthas said that Phoenix is "engaging, engaged, mischievous, honest" in person andAnderson Cooperof60 Minutesthought that he was "wry, shy and couldn't be any more friendlier" adding that Phoenix "just doesn't like to talk about himself".[152]Although known for his intensity and darkness on-screen, directorJames Graywho worked with Phoenix in four feature films, says that Phoenix is very different off-screen saying "He's actually very tender and sweet and sensitive. It's almost as if he channels his intensity into the characters. Like the work is an outlet for his darker side."[110][153]
Phoenix has been described as one of the finest actors of his generation.[150][154][155][156]As he achieved stardom afterGladiator(2000), he was conveniently ruled out ofteen-idolroles because of his hard gaze and scarred lip.[154]Justin Chang, analyzing his career inLos Angeles Timesin 2020, remarked that filmmakers immediately seemed to recognize that Phoenix was more than a heartthrob, and that there was "something more tortured, more vulnerable and infinitely more interesting at play beneath the surface". He noted that through his work, Phoenix is challenging and redefining cinematic manhood and that this quality sets him apart from most of his contemporaries.[155]Film criticandfilm historianLeonard Maltinhas called Phoenix "a true chameleon", writing 
"[Phoenix] commands the screen and breaks your heart; he makes us feel it all vicariously."[157]
Phoenix is particularly known for his ability to heavily commit to each role he plays and his intense preparations, deeply immersing himself in the characters, often blurring the lines between fiction and reality.[158][8]That immersion was particularly evident during the filming of themockumentaryI'm Still Here(2010), when Phoenix announced to the world that he was retiring from acting to become a rapper. Throughout the filming period, Phoenix remained in character for public appearances, giving many the impression that he was genuinely pursuing a new career. Media outlets worldwide believed that Phoenix was having amental breakdownafter his infamous appearance onThe Late Show with David Letterman.[159]Confusion from the media turned to concern as the seemingly drug-addled Phoenix continued his attempts to convince crowds he was serious about a rap career. Many worried his erratic behavior was a sign he was stuck in a downward spiral, and headed down the same self-destructive path that took the life of his older brother. Although widely suspected to be a mockumentary, the fact that the events of the film had been deliberately staged was not disclosed until after the film had been released.[85]To this day, some people believe he went through a personal meltdown during the filming period.[8][160]Phoenix has credited the making ofI'm Still Herefor allowing him to make bolder choices in acting.[150]
Phoenix contends there's no real methodology to the roles he chooses, but has said that he is drawn to complex characters.[161]He speculates that his affinity for dark roles derives from something more ineffable, possiblyprenatalsaying that "I think there is a combination of nature and nurture[...]—and some of it is my upbringing." Even so, Phoenix remains reluctant to draw a line between his unusual childhood, his private tragedy and his talent for "inhabiting the morose, damaged, violent, and otherwise anxiety-riddled characters".[8]James Gray has described Phoenix as "one of the most incorruptible people I've ever known, and the least superficial", and has spoken of his acting, saying that he admires Phoenix's "limitless ability to surprise you in the best ways and inspire you to move in a direction that you haven't thought of originally, better than what you have in mind".[132][110]
Garth Davis, who directed Phoenix inMary Magdalene(2018), has remarked that he does not applymethod acting, but said that working with Phoenix is like "working with this beautiful wild animal, where you have to give him the space to be free, so his performance can roam freely: raw, uncontrived and truly natural. If he smells the design of the scene, you lose his free spirit; if the script is weak, he will expose its flaws. He is fiercely intelligent and almost completely instinctual. And he has this immense sensitivity that can be both his curse and his gift, but for me, that is what it means to be human".[110]In an interview withThe Guardianin 2015, Phoenix said that he prefersindependent filmovermajor studio film, citing that "the quality of acting suffers".[162]
In 2019, Phoenix stated that in choosing films, he solely relies on the director, "I don't really care about genre or budget size, anything like that. It's just whether there is a filmmaker that has a unique vision, has a voice, and the ability to make the film."[163]For Phoenix, a great performance is in the director's hands — it's ultimately the director's world he's entering. He maintains that the director creates the character's arc and that the best directors adjust to what is happening with the actor in the moment.[150]
Phoenix has citedRobert De Niroas one of his favorite actors and strongest acting influences. Phoenix recalled watchingRaging Bullfor the first time in an interview, "I think it just… awakened something in me. And I could suddenly see it through his eyes. There's a part inRaging Bullwhere De Niro meets a girl in between a chain-link fence. And he, you know, shakes her pinky and it's like this just beautiful little detail, it's this wonderful moment. And I think that in some ways is what I'm always looking for."[164]
Phoenix has directed music videos forRingside,[165]She Wants Revenge,[166]People in Planes,[167]Arckid,[168]Albert Hammond Jr.,[169]andSilversun Pickups.[170]He was said to have produced the opening track forPusha T'sMy Name Is My Namealbum alongsideKanye West. The track is called "King Push". Phoenix then denied in a statement toXXLhaving produced the record, saying, "While it was widely reported that Pusha T used my beat and that I produced his song, I can't take any credit. A friend's son played me his music, and all I did was make an introduction to Kanye [West]'s camp."[171]
Phoenix is identified as one of the most active celebrities in theanimal rights movement.[172]A vegan since age three, he does not wear any clothes made out of animal skin; he requests that all of his leather costumes in films are made from synthetic materials.[173]Phoenix has said that animal rights are one of the most important pillars in his life, and maintains that "climate change is imminent if we do not adopt a plant-based lifestyle".[174]He has helped raise awareness of the correlation between animal rights, climate change and health issues.[175]
Phoenix has received praise and accolades from animal rights groups, withPETAnaming him "Person of the Year" in 2019. PETA's president,Ingrid Newkirksaid in a statement: "Joaquin Phoenix never misses an opportunity to turn the spotlight away from himself and onto animals' plight and to set a great example of walking the vegan walk".[176]He has been an active supporter of numerous animal rights organizations, including PETA.[177]
"We go into the natural world, and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. Then we take her milk that's intended for her calf, and we put it in our coffee and our cereal. And I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something, to give something up, but human beings, at our best, are so inventive and creative and ingenious. And I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles, we can create, develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment."
Throughout the years, Phoenix has headlined numerous campaigns for different organizations to help promote veganism and end animal slaughter.[179]In 2019, Phoenix and his partnerRooney Maraled the National Animal Rights Day demonstration to help spread awareness for animal rights.[180]On January 10, 2020, Phoenix was arrested with actressJane Fondaat a climate change protest outside theUnited States Capitolin Washington, D.C. At the protest, Phoenix spoke about the link betweenanimal agriculture and climate change.[181]
Phoenix has also been vocal in drawing attention to the suffering of fish, which he sees as a neglected cause in the sphere of animal rights. Fish, says Phoenix, are the "last thing besides insects that people don’t really consider".[182]Phoenix's views were shaped by a childhood incident in which he saw fish brutally flung against the side of the boat.[183][184]In 2013, he simulated drowning in a 41-secondPETAspot, designed to dramatise how fish suffer in the final moments of their lives. The video was shot by photographer Michael Muller.[185]
During the 2019–20awards season, amid protesting for animal rights, Phoenix had been driving a behind-the-scenes movement that transformed five events to meat-free menus, beginning with theGolden Globe Awards. He acknowledged theHollywood Foreign Press Associationduring his acceptance speech, for its "very bold move making tonight plant-based. It really sends a powerful message." Soon after,Critics' ChoiceandSAGfollowed suit. Phoenix contacted the presidents of the award ceremonies, accompanied by signatures from the likes of fellow nomineesLeonardo DiCaprioandPhoebe Waller-Bridge. Phoenix's pitch was that meat agriculture is a leading cause of climate change and that the televised spectacles should use their platforms to address pressing societal issues. TheAcademy Awardslater announced that all food served at theDolby Theatrebefore the Oscars was going to be vegan. Lisa Lange, Senior Vice President of Communications at PETA, spoke of Phoenix's power saying "He knows what can be done. He knows he's in a good position to push. He enlists friends. And it works. He can have influence in Hollywood and it influences the rest of the world."[186]
A day after winning theAcademy Award for Best Actor, and subsequently delivering a headlining acceptance speech in which he spoke to the plight of mother cows and their babies used in animal agriculture, Phoenix helped to rescue a cow and her newborn calf from a Los Angeles slaughterhouse. They were taken toFarm Sanctuary, an animal sanctuary and advocacy organization, where they will live out the rest of their lives.[187]The same month, he starred inGuardians of Life, the first of twelve short films by the environmental organizationMobilize Earththat highlighted the most pressing issues facing humanity and the natural world. Funds raised by the project went toAmazon WatchandExtinction Rebellion.[188]Dávid Szőke and Sándor Kiss inFilm Internationalwere highly critical of this move, arguing that "what is rather mind-boggling is that the discourse centers less on the issue of the calf and its mother or the exploitation of our natural world, and more on Phoenix in the leading role as the savior of our planet, raising questions about the narrative’s alignment with his environmental activism."[189]
Two animal species have been named after him. In 2011, atrilobitespecies was namedGladiatoria phoenixfor his iconic role in the 2000 filmGladiator, and in 2020, a spider species endemic to Iran was namedLoureedia phoenixi(also known as the Joker spider) due to its color pattern matching the DC Comics characterJoker, for his role in the 2019 filmJoker.[190][191][192]
In 2020, Phoenix collaborated withJusticeLAto create a public service announcement #SuingToSaveLives about the health of people in L.A. County jails amid theCOVID-19 pandemic.[193][194]
In October 2023, Phoenix signed an open letter by artists to PresidentJoe Bidencalling for a ceasefire during theIsraeli bombardment of Gaza.[195]The letter reads: "We believe all life is sacred, no matter faith or ethnicity and we condemn the killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians."[196]
After reestablishing himself as an actor in the mid-1990s, Phoenix moved back toLos Angeles.[150]He is known for his disdain ofcelebrity culture, rarely granting interviews, and being reticent about discussing his private life.[110][151]In 2018, he described himself as asecular Jewwho did not affiliate with any organized religion; one of his "core values" is the idea of forgiveness.[197]He has also claimed that his mother believes in Jesus, though his parents were not religious. While portraying Jesus in the 2018 movieMary Magdalene, he expressed that the role changed his perspective on the nature of forgiveness.[198]
In early April 2005, Phoenix checked himself into rehab to be treated for alcoholism.[199]Twelve years later, he revealed that he did not need anintervention: "I really just thought of myself as ahedonist. I was an actor in L.A. I wanted to have a good time. But I wasn't engaging with the world or myself in the way I wanted to". On January 26, 2006, while driving down a winding canyon road in Hollywood, Phoenix veered off the road and flipped his car.[200]The crash was reportedly caused by brake failure. Shaken and confused, he heard someone tapping on his window and telling him to "just relax". Unable to see the man, Phoenix replied, "I'm fine. I am relaxed." The man replied, "No, you're not." The man then stopped Phoenix from lighting a cigarette while gasoline was leaking into the car cabin. Phoenix realized that the man was German filmmakerWerner Herzog. While Herzog helped Phoenix out of the wreckage by breaking the back window of the car, bystanders called an ambulance. Phoenix later approached Herzog to express his gratitude.[201][202]
In 2012, Phoenix labeled theAcademy Awards"bullshit". He later gave an interview apologizing for his comments, and acknowledged that the awards provided an important platform for many deserving filmmakers.[203]He elaborated on the topic while onJimmy Kimmel Live!in 2015, explaining that he was uncomfortable receiving accolades for his work, considering the filmmaking process a collaborative one.[204]
A longtime vegan, Phoenix findsanimal agriculture"absurd and barbaric". He explained his reasoning behind hisveganism: "To me, it just seems obvious—I don't want to cause pain to another living empathetic creature. I don't want to take its babies away from it, I don't want to force it to be indoors and fattened up just to be slaughtered. Certainly, also, the effect that it has on our environment is devastating. So, for me, it's my life and has always been my life, and it's really one of the most important things to me."[205]
Phoenix is on the board of directors forThe Lunchbox Fund, a non-profit organization which provides daily meals to students of township schools inSoweto, South Africa, founded by Page-Green.[206]
From 1995 to 1998, Phoenix dated hisInventing the Abbottsco-starLiv Tyler. The two remain close friends, with Tyler considering Phoenix and his sisters as her family.[207]He was romantically involved with South African modelTopaz Page-Greenfrom 2001 to 2005.[208]From 2013 to 2015 he was in a relationship with artistAllie Teilz.[209]
In 2012, Phoenix metHerco-starRooney Mara. The two remained friends and began a romantic relationship four years later, during the making ofMary Magdalene.[8][210]They were engaged to be married in 2019, but the ceremony never took place.[211]In August 2020, the couple had a son.[212]In June 2024, they welcomed their second child.[213]They reside in theHollywood Hills. Phoenix has described his family life as simple. He enjoys meditating, watching documentaries, reading scripts, and taking karate classes.

Iloatheheterosexual weddings; I would never go to a wedding in my life. I loathe the flowers, I loathe the fucking wedding dress, the little bridal tiara. It's grotesque. It's just hideous. The wedding cake, the party, the champagne, the inevitable divorce two years later. It's just a waste of time in the heterosexual world, and in the homosexual world I find it personally beyond tragic that we want to ape this institution that is so clearly a disaster."[59]A few days after the release of the interview, he was criticized[60][61][62]for the following remark: "I can't think of anything worse than being brought up by two gay dads". He went on to explain that "[f]or me, being gay was about wanting to do the opposite of the straight world, so I think that's where my problems in this particular area come from. [...] But that's me, just me. I'm not having a go at gay couples who do. I think if Elton and David want to have babies, that's wonderful. I think we should all do what we want."[63]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
