Willy Wonka, a young chocolatier, arrives at the Galéries Gourmet with dreams of establishing his own chocolate shop. Wonka is coerced to stay at Mrs. Scrubitt's boarding house by her co-worker, Bleacher, and unknowingly signs a predatory contract due to his illiteracy. He introduces "hoverchocs", which make the consumer fly, but rival chocolatiersArthur Slugworth, Gerald Prodnose, and Felix Fickelgruber have his earnings seized by the police for selling without a shop. Unable to pay the contract's exorbitant fees, Wonka is forced to work in Scrubbitt's launderette alongside her foster daughter, Noodle, and fellow captives Abacus Crunch, Piper Benz, Larry Chucklesworth, and Lottie Bell.
Wonka befriends Noodle, who agrees to teach him how to read. Meanwhile, Slugworth and the "Chocolate Cartel", threatened by Wonka's chocolate, bribe the Chief of Police to intimidate Wonka. Crunch, having previously worked for Slugworth as an accountant, reveals that the Cartel has a secret vault of chocolate, used for bribes to maintain their power. Wonka and the launderette workers embark on a chocolate-selling crusade to alleviate their debts, using the city's storm drains to evade the police. Wonka later discovers his chocolates are being pilfered by anOompa Loompanamed Lofty, who seeks retribution for the cocoa beans Wonka took from Loompaland under his watch.
Wonka finally opens his dream chocolate shop, but the Cartel bribe Scrubitt to sabotage his chocolates withYetisweat. Chaos ensues among Wonka's customers, leading to the destruction of the shop. Wonka reluctantly accepts the Cartel's offer to pay off everyone's debts in exchange for him leaving town by boat. The laundry workers are released, but Slugworth pays Scrubitt to keep Noodle indefinitely. Wonka deduces that Noodle and Slugworth are related, before he, with Lofty aboard, realizes the Cartel has rigged the boat to explode. After escaping from the boat and rescuing Noodle, Wonka and his friends devise a strategy to obtain the Cartel's incriminating account book.
Wonka and Noodle infiltrate the Cartel's headquarters, only to be confronted by the Cartel. Slugworth reveals that after the death of Noodle's father, his own brother Zebedee, he lied to her mother Dorothy Smith that Noodle had died as well and gave the newborn to Scrubitt. Held at gunpoint and locked in the Cartel's vault of liquid chocolate, Wonka and Noodle nearly drown, but Lofty, still seeking reimbursement from Wonka, rescues them.
Wonka and Noodle expose the Cartel's misdeeds, releasing their chocolate reserves into the city fountain, now laced with Wonka's unique ingredients, ruining the Cartel's enterprise. The Cartel float away, having eaten Wonka's hoverchocs, and the Chief is arrested. Wonka reunites Noodle with her mother and purchases an abandoned castle that he transforms into his own chocolate factory, with Lofty heading the tasting department.
During the credits, Lofty shows footage of Wonka's friends returning to their old lives while Scrubitt and Bleacher are arrested.
In October 2016,Warner Bros. Picturesreacquired therightsto theCharlie and the Chocolate Factory(1964) characterWilly WonkafromRoald Dahl's estate, with a film in development from producersDavid Heymanand Michael Siegel.[20]The announcement of the project was met with a mostly negative response as it came less than two months following the death ofGene Wilder, who portrayed Willy Wonka in the1971 film adaptation.[21]The following month, Heyman revealed that the project would not be a third straight adaptation of the book: "They've done two films, quite different. But it's possibly an origin story. We're just in the early stages of it, working with a writer calledSimon Rich, which is wonderful."[22]In February 2018, it was announcedPaul Kingwas in negotiations to direct.[23][24]He ultimately decided against completing hisPaddingtonfilms, as he had been satisfied with his first two films and felt "it was time to let go and give somebody else a shot".[25]That year, it was revealed that the film would be a prequel to the events of Dahl's book.[26]King grew up as a fan of both the book and the 1971 film adaptation and enjoyedTim Burton's 2005 adaptationas an adult.[27]"I was a bit nervous because origin stories don't always feel essential, and I was aware this is such a beloved property," he said.[28]King's hiring as director, as well as the project's title,Wonka, was announced in January 2021.[29]The film had financing through Domain Entertainment.[30]
After being approached by Heyman to direct, King felt the urge to revisit Dahl's book and was surprised: "I realised that it's also an amazing emotional masterpiece. I really wasn't expecting that. Or maybe I had forgotten how incredibly touching it is. Poor little Charlie suffers so much. And you're so rooting for him. I found myself in tears at the end of it."[31]While looking through Dahl's archives and unpublished material for research, King found that Dahl had expressed interest in exploring Wonka's backstory but never went far with it.[32]When writing the screenplay, King did not want to "reinvent" the 1971 film, instead he wanted it to be a "companion piece" to both the book and the original film adaptation; as such, he decided to set it 25 years before the events of the story.[32][33]He set the story during the 1940s and paid homage to classic European story books.[34]He worked closely with the Dahl estate, particularly producer Luke Kelly, who is Dahl's grandson.[35]Creating the supporting characters, King was inspired by several of Dahl's other stories: the trio of villains, the "Chocolate Cartel", drew inspiration from Boggis, Bunce, and Bean from Dahl'sFantastic Mr Fox; and the character of Mrs. Scrubitt was inspired by Dahl's short story "The Landlady".[28]He also stated Slugworth's chocolate cartel as being a "savage indictment ofcapitalism", wanting each character to represent a different aspect of greed, whereas Wonka had epitomized generosity and dedicated his life in creating his factory.[25][36]King developed the screenplay with hisPaddington 2(2017) collaboratorSimon Farnaby, with additional material fromJeff Nathanson, Simon Rich, and Simon Stephenson.[37][38]He did not consider the film a musical, but "a movie with songs", noting that the Oompa Loompas sang in the book and Dahl's usage of poetry.[39]He citedOliver!(1968),Cabaret(1972),Bugsy Malone(1976), andAnnie(1982) as inspirations, particularly focusing onOliver!as he felt Dahl's book was influenced byCharles Dickens.[33]
Timothée ChalametandTom Hollandwere the frontrunners for the title role after King joined the project.[40]Donald Glover,Ryan Gosling, andEzra Millerwere previously considered for the role.[41]According to Paul King, "We were pretty open to looking for the right person. But, for me, it really was a list of one." King was impressed with Chalamet's performances inCall Me by Your Name(2017) andLady Bird(2017).[31]King offered the actor the part with no audition after seeing his high school performances on YouTube, which proved his vocal and dancing skills.[42]Chalamet grew up as a fan of both the 1971 and 2005 films and wanted to portray the character in a different way from Wilder andJohnny Depp: "It was a total inverse of that Willy Wonka with a demented look in his eye that we all know. How would that character have started, to land in a place where he's still childlike but sort of broken?"[43]King likened Chalamet's Wonka to "aCharlie Chaplininnocent character, almost like the immigrant tramp figure coming to this world for the first time, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and completely naive – with this childlike wonder but none of the street smarts that he's going to develop over the next 25 years."[33]Chalamet was officially cast in May 2021 and was paid $9 million for his involvement.[44][45]
In September 2021, it was announcedKeegan-Michael Key,Sally Hawkins,Rowan Atkinson,Olivia Colman, andJim Carterwere among the newest additions to the cast, with Farnaby also set for a role.[46][47]Unlike the 1971 and 2005 films,Wonkais the first film to not feature the Oompa-Loompas portrayed by dwarf actors. The casting ofHugh Grantas Lofty generated backlash from the dwarfism community.[48]

The marketing campaign from Warner Bros. Pictures forWonkabegan on October 10, 2021, when Chalamet shared a photograph of himself in costume as Willy Wonka. The image was posted on Chalamet's Instagram with the caption "The suspense is terrible, I hope it will last," a reference to a famous Wilder line in the 1971 film,[70][71]which itself is a quote from the 1895 playThe Importance of Being EarnestbyOscar Wilde.[72]The Guardiannoted that the image was met with mixed reception online.[73]
On April 26, 2022, footage of Chalamet as Willy Wonka was shared during Warner Bros. Pictures' presentation atCinemaCon. It also featured a rendition of the song "Pure Imagination" from the 1971 film.[74][75]Deadlinedescribed the trailer: "ThinkFantastic Beastsin regards to period (early 20th century), but so much more fun".[76]The following year at the convention, Warner Bros. screened a teaser trailer forWonka, which also saw a first-look at Grant as anOompa-Loompa,[77][78]which caused criticism from actors withdwarfism, includingJason Acuña, who remarked, "So I guess Hugh Grant, you're now identifying as a little person".[79]IndieWirepraised Chalamet's transformation as Wonka remarking: "like the chocolate he concocts in this first trailer, it will make you fly".[75]The trailer was released to the public on July 11, 2023, alongside a teaser poster.[80]The film was also promoted during the 97thMacy's Thanksgiving Day Paradeon November 23, 2023, in the form of a float called "The Deliciously Delectable World of Wonka."[81][82]On November 27, 2023,IHOPintroduced a Wonka Menu to promote the film.[83]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 82% of 329 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's consensus reads: "With director Paul King at the helm and some solid new songs at the ready, the warmly old-fashionedWonkaputs a suitably sweet spin on the classic character while still leaving some room for the source material's darker undertones."[96]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 64 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[97]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled byPostTrakgave it an 85% overall positive score, with 64% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[91]
Rotten Tomatoes found the initial reactions on social media to be mostly positive, with some reviewers criticizing the script and others praising Chalamet's performance and the film's presentation.[98]According to the website, critics found the film to be "silly and fun for the whole family with catchy music and stunning production design, even if it loses some of the edge found in its predecessors."[99]TheBBCreported that a number of critics likened the film tonally to thePaddingtonfilms, and despite "several glowing reviews", some felt thatWonka"lacks the darker elements of previous versions". Chalamet's performance was both praised and criticized for his singing, while some considered him miscast.[100]
In a 5 out of 5 star review,Peter BradshawofThe Guardianwrote that the film is "spectacular, imaginative, sweet-natured and funny". Although Bradshaw appreciated Chalamet's performance, finding it better than previous adaptations of the character, the film does not explain "what happened to him as a young man to turn him into the somewhat ambiguous, even sinister adult figure with a streak of Dahlian cruelty", wondering if in a possible sequel "something happens to sour our young hero".[101]
Owen GleibermanofVarietywrote that "Wonkamay be the squarest big-scale Hollywood musical in decades" as a "fun, rousing, impeccably staged, jaw-droppingly old-fashioned musical prequel to the legendary Roald Dahl tale", but "it might have been an even bigger hit had it been a little less sanded off for children".[102]Stephanie ZacharekofTimewrote that "Wonkais carefully calibrated to bring joy" which is "plenty of feel-goodism for one musical", with "grand but somehow flat-looking sets" and "with musical numbers that stress the importance of dreams and wonder and friendship", but which "gives us everything but that quiet, thrumming sensation".[103]CultureSonar classed it as one of the best films of the year: "What many wrote off as an airless cash-in is actually one of the finest interpretations of Roald Dahl’s character to date."[104]
In a more negative review, David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterfound the film "sickly sweet and hopelessly twee" with the character of Willy Wonka "neutered, stripped of any edge that might have made him interesting" and that "a number of gifted actors are either misused or wasted".[105]Johnny Oleksinski ofNew York Postalso pointed out that "it's a shame that in this origin story the viewer doesn't leave with any deepened understanding of who Willy Wonka is" and "absent of any edge or layered characters", stressing that "Wonkais at its most enjoyable when you forget the novel".[106]
In a September 2023 interview withTotal Film, King expressed interest in making sequels, saying: "Dahl was definitely interested in taking Willy Wonka on. There's drafts that didn't really go anywhere, and there's a short story. He didn't really write sequels, but this was the one book where he clearly felt there was more in the tank there. There's an awful lot more Wonka story that we have that we would like to tell. It's not likeDune: Part Onewhere you go, 'This is what's happening inPart Two.' Hopefully it works exquisitely as a stand-alone movie. But I would definitely like to do more. And I'd like to spend more time in this world, and meet some more Oompa Loompas."[116]In November 2024, while attending thePaddington in Perured carpet, Paul King confirmed that development on a sequel was underway, stating "We're very early. We've got about half of a draft [...] We've got a story that we like and we know where we want to take him."[117][118]
