The Boys in the Boatis a 2023 Americanbiographicalsports dramafilm produced and directed byGeorge Clooneyfrom a screenplay byMark L. Smith, based onthe 2013 bookbyDaniel James Brown. The film follows theUniversity of Washingtonrowing team, and their quest to compete in the1936 Summer Olympics. It starsJoel Edgertonas coachAl Ulbrickson Sr.andCallum Turneras rowerJoe Rantz.
The Boys in the Boathad its world premiere inLos Angeleson December 11, 2023, and was theatrically released byAmazon MGM Studiosin the United States on December 25 and internationally byWarner Bros. Pictures. It  grossed $55 million and received mixed reviews from critics.
An elderlyJoe Rantzwatches his grandson rowing a fiberglass boat and is reminded of his glorious rowing days. In 1936, Joe Rantz is a poor engineering student at theUniversity of Washington(UW), living in an abandoned car and eating canned food, with no job and tuition fees due in two weeks. Fellow struggling student Roger Morris tells Joe the8+rowingteam comes with jobs and boarding. Despite not being rowers, they make the UWjunior varsity (JV)team in a special year for coach Al Ulbrickson, who is under pressure to beat rivalCaland compete for the1936 Olympics. Joe and Roger are just happy to have a dorm room and steady food, and gladly mop floors for tuition. Joe starts dating Joyce, a classmate, and admits toracing-shellbuilderGeorge Pocockthat he's been on his own since his father abandoned him at age fourteen.
The JV and varsity 8+ teams train together, trying to get their rowing "swing" in sync with fast pace. Coach Al worries that his varsity crew isn't fast enough for the Olympics, and the JVs are strong but inexperienced. On George's suggestion, Al brings backBobby Moch, the experienced but headstrongcoxswain, warning him to follow orders on the JVs or he's out. At the Pacific Coast Regatta onLake Washington, UW and Cal race two miles in front of 100,000 fans.  Coach Al wants the JV boat to maintain a steady pace, hoping the Cal JVs would screw up, but Bobby calls a fast pace and pulls off a course-record win, astonishing Al. The rowers become campus stars.
Ahead of the four-milePoughkeepsie RegattainNew York, for a berth in the Olympics, Al risks his job by promoting the JVs above his experienced varsity boat. After Joe sees his long-lost father inSeattle, he performs badly in New York practice and is benched. Joe packs up to leave, but George Pocock tells him not to quit like his father.  Joe reconsiders and agrees with Al that it's all about the boat, the only thing he has. On race day, Bobby is told by Al to start slowly and let the other boats tire, then kick mid-race to 35 strokes per minute.  Bobby starts at 28 and holds it past mid-race, then coaxes 36, with a 40-stroke finish to lead ragtag UW to upsetNavy, Cal, and the other privileged schools.
TheUS Olympic Committeeis short on funds, so UW needs to raise $5,000 (equivalent to $113,000 in 2024) to pay for their travel, otherwise a team able to pay will go. The team and community raise the money, and they sail forBerlin. InNazi Germany, stroke oarsman Don Hume falls sick. At theopening ceremony, Roger tellsJesse Owensto show the Germans that he's the fastest guy in the world. Owens replies, "not the Germans, the folks back home". The rowing team then sets an Olympic record in the qualifier, but the effort takes a toll on Hume. Al protests about the lane assignments, but realizes he'll have calm water at the end, so he calls for a fast start to stay close to the German team, with a big kick to finish. Hitler attends the finals expecting his team to complete a German gold-medal sweep of the rowing events. Bobby fails to hear the final's starting gun and starts badly, with Hume struggling early; nonetheless, Bobby coaxes Hume and the crew to 42 strokes per minute to get within reach, then calls for 46 with 300 meters to go. The US wins thegoldin a photo finish overItalyand Germany. Back in the present, the elderly Joe comes out of his reverie and tells his grandson that his eight-man crew was always one.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
