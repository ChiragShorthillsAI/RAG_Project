At their new headquarters onKnowhere, theGuardians of the Galaxyare attacked byAdam Warlock, aSovereignwarrior created by High PriestessAyeshawho seeks to destroy them for stealing from her.[a]After critically woundingRocket, Adam is stabbed byNebulaand flees. The Guardians' med-packs are ineffective at healing Rocket's wounds due to akill switchembedded in him by the organization Orgocorp. The Guardians travel to Orgocorp's headquarters to find the switch's override code and save Rocket's life.
As Rocket lies dying, he recalls his past. He was found and experimented on as a baby raccoon by theHigh Evolutionary, leader of Orgocorp, who aimed to enhance andanthropomorphizeanimal lifeforms into "Humanimals" for an ideal society,Counter-Earth. Rocket's fellow Batch 89 test subjects included the otterLylla, walrusTeefs, and rabbitFloor. Impressed by Rocket's intelligence, the High Evolutionary used his insights to improve later batches of Humanimals. Angry that one of his creations could solve a problem that he could not, the High Evolutionary planned to harvest Rocket's brain and incinerate all of Batch 89. Rocket tried to rescue his friends, but the High Evolutionary killed Lylla and mocked Rocket's grief. Enraged, Rocket attacked the High Evolutionary, whose henchmen killed Teefs and Floor during the chaos. Rocket escaped in a spaceship.
In the present, an alternate version ofGamora,[b]who has joined theRavagers, helps the Guardians infiltrate Orgocorp. They retrieve Rocket's file but discover that Theel, one of the High Evolutionary's advisors, has removed the override code. The Guardians and Gamora travel to Counter-Earth to find him. They are followed by Ayesha and Adam after the High Evolutionary, their race's creator, threatened to wipe out the Sovereign if they failed to retrieve Rocket. At Counter-Earth,DraxandMantisremain with Gamora and Rocket whilePeter Quill,Groot, and Nebula go to the High Evolutionary's Arête Laboratories complex. Guards force Nebula to wait outside due to her cybernetic enhancements; Quill and Groot enter Arête. Drax tricks Mantis into pursuing Quill's group and Gamora saves Rocket from Adam and War Pig, one of the High Evolutionary's Hellspawn guards.
The High Evolutionary agrees with Quill that Counter-Earth is imperfect and begins bombarding the entire planet, killing the Humanimals and Ayesha. Arête, which is actually a spaceship, departs as Nebula, Drax, and Mantis board it to rescue Quill and Groot. However, the latter pair jump off the spaceship with Theel, whom they kill before retrieving the override code from his corpse. They are rescued by Gamora on their ship. As they use the code, Rocketflatlinesand has anear-death experiencein which he reunites with Lylla, Teefs, and Floor. Lylla tells him his time has not yet come, and Quill succeeds in disabling the kill switch and restarting Rocket's heart.
Drax, Nebula, and Mantis encounter the High Evolutionary's next batch of test subjects—genetically modified humanoid children—before they are captured. The other Guardians orchestrate a rescue, which leads to a battle against the High Evolutionary's forces.Kraglinopens fire on Arête with Knowhere and then helps to save Knowhere citizens from a counter-attack by the High Evolutionary's Hellspawn. Intent on retreat, the High Evolutionary's crew mutinies, but their leader kills them. Drax, Nebula, and Mantis befriend three monstrous Abilisks to escape and reunite with the rest of the Guardians. The Guardians delay leaving Arête, choosing to rescue the children, who escape to Knowhere via a tunnel constructed byCosmo'stelekinesis. Rocket discovers imprisoned animals on the ship and is confronted by the High Evolutionary, whom the other Guardians defeat. Rocket spares the High Evolutionary,[c]and the Guardians help the animals escape to Knowhere. Quill nearly dies trying to reach Knowhere but is saved by Adam, whom Groot had earlier rescued from Arête's destruction.
Quill decides to leave the Guardians, names Rocket as the new captain, and reunites with his grandfather on Earth. Mantis embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the Abilisks, Gamora rejoins the Ravagers, and Nebula and Drax remain on Knowhere to raise the rescued children. The new Guardians—Rocket, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, Adam,Phyla(one of the rescued children), and Adam's petBlurp—later take on a mission.

Quinnas a Ravager;[67]and writer and directorJames Gunnas the voice of Lambshank, a deformed experiment of the High Evolutionary that is among those freed by the Guardians of the Galaxy.[68]Gunn originally wrote the role forStan Leeand planned to have him record Lambshank's voice instead of traveling toAtlantadue to Lee's growing age, before designing the character's face to resemble Lee's. After Lee's death, Gunn chose to take over the role.[69]
Guardians of the Galaxy(2014) writer and directorJames Gunnstated in November 2014 that, in addition to having the "basic story" forGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2(2017) while working on the first film, he also had ideas for a potential third film.[70]Despite this, he was unsure in June 2015 if he would be involved with a thirdGuardiansfilm, saying that it would depend on how he felt after makingVol. 2.[71]In April 2016,Marvel StudiospresidentKevin Feige, the producer of theGuardiansfilms, said a third film was planned for the franchise as part of theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU) in "2020 and beyond".[72]In March 2017, Gunn said there would be a third film "for sure. We're trying to figure it out",[73]soon adding that there were no specific plans for the film yet, but that Marvel would want to make it "unless something goes horribly—which is always possible, you never know".[74]He also reiterated that he had not decided whether he would be directing the film, and that he was going to figure out his involvement and his next project "over the next couple of weeks".[73]Part of Gunn's reluctance to return to the franchise came from not wanting to work on it withoutMichael Rooker, whose character from the first two films,Yondu Udonta, died at the end ofVol. 2.[75]
"In the end, my love forRocket,Groot,Gamora,Star-Lord,Yondu,Mantis,Drax, andNebula—and some of the other forthcoming heroes—goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine, and I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit."
Gunn announced in April 2017 that he would return to write and directGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. He said the film would be set afterAvengers: Infinity War(2018) andAvengers: Endgame(2019), and would "conclude the story of this iteration of theGuardians of the Galaxy, and help catapult both old and new Marvel characters into the next ten years and beyond".[76]He also felt that the threeGuardiansfilms would "work together as a whole", telling one story,[77]with the third film "tying a lot of stuff together" from the first two and giving "a lot of answers on a lot of different things".[78]Gunn also planned to work with Marvel on the future of the "Marvel Cosmic Universe".[76]He was set to begin work onVol. 3shortly after completing his work as executive producer and consultant onInfinity War.[79]On returning for the third film, Gunn said, "I wouldn't have said yes if I didn't have a fairly clear idea of where we were going and what we were going to do. I'm not a guy that's just going to do it if I don't have a vision for it".[77]
After originally includingAdam Warlockin his script treatment forVol. 2, Gunn and Feige noted the importance of the character on the cosmic side of the MCU and hinted that he would make an appearance inVol. 3.[80]In May 2017, after the release ofVol. 2, Gunn said he would be creating the third film "over the next three years",[81]and confirmed thatPom Klementieffwould reprise her role asMantis.[16][82]He also intended to haveElizabeth Debickireprise her role asAyesha.[83]By mid-June, Gunn had completed the first draft of his script treatment for the third film, and was consideringchanging a piece of character infohe had placed in the background of the mugshot sequence in the first film (when the Guardians are captured by theNova Corps).[84]In September, Gunn reiterated thatVol. 3would be released "in a little under three years",[85]as the film had privately been set for release on May 1, 2020.[86]At the end of February 2018, Gunn planned to meet withMark Hamillabout possibly appearing in the film.[87]In April,Chris Prattwas set to reprise his role asPeter Quill / Star-Lord,[16][88]and the following month,Dave Bautistaconfirmed that he would reprise his role asDrax the Destroyer.[89]Marvel received the completed first draft of the screenplay from Gunn by the end of June, ahead of the beginning of officialpre-productionon the film.[90]
On July 20, 2018, Disney and Marvel severed ties with Gunn. This came after conservative commentators, such asMike Cernovich, began circulating oldtweetshe had made regarding controversial topics such asrapeandpedophilia, and called for his firing.[91][92]The Walt Disney StudioschairmanAlan F. Hornstated, "The offensive attitudes and statements discovered on James' Twitter feed are indefensible and inconsistent with our studio's values, and we have severed our business relationship with him".[91]While not part of the decision to fire Gunn,the Walt Disney CompanyCEOBob Igersupported the "unanimous decision" from the various executives at Marvel and Walt Disney Studios.[93]In response, Gunn said in a series of tweets that when he started his career he was "making movies and telling jokes that were outrageous and taboo" but felt as he has "developed as a person, so has my work and my humor". He continued, "It's not to say I'm better, but I am very, very different than I was a few years ago; today I try to root my work in love and connection and less in anger. My days saying something just because it's shocking and trying to get a reaction are over". In a separate statement, Gunn said the tweets at the time were "totally failed and unfortunate efforts to be provocative", adding "I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then".[91]
In response to the firing, many of theGuardianscast members tweeted support for Gunn. Rooker decided to leave Twitter,[94][95]while fans signed an online petition asking for Gunn to be reinstated which received over 300,000 signatures.[96]The firing also garnered reaction from other Hollywood personalities, such as actressSelma Blairand comedianBobcat Goldthwait,[95]and inspiredopinion pieceson the firing and how it would affect Hollywood fromKareem Abdul-Jabbar,[97]and news organizations such asThe Hollywood Reporter,[98]Variety,[99]Deadline Hollywood,[100]andForbes.[101]On July 30, the cast of theGuardians of the Galaxyfilms, including Pratt,Zoe Saldaña, Bautista,Bradley Cooper,Vin Diesel,Sean Gunn, Klementieff, Rooker, andKaren Gillan, issued a statement in support of James Gunn, saying, "We fully support James Gunn. We were all shocked by his abrupt firing last week and have intentionally waited these ten days to respond in order to think, pray, listen, and discuss. In that time, we've been encouraged by the outpouring of support from fans and members of the media who wish to see James reinstated as director ofVolume 3as well as discouraged by those so easily duped into believing the many outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding him".[96]Despite this and the notable "vociferous support" Gunn received,Varietyreported that Disney was not planning to rehire him as the jokes were "unacceptable in the#MeToo eraand are not in line with Disney's family-friendly image".Varietycontinued that, despite rumors of Gunn being replaced by established Marvel directors such asJon Favreau,Taika Waititi, or theRusso brothers, Marvel had yet to meet with any other director, and would most likely hire someone new.[102]In early August, Bautista said that he would fulfill his contract and appear in the film as long as Marvel chose to use Gunn's existing script.[103]
Disney and Marvel still wanted to "move forward quickly" on the film,[104]and were soon confirmed to be keeping Gunn's script. This, combined with the fact that Gunn did not breach his contract since the tweets were written years before he signed on to the film, had led to "complicated negotiations" between Gunn and Disney over his exit settlement. Gunn was expected to be paid $7–10 million or more, and there was some hope that the negotiations could lead to him eventually returning in some capacity, "even if [it was] to develop and direct another Marvel movie". Gunn would be free to move on to new projects following the settlement, and other major studios were interested in hiring him includingWarner Bros.for their rival superhero franchise, theDC Extended Universe(DCEU).[105]During this time, executives at Marvel Studios began "back channel conversations" with Disney in an attempt to find a compromise that could lead to Gunn returning to the film in some way. This "eleventh-hour" effort from Marvel was inspired by the statements from the film's cast.[104]In mid-August, Gunn met with Horn following a strong push from Gunn's talent agency for him to be given a second chance. Despite this and the reported "civil and professional" nature of the meeting, Horn only took it as a courtesy and used it to reaffirm Disney's decision to fire Gunn.[106]
Later in August, the small crew that was preparing for pre-production were dismissed as production of the film was postponed so Marvel and Disney could find a director to replace Gunn.[107]Pre-production was to have begun by the end of 2018, withprincipal photographyset for January or February 2019.[107][108]At this time, Bautista was unsure if he would return for the film, as he did not know if he would "want to work for Disney" given how they handled the firing of Gunn.[109]In late September, James Gunn's brother Sean, who playedKraglin Obfonteriand provided motion capture forRocketin the previousGuardiansfilms, reiterated that Disney still intended on making the film with James's script, but had not revealed to the cast when production may continue. Sean added that he had been preparing to reprise his roles for the third film before his brother's firing.[25]At the end of the month, Cooper was asked if he would consider directingVol. 3after the success of his directorial debutA Star Is Born(2018), but said that he "could never imagine" directing a film that he did not write.[110]By mid-October, James Gunn had completed his exit settlement with Disney and was set to write and potentially directThe Suicide Squad(2021) for Warner Bros. andDC Films.[111]
The day after Gunn joinedThe Suicide Squadin mid-October 2018, he was privately notified by Horn that he could return as director forVol. 3. This came after further meetings between the studios and Gunn. Horn had changed his mind after being impressed by Gunn's response to the situation.[112][113]Gunn discussed his commitments toThe Suicide Squadwith Feige,[112]and production onVol. 3was put on hold until February 2021 to allow Gunn to completeThe Suicide Squadfirst.[113][114][115]In December, after working with Marvel Studios on the script forAnt-Man(2015),Adam McKaysaid he was willing to work with the studio again and stated that he had discussed taking over as director forVol. 3with Feige, among other projects.[116]In early 2019, Feige and Pratt reiterated that Marvel would still makeVol. 3,[117][118]and in March 2019, Gunn was publicly revealed to have been rehired as director of the film.Deadline Hollywoodstated that Marvel Studios had "never met with or considered any other director" for the film.[113]By the end of April, the franchise's five main stars—Pratt, Saldaña, Bautista, Cooper, and Diesel—were all expected to return for the sequel, with filming to take place in 2020.[5]
Discussing his firing and re-hiring in May 2019, Gunn said that of all the elements of the film that he had been sad to leave when he was fired, the most meaningful to him was the character of Rocket. Gunn personally identifies with Rocket, describing himself and the character as "the same".[19]He had grown to love the character since working on the first film due to feeling that anorigin storyfor Rocket could justify what aBugs Bunny-like "goofy character" like him could exist in the MCU if it were the saddest one in the universe, crediting it as the "seed" of the trilogy. WhileVol. 3effectively reveals Rocket's backstory throughflashbacksakin to those from the story structure ofThe Godfather Part II(1974), Gunn initially considered telling Rocket's origins in a team-up movie between him andGrootwithout the other Guardians. He was eventually convinced to make a third Guardians-centric film instead of the Rocket and Groot film but chose to use it to tell Rocket's story.[119][120]That month, Gillan confirmed that she was returning for the sequel and expressed excitement for Gunn's return to the franchise.[13]In June, Saldaña was asked about her role in the film after her characterGamorawas killed inInfinity War, and she returned to play a younger version inEndgamewho travels through time to the present. Saldaña said that Gamora's fate would depend on the plans that Marvel and Gunn have forVol. 3, but that she would like to see Gamora rejoin the Guardians and also be portrayed as "the most lethal woman in the galaxy" as she has been referred to previously.[7]Gunn was asked in October if he was unhappy about Marvel's decision to kill Gamora inInfinity Warand said he was not, adding that he had discussed the storyline with the studio beforehand.[121]According toInfinity WarandEndgamescreenwritersChristopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, Gamora was brought back inEndgamespecifically so that Gunn could include her inVol. 3.[8]
In December 2019, Gunn was asked if he would have Yondu return in the film and said as long as he was involved with theGuardianscharacters, he would not have the character be resurrected. Gunn felt the stakes of a character's death were important and said characters who die in his films would likely remain dead.[122]Gunn said in February 2020 that bringing Yondu back to life would "nullify Yondu's sacrifice" inVol. 2, and said the character would not return unless it was for a prequel or flashback;[123]Gunn later said Yondu would not be resurrected in the film to not diminish his death's meaning.[124]In April, Gunn said theCOVID-19 pandemicwould not affect production plans for the film at that time,[125]saying the next month that the film would be released "a little after 2021".[86]In August, Gunn turned in a new draft of the film's script and began writing a spin-off television series fromThe Suicide SquadtitledPeacemaker(2022).[126]A month later, he was planning to begin work onVol. 3in 2021 after completing that film and series.[127]He confirmed in November that the script forVol. 3was finished,[128]and said that very little had changed from his initial ideas despite the production setbacks.[129]The film was given a 2023 release date a month later,[130]with filming set to begin in late 2021.[129][131]Shortly after, it was revealed to also be set afterThe Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special(2022).[132]
Pre-production work creating the designs and visuals for the film began by April 2021.[133]In early May, Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released on May 5, 2023.[134]Later that month, Gunn saidVol. 3would take place after the events ofThor: Love and Thunder(2022), which features severalGuardianscharacters.[135]That film concludes the storyline established inEndgamewhich seesThorjourney off with the Guardians. Gunn noted this ending was decided upon "in editing" and conflicted with his already-submitted screenplay forVol. 3, since he never planned to feature Thor in the film.[136]Gunn had begun storyboarding the film by June,[137]with filming later revealed to begin in November 2021 inAtlanta, Georgiafor an expected end around April 2022.[138][139][140]By then, Bautista said he had not read a script forVol. 3and was unsure if it had changed during the production delays.[138]The next month, Gillan said that she and Klementieff had read the script together and she found it to be incredible, brilliant, emotional, and funny. She also felt it was Gunn's "strongest work yet" with the Guardians characters.[141]Gunn reiterated that the script had "basically stayed the same" from three years prior but he had been "playing with it in little ways" over the years. He was in the middle of another draft by the end of the month and said the film would be emotional and have a "heavier" story than the previous films,[140][142]with a more grounded approach that was inspired byThe Suicide SquadandPeacemaker.[143]An early option Gunn had in mind for the character who would become the film's main villain and be revealed to be the one who created Rocket was theFantastic FourvillainAnnihilus, but Gunn ultimately opted to fill that role with theHigh Evolutionary.[144]Gunn originally wrote acameo appearanceforKumail Nanjiani, a friend of his, but removed this after learning Nanjiani was cast asKingoin Marvel Studios'Eternals(2021).[145]
By late August, Gunn and Marvel Studios began meeting with actors for the role of Adam Warlock, includingWill Poulter,[22]who auditioned for the role overZoombefore an in-personscreen testwith Gunn in Atlanta.[146]Poulter initially knew the character had been teased at the end ofVol. 2, but was not told the character's name until he was "drip-fed" information about Warlock's "steeped" comic book history with the High Evolutionary.[147]George MacKayhad also been on the shortlist andRegé-Jean Pagewas considered for the part,[22][148]whileDavid Corenswetalso auditioned andAaron Pierrewas almost cast in the role. They were later cast by Gunn for theDC Universe(DCU) franchise, respectively as theDC ComicscharactersSupermanin the filmSuperman(2025) andJohn Stewart / Green Lanternin the television seriesLanterns(2026).[149][150]In September, Gillan reiterated her positive comments about the script and said the film would explore the characters from the previousGuardiansfilms on a deeper level,[151]whileSeth Green, who voicesHoward the Duckin the MCU, said the film would be about Gamora and Nebula's story. He did not know at that time if Howard would appear after doing so in the previousGuardiansfilms.[152]Poulter was cast as Adam Warlock in October,[22][148]and Gunn said "dozens of roles" had already been cast.[153]Poulter was chosen for the part because of his dramatic and comedic abilities and because Gunn "wanted somebody who was youthful" and would fit with Marvel Studios' future plans for the character.[23]Casting also took place for various background roles, including aliens and security guards.[154][155]Pratt began rehearsals and camera tests later that month,[156]and a production meeting was held in early November, shortly before the start of filming. Gunn also reiterated his comments on not resurrecting Yondu in the film.[157]
Principal photographybegan on November 8, 2021,[158]atTrilith Studiosin Atlanta, Georgia,[155][159]under theworking titleHot Christmas.[115]Henry Brahamserved as cinematographer, after doing so forVol. 2,The Suicide Squad,  andThe Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special.[160]Filming was previously scheduled to begin in January or February 2019 prior to Gunn's firing,[107][108]and then in February 2021,[115]before Gunn began work onPeacemaker.[127]With the start of filming,Sylvester Stallonerevealed that he would return asStakar OgordfromVol. 2,[37]and Gunn posted a photo of the main cast members which revealed thatChukwudi Iwujiwas part of the film following his collaboration with Gunn onPeacemaker.[158][161]Iwuji's screen test for the film was shot on the set ofPeacemakerwith that series' crew, and Marvel repaid this favor by letting Gunn use theVol. 3set and crew to filmEzra Miller's cameo appearance asBarry Allen / The Flashfor thePeacemakerfirst-season finale.[143]
Production designer Beth Mickle said Gunn chose to mainly use practical effects forVol. 3after they did so with their work onThe Suicide Squad.[162]In February 2021, Gunn stated the film would be shot usingIndustrial Light & Magic'sStageCraftvirtual production technology that was developed for theDisney+Star WarsseriesThe Mandalorian,[163]but in October, he said they would not be able to use the technology because the sets were too big,[164]believing they were larger than the sets used onThe Suicide Squad.[165]The interior of the Guardians' new ship, theBowie, was a four-story set.[166]Judianna Makovskyserved as costume designer.[167]The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Specialwas filmed at the same time asVol. 3,[15][168]from February to late April 2022,[169][170]with the same main cast and sets.[132][142][166]Gunn enjoyed being able to switch to filming the special after doing scenes forVol. 3, given the tonal difference between the two withVol. 3being more "emotional",[171]feeling it helped provide a "relief" to the actors as well,[15]and called theHoliday Specialshoot easier thanVol. 3.[166]In February 2022, Callie Brand was revealed to appear in the film as an alien.[63]Shooting was also expected to occur inLondon, England, in late 2021.[172]Vol. 3is the first MCU film to feature the word "fuck" uncensored; it is spoken by Quill. The dialogue "Open the fucking door" was not scripted, but improvised by Pratt on Gunn's suggestion,[173][174][175]although, there was some consideration over giving theone-linerto Groot instead.[176]Gunn was inspired by the Korean filmThe Villainess(2017) for the action scenes inVol. 3.[177]Filming onVol. 3wrappedon May 6, 2022.[178]

Drew Taylor ofTheWrapcalled the trailer a doozy, thrilling, and emotional, and stated that "Gunn's patented, rollicking 'Guardians of the Galaxy' tone is very much in place", and noted "an undercurrent of extreme melancholy".[202]Carson Burton ofVarietypredicted from the trailer that the film would be "shaping up to be an emotional ending" by showing Rocket's memories and Star-Lord missing Gamora.[27]Jay Peters atThe Vergesaid the trailer intrigued him as a "wild ride across the stars" with different planets.[203]

Thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoesreported an approval rating of 82% based on 404 reviews with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "A galactic group hug that might squeeze a little too tight on the heartstrings, the finalGuardians of the Galaxyis a loving last hurrah for the MCU's most ragtag family."[232]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted average scoreof 64 out of 100, based on 63 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[233]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, the same as the previous twoGuardiansfilms, whilePostTrakreported that moviegoers gave the film a 91% positive score, with 79% saying they would definitely recommend it.[224]
The Independentfound it was "the best Marvel movie in years"[234]as didVox[235]and theCBC.[236]In mixed reviews,Peter BradshawofThe Guardian[237]and Nicholas Barber of theBBCagreed the film was overlong, Barber opining that "the film's saving grace is that, just as Gunn has been allowed to unleash his gonzo imagination, he has also been allowed to pour out his emotions."[238]Wendy Ide ofThe Observerlauded the films for its emotional weight and deemed it a satisfying conclusion, stating that "What elevates Vol 3 (supposedly the final film in theGOTGseries) is the way it keeps that personality, nodding to the irreverent swagger that is a crucial component of theGuardiansUSP while delivering a series of devastating emotional sucker punches along the way."[239]Matt Singer fromScreenCrushpraised the film for concluding Rocket's arc story stating that "a character tells Rocket that the events unfolding onscreen have beenhisstory all along — and withGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, it does feel like Marvel has spent $200 million on a movie about a melancholy space raccoon looking for love and acceptance."[240]
Writing forThe Verge, Charles Pulliam-Moore praised the film's action sequences and storyline and commented that "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3tells the action-packed, flashback-filled story of how Rocket Raccoon's (Bradley Cooper) life being gravely endangered gives the rest of the Guardians a reason to come together and really start working on some of the emotional issues that've been haunting them sinceEndgame."[241]The Hindustan Timespraised Gunn's direction and writing, commenting that "As James Gunn concludes his journey with these characters he clearly cares so deeply about, you can't help but reflect on your own. Walking out, I had my own little flashback montage playing in my head of all the adventures we've been on and foes we've faced with this lovable group of galaxy-saving idiots."[242]Nathan Durr ofCBS Newspraised the film's soundtrack and stated that "There's no exception here regarding the soundtrack as Gunn and company cleverly implement songs that add weight to the complexities and emotions of the characters."[243]
A negative review fromNPRcriticized the approach ofcruelty to animalsin the film,[244]whileThe New York Timescalled it a "dour, visually off-putting two-and-a-half-hourA.S.P.C.A. nightmare of a film (that) may only be for completionist fans",[245]and theChicago Tribune, "the most empty, brutal MCU movie yet".[246]Conversely,People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals(PETA) declared the film to be "the bestanimal rightsfilm of the year", and gave Gunn a "Not a Number Award" for his depiction of animal testing.[247]
In February 2021, the documentary seriesMarvel Studios: Assembledwas announced.[283]The special on this film, "The Making ofGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3", was released on Disney+ on September 13, 2023.[284]
Gunn said in April 2017 that a fourthGuardiansfilm could happen, although, it would likely center on a new group of characters since Gunn planned to conclude the story of the current team inVol. 3.[285]Later in September, Gunn said he was unlikely to return for anotherGuardiansfilm but would continue to work with Marvel Studios on other projects that use the Guardians and cosmic characters.[286]One such project from Gunn was a film centered on Drax and Mantis, which Bautista called "brilliant". However, in May 2021, Bautista stated that he had not heard any further updates regarding it, feeling Marvel Studios was not "very interested, or it doesn't fit into the way they have things mapped out".[287]Gunn confirmed in September 2019 that he intended forVol. 3to be his lastGuardiansfilm,[288]which he reaffirmed in May 2021.[289]In July 2021, Gillan expressed her desire to continue playing Nebula afterVol. 3.[290]In April 2023, Saldaña confirmed thatVol. 3would be the last time she portrays Gamora, but hoped Marvel would recast the role with a younger actor because she wished for the character to continue.[10]
Pratt indicated in May 2023 that he was willing to continue playing Peter Quill if the right script came along,[291]and a note at the end ofVol. 3'spost-credits scene states that the "Legendary Star-Lord" will return to the MCU.[43]In December 2024, Gunn said he had given his blessing to Pratt to continue in the role without him, and he was excited for Marvel to use the Guardians again in future projects. He noted that there were planned spin-offs that did not eventuate but still could without his involvement, including a television series focused on the Ravagers and a project that he called "Legendary Star-Lord" which they "had a whole idea for".[120]

The company was originally established byWalt Disneyin 1953 asBuena Vista Film Distribution Company Inc.(later renamedBuena Vista Distribution Inc.andBuena Vista Pictures Distribution Inc.). It took on its current name in late 2007.[7][8]
Before in 1953, Disney's productions were previously distributed by:
A dispute withRKO Picturesin 1953 over the distribution ofThe Living Desert, Disney's first full-length film in theTrue-Life Adventuresseries,[9]led Walt and his older brotherRoy O. Disneyto form its wholly owned subsidiary, the Buena Vista Film Distribution Company, Inc. (BVDC), to handle North American distribution of their own products.[7]RKO refused to distribute the film.[9]The name "Buena Vista" came from the eponymous street in Burbank, California, where theWalt Disney Studioswas located (and remains to this day). Buena Vista's first release was theAcademy Award-winning live-action featureThe Living Deserton November 10, 1953, along withToot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, Buena Vista's first animated release.[10]Notable subsequent releases included the Austrian filmVictoria in Dover, the JapaneseDaieifilmPrincess Yang Kwei Fei(Most Noble Lady), released in US theaters in September 1956,[11][12][13]The Missouri Travelerin March 1958,[10]andThe Big Fishermanin July 1959 (the first third-party production financed by Disney).[10]
By July 5, 1957,RKO Japan, Ltd.was sold to Disney Productions and British Commonwealth Film Corporation. In allocating the foreign film licenses to the company, Disney would use 5 and Commonwealth 8.[14]
In April 1960, the company dropped "Film" from its name.[8]In 1961, Disney incorporated Buena Vista International (BVI),[15]distributing its first PG-rated film,Take Down, in January 1979.[10]The low-budget movie was not produced by the Disney studios and was acquired from an independent studio, makingThe Black Holethe first PG-rated Disney film.[16]In late July 1990, Buena Vista changed its name to Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc. (BVPD).[8]
In the 1980s, Disney purchased a controlling stake in one ofPacific Theatres' chains[17]leading to Disney's Buena Vista Theaters and Pacific to renovate theEl Capitan Theatreand theCrestby 1989.[18]The Crest was finished first while El Capitan opened with the premiere ofThe Rocketeerfilm on June 19, 1991.[19]
In 1992, Buena Vista made production loans totaling $5.6 million toCinergi Picturesfor its filmMedicine Manand its 1994 filmsRenaissance ManandColor of Nightand were distributing Cinergi's films. The corporation purchased a 12.8% share in Cinergi with its initial public offering in 1994.[20]Soon, BVPD signed a 25 picture distribution deal with Cinergi.[21][22]
Gaumontand Disney formed Gaumont Buena Vista International, a joint venture in French distribution, in 1993.[23]In August 1996, Disney andTokuma ShotenPublishing agreed that Disney would distributeStudio Ghiblianimated films and provide 10% of the production cost of the studio's current in-production film,Spirited Away.[24][25][26]Disney would go on to produce the English dubs and distribute 15 of Ghibli's films, through theWalt Disney Pictures,Buena Vista Home Video,MiramaxandTouchstone Picturesbanners.[27]
In September 1996, following Disney's acquisition ofCapital Cities/ABC, Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc. was merged[8]into ABC, Inc.,[28]the parent company of that group.
For the November 1995 premiere ofToy Story, Disney rented theHollywood Masonic Temple—adjacent to the El Capitan Theatre—forTotally Toy Story, a multimediafunhouseand a promotional event for the movie.[29]On July 17, 1998, Buena Vista Pictures Distribution purchased theHollywood Masonic Templebuilding to continue using it as a promotional venue.[30]
By 1997, BVPD's share in Cinergi dropped to 5%. After nine films were delivered under the agreement, Cinergi sold on November 22, 1997 all of its 12-film library with the exception ofDie Hard with a Vengeanceto Disney, plus $20 million in exchange for Disney's Cinergi share holdings, production advances of $35.4 million and other loans.[22]In 2002, Disney signed a four animated film deal withVanguard Animation;[31]however,only one filmwas released under that negotiation.[32]
In 2004, BVI and Gaumont dissolved their French distribution joint venture, Gaumont Buena Vista International.[23]Buena Vista International agreed to a distribution deal with MegaStar Joint Venture Company Limited in April 2006 for the Vietnam market.[33]
On April 25, 2007, Disney discontinued the usage of theBuena Vistabrand in its distribution branding.[7]
In early 2009, Disney entered a distribution agreement with a reorganizedDreamWorks; the deal called for an estimated 30 films over a five-year period from DreamWorks and they would be released through the Touchstone banner.[34]In 2011,GKIDSacquired the North American theatrical distribution rights of the Ghibli films, withWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainmentretaining the home video rights until July 2017 whenShout! Factorytook over the home video rights. However, Disney only handles home video distribution of the company's films in Japan and formerly Taiwan and China.[35][36]
Disney's distribution deal with DreamWorks expired in August 2016, after the two studios decided to not renew their agreement on December 16, 2015, withUniversal Picturesreplacing Disney as DreamWorks' distributor.[37][38]By the end of the deal, Disney had distributed 14 of DreamWorks's original 30-picture agreement; thirteen through Touchstone and one throughWalt Disney Pictures.[39][40]Disney took complete ownership rights of those 14 DreamWorks films fromAmblin Partnersin exchange for loans made to that company.[41]The Light Between Oceans, the final film in that distribution deal, was also the last film released under Touchstone.
On December 14, 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced plans topurchase 21st Century Fox, which included20th Century FoxandFox Searchlight Pictures. On March 20, 2019, the acquisition of 21st Century Fox was completed.[42]Following the reorganization and renaming of the acquired film units, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures began distributing20th Century Studiosfilms in the United States, while Searchlight continued to operate their autonomous distribution unit.[43][6]

Internationalfor the release of Disney and Touchstone films in many overseas markets except inAustraliaandNew Zealand, where distribution went throughRoadshow Distributorsinstead (due to Roadshow also theatrically distributing Warner films as well during this period), with Disney retaining full control of all distribution and marketing decisions on their product (one notable practice in this policy is obscuring Warner references in posters and it is credited only in very small text with the exception of some UK posters where sometimes the full logo is shown).[78]Warner previously had an overseas distribution partnership withColumbia Pictures, but it was dissolved in 1988.
In 1992, Disney opted to end their joint venture with Warner Bros. to start autonomously distributing their films in these aforementioned overseas markets beginning withAladdin, inspiring Warner Bros. to establish theFamily Entertainmentlabel to self-distribute family-friendly films under the Warner umbrella at the same period. In those territories from 1993 to 2007, Disney reactivated the Buena Vista International name, and also sent distribution under it in countries that did not have any current arrangements with other companies.[citation needed]Disney would then continue its overseas film distribution relationship with Warner Bros. through a home video distribution deal in Europe and Australia in whichWarner Home Videodistributed select Disney material on DVD from 1999 to 2002, when Disney opted to self-distribute DVDs in these aforementioned territories.
Italia Film, aLebanesefilm distribution and production company, is Disney's exclusive theatrical film distribution partner for various Middle East and North Africa (MENA) markets since 1993, after making a deal directly with Buena Vista International at the time.
