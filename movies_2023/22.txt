Momoa pitched a story for anAquamansequel during the first film's production. Wan did not want to rush a sequel after the first film's commercial success but agreed in January 2019 to oversee development. Johnson-McGoldrick signed on to return as screenwriter a month later, and Wan was confirmed to be returning as director in August 2020. He said the film would expand onAquaman'sworldbuilding, have a more serious tone, and feature themes such asclimate change. It is abuddy comedybetween Aquaman and Orm, and was inspired by theSilver Age of Comic Bookswith a retro science fiction vibe similar to the works of animatorRay Harryhausenand thehorror films of the 1960s, specificallyPlanet of the Vampires(1965). Wan announced the sequel's title in June 2021, andprincipal photographybegan later that month and concluded in January 2022. Filming took place in the United Kingdom, Hawaii, Los Angeles, and New Jersey, with additional filming in New Zealand. Severalreshootstook place between July 2022 and June 2023 to alter the storyline while some actors' roles were reduced, including Heard's whose involvement was the subject of controversy during production.
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdompremiered at a fan event atthe Grove, Los Angeleson December 19, 2023, and was released in the United States on December 22. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed $439 million worldwide against a production budget of $205–215 million.
Four years after becoming king ofAtlantis,[a]Arthur Curryhas marriedMeraand had a son,Arthur Jr., while splitting his life between land and sea. Meanwhile,David Kane / Black Mantacontinues to seek revenge against Arthur for his father's death, working with marine biologistStephen Shinto findAtlanteanartifacts. When Shin accidentally discovers a cavern inAntarctica, Manta finds a Black Trident that possesses him, its creator promising to give him the power to destroy Arthur and Atlantis.
Five months later, Manta breaks into anOrichalcumreserve on Atlantis to steal them to power his Atlantean machines that are of ancient origin but are of unknown design to modern Atlanteans. They are caught midway and chased by Atlantean forces, with Mera injured in the ensuing battle. Arthur learns that this usage of Orichalcum, which emits high quantities ofgreenhouse gases, has not only raised planetary temperatures and causedextreme weatherandocean acidification, but nearly caused a planetary extinction in the past when used by an ancient Atlantean kingdom. To learn where Manta is hiding, Arthur breaks his half-brother,Orm, out of prison, and they visit apirate havencalled the Sunken Citadel, meeting Kingfish to learn of Manta's whereabouts.
The information they obtain leads them to avolcanic islandin the South Pacific, where they battle Manta's forces after getting themselves through flora and fauna mutated by the Orichalcum. There, Orm touches the Black Trident, which shows him visions of its provenance. Orm learns the trident was created byKordax, the brother ofKing Atlanand ruler of the lost kingdom of Necrus. Kordax was imprisoned withblood magicfollowing a failed attempt to usurp the throne. Realizing the blood of any of Atlan's descendants could release Kordax; the pair deduce Manta has kidnapped Arthur Jr. With Shin's help, the Atlanteans determine that Kordax's prison and the lost kingdom of Necrus are located in Antarctica.
In Necrus, Arthur fights Manta and is almost killed before Mera arrives and saves him. Manta throws the Black Trident at Mera, but Orm catches it before it strikes her. The spirit of Kordax leaves Manta for Orm, who proceeds to fight Arthur and uses Arthur's blood to free Kordax. Arthur convinces his brother to give up his hatred for him, allowing him to destroy both Kordax and the Black Trident. With Kordax's magic vanishing, Necrus starts to collapse. Manta refuses Arthur's help and allows himself to fall into afissure. The Atlanteans and Shin safely escape and decide that Orm has redeemed himself. They plan to inform Atlantis that Orm died on the condition that he remains hidden, vacating to the surface world. Believing the unification of the underwater kingdoms and the surface world is necessary to prevent further damage to the oceans and planet, Arthur reveals Atlantis' existence through an announcement at theUnited Nations, declaring his intentions of making the kingdom amember state.

Also returning from the first film areJohn Rhys-Daviesas the voice of the Brine King;[42]as well as the giantseahorseStorm, Arthur'ssteed;[43][10]and the octopusT.O.P.O., which stands for "Tactical Observation and Pursuit Operative",[44]who is a tacticalcovert operativefor Atlantis that aids Arthur in freeing Orm and on their quest, in addition to playing several instruments, such as the drums.[19][45][46][17]Wan said T.O.P.O., who was created through visual effects, was a "realcharacter" in the film after briefly appearing in the first film, with an actor occasionally standing in for T.O.P.O. with a stick puppet for Momoa to act against.[45]The director described the character and Arthur as having a fun slightly antagonistic relationship, while Momoa said T.O.P.O. added a lot of comedy which complemented Arthur being "very salty".[46]
During the production ofAquaman(2018), starJason Momoadeveloped a storypitchfor a sequel that he gave toWarner Bros. Pictures GroupchairmanToby Emmerichand producerPeter Safran. In October 2018, before the film's release, Momoa said he would be more involved in the development of a potential sequel and expected filming to begin in 2019. DirectorJames Wansaid several storylines could spin out fromAquaman, with that film introducingseven underwater kingdomsthat had yet to be fully explored.[12][49]Momoa and his producing partner Brian Mendoza wrote a 50-pagetreatmentfor the sequel, which Warner Bros. bought but did not entirely follow,[14]and the actor was paid $15 million for his involvement.[50]Emmerich had enough confidence in box office projections for the film by early December to begin discussing a sequel.[51]By the end of January 2019, whenAquamanwas set to become the highest-grossing film based on a singleDC Comicscharacter, Warner Bros. was in negotiations with Wan to oversee the development and writing of a sequel with the potential to return as director. Geoff Boucher ofDeadline Hollywoodnoted that Wan had been very protective of sequels to his previous filmsInsidious(2010) andThe Conjuring(2013), and was "deeply invested" in theworldbuildingofAquaman. Wan had previously compared the world ofAquamanto other fictional worlds such asMiddle-earth, theStar Warsgalaxy, and theWizarding World.[52]
In early February 2019, Warner Bros. hired Noah Gardner and Aidan Fitzgerald to write the script for a "horror-tinged"Aquamanspin-off film titledThe Trench, based on one of the kingdoms introduced in the first film. It was expected to have a smaller budget and not feature the main cast ofAquaman, with Wan and Safran producing. Borys Kit ofThe Hollywood Reporterreported then that there had not yet been serious discussions about a direct sequel toAquamanbetween the studio, Wan, and Momoa, due to them wanting to have a "breather" first,[53]but several days later he reported that active development on a sequel was getting underway with the first film's co-writer, and frequent Wan collaborator,David Leslie Johnson-McGoldricksigning on to write the screenplay. Wan and Safran were producing the sequel, however, it was still unclear if Wan would direct it.[54]At the end of February, Warner Bros. scheduledAquaman 2for release on December 16, 2022.[55]The next month, Safran explained that he and Wan did not want to rush a sequel, and Warner Bros. had been supportive of that which is why the film's release was scheduled for four years after the first film. He added that they were approaching theAquamanfranchise similarly toThe ConjuringUniverse, with spin-offs likeThe Trenchexploring stories about the underwater kingdoms alongside the "mothership" films featuringAquaman. Safran said Wan knew "the architecture, the armory, the military, the look, the feel, [and] the general vibe" of each of the seven kingdoms and wanted to explore them all in future projects.[48]
In July 2019, Wan was set to direct the filmMalignant(2021) before beginning work onAquaman 2.[56]Patrick Wilsonsaid in November that he had discussed plans for the sequel with Wan and indicated that he would be reprising his role asOrm Marius / Ocean Masterfrom the first film.[57]A month later,Yahya Abdul-Mateen IIconfirmed that he was returning asDavid Kane / Black Manta, and was looking to flesh out the character.[22]Johnson-McGoldrick stated in March 2020 that the sequel would not be based on a specific comic book, but was taking inspiration from theAquamanstories of theSilver Age of Comic Booksthat featured Black Manta as the villain.[58]Wan was confirmed to be directing the sequel at the virtualDC FanDomeevent in August,[47]when Wilson was also confirmed to return.[59]Wan said it would be more serious than the first film and feature themes that were more relevant to the real world,[47]such asclimate change. He said the creatives were not afraid to address this in a big way through the film, citing that the Aquaman character is environmentally conscious in the comic books and fights to keep the ocean clean. He also affirmed that the film would remain a "fun action-fantasy movie".[60]Momoa said a scene was featured in the film in which Aquaman addresses theUnited Nationson climate change, with the actor having previously done so at the UN'sOcean Conference.[61]Wan added that the film would include more worldbuilding and exploration of the underwater kingdoms,[47]and would feature some horror elements similar to the Trench sequence in the first film.[62]Being able to expand on the worldbuilding of the first film was one of the key reasons that Wan chose to direct the sequel, along with Johnson-McGoldrick's script which Wan felt had a "really cool story to bring all these characters back, and then growing them in a big way".[63]Safran felt embracing the mythic nature of the Aquaman character and pairing that with the film's worldbuilding and visual storytelling made the film compelling,[15]and he and Momoa both believed the film's humor exceeded that of the first film,[61][10]while Wan said Aquaman was at the center of the film with his charm and humor.[15]
Amber Hearddebunked rumors in November 2020 that she would not be reprising her role asMerafrom the first film following allegations of domestic abuse made against her by her ex-husbandJohnny Depp. That month, a petition to have Heard fired from the franchise received more than 1.5 million signatures, and came after Warner Bros. removed Depp fromFantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore(2022) when allegations made byThe Sunthat Depp abused Heard were ruled to be "substantially true" in the defamation lawsuitDepp v News Group Newspapers Ltd, filed againstThe Sun'sowner.[18][64]Safran said they never considered making the film without Heard and would not react to the "pure fan pressure" of the petition and other social media conversations.[65]However, Heard later stated, during a second defamation trial inDepp v. Heardthat was brought against her by Depp over a column inThe Washington Post, that "they didn't want to include" her in the film, and that she had to fight to keep her part. She claimed that revisions were made to the script that reduced her role to a "very pared down version", including removing action sequences for her character, and she was unable to renegotiate heroption contractthat stipulated she would earn $2 million for the sequel, which was double what she made for the first film.[66][67][68]By that point, in May 2022, the petition to have Heard removed from the film had received more than four million signatures.[66]
DC FilmspresidentWalter Hamadatestifiedduring Depp and Heard's defamation trial that the studio did consider recasting Mera, but this was due to concerns over Heard's lack of chemistry with Momoa rather than the abuse allegations. He added that it was the studio's philosophy to "hold people to their options" and not to renegotiate contracts, and said the size of Heard's role had not changed during the sequel's development. Hamada explained that the film was always intended to be abuddy comedythat focused on the relationship between Aquaman and Orm.[69][70]Safran compared this relationship to that ofNick NolteandEddie Murphy's characters in the film48 Hrs.(1982), while Wan said the film was written as a "bromanceaction-adventure" story focused on that relationship with the two brothers "overcoming their differences to save the world", compared to the first film which focused on Aquaman's relationship with Mera.[10][15]Tatiana Siegel atVarietyreported that Heard had been "nearly fired" from the sequel after the first film's release due to the chemistry concerns, but these plans were abandoned after her ex-boyfriendElon Muskintervened. Siegel also reported that the "lack-of-chemistry narrative" had been disputed, citing that Heard had performed achemistry testwith Momoa on the first film and had been cast over two other actresses, includingAbbey Lee. Heard described her experience with Momoa and Wan on the film's set as hostile, which was refuted by a DC spokesperson who called the production positive and collaborative.[7]Depp v. Heard'sjury ultimately found that both Heard and Depp defamed each other, with Heard having defamed Depp on three counts and Depp having defamed her on one count.[71]Social media responses to the trial heavily favored Depp over Heard, with several memes and videos "mocking her testimony". In June 2022, reports emerged that Heard had been fired from the film following the trial, but these were also debunked.[72]Heard ultimately appeared for around 20 minutes in the film,[73]with two of her scenes – a fight sequence with Black Manta and a love scene with Momoa — reportedly cut during production.[7]Several commentators noted upon the film's release that many of Heard's scenes had been removed and that the remaining scenes appeared to be "clunky" and "awkward".[73]ActorDolph Lundgren, who portrays Mera's fatherNereus, later said that he and Heard had larger roles in theoriginal cutand script before they were reduced duringreshoots.[21][74]
In February 2021, Lundgren said he was reprising his role as Nereus in the sequel, with filming expected to begin later that year in London.[29]A month later, the planned start date for filming was revealed to be in June, although, there was potential for this to be impacted by theCOVID-19 pandemic.[75]Richard Sale was also revealed to be serving as the costume designer, after previously serving as an assistant costume designer on DC'sWonder Woman 1984(2020).[75][76]IWC Schaffhausencreated red and blue glowingSuper-LumiNovaprop watches for the film, which were worn by Abdul-Mateen II andRandall Park.[77]In April, Warner Bros. and DC announced that development onThe Trenchwas no longer moving forward, with the studios not having room for the spin-off on their slate of films and believingAquaman 2to be enough of an expansion of the franchise for the time being;[78]Wan later revealed thatThe Trenchhad been theworking titleand a misdirect for a planned Black Manta film.[27]Later that month,Pilou Asbækentered talks to join the film's cast.[79]Momoa said in May that he would begin filming in July,[80]and Wan announced a month later that the sequel was titledAquaman and the Lost Kingdom,[81]whileTemuera Morrisonconfirmed his return as Aquaman's fatherThomas Curry.[30]Willem Dafoewas also reported to be reprising his role asNuidis Vulkofrom the first film,[82][83]but he ultimately did not appear, which Wan attributed to scheduling conflicts. The director felt that Vulko's absence allowed for Atlanna's role to be expanded as her son's advisor on how the underwater world works.[34]
Principal photographybegan on June 28, 2021,[84]using five stages and thebacklotatWarner Bros. Studios Leavesdenin Watford, England, alongside an external tank.[85]Filming used the working titleNecrus,[75]referring to the lost underwater kingdom of Necrus,[75][37][86][87]which is featured in the film.[37]Necrus, also known as "the Black City", debuted inAquaman#30 (1966) as an unstable underwater city rivaling Atlantis that cannot be in the same location twice and originated from an alien satellite.[88][75][86][87]Wan said it was fun designing the lost kingdom of Necrus, detailing it as a society with various vehicles and weapons, such as the one-man operated machines called the Octobots that move in-and-out of water which Orm encounters. For the kingdom's design, he was inspired by theAquamancomics from the Silver Age of Comic Books in the 1960s and their retro vibe.[10][15]Wan feltAntarcticaand its landscape was familiar while remaining largely unvisited by much of the world, which allowed him to explore a heightened version of it in the lost kingdom. For the lost kingdom, the creatives incorporated ancientAtlanteantechnology that was more advanced than typical modern technology used by humans and incorporated it in the uniforms and weapons of Black Manta's crew, his colossal submarine, and the Octobots. The kingdom featured a retro sci-fi look similar to what the Silver Age comics in the 1950s believed the future would have looked like, evoking a different age but with a modern spin.[15]
Many of the crew members returned from the first film,[76][15]includingDon Burgessas the cinematographer and Bill Brzeski as production designer,[89][76]with the latter serving alongside Sahby Mehalla.[2]The special effects and visual effects crew invented new technology and VFX rigs for the underwater scenes in the film so it would be easier for the actors to shoot their scenes, with 100 cameras capturing the performances and action scenes, which was then applied to 3D versions of the actors. This new setup came after Wan found the rigging system used for the first film to be complex and because it caused physical pain for the actors with its equipment. Wan believed the new setup was more versatile and safe.[90][91]Wan said the creatives wanted the sequel to provide a more immersive and exciting experience for audiences while expanding the story and characters, and explained that the depiction of Atlantis in the film was expanded upon from the first film by providing the city depths, residential areas, and an area inspired byTimes Square, while also exploring some of its politics. Atlantis was also given more color and vibrancy.[15]Safran felt the different look and feel of Atlantis was still anchored in what audiences liked from the first film while still feeling fresh and new, highlighting Wan's ability to capture the fantasy and colors of the new worlds being explored. To create the various underwater worlds and creatures, Wan and the creatives transitioned away from theblue screenmethod used on the first film, and instead used the new Eyeline Studio technology, which saw the actors in circular booths surrounded by 136 cameras, which producer Rob Cowan said changed the creative and practical methods of shooting the film.[15]
In August 2021, Wan said the sequel was strongly influenced by the filmPlanet of the Vampires(1965),[92]as well as "old-schoolEuro-horror" and thestop motionmonsters created by animatorRay Harryhausen. He said the film had a "very retro" look similar to thehorror films of the 1960s, and featured unsettling mechanical creatures which had an "old-school sci-fi and horror" feeling, which was connected to Black Manta's role in the film.[93]Brzeski compared the film to Harryhausen's work on the filmsThe 7th Voyage of Sinbad(1958) andJason and the Argonauts(1963) for being afantasticaladventure with a "great quest and monsters",[10]such as theDeserter tribewhich are located in theSaharadesert and evolved intovampiriccreatures by relying on blood for moisture,[17]while incorporating issues modern audiences could relate to.[10]Wilson said they pushed the fight scenes and stunts further than the first film in addition to exploring the characters' relationships. He also revealed that the characterT.O.P.O., an octopus playing drums, appears in the film.[94]Wan said that following the positive reception to T.O.P.O.'s brief appearance in the first film, he and Johnson-McGoldrick decided to give the character a significant role in the sequel,[43]and believed the inclusion of T.O.P.O. and other creatures from the Aquaman comics allowed audiences to know they were embracing the character's fictional world.[43]
Location shootingtook place in early September 2021 at theSaunton Sandsbeach inDevon,[85][95]as well as atPiccadillyin theCity of Westminster, London,[85]and inJersey City, New Jerseythat year.[96]Later that month, Asbæk's casting was confirmed,[97]portrayingKordax, the undead king of Necrus.[37][38]At this time, Randall Park was revealed to be returning from the first film as Dr.Stephen Shin, while the following actors joined the cast:Vincent Reganas the ancient kingAtlan, replacingGraham McTavishwho briefly portrayed the character in the first film; Jani Zhao as Stingray, an original character for the film, in her first English-language feature role; andIndya MooreasKarshon.[28]After shooting 95 percent of the film in the United Kingdom,[98]production moved to Hawaii for on-location shooting until December 9.[99][96]Nicole Kidmanwas confirmed to have reprised her role as Aquaman's motherAtlannashortly after that.[33]Filming then moved to Los Angeles, and officiallywrappedon January 12, 2022, inMalibu.[98]Filming was completed on time and under budget, and reportedly needed around a week ofreshoots.[7]
Warner Bros. adjusted its release schedule in March 2022 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the workload of visual effects vendors.Aquaman and the Lost Kingdomwas moved to March 17, 2023, andThe Flashwas also moved from 2022 to 2023, to allow time for their visual effects work to be completed, whileShazam! Fury of the Godswas moved up to this film's previous release date because it would be ready for release earlier.[100]Wan said that while he preferred the Christmas release timeframe for the film, he was thankful for this delay because it allowed for more time to work on the visual effects and its new technology, which he called groundbreaking, and said the film would not have made its prior release date.[101][102]He had also been working on hisdirector's cutat this time.[102]Wilson also said that new VFX techniques were used forThe Lost KingdomandThe Flash.[94]In April 2022,Discovery, Inc.and WarnerMedia merged to becomeWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD), led by president and CEODavid Zaslav. The new company was expected to restructureDC Entertainmentand Zaslav began searching for an equivalent toMarvel StudiospresidentKevin Feigeto lead the new subsidiary.[103]That June, the final writing credits for the film were revealed: Johnson-McGoldrick received screenplay credit, while the duos of Wan and Johnson-McGoldrick, and Momoa and his producing partner Thomas Pa'a Sibbett received story credit.[104][14]
The film received severaltest screeningsin mid-2022 that were met with mixed results, which continued after it was recut around then, prompting a new cut to be made. Two rounds of reshoots then took place between mid-2022 and the start of 2023, with Warner Bros. film chairsMichael De LucaandPamela Abdyinvolved in editing the film.[105][7]Momoa revealed in July 2022 thatBen Affleckwas reprising hisDC Extended Universe(DCEU) role ofBruce Wayne / Batmanfor reshoots on theWarner Bros. Studios backlotinBurbank, California.[106]Aaron Couch ofThe Hollywood Reporterreported soon after thatMichael Keatonhad filmed a scene as his version ofBruce Wayne / Batmanfrom directorTim Burton'sBatman(1989) andBatman Returns(1992). Keaton's version was set to be introduced to the DCEU inThe Flashbefore that film's release was pushed to afterAquaman and the Lost Kingdom's. The scene reportedly confused audiences during test screenings, and Couch felt this was why Affleck joined the reshoots.[107]In August, Warner Bros. delayed the film to December 25, 2023, to help spread out the marketing and distribution costs for its feature films.[108]This pushed the film's release to after the planned release ofThe Flash, which meant there was potential for Keaton's version of Batman to appear in the film instead of Affleck's.[109]Keaton's cameo had reportedly been cut from the film by October.[110]Around that time, De Luca and Abdy told Wan to reduce the budget for the reshoots because the film's budget had reached $205 million during production.[111]Safran and writer/directorJames Gunnwere hired as the co-chairmen and co-CEOs of the newly formedDC Studiosat the end of the month.[112]A week after starting their new roles, the pair had begun developing an eight-to-ten-year plan for a new franchise called theDC Universe(DCU) that would be a "soft reboot" of the DCEU.[113][114]By mid-November, Safran had been "fixing"The Lost Kingdom,[115]while Gunn had provided notes on it by the following month.[116]Momoa said in January 2023 that he had shot scenes with a couple of actors as Batman, but was unsure which would be included in thefinal cut.[117]After further test screenings in early 2023, Gunn consulted on the film.[105]In April, the film's release date was moved forward five days earlier to December 20, 2023.[118]The reshoots had concluded just before the2023 Writers Guild of America strikebegan early the following month,[7]and the studios approached a third set of reshoots – which increased the film's budget – to occur in New Zealand over five days in mid-June with Momoa and Wilson. Those reshoots were completed in four days. By then, both Affleck and Keaton were excluded from the latest cut of the film due to Gunn and Safran's plans for the DCU;[105]neither actor appeared in the final version of the film.[119]Following the reshoots, the film's budget ultimately reached $215 million.[7]
Explaining the reshoots, Wan said he had to make some adjustments during production as it had been challenging to keep track of the different versions of the DCEU while remaining mindful of other plans for the franchise, but was fortunate that theAquamanfilms were "far removed" from the rest of the DCEU films and characters.[60]In September, the director said the film would not be connected to any previous DCEU films as he was uncertain if it was going to be released before or afterThe Flash, which was intended to reboot the DCEU.[10]He explained that he had directed a relatively small amount of additional photography, which he described as a routine part of the production process, due to some actors being unavailable during some parts of principal photography.[10]Lundgren later said that the studio decided to reshoot much of the footage to rebuild it with a slightly different storyline, reducing his and Heard's roles.[21][74]In October 2023, the film's release was delayed by two days to December 22, 2023.[120]The following month, Warner Bros. signed a new multi-year co-financing deal with Domain Capital for their theatrical films, includingThe Lost Kingdom, through that company's $700 million fund for media and entertainment, Domain Entertainment.[3][4]Kirk Morri returned as the editor from the first film,[38][76]andNick Davisserved as the visual effects supervisor, having previously worked onThe Dark Knight(2008).[76]Nearly each frame in the film featured visual effects,[102][105]which were provided byCinesite,DNEG,Industrial Light & Magic(ILM),Moving Picture Company(MPC),Scanline VFX,[121]andRodeo FX.[122]
Rupert Gregson-Williamsrevealed in August 2021 that he was returning to compose the score for the sequel after doing so for the first film and DC'sWonder Woman(2017).[123]The song "Deep End" was performed byX Ambassadorsand released as a single on November 17, 2023.[124]The soundtrack album for Gregson-Williams' score was released byWaterTower Musicon December 22.[125]
Wan and Wilson teased plans for the film in a panel at the virtualDC FanDomeevent in August 2020.[47]A year later, at DC FanDome 2021, concept art and behind-the-scenes footage from filming were revealed.[23]In February 2022, the first footage from the film was released as part of a teaser for Warner Bros.' 2022 slate of DC films, which also includedThe Batman,Black Adam, andThe Flash(beforeAquaman and the Lost KingdomandThe Flashwere delayed to 2023 the following month).[126][100]Wan promoted the film at Warner Bros.'CinemaConpanel in April 2022, showing a recorded message of Momoa as well as some brief footage from the film.[127]He revealed more concept art for the film when its release date was delayed in August.[109]The first trailer was showcased during Warner Bros.' CinemaCon panel in April 2023, showing the "bromance" between Arthur and Orm among other footage.[128]Steve Weintraub atCollidersaid the footage looked "absolutely massive in scale" and featured several action sequences.[24]The first theatrical trailer was released on September 14, 2023.[129]The cast was not able to participate in marketing during the2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,[7]until the strike ended in November.[130]IWC Schaffhausen, in collaboration with Warner Bros. Pictures, released an Aquatimer Perpetual Calendar Digital Date-Monthdiving watch, inspired by the watches worn by Abdul-Mateen II and Park in the film.[77]
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdompremiered on December 19, 2023, at a fan event screening atthe Grove at Farmers Marketin Los Angeles.[131][132][133]This was noted by Borys Kit ofThe Hollywood Reporterfor not having ared carpetevent and after party, with Wan and Momoa attending after a series ofblue carpetphoto calls and small-scale fan events in London, Beijing, and Los Angeles.[131]The film was released in China on December 20,[130]and in the United States on December 22,[120]inIMAX,3D,4DX, andScreenX, among otherpremium large formats(PLFs).[133][134]It was originally set for release on December 16, 2022,[55]but was moved to March 17, 2023, when Warner Bros. adjusted its release schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the workload of visual effects vendors.[100]It was then moved to December 25, 2023, when Warner Bros. Discovery was trying to spread out marketing and distribution costs,[108]before moving forward to December 20,[118]and ultimately being pushed back by two days to December 22.[120]
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdomwas released byWarner Bros. Home Entertainmentondigital downloadon January 23, 2024,[44]on the Warner Bros. streaming serviceMaxon February 27,[135]and onUltra HD Blu-ray,Blu-ray, andDVDon March 12. It includes behind-the-scenes featurettes, as well as the special feature "Atlantean Blood is Thicker Than Water" which explores Aquaman and Orm's dynamic on both Blu-ray versions and the originalmotion comicAquaman: Through Fire and Wateron premium digital versions.[44]According toNielsen Media Research, which measures the viewership of media on streaming services,The Lost Kingdomwas the most-watched film on streaming upon its debut for the week of February 26 – March 3, 2024, with a total of 685 million minutes watched.[136]
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdomgrossed $124.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $314.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $439.4 million.[8]It became the highest-grossing DCEU film since the firstAquamanfilm, but it grossed less than half of that film's box office revenue.[137]Some commentators deemed that the film "floundered" at the box office,[138][135][136]with Aidan Kelly ofColliderestimating that it needed to earn $305–355 million worldwide to reach itsbreak-even point,[138]while/Film'sHannah Shaw-Williams thought it was unlikely that the film would break even during its theatrical run, even after surpassing a worldwide gross of $400 million.[139]Jill Goldsmith atDeadline Hollywoodnoted that the revenue of Warner Bros.' theatrical films released in the fourth quarter were higher on most releases, includingThe Lost Kingdom, although this was lower than box office analysts had predicted despite lowered projections.[140]
In the United States and Canada,Aquaman and the Lost Kingdomwas released alongsideMigration,Anyone but You, andThe Iron Claw, and was projected to gross around $40 million in its four-day opening weekend.[133]The film earned $13.7 million on its first day, including $4.5 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to have a traditional opening weekend of $27.7 million, the fourth-lowest of the DCEU, and the second-lowest among those films unaffected by theCOVID-19 pandemic.[141][6]It then made $10.6 million on Christmas Day, for a four-day total of $38.3 million.[141]In its second weekend, the film made $19.5 million, a drop of 30%, finishing in third behindWonkaandMigration.[142]In its third weekend, the film made $10.6 million, a drop of 42%, remaining in third.[143]In its fourth weekend, the film made $5.3 million, a drop of 50%, finishing in sixth.[144]
The film received negative reviews from critics.[145][146]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 33% of 213 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Jason Momoa remains a capable and committed leading man, but even DC diehards may feel thatAquaman and the Lost Kingdomsticks to familiar waters."[147]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 42 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[148]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, tied withBatman v Superman: Dawn of JusticeandThe Flashfor the lowest of the DCEU, whilePostTrakreported 69% of filmgoers gave it a positive score, with 50% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[141]
The chemistry between Momoa and Wilson was noted by critics as one of the film's high marks.[149][150]BothPeter BradshawofThe GuardianandThe Independent'sClaire Loughrey provided a one-star rating for the film. Bradshaw compared the humor toTaika Waititi's Marvel filmsThor: Ragnarok(2017) andThor: Love and Thunder(2022) and felt Aquaman's role as a father was a derivative trope "used as a tired relatability short-cut by Hollywood". He also lamented Randall Park's role in the film, feeling it was "entirely wasted", and expressed ambivalent feelings about the cast performances. Meanwhile, Loughrey labeled the film as an "entry in the rogues' gallery of brainless franchise films", opining that Wan might have incorporated elements from his planned projectThe Trenchinto the project. She was surprised the film's theme was about climate change and thought Mera's role was "faux-feminist" and narratively contrived, noting Amber Heard's legal controversies. Furthermore, she also called the set pieces "derivative" and thought the humor negatively impacted the film's emotional moments.[151][152]Giving a two-star review, writer Nicholas Barber of theBBCbegan by expressing his views thatAquaman'sbox office revenue was the primary reason for this film's existence. However, he praised the performances of Wilson and Abdul-Mateen II while noting that Momoa seems to have been miscast as "[h]e's too earthy to be the king of the sea." Barber also called the relationship between Arthur and Orm "clichéd," lamented at the complete waste of Kidman's talent, and opined that while most of Heard's scenes had been edited out, the film's "unrelated plot" was such that her absence did not matter much. Ultimately, he concluded that the film never "attempts anything original or honest" and criticized its "brutal" editing for "rush[ing] through every potentially major event in a blur of montages and voiceovers".[153]David Fear ofRolling Stonefelt it functioned as a standalone film and was separate from the DCEU, but disliked the tone and visual effects. Fear also called the storytelling "curiously thin" and was mixed on its commentary regarding climate change, but appreciated Momoa's performance and thought the film adequately concluded the DCEU.[154]CNN's Brian Lowry negatively compared it toWonder Woman 1984(2020) and felt the lack of a new antagonist was to its detriment, calling David Kane a "one-note villain". He enjoyed Momoa's performance and thought it contributed to the film's "fun", but also was not interested in Arthur and Orm's relationship as it "wades through too many clunky moments to reach the few good ones".[155]Writing for theAssociated Press, Mark Kennedy thought the film's plot to be derivative from other films – such asThe Matrix(1999),Pirates of the Caribbean, andStar Wars– and disliked references to other films. Nevertheless, Kennedy considered Momoa's performance to be "holding it all together," and summed up the film as attempting to raise the stakes by having a higher production budget.[156]
Wan's direction was commended by Alissa Wilkinson atThe New York Timesand Phil Owen ofGameSpot, with Wilkinson crediting him with creating a film "beyond the paint-by-numbers superhero movies we've been watching for decades now". Wilkinson also enjoyed the political commentary, as she felt certain elements were metaphors for authoritarianism and fascism. She primarily enjoyed Wilson's performance and Orm's character development compared toAquaman, but felt certain plot elements and the humor became repetitive and boring. Owen commended the production values but felt it lacked "substance" and was "empty-headed", going on to give the film an 8 out of 10.[157][158]The A.V. Club'sMatthew Jackson gave it a B grade, enthusiastically enjoying the film's depiction of Orm and Arthur's relationship, calling that "formula ... absolute gold, both on a set piece and a character level". Jackson opined that the narrative contained too much and disliked the plotting, but he still felt it could effectively tell a cohesive narrative and enjoyed his overall viewing experience.[159]Michael Ordoña of theLos Angeles Timesfelt it highlighted climate change in an "earnest if clumsy fashion" and expressed minor complaints with the absence of physics during CGI-based action sequences underwater. Ordoña enjoyed the film's "buddy cop movie" tone and noted how it focused on portraying Arthur interacting with his family rather than Mera. He commended the characterization of Arthur and Orm, complimenting the former as the "most alive character in the DCEU", and enjoyed the short runtime.[160]Meanwhile, Bob Strauss from theSan Francisco Chronicleconsidered it to be a decent conclusion for the DCEU, and added that the story and runtime had been concise and efficient, agreeing with Ordoña's sentiments. He mostly enjoyed the film's design and visual effects, but felt it was similar toZack Snyder's then-released filmRebel Moon(2023). He considered the acting effective in conveying the sensation of being underwater, highlighting Arthur and Orm's relationship, but disliked the exposition delivery.[161]
At the49th People's Choice Awards, Momoa was nominated for the Action Movie Star of the Year.[162]The film was nominated forOutstanding Animated Character in a Photoreal Featureat the22nd Visual Effects Society Awardsfor the character T.O.P.O. the Octopus.[163]At the2024 Kids' Choice Awards, the film was nominated forFavorite Movieand Momoa was nominated forFavorite Movie Actor.[164]
By December 2022, Warner Bros. was considering ending theAquamanfilm series and recasting Momoa as the characterLobofollowingAquaman and the Lost Kingdom;[165]Momoa had long been a fan of Lobo.[166]In January 2023, Momoa said while he would "always be Aquaman", he felt he could also portray other characters.[167]Gunn and Safran said Momoa could play Aquaman in the DCU, but a decision on the role had not been made. Because no actor would play multiple characters, Momoa would not portray Aquaman in the DCU if he was instead cast as Lobo.[168]Safran wanted to continue working with Momoa as Aquaman or in another role, and explained that they set a high bar for casting, while feeling Momoa was perfect as Aquaman.[14]In September 2023, Wan saidThe Lost Kingdomset up a sequel, which he expressed interest in directing after a long break.[10]Gunn had saidThe Lost KingdomandThe Flashwould lead into the first DCU filmSuperman(2025),[168]but later clarified that no DC media released before the DCU began in 2024 would be canon to that franchise, leading some commentators to question the possibility of a potential continuation moving forward.[169][170]
By October 2023, no actors from directorZack Snyder's DCEU films were expected to reprise their roles in the DCU, including Momoa as Aquaman. However, Momoa had been in talks to portray Lobo in eitherSupermanor a standalone film for the character.[7]Ahead ofThe Lost Kingdom'srelease in December 2023, Momoa cast doubt on reprising his role as Aquaman because a sequel depended on the film's reception.[132]He had several ideas for continuing the role, such as having a younger character like Aquaman's sonArthur Jr.be featured in a sequel, but said that he would not be replaced with a different actor as Aquaman.[171]Safran said Momoa would "always have a home at DC" and they would figure out his continued involvement followingThe Lost Kingdom,[132]and a year later, Momoa was confirmed to be portraying Lobo in the DCU, starting with the filmSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow(2026).[166]

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]
Warner Bros. owns some shared universes. Some of them are based on books and comics, including some of the highest grossing IP's in the movie industry.

DC Studiosis an American film and television production company that is a division ofWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD). It is responsible for the production of live-action and animated films and television series, as well as video games, based on characters from theAmerican comic bookpublisherDC Comics, primarily as part of its flagshipmedia franchiseandshared universe, theDC Universe(DCU). The studio has been led by writer/directorJames Gunnand producerPeter Safranas its co-chairmen and co-CEOs since it was formed in November 2022.
The studio's predecessor,DC Films, was formed in May 2016 as a division ofWarner Bros. Picturesto oversee DC-based film productions, primarily those from its shared universe franchise theDC Extended Universe(DCEU). It was led by DC comic book and television writerGeoff Johnsand Warner Bros. producer Jon Berg as co-chairmen. After several DCEU films received poor reception and underperformed financially, the duo stepped down by the end of 2017, and the division was reorganized, withWalter Hamadahired as the studio's president. Following the merger of DC and Warner Bros. ownerWarnerMediawithDiscovery, Inc.in April 2022, WBD overhauled operations, resulting in Hamada stepping down in October 2022. DC Films was then dissolved in favor of DC Studios, a new division with greater oversight of DC media. Gunn and Safran, who had worked on some DCEU projects, were hired to lead the studio, and the duo began work on the DCU as a new franchise to serve as asoft rebootof the DCEU.
From 2016 to 2023, DC Films produced 13 films within the DCEU, fromSuicide Squad(2016) toAquaman and the Lost Kingdom(2023), alongside two standalone films,Joker(2019) andThe Batman(2022).Jokerand the studio's filmAquaman(2018) are among the50 highest-grossing filmsof all time, withJokerbecoming the firstR-rated filmto gross over $1 billion. The first DC Studios production is the television seriesThe Penguin(2024), a spin-off fromThe Batman. DC Studios plans to release films and television series within the DCU, starting with the animated seriesCreature Commandosin 2024, and the filmSupermanin 2025. Productions that are not part of the DCU are set to be part of the "DC Elseworlds" label. The studio's first animated film will beDynamic Duo(2028).
After the divisive reception toBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016),Warner Bros. Picturessought to stabilize the direction of its media franchise andshared universe, theDC Extended Universe(DCEU). In May 2016, the studio reorganized to have genre-responsible film executives, thusDC Entertainmentfilms under Warner Bros. Pictures were placed under a new division, DC Films, to be led by Warner Bros.executive vice president, Jon Berg, and thechief creative officerofDC Comics,Geoff Johns. This was done in hopes of competing more directly withMarvel Studios' franchise, theMarvel Cinematic Universe. Johns kept his role at DC Comics, and reported to DC Entertainment's president,Diane Nelson, while Berg reported to Warner Bros. Pictures' president, Greg Silverman.[3]The division's formation was not designed to override the "director-driven" mandate.[8]
Justice League(2017) had one of the biggest film budgets (nearly $300 million) but grossed about $96 million in its opening weekend. An analysis inThe Washington Postexpected that there would be a course correction again, with a possible change in leadership.[9]Forbescontributors felt that the course correction would be for DC Films to give up on the shared universe, while continuing with theWonder Womanfilms and occasionally other films, as Warner Bros. had other franchises they could work with.[10]Despite this, in December, the studio reiterated their planned film slate for the DCEU.[11]That same month, Warner Bros. announced that a new strategy and organization of DC Films would occur, with Berg leaving his position as the studio's co-president of production to form a Warner Bros.–based production company withRoy Lee.[12][13]Johns was expected to remain involved in future DC films moving forward in an advisory role while continuing as the president and chief creative officer of DC Entertainment, with Warner Bros. expected to hire a new studio head.[12]In January 2018, Warner Bros. executiveWalter Hamadawas appointed as the new president of DC Films, to oversee the films in the DCEU. Hamada was closely associated withNew Line Cinema, and helped develop horror films, such asIt(2017) andThe Conjuringfilm franchise.[14]Johns subsequently left his role at DC Entertainment that June and he was no longer involved with the DCEU.[7]
In April 2022, after the merger between Warner Bros.' parent companyWarnerMediaandDiscovery, Inc.to formWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the new CEODavid Zaslavwas exploring a restructuring of DC Entertainment, including having a creative leader akin to Marvel Studios presidentKevin Feigeto lead its film and television projects.[15]Later in July,Toby Emmerichstepped down as the head of the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group. The group was restructured to give DC Films, Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, andWarner Animation Grouprespective leadership. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De LucaandPamela Abdybecame the co-executives of Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. They were also temporarily signed to oversee the remaining units of the group until the new positions were filled.[16][17]
When the release of the filmBatgirlwas canceled by WBD in August, Hamada was not consulted regarding the decision and only learned about it when De Luca and Abdy informed him at a test screening forBlack Adam(2022). Hamada was upset and considered resigning, but agreed to stay untilBlack Adam'srelease.[18]Later that month,Dan Linentered talks to oversee DC's film and television divisions. From this position, Lin was expected to report directly to Zaslav, while Hamada would depart the studio.[19][20]In September, Lin and WBD ended negotiations and agreed to part ways.[21]DuringBlack Adam'sTimes Square premiere in October, star and producerDwayne Johnsonsaid he could be a consultant at DC Films, helping the studio find its next creative leader.[22]Later that month, it was reported that De Luca had been effectively running DC Films in place of Hamada.[23]On October 19, Hamada departed the company, two days before the release ofBlack Adam.[24]
Less than a week after Hamada's departure, writer/directorJames Gunnand producerPeter Safran, who had previously worked together on the DCEU projectsThe Suicide Squad(2021) and its spin-off seriesPeacemaker(2022), were announced as the co-CEOs and co-chairmen of DC Studios, a newly-created production entity under WBD. DC Films was dissolved, and DC Studios helped oversee the remaining films from the studio that were pending release in 2023. The duo was tasked with leading the production of films, television, animation, and video games under the DC label, reporting directly to Zaslav, while also working alongside but independently of the heads of WBD's other divisions. Gunn oversees the creative development of DC projects, while Safran supervises the production side. Their roles officially began on November 1, 2022.[1][25][2][26]
In November, Gunn said that the studio would focus on multiple DCU live-action and animated projects, but also stated that they would acknowledge fan responses and complaints,[27]and confirmed all subsequent DC projects would be released under the DC Studios banner, including those that were filmed before the formation of the studio.[28]In December, Gunn announced that he was writing a new Superman film that would feature a younger actor in the role.Henry Cavillwas not set to return asSuperman, whileBen Affleck, who portrayedBruce Wayne / Batmanin the DCEU, was reported to be in talks to direct a new DC Studios project, before Affleck stated that he was not interested in directing a DC film.[29][30]Gunn later revealed that new DC films would have an equal focus on popular and obscure characters, drawing inspiration from the DC animated seriesJustice League Unlimited(2004–2006) andYoung Justice(2010–2022).[31][32]
On January 31, 2023, Gunn and Safran announced the first slate of DCU content, titled "Chapter One: Gods and Monsters". They also assembled awriters' roomthat includedDrew Goddard,Jeremy Slater,Christina Hodson, Christal Henry, andTom King.[31]Projects that are not a part of the shared universe will be branded as "DC Elseworlds".[33]The following month, Gunn confirmed development for animated films within both the DCU and DC Elseworlds.[34]Gunn said in March that they were working on potentially incorporating characters from DC'sVertigo Comicsimprint beyond theSwamp Thingfilm,[35]and said the following month that there were plans to incorporate characters from the DC-ownedMilestone Media, such asStatic.[36]In September, WBD announced that it would expand its production facility atWarner Bros. Studios Leavesden, England, which would serve as the primary production hub for DC Studios. Gunn and Safran were consulting on the expansion, with work starting in the second quarter of 2024 and was expected to be finished in 2027.[37]
In February 2024, Gunn and Safran worked with WBD corporate siblings to acquire theChristopher ReevedocumentarySuper/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story(2024).[38][39]This is the first film to be released under the DC Studios banner,[40]whileThe Penguin(2024) is the first DC Studios production and the first series to be released under that banner.[41]AtSan Diego Comic-Conin July 2024, Gunn unveiled the official logo for DC Studios as an updated version of the 1977 "DC Bullet" logo designed byMilton Glaser, alongside an animated introduction sequence featuring Superman,[42][43][44]in a recreation of the back cover ofSuperman#1(1939) designed byWarner Bros. Animation.[45]The updated logo was also being used for DC Comics and its affiliated units,[42][43][44]but was not used for some earlier projects that DC Studios had inherited, namelyThe Penguinand the animated seriesHarley Quinn(2019–present), because they were not as involved in those. A slightly different DC Studios logo animation is used for the end credits onThe Penguin, while a separate logo and opening animation are set to be used for future projects released under the "DC Elseworlds" banner.[45]
That October, DC Studios andWarner Bros. Pictures Animationgreenlit the theatrical animated filmDynamic Duo(2028), which is DC Studios's first animated film and the first new project to move forward at the studio following its DCU announcements.[46][47][48]The filmJoker: Folie à Deux(2024) is part of the "DC Elseworlds" label and was overseen by Warner Bros. Pictures co-chiefs De Luca and Abdy, without the involvement of Gunn, Safran, or DC Studios, although the DC logo used before that studio's formation is included in the credits.

James Wan was born on 26 February 1977 inKuching,Sarawak,MalaysiatoChinese-Malaysianparents. Wan and his family moved toPerth, Western Australia when he was seven.[9]He attendedLake Tuggeranong CollegeinCanberra[10][11]before returning to Perth as an adult. Wan relocated from Perth toMelbourne, where he attended theRoyal Melbourne Institute of Technology(RMIT). He graduated from RMIT with a Bachelor of Arts in media in 1999.[12]
Prior to 2003, Wan and his friend, fellow filmmakerLeigh Whannell, had begun writing a script for a horror film, citing their dreams and fears as inspiration for its plot. Upon completing the script, Wan and Whannell had wanted to select an excerpt from their script, later to be known asSawand film it to pitch their film to studios. With the help ofCharlie Clouser, who had composed the score for the film, and a few stand-in actors, Wan and Whannell shot the film with a relatively low budget. Whannell also decided to star in the film asAdam Stanheight, one of the film's main protagonists.[13]
After the release of the full-lengthSaw, the film was met with overwhelming success in the box office both domestically and internationally. The film ended up grossing $55 million in America, and $48 million in other countries, totaling over US$103 million worldwide. This was over $100 million more than the production budget.[14]This led the studio togreen-lightthe sequelSaw IIand later the rest of theSawfranchise. Since its inception, theSawfilms have become the highest grossing horror franchise of all time worldwide in unadjusted dollars. In the United States alone,Sawis the second highest grossing horror franchise, behind only theFriday the 13thfilmsby a margin of $10 million.[15][16]Wan directedSaw(2004) and co-wroteSaw III(2006). Meanwhile, he and Whannell have predominantly served as executive producers to the sequelsSaw II,Saw III,Saw IV,[17]Saw V,Saw VI,Saw 3D,Jigsaw,SpiralandSaw X.
In 2007, Wan directed two featured films. The first was the horror filmDead Silence, which was the result of advice from Wan and Whannell's agent at the time; Wan and Whannell have since stated that the film was a negative experience for them.[5]Dead Silencefeatured Australian actorRyan Kwantenand is based on the premise of a legend, whereby the ghost of a ventriloquist, Mary Shaw, removes the tongue of any person who screams in its presence. Rather than a gore movie, Wan described the film as "a creepy doll movie. It's in the spirit of those oldTwilight Zoneepisodes or Hammer Horror Films. Very old-school."[18][19][20]The film grossed over $22 million[21]against a production budget of $20 million.[22]It received negative reviews from critics.[23][24]
Wan's second directorial film of 2007 was thevigilanteaction drama filmDeath Sentence, a film adapted from the 1975novel of the same namebyBrian Garfieldthat was written as the sequel toDeath Wish.[25][26]The film's protagonist (Kevin Bacon) was a father seeking revenge for his murdered son, who was killed by a local gang. Whannell played a minor character as one of the gang members.[27][28]Wan described the film as "a raw and gritty, 70s styled revenge thriller ... It's my arthouse movie with guns."[18]The film grossed $17 million[29]against a production budget of $10 million.[30]Similar to Wan's previous film, it received negative reviews.[31][32]Author Garfield later stated, "I think that, except for its ludicrous violence toward the end, theDeath Sentencemovie does depict its character's decline and the stupidity of vengeful vigilantism," adding, "As a story it made the point I wanted it to make."[33]Dead Silence and Death Sentence are Wan's first films to be distributed by U.S. major film studios with Dead Silence being distributed byUniversal Picturesand Death Sentence being distributed by20th Century Fox.
Having worked on his previous three films continuously, Wan told the male lifestyle websiteCraveOnlinethat he was ready for "a bit of time off just to chill... but at the same time I'm using this opportunity to write again."[34]In 2008, Wan directed a trailer for thesurvival horrorvideo gameDead Space.[35]During this time, Wan andTobe Hooperwere in talks to revive theTexas Chainsaw Massacreserieswith a trilogy of films, with both planning to direct although the studio instead made 2013'sTexas Chainsaw 3D.[36]
Wan returned to the horror genre with the filmInsidious, which premiered at the 2010Toronto International Film Festivalas part of the "Midnight Madness" program and was sold to Sony Pictures Worldwide for a seven-figure sum within four hours of the premiere's conclusion. The film began its American theatrical release in the first weekend of April 2011 and achieved third place at the box office, with an estimated US$13.5 million in ticket sales.[37]StarringPatrick Wilson,Rose ByrneandBarbara Hershey, the film was made independently, as Wan sought complete creative control and also wanted to make a film that was markedly different from the gore that he had become synonymous with due toSaw. Wan stated in an interview, "the fact thatInsidiouswas not being run by a committee really afforded me the luxury to make a film with lots of creepy, bizarre moments that a studio might not 'get.'"[38]Wan later revealed that he wanted to "experiment in other genres, or make films in other genres because I love, Leigh and I have, we're not just horror fans. We're film fans. I love action films. I want to do action films. I want to do romantic comedies. I love all this stuff. So, if I find the good material, I'll do it.[37]
Wan's next film,The Conjuring(2013), centered on the real life exploits of husband and wifeEd and Lorraine Warren, a married couple that investigated paranormal events.[39]The film focused on the couple's most famous case second tothe Amityville haunting, in which they investigated a witch's curse on a Rhode Island family farm. In his second collaboration with the pair, Patrick Wilson starred in the film, with him andVera Farmigaplaying the husband and wife respectively.[40]Filming commenced inNorth Carolina, United States,[40]in late February 2012 andNew Line Cinema, together withWarner Bros. Pictures, had initially slated the film for a release on 25 January 2013.[41][42]A test screening of the film occurred in October 2012 at the New York Comic Con event, where it screened in the IGN Theater, and the audience feedback was overwhelmingly positive. At that stage, Wan had several more weeks before the film was completed. The film was released in July 2013[43]and was a critical[44][45]and commercial success, grossing $319.5 million.[46]
After work onThe Conjuringwas complete, Wan directed a sequel to 2010'sInsidious. The film was once again written by Wan's longtime collaborator and close friend, Whannell, and the cast of the original film returned. Filming for the sequel commenced in January 2013 and the film was released on 13 September 2013. The budget for the film had been described as "shoestring" by one media outlet. Oren Peli, the creator of theParanormal Activityfranchise, returned as an executive producer.[47]Film District distributedInsidious: Chapter 2.[48]It received mixed reviews[49][50]but grossed over $161 million worldwide against a budget of $5 million.[51]Wan later admitted that he wasn't as involved in the sequel, adding "it would be good to shepherd it and keep it more in track to the version I had when I made the first film so that it doesn't detour too far" since he never intended to make a sequel initially.[43]

He lived inSpångauntil the age of 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland,Ångermanland.[1][2][3]Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth,[4][5]but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957.[6][7][8]He has two sisters, Katarina and Annika and an elder brother Johan.[3]Lundgren claims his father was physically abusive and took out his own personal frustrations on his wife and son. He has stated that, during his tirades, his father would call him a "loser", which motivated him later as he grew more ambitious to prove himself. But he also said, "I still love my father, no matter what happened. There are many things about him I still admire. As a child, I was probably too much like him, very stubborn—perhaps that's what he couldn't deal with."[3]He has cited his troubled relationship with his father as the reason he developed a desire to participate in heavy contact sports such as boxing and karate.[3]
Lundgren has said that, as a child, he was insecure and suffered from allergies, describing himself as a "runt".[3][9]He showed a keen interest in drumming and had aspirations to become a rock star.[3]At age seven, he triedjudoandGōjū-ryū. He took upKyokushinkarateat the age of 10, and beganlifting weightsas a teenager.[9]Lundgren stated that "My dad always told me that if I wanted to make something special with my life, I had to go to America."[3]After graduating from high school with straight A's, he spent time in the United States in the 1970s on various academic scholarships, studying chemical engineering atWashington State University1976–1977,[10]andClemson University[11]prior to serving his mandatory one year in theSwedish Coastal Artilleryat theCoastal Ranger School. In the late 1970s, he enrolled at theRoyal Institute of Technologyin Stockholm and graduated in the early 1980s with a degree inchemical engineering.[3][12]
Amidst his years of studying, Lundgren honed hiskarateskills by training in a dojo for five years, and attained ablack beltinKyokushinby the late 1970s. He captained the Swedish Kyokushin karate team, and was a challenger at the 1979 World Open Tournament (arranged by the Kyokushin Karate Organization).[13]He won the European championships in 1980 and 1981, and a full-contact karate tournament in Australia in 1982.[14]In 1982, Lundgren graduated with amaster's degreein chemical engineering from theUniversity of Sydney.[15]During his time inSydney, he earned a living as abouncerin a nightclub in the notoriousKing's Crossarea.[16]
Lundgren was awarded aFulbright ScholarshiptoMITin 1983.[17]However, while preparing for the move toBoston, he was spotted in the nightclub where he worked in Sydney and was hired byGrace Jonesas a bodyguard, and the two became lovers.[18]He moved with Jones to New York City, where he dabbled in modeling at theZoli Agencybut was described as "a bit too tall and muscular for a model's size 40".[3]He earned a living as a bouncer at the Manhattan nightclubThe Limelight, which was housed in the formerEpiscopalChurch of the Holy Communion, working withChazz Palminteri.[3]In the daytime, he studied drama at the Warren Robertson Theatre Workshop and has said that "my time in New York City opened up my adolescent Swedish eyes to a multitude of different people and lifestyles, mostly in the arts. I hung out withAndy Warhol,Keith Haring,Iman, andSteve Rubell, danced atStudio 54, and studied acting withAndie MacDowellandTom Hulce."[3]Friends told him he should be in movies.[3]He quit studying at MIT after two weeks to pursue acting.[17][19]Lundgren said after being exposed to the entertainment business, he found it more attractive and rewarding than chemical engineering, so he decided to pursue a career in acting.[18]
Lundgren made his film debut in the 1985James BondfilmA View to a Kill,Roger Moore's final film as 007, in the minor role of Venz, aKGBassassin.[20][21]His former loverGrace Jones, who portrayed the villainMay Day, personally recommended him.[22]According to Lundgren, Moore said of him, "Dolph is larger than Denmark."[23]
Upon learning thatSylvester Stallonewas seeking an imposing fighter to play Soviet boxerIvan DragoinRocky IV(1985), Lundgren sent videos and pictures of himself to a distant contact of Stallone, eventually reaching him. Lundgren tried out for the role, but as he himself has stated, he was initially turned down because he was too tall.[24]Lundgren eventually beat 5,000 other hopefuls to land his breakout role opposite Stallone,Carl Weathers, andBrigitte Nielsen. To improve his physique and athletic abilities, he trained intensely inbodybuildingandboxingfor five months before the film was shot. Lundgren said: "We trained six days a week—weights in the morning for about an hour, then boxing in the afternoon. We did a split of chest and back one day and then shoulders, legs, and arms the next. We boxed for an hour and a half, practiced the fight choreography, and did bag work and abs."[25]He weighed 240 pounds during filming,[25]but in the film he was billed at 260 pounds, one shipping above of Drago, "He's a exceptional 250 pounds of merciless fighting machine, Drago is listed come to behold 270 pounds, the best that Soviet science & medicine can create".[26]His character's lines "If he dies, he dies" and "I must break you" are amongst the best known of theRockyseries, and have often been cited in popular culture.[27][28]Lundgren hit Stallone so hard during the filming of a fight scene that Stallone was in intensive care in the St. John's Hospital for nine days with a blood pressure of 290, due to swelling of thepericardial sacaround his heart.[29]Lundgren later fought in a real boxing match against formerUFCfighterOleg Taktarov, and lost via decision.[30]Lundgren has highlighted the premiere ofRocky IVat theMann Village Theatre,[31][32][33]inWestwood, Los Angeles, as the moment which changed his life, remarking: "I walked in to a Westwood movie theater as Grace Jones' boyfriend and walked out ninety minutes later as the movie star Dolph Lundgren. I was shell-shocked for years from the mind-boggling and daunting experience of being a student-athlete from tiny Sweden suddenly having to live up a new action-star persona."[3]
In 1987, Lundgren released on home media a workout video calledMaximum Potential,[34]and he also got his first lead role asHe-ManinMasters of the Universe, based on thepopular children's toyline and cartoon, directed byGary Goddard.[35]Lundgren weighed his all-time heaviest during the filming at 280 pounds.[25]The film was a critical failure and viewed as far too violent for a family picture.[36][37]It is referred to as a "flop" byVarietymagazine,[38]and has a 13% "rotten" rating atRotten Tomatoes.[39]Lundgren was criticized for being too wooden as a leading man, and it was dismissed as "a glossy fantasy starring monosyllabic Dolph Lundgren".[40]
In 1988, he starred inJoseph Zito'sRed Scorpion. Lundgren plays a SovietKGBagent who is sent to an African country to assassinate the leader of ananti-communistrebel movement, but eventually switches sides.[41]The film was poorly received and has an 17% "rotten" rating at Rotten Tomatoes.[42]Stephen HoldenofThe New York Timessaid: "Dolph Lundgren's pectorals are the real stars ofRed Scorpion,an action-adventure movie set in the fictional African country of Mombaka. Filmed from below so that one has the sense of peering up at a massive kinetic sculpture, his glistening torso, which over the course of the film is subjected to assorted tortures, is the movie's primary visual focus whenever the action slows down. And since Mr. Lundgren remains stone-faced, rarely speaking except to issue commands in a surprisingly hesitant monotone, his heaving chest actually communicates more emotion than his mumbling lips."[43]
In 1989, Lundgren then starred asMarvel ComicsadaptationThe Punisherplaying the title role. Directed byMark Goldblatt, the film changes some details of the character's origin, and eliminates the signature skull logo. These elements troubled fans of the comic book upon its release and were dismissive. Also initial reviews found it to be a trashy comic book film. The film had a troubled release as the studios who made it were changed ownership. While the film was theatrically released internationally, the film went direct-to-video in the US. However over the years the film developed a cult with some who think it's the best adaptation of the comic. The film was re-evaluated with a much more positive outlook who find Lundgren's performance solid as a ghostly and soul depraved vigilante.[44]
In 1990, Lundgren starred inCraig R. Baxley's sci-fi thrillerI Come in Peace(also known asDark Angel) oppositeBrian Benben,Betsy Brantley, Matthias Hues, andJay Bilas. Lundgren plays a toughHoustoncop with an inner sensitivity,[45]who does not let the rules of police procedure prevent him pursuing his mission to wipe out a gang of drug dealers who killed his partner. Lundgren said of his role: "What attracted me to Dark Angel is that I get to do more than just action. There's some romance, some comedy, some drama. I actually have some clever dialogue in this one. I get to act."[46]
In 1991, Lundgren starred inManny Coto's action filmCover UpoppositeLouis Gossett Jr.Lundgren portrays a US Marine veteran turned reporter, who finds his own life in jeopardy after stumbling across a political cover-up.[47]InMark L. Lester's martial arts action filmShowdown in Little Tokyo, he andBrandon Leeplay police officers investigating theyakuza.[48][49]The film received a mainly negative reception from critics and was criticized for its violence;Vincent CanbyofThe New York Timesdescribed it as "violent, but spiritless."[50]Varietywrote: "Lundgren can hold his own with other action leads as an actor and could easily be Van Damme-marketable if only he'd devote as much attention to quality control as he does to pectoral development."[51]David J. Fox of theLos Angeles Times, however, described the film as a "class act", and some retrospective critics find it to be entertaining for its genre.[52][53][54][55]
In 1992, Lundgren starred in the sci-fi action pictureUniversal Soldierdirected byRoland Emmerich. Lundgren (as Sergeant Andrew Scott) andJean-Claude Van Damme(asLuc Deveraux) play U.S. soldiers who died during theVietnam War,[56]only to be laterreanimatedin a secret Army project to be sent on missions as GR operatives. At the1992 Cannes Film Festival, Van Damme and Lundgren were involved in a verbal altercation that almost turned physical, but it was believed to have only been a publicity stunt.[57][58]Universal Soldieropened in theatres on 10 July 1992, a moderate success domestically with $36,299,898 in US ticket sales, but a major blockbuster worldwide, making over $65 million overseas, which earned the film a total of $102 million worldwide, on a $23 million budget.[59]Despite being a box office hit, it was not well-received; mainstream critics dismissed the movie as aTerminator 2rip-off.[57][60][61][62]Film criticRoger Ebertsaid: "it must be fairly thankless to play lunks who have to fight for the entire length of a movie while exchanging monosyllabic idiocies", and includedUniversal Soldierin his bookI Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie.[57][58]
In 1993, Lundgren starred oppositeKristian AlfonsoandGeorge SegalinVic Armstrong'sJoshua Tree.[63]Lundgren plays Wellman Anthony Santee, a former racecar driver who is framed by police officer Frank Severance (Segal) for the murder of a highway patrolman.

In 1994, Lundgren starred inBruce Malmuth'sPentathlonas an East GermanOlympicgold medalistpentathleteon the run from an abusive coach.[65]Lundgren trained with the U.S. pentathlon team in preparation for the role,[66]which later led to him being selected to serve as the (non-competing) Team Leader of the 1996 U.S. OlympicModern Pentathlonteam during theAtlanta Games, to promote the image of the sport and to coordinate planning and other details between the team and theUnited States Olympic Committee.[67]The film was seen negatively by most critics;Film Reviewsaid it was "appallingly acted and monotonous"[68]and Video Movie Guide 2002 described it as a "sillyCold Warthriller".[69]
Later in 1994, Lundgren appeared inPerry Lang'sMen of War(scripted byJohn Sayles) alongsideCharlotte LewisandBD Wong, as Nick Gunar, a former Special Ops soldier who leads a group of mercenaries to a treasure island in theSouth China Sea. The film was well received by some critics. One author said "Men of Warinvokes the most vividly remembered fighting in a foreign land of recent Western history. This innovation, associating the muscle image with the Vietnam experience, is carried over into other contemporary muscle films."[70]Another said, "fine performances by an all-star Dolph Lundgren as a mercenary assigned to 'convince' a cast in this offbeat and disturbing film."[71]
In 1995, Lundgren appeared inRobert Longo'sJohnny Mnemonic, co-starringKeanu Reeves. The film portrays screenwriterWilliam Gibson'sdystopiancyberpunkview of the future with the world dominated bymegacorporationsand with strongEast Asianinfluences.[72]Reeves plays the title character, a man with acyberneticbrain implant designed to store information. Lundgren plays Karl Honig, aJesus-obsessed hitman and street preacher who wears a robe and carries a shepherd's staff.[72][73]Critical response was negative overall; Roger Ebert said, "Johnny Mnemonic is one of the great gestures of recent cinema, a movie which doesn't deserve one nanosecond of serious analysis."[74]The film was a financial disappointment, grossing $19,075,720 in the domestic American market against its $26m budget. The cloak worn by Lundgren in the film is now located in the lobby of the Famous Players Coliseum inMississauga, Ontario, it was his last theatrical release film until 2010.[75]Later in 1995, Lundgren appeared inTed Kotcheff'sThe Shooter, an action drama in which he plays Michael Dane, a U.S. Marshall who gets caught up in politics when he is hired to solve the assassination of a Cuban ambassador.
In 1996, Lundgren starred inRussell Mulcahy'sSilent Trigger, playing a formerSpecial Forcesagent who joins a secretive government agency as an assassin.[76][77]The Motion Picture Guide to the films of 1997 said, "this stylish but empty thriller gives square-jawed Dolph Lundgren another shot at straight-to-video immortality".[76]

The film co-starredMichael Sarrazin,Montel Williams,Roy ScheiderandChristopher Heyerdahl, and was shot on location in Montreal.[78]The film was praised for its exciting action sequences.[79]Doug Pratt described the first half of the film as "excellent" and described Lundgren's character as "tenacious",[80]although Robert Cettl wrote "the Peacekeeper trades on the presence of B-movie action star Dolph Lundgren, an actor who never became as popular as his action contemporaries Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal."[81]
In 1998, he appeared in Jean-Marc Piché's action/supernatural horror filmThe MinionalongsideFrançoise RobertsonLundgren portrays Lukas Sadorov, a middle eastern templar and member of an order who are charged with guarding the gateway to Hell that, if opened, will unleash all evil.[77]The DVD and Video Guide of 2005 described the film as being "possibly one of the worst films ever".[71]Later in 1998, Lundgren appeared alongsideBruce PayneandClaire StansfieldinSweepersas Christian Erickson, a leading demolition expert and head of an elite team of specialists, trained to disarm mine fields in a humanitarianminesweepingoperation inAngola.[82]The Video Guide to 2002 said, "that noise you hear isn't the numerous on-screen explosions but action star Lundgren's career hitting rock bottom."[83]He also featured in theTV pilotBlackjack(directed byJohn Woo) as a former US Marshal who becomes the bodyguard and detective of a young supermodel (Kam Heskin), who becomes the target of a psychotic assassin (Phillip MacKenzie).[84][85]One review described  the narrative as "laughably stupid", while the DVD and Video Guide to 2005 said, "dull, lightweight, made-for-TV action fully to a satisfying climax".[71][86]
In 1999, Lundgren played a mercenary inIsaac Florentine'sBridge of Dragons,[87]a military pilot inAnthony Hickox'sStorm Catcher,[77][88]and a cop who's a former boxer inJill Rips, also directed by Hickox, based on a 1987novel by ScottishwriterFrederic Lindsay.[89]

This subpar effort sinks to the bottom of the ocean in a tidal wave of cliche."[92]During an interview onThe Tonight ShowwithJay Lenoin May 2008,GladiatordirectorRidley Scottsaid Lundgren had been considered for the part of undefeated fighter Tigris of Gaul in 2000, but was eventually rejected because "as an actor, he just didn't fit in with what we were trying to achieve".[93]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
