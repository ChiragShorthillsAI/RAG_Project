The Iron Clawis a 2023biographicalsportsdrama filmwritten and directed bySean Durkinabout theVon Erichs, a family ofprofessional wrestlerswho are "cursed" by tragedy. The film depicts the struggles of wrestling company ownerFritz Von Erich's sons to achieve the success for which their father groomed them, from 1979 to the early 1990s.
The film starsZac EfronasKevin Von ErichalongsideJeremy Allen White,Harris Dickinson,Maura Tierney, Stanley Simons,Holt McCallany, andLily Jamesas other members of the family. The titled named after the "Iron Claw," an in-ring signature move of the Von Erichs.
The Iron Clawpremiered at theTexas TheatreinDallason November 8, 2023. It was released in the United States byA24on December 22, 2023, and byLionsgatein the United Kingdom on February 9, 2024. It grossed over $45 million, on a $15.9 million budget, and received positive reviews, with Efron's performance receiving acclaim from critics, who deemed it the best of his career. It was named one of thetop 10 films of 2023by theNational Board of Review.[5]
In 1979, theWorld Class Championship Wrestling(WCCW) company is owned by retired professional wrestlerFritz Von Erich, who once dreamed of winning theNWAWorld Heavyweight Championship. Fritz has five sons with his wife Doris, from oldest to youngest: Jack Jr., who died as a child,KevinandDavid, who both wrestled in WCCW,Kerry, an aspiringdiscus thrower, andMike, an aspiring musician. Kevin, the currentTexas Heavyweight Champion, starts a relationship with a woman named Pam and tells her about the "Von Erich curse" that killed Jack Jr. as a child, supposedly brought on by Fritz changing his last name from Adkisson to his mother's, whose family had suffered constant tragedy.
Kevin wins a non-title match againstNWA World Heavyweight ChampionHarley Racebydisqualification, putting himself in the lead to challenge for the title. However, Fritz is disappointed that Kevin took a long time to get up after taking avertical suplexdirectly on concrete but is delighted by David displaying a natural talent for showmanship while cutting apromo. The1980 Summer Olympics boycottdashes Kerry's hopes of competition, and he moves back home, where Fritz asks him to also become a wrestler.
By 1983, Kevin, Kerry and David defeat theFabulous Freebirdsto win theSix-Man Tag Team Championship, and Fritz volunteers David over Kevin to fight current NWA World Heavyweight ChampionRic Flair. Kevin and Pam get married, and he reveals at the wedding to an ill David that he will soon be a father. A week before his match against Flair, David dies ofenteritiswhile touring in Japan. Both Kevin and Kerry volunteer to fight Flair in his place, but Fritz lets acoin flipdecide, resulting in Kerry being the one to face Flair—beating him and winning the World Heavyweight Championship. Although Fritz is overjoyed, a drunk Kerry goes out for a motorcycle ride and loses his right foot in an accident.
Fearing the curse, Kevin has his newborn son,Ross, legally surnamed Adkisson. Kevin begins training Mike, who badly injures his shoulder during a match and goes into atoxic shock-inducedcomaduring surgery. Mike narrowly emerges from his coma with noticeable brain damage and is no longer able to play the guitar, leading himself to commit suicide. A grief-stricken Kevin starts to distance himself from Pam and Ross, fearing the "curse" will affect them too. Nonetheless, he fights Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but is disqualified when he ignores the referee and grapples Flair with the signature Von Erich "Iron Claw" move for too long.
Kerry returns to wrestling with a newprostheticfoot and works for theWorld Wrestling Federation(WWF, later WWE), now dwarfing WCCW in popularity, where he wins theWWF Intercontinental ChampionshipatSummerSlam. Fritz gives the task of running the WCCW to Kevin, who focuses on life with Pam, Ross, and newest sonMarshall. Kerry gives Fritz a new gun for Christmas but becomes upset when Fritz puts it away instead of firing it. Kerry later calls Kevin to tell him that the curse's constant presence and his declining career have made him consider suicide. He hangs up before Kevin can learn his location.
After calling Fritz for help but receiving none, Kevin arrives at Fritz's house the next morning just in time to hear Kerry commit suicide with the gun and nearly strangles Fritz to death in a fit of rage. Sitting with Kerry's body, Kevin has a vision of his brothers in the afterlife: Kerry, now with his right foot back, leaves behind the coin that decided he would face Flair and reunites with Mike, now free to pursue his musical dreams, David wearing the world title belt he had been chasing in life, and Jack Jr., whom he meets for the first time since being a toddler.
Sometime later, Kevin sells WCCW toJerry Jarrettdespite Fritz's protests, and Pam becomes pregnant again. Kevin cries while watching his sons play football, telling them he misses having brothers. Kevin's sons promise to be brothers to him, and he gets up and plays with them.
A textual epilogue reveals that the Von Erichs were inducted into theWWE Hall of Fame in 2009and that Kevin and Pam are still married and have bought a ranch in Hawaii, where their large family lives to this day, including their four children and thirteen grandchildren.
Sean Durkin had a long-term aspiration to create a film based on the Von Erich family. He was a fan of professional wrestling during his youth and he was personally saddened by the string of Von Erich family deaths. In 2015 he began research for the film's initial screenplay.[6][7]Chris Von Erich, the youngest member of the family, was not included in the screenplay because, according to Durkin, "it was one more tragedy that the film couldn't really withstand".[8]Chris died by suicide in 1991, a year and a half prior to Kerry Von Erich, and he was the fourth family death (after Jack Jr., David, and Mike).
In June 2022, the film was announced to star Efron and to be produced and distributed by A24. Later, it was also developed by House Productions, with the support of Access Entertainment and BBC Film.[9]In September, White and Dickinson were announced as joining the project to portray the Von Erich brothers, alongside Efron. One month later, McCallany and James were cast,[10]and Juliette Howell, Angus Lamont, Maura Tierney, Tessa Ross, Derrin Schlesinger, and Harrison Huffman were confirmed as producers.[11][12][13]In November, Friedman was cast and was later credited as an executive producer.[14]
Principal photographybegan in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in October 2022,[15][16][17]and it lasted six weeks.[18]Instead of filming the wrestling scenes in multiple edited sequences, however, the cast performed full-length, one-take wrestling matches, in front of a live audience, which was held in a furniture store that was converted to appear as theDallas Sportatorium.[6]Chavo Guerrero, who portraysThe Sheik, also acted as the film's primary wrestling consultant.[19]Guerrero also spoke to the cast aboutpremature deaths in professional wrestling, including that of his uncle,Eddie Guerrero.[7]
The film received special dispensation fromSAG-AFTRA, to continue production and promotion during the2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, subject to the acceptance of certain conditions and stemming from A24's positive relationship with the union.[20]
Richard Reed ParryofArcade Firecomposed the film's score.[21]Parry andLaurel Sprengelmeyeralso wrote an original song for the film, "Live That Way Forever".[22]
Additionally, the film features songs such as "Don't Do Me Like That" byTom Petty And The Heartbreakers, 
"(Don't Fear) The Reaper" byBlue Öyster Cult,[23]"Thank God I'm a Country Boy" byJohn Denver,[24]and "Tom Sawyer" byRush.[25][26]"Tom Sawyer", which served as Kerry Von Erich'sentrance musicfrom 1981 to 1983, was also featured in the marketing for the film.[26]
The Iron Clawpremiered at theTexas TheatreinDallason November 8, 2023, hours after the end of the2023 SAG-AFTRA strike;[27]and it was attended by Kevin Von Erich, who had recently returned to Texas after moving to Hawaii more than 20 years earlier,[28]alongsideBill Mercer,Marshall, Ross Von Erich, andTrish Stratus.[29]The film was released, in the United States, on December 22 byA24, and  premiered in the United Kingdom byLionsgateon February 9, 2024.[30][31]
The film was released for digital platforms on February 13, 2024, and forBlu-rayandDVDon March 26, 2024.[32]
In the United States and Canada,The Iron Clawwas released alongsideMigration,Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, andAnyone but You, and was projected to gross around $6 million from 2,774 theaters in its four-day opening weekend.[33]The film made $2.5 million on its first day, including $640,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $4.9 million, finishing sixth at the box office.[34]In its second weekend the film made $4.6 million, finishing seventh at the box office.[35]The following weekend it made $4.5 million, a drop of just 3% and finishing eighth.[36]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 89% of 271 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's consensus reads: "Powerfully acted and profoundly sad,The Iron Clawhonors its fact-based story with a dramatization whose compassionate exploration of family ties is just as hard-hitting as its action in the wrestling ring."[37]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[38]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale, the best ever for an A24 title, whilePostTrakreported 91% of filmgoers gave it positive score, with 72% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[34]
The New Yorker'sRichard BrodywroteThe Iron Claw"is as exuberant as it is mournful, and the high spirits of performance and achievement are inseparable from the price that they exact".[39]Adam Nayman ofThe Ringercalled it "a sports movie with genuine existential heft",[40]andThe Atlantic's David Sims commented "it is the kind of big, weepy, macho film that just doesn’t get made much anymore, a soaringpower balladthat should prompt a lot of loud sniffling in the theater."[41]David Fear ofRolling Stonenoted the film establishes from the outset that "the physical violence in the ring will be nothing compared to the psychological carnage happening outside of it".[42]
The cast received widespread praise.[39][40][43][44][45]David Fear ofRolling Stonewrote of Efron's performance: "The lost, needy look in his eyes, especially when he's around his father, makes him seem like a frightened lad playing adult dress-up…Efron gets at what drove Kevin: discipline, love, and fear. He anchors the movie".[42][43]Of White, Fear added, "The Bearhas already sold many folks on the fact White is not only a hell of an actor, but can do a lot with silences, pauses, those peepers, and a kind of simmering soulfulness. This movie should convince whatever few naysayers are left that he’s the real deal."[42][46]
David Sims commented, "To wrestling nerds, the Von Erichs have a titanic legacy, and Durkin does his best to represent that by exploring the sport's crunchy, amateurish pre-corporate age, when regional live events were the big moneymakers and television was largely ignored."[41]Writing forRogerEbert.com,Christy Lemiresaid "the sequence in which the Von Erichs discover the song that would become their anthem—the iconic 'Tom Sawyer'—is a montage that moves with a verve that’s reminiscent ofScorsese's muscularity".[25]
David Fear noted "there are times when the movie comes close to being an outright feel-bad sports movie".[42]Several critics discussed the film's tendency to focus on the tragic, and expressed that character detail and depth are unfortunately sacrificed in favor of covering more narrative ground.[25][45][46][47]Allison Willmore ofVulturewrote, "In streamlining their story to emphasize the tragedies that accrue as time goes on, the film risks reducing its characters into martyrs who suffer and die on behalf oftoxic masculinity."[48]The New York Times'Manohla Dargisopined: "The iron claw of corrosive patriarchy, as it were, and of emotional repression and misplaced ambition proves more than [Durkin] wants to grapple with."[44]Richard LawsonofVanity Fairsaid, "When the bad stuff does start happening—and then happens, again and again—it’s hard to grasp the central why of it all. Why is this family so doomed, so pained, so self-destructive and unhappy?"[45]
Writing forTexas Monthly, Sean O'Neal said, "The film sparks most in those early scenes set against the nostalgic neon glow of the eighties Dallas skyline, when the Von Erichs—and the city that surrounded them—seemed invincible and electric. Selfishly, I found myself wishing it could have lingered there a bit longer, before that golden myth gave way to gray and murky reality."[46]Adam Nayman concluded, "It may be that by finally torquing a story about unimaginable loss into that of a mind who finds himself,The Iron Clawerrs on the side of uplift. But as acted by Efron, the catharsis feels earned—the euphoric feeling of having broken out of a deathlock, even if only momentarily."[40]
In October 2023,Marshall Von Erich, Kevin's son, praised Guerrero's role as a wrestling consultant, highlighting the accuracy of the film's wrestling sequences and complimenting Efron's performance.[19]Kevin Von Erich also positively highlighted Guerrero's contributions, stating, "He did a great job, pushing [the cast] and getting them ready. It is a lot more difficult than it looks, and they did so well."[49]Von Erich met Efron and endorsed both his portrayal and the overall film, which Efron later stated was "the most important review".[18]Von Erich stated that his niece Hollie, Kerry's daughter, was moved when she saw McCallany, who plays her late grandfather Fritz, on set, but believed the film inaccurately portrays Fritz as coming off "pretty rank".[50][51]
Wrestling journalistDave Meltzer, who lived and worked in Texas during the events of the film, lauded the performances of the film's cast but noted the film's plot contained several historical inaccuracies and depicted many events in an incorrect chronology. Meltzer also opined that the film struggled to correctly depict the Von Erichs' mass popularity at their height.[52]Additionally, Meltzer noted that some members of the professional wrestling community heavily criticized the exclusion of Chris Von Erich from the film, but agreed that the inclusion of Chris would have prolonged the length of the film greatly. Meltzer panned Aaron Dean Eisenberg's imitation of Ric Flair, suggesting that it was the weakest aspect of the film.[52]

In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]

Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
