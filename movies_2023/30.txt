Family Switchis a 2023 Americanfantasy comedyfilm directed byMcG, written byAdam Sztykieland Victoria Strouse, and starringJennifer GarnerandEd Helms. The film is based on the 2010 children's bookBedtime for MommybyAmy Krouse Rosenthal.[1]It was released byNetflixon November 30, 2023, and received mixed reviews from critics.
InLos Angeles, the Walker family: the working couple Jess and Bill, along with their three kids CC, Wyatt and Miles, are a divided family: the parents and the children routinely find themselves at odds, primarily due to their respective outlooks towards life. With Christmas approaching, the convivial parents vainly attempt to draw the emotionally-distant children to spend more time together than individually. During an excursion to theGriffith Observatoryto witness a rare planetary alignment, the fissures between the family erupt - with Jess and CC, Bill and Wyatt simultaneously wishing each other to try being them for a more intimate understanding. While asking an astrologer, Angelica, to take a family picture, a blinding flash rocks the observatory; in the melee, the family accidentally damage the telescope.
The next morning, the family awaken to find themselves spiritually split from each other: Jess and CC find themselves in each other's bodies, as do Bill and Wyatt, much to their collective horror. Moving to resolve the quagmire, the family employ their unknowing neighbor Rolf to babysit toddler Miles and family dog Pickles, who were also switched. At the observatory, the family manage to bribe the staff to accelerate the telescope's repairs with the aim of reverting into their original bodies by the end of the planetary alignment.
Attempts by the family to pursue their regular lives in each other's bodies culminates in disaster: "Jess" (CC), attempts to deliver a presentation to an important client on her mother's behalf, which is ruined when she hastily devours ice cream, kicking in her mother's lactose intolerance, causing her to fart profusely during the meeting, while "CC" (Jess), intentionally compromises her daughter's crucial soccer match to help an injured opponent, which is witnessed by a national recruiter in attendance; "Wyatt" (Bill) bungles his son's interview for aYalescholarship with his nonchalant attitude, and "Bill" (Wyatt), despite his strange demeanor that day, is invited to a party hosted by his son's crush, Ariana.
Exasperated, the family proceed to discover that the telescope is missing a specially-made lens that is crucial to its functioning. Realizing that next alignment would not be until 2162, "Bill" calls in a favor to procure the lens early. Privately, "Bill" divulges the party invitation to "Wyatt", who reluctantly attends with "CC"; he ends up fumbling a would-be intimate moment with Ariana, but he also stands up to his son's bully. Meanwhile, "Jess" and "Bill", who are pressured into kissing by their unknowing neighbors, sneak into the party, where the four manage to enjoy a moment of togetherness, which is sunk when "Bill" learns of "Wyatt"'s rejection of Ariana.
The next day, however, the family learn the hardships each other has to face; "Jess" discovers her mother's sacrifices at work for her daughter's soccer talent, while "CC" discovers her daughter's academic sincerity outside of soccer; "Bill" discovers that his father had sacrificed a potential music career to be a parent. Accepting that their individual life pursuits may have been lost owing to the switching, the family resolve to stay together irrespectively. They team up to sing at Bill's music concert, which is attended by Jess's clients. The show is a success, and "Jess" is awarded a promotion. "Bill" finally receives the crucial telescopic lens, and the family race to the observatory with assistance from Angelica. They make it in time, but "Bill" accidentally slips over, destroying the lens in the process. However, they discover "Miles" had pocketed the original lens before the switch; they use it, but nothing occurs.
The next morning, the family discovers they have reverted to their original bodies. Wyatt patches up his relationship with Ariana, sharing a first kiss with her, and CC is given a second chance for national soccer tryouts by the recruiter, who admired her sportsmanship at the game. Angelica watches the reunited family, wishing them a Merry Christmas before driving away.

Family Switchwas released onNetflixon November 30, 2023.[8]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 45% of 31 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "A great cast and some moderately heartwarming moments aren't enough to make up forFamily Switch's unimaginative take on the overused body-swap gimmick. "[9]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 37 out of 100, based on eight critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[10]
Owen GleibermanofVarietywrote, "Family Switchhas bits and pieces of amusement, but mostly you want to swap it for a better movie".[11]Angie Han ofThe Hollywood Reportersaid: "The body-swap comedy isn't good so much as it is completely and totally innocuous. Its characters are drawn in the broadest of strokes and the plot points unfold along creakily predictable beats, but it's too blandly sweet to be irritating or offensive. If you're just looking to fill a movie-shaped hole in your holiday plans, that might make it passable enough."[12]

Joseph McGinty Nichol(born August 9, 1968), known professionally asMcG, is an American director, producer, and former record producer.
McG began his career in the music industry, directing music videos and producing various albums. He later rose to prominence with his debut theatrically released narrative feature,Charlie's Angels, which had the highest-grossing opening weekend for a directorial debut at the time. Since then, he has directed several other films, includingTerminator Salvation,This Means War, andThe Babysitter. On television, McG co-createdFastlanewithJohn McNamaraand executive producedThe O.C.,Supernatural, andChuck.
McG also owns a production company,Wonderland Sound and Vision, founded in 2001, which has overseen the production of the films and television shows he has worked on sinceCharlie's Angels: Full Throttle.
Joseph McGinty Nichol was born inKalamazoo, Michigan, and grew up inNewport Beach, California. As his uncle and grandfather were also named Joe, his mother nicknamed him "McG" to avoid confusion.[1]
McG attendedCorona del Mar High School, where he metMark McGrath. Initially he wanted to become the lead singer of a band he formed with McGrath. However, he failed as a front man and persuaded McGrath to take over. Instead he worked behind the scenes as producer and marketer for the band until he was 22. He then obtained aBachelor of ArtsinpsychologyfromUC Irvine. McG thought of attending medical school afterwards, but tired of studying, he formed a record label known as G Recordings in 1993, working on his hobby as a still photographer, shooting local bands and musicians, along with earning money driving a delivery truck. He eventually brought to the latter job McGrath, who had been in a state of depressive apathy after graduating, and decided to again try his hand fronting a band.[2][3]The band had several hit singles asSugar Ray, signed with a label, and went on tour.[4]McGrath has said McG has been a "psychologist, therapist and [musical] collaborator" to him, including convincing him to record "Fly", which would become Sugar Ray's breakout hit, given McGrath previously did not feel he had the singing voice to perform the song well.[3]
In 1995, McG producedSugar Ray'sfirst albumand co-wroteseveral songs ontheir second.[5]He borrowed $3,500 from his father to make a music video for the song "Caboose", which helped the band get signed withAtlantic Recordsand started his career as a music video director. His work doing the first threeKornmusic videos led to a stint withCypress Hill, and afterwards McG became highly sought with over fifty music video credits such asSublime's"Santeria",Smash Mouth's "All Star", andThe Offspring's "Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)", along with documentaries on Korn and Sugar Ray.[3]In 1997, he was awarded theBillboard's Pop Video of the Year Award for Smash Mouth's "Walkin' on the Sun" and the Music Video Production Association's Pop Video of the Year Award for Sugar Ray's "Fly".[6]Eventually, this landed him in the television commercial business, directing advertisements forMajor League BaseballandCoca-Cola. A notable one was a commercial forGap, which was honored at the 1999London International Film Festival.[7]
Impressed with McG's music videos,Drew Barrymoreapproached him about directing afilm adaptationofCharlie's Angels. He accepted, wanting to take on bigger projects, and pitched the movie to the studio executives, who were initially reluctant but later approved the project after much persistence. The film, for which he was paid $350,000, was released in 2000 and went on to gross over $250 million worldwide with mixed critical reception from critics and fans alike. However, he won the Hollywood Breakthrough Award at the 6th AnnualHollywood Film Festivalheld in 2002.[6]Sony paid him $2.5 million to direct the military action-dramaDreadnoughtfor Red Wagon Entertainment.[8]He was also set to develop a sequel toCharlie's Angelsand present his film producing debut withAirshow, the latter of which has yet to be made.[9]
In February 2002,Jon PetersandLorenzo di Bonaventuraattached him onto the fifth installment in theSupermanfilm series that was indevelopment hell, thus putting his previous projects on hold. McG and Peters hiredJ. J. Abramsto pen a new script for the film entitledSuperman: Flyby, which was submitted in July 2002.[10]Bailing out of the project in favor ofCharlie's Angels: Full Throttlein September 2002, McG was replaced byBrett Ratner.[11]Meanwhile, he developed and co-created a television series withJohn McNamaracalledFastlane(2002), which was eventually canceled after one season due to the high costs of each episode.[12]Josh Schwartzapproached him and his producing partner,Stephanie Savage, about another television series as well,The O.C.(2003), which revolved around the lives of several teenagers based in McG's hometown of Newport Beach.[13][14]McG was set to direct the pilot, but because of scheduling conflicts withCharlie's Angels: Full Throttle, he was replaced byDoug Liman.[15]The show ended after four seasons in 2007.[12]
The sequel toCharlie's Angelsfollowed in 2003, and although not as successful as the first,Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle(2003) also made over $250 million worldwide.[7]Shortly thereafter,Sonyextended its first-look production deal withWonderland Sound and Visionfor an additional three years, withHot Wheels,Airshow, andRadianton their film slate.[16]Since then, none of those films have been developed with the former, which was previously supposed to be a directing vehicle for him in 2003 (he later chose to produce instead in 2006),[1][17]being put intoturnaroundin 2009.[18]
Warner Bros., still satisfied with his bankability, re-hired him to directSuperman: Flybyin April 2003 after Ratner had dropped out due to casting and pre-production difficulties. During his tenure, McG and the producers spent more than $15 million planning storyboards, concept art, and locations, as well as having script revisions and the film completely pre-visualized. However, McG later left the project, citing hisfear of flyingto Sydney.[19]This eventually broughtBryan Singeron board in July 2004, resulting inSuperman Returns.[11]McG produced the television series,The Mountain(2004), on the same year, also getting canceled after one season.[12]
His next television work wasSupernatural(2005), for which he served as an executive producer until 2013.[12]The following year saw Warner Bros. allowing McG, who "looked to improve as a storyteller and wanted to get more substantial material," to directWe Are Marshall(2006), asportsdrama film.[1]Although the film received mixed critical reception, McG was complimented for his ability of emotional storytelling. Jessica Reaves of theChicago Tribunenoted that "McG shows new maturity. Scenes that could have been played for ghoulish effect, like the plane crash and its fiery aftermath, are handled with skillful efficiency."[20]At a budget of $35 million, the film only made $43.5 million.[7]He had also produced the horror filmStay Alive(2006), which received largely negative reviews.[21]
Along withAdam Brody, McG was next set to produce a remake of the cult comedy hitRevenge of the Nerds, planned for a release in 2007 with a budget of $12.5 million and filming to begin atEmory University. However, after reviewing the script, university officials backed out two weeks before filming, citing it as "too bawdy." This led the film to be shot atAgnes Scott Collegefor two weeks, but producersFox Atomicshelved it due to the "lack of wide open space Emory's campus would have afforded them and [the fact that] winter was fast approaching making the prospect of shooting the movie's many outdoor scenes problematic."[22]Furthermore, studio executivePeter Ricewas disappointed with thedailies.[23]
In 2007, McG worked mostly on television, producingPussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll(2007) andChuck(2007).[12]Co-created byJosh Schwartz, his partner onThe O.C., he directed the latter's pilot and remained an executive producer throughout the series. Fox had also given a script commitment toInvisible, a television pilot written by Ari Eisner about a criminal who becomes invisible he was supposed to produce,[24]andWe Are Marshallwriter Jamie Linden was working with him on a TV pilot calledFlash Back.[25]However, as of 2011, there have been no updates on these shows.
On August 2, 2007, McG signed a three-year first-look production deal for his Wonderland Sound and Vision company withWarner Bros., planning to "produce three movies a year" and directing "one of them every year." The first four films set up wereNightcrawlers(now known asMonster Squad), an untitled spy project,Yucatan, andMaintenance.[26]The former, about an aberrant father who must confront his childhood tormentor to rid of his fear of monsters and the dark, was arranged to start in November 2007, but McG dropped out and was later replaced byMike Mitchell;[27]the untitled spy project was rewritten byPhil Alden Robinsonand was to be produced by Basil Iwanyk;[28]Yucatan, based onSteve McQueen's leftover notes and storyboards of his passion project, is anepicadventurousheist film, though Warner Bros. has now placed the project under Team Downey;[29]andMaintenancewas afilm adaptationofJim Massey's comic book series of the same name about two janitors who work for a weapons manufacturer that supply to the world's most evil super villains, but the rights of the film have moved toDreamWorks Animation.[30]As a result, none of them will feature the involvement of McG.[31]
On October 30, 2007, Fox approved a pilot for an American remake of the British cult showSpaced, which McG served as an executive producer, even thoughSimon Peggand fans were outraged at the prospect of having a remake without the original creators' involvement. Nonetheless, the pilot, written byAdam Barr,[32]was panned before its airing, resulting in Fox scrapping the series.[33]McG then executive producedPussycat Dolls Present: Girlicious(2008). ThePussycat Dolls Presentseries was canceled afterward. He was the executive producer for theWB Television Network's online series,Sorority Forever(2008) andExposed(2010), as well.[34]
McG's next film project wasTerminator Salvation(2009), the fourth installment of theTerminatorfilm series that introduces the future war fought between humanity andSkynet. After theHalcyon Companypurchased the rights, they signed McG onto the project, for which he was paid $6 million.[35]Although he promised fans that he would bring back credibility to the saga, with the casting ofChristian Baleand a personal talk withJames Cameron,[36]the film, released on May 21, 2009, in the United States and Canada, received mixed reviews. It grossed $371 million worldwide, well below industry expectations considering its high budget.[37]In promotion of Terminator Salvation, at a Wondercon event, McG highlighted actressMoon Bloodgood, and asked the audience, “Do you want to see Moon’s boobs?”[38][39]
FollowingTerminator Salvation, he was expected to direct aremakeof20,000 Leagues Under the SeaforDisney, for which he was interested in castingSam WorthingtonforCaptain Nemo.[40][41]However, after spending nearly $10 million on pre-production work, Walt Disney Studios' movie chief Rich Ross put the project on hold indefinitely due to creative concerns, and McG is no longer attached.[42]Subsequently, he went into negotiations with20th Century Foxto directThis Means War, a spy comedy project about two best friends who go to war against each other after falling for the same girl. Though initially troubled with numerous casting dropouts, includingBradley Cooper,[43]Seth Rogen,[44]andSam Worthington,[45]the film was finally filmed inVancouverand was released in 2012.[46]Since then, he has been in negotiations for the directing duties forUniversal Pictures'Oujia(a film based on theHasbroboard game of the same name,[47]) and has been attached toLorene Scafaria's pitch based on aRolling Stonearticle about the true life events ofEsther Reednamed "The Girl Who Conned the Ivy League," along withAmanda Seyfried,[48]and a high-profile untitled space adventure project written byDavid Callahamfor20th Century Fox.[49]McG was also in discussions to supervise development and direct the fifth installment of theTerminatorfilm series, having made a $10 millionright-of-first-refusaldeal with theHalcyon Company,[3]but with the rights of the series transferred to hedge fund Pacificor, his further involvement became unlikely.[50]The film adaptation ofPeter M. Lenkov's graphic novel seriesR.I.P.D.was another project he was circling, but because of his commitment toThis Means War, he was replaced byRobert Schwentke.[51]He producedThe Duff(2015), a teen comedy based on a book.[52]
McG has also delved into comics with Wonderland set to publish the originalHaunted City, written by Chap Taylor, that will expand into a feature film, which he plans to direct, a television show, and a video game.[53]

She had an "other-worldly" experience whenSteven Spielbergcalled to offer her a role as a high-class call girl in the crime comedy-drama filmCatch Me If You Can(2002).[47]After seeing her inAlias, Spielberg was sure that "she would be the next superstar".[48]She filmed her scene oppositeLeonardo DiCaprioduring a one-day shoot.[49]Garner's first co-starring film role was in the action superhero filmDaredevil(2003), in which she playedElektratoBen Affleck's Daredevil.[50]The physicality required for the role was something Garner had discovered "an aptitude for" through her work onAlias.[47][51]Elvis Mitchell ofThe New York Timeswrote that she "realizes Elektra more through movement than by way of her lumpy, obvious lines. She hasn't mastered the combat skill of tossing off bad material."[52]WhileDaredevilreceived mixed reviews, it was a box office success.[53]Also in 2003, she voiced herself in an episode ofThe Simpsons.
Garner's first leading film role, in the romantic comedy13 Going on 30(2004), was widely praised. She played a teenager who finds herself trapped in the body of a thirty-year-old. Garner choseGary Winickto direct the film[54]and they continued to look for other projects to do together until his death in 2011.[55][56]Manohla Dargis of theLos Angeles Timesfound her to be "startling": "Whenever she's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else."[57]Owen Gleiberman ofEntertainment Weeklycalled it an "utterly beguiling" performance, writing, "You can pinpoint the moment in it when Garner becomes a star."[58]Ann Hornaday ofThe Washington Postremarked: "Garner is clearly cut out to be America's next Sweetheart; she has the same magic mix of allure and accessibility that the job calls for."[59]13 Going on 30grossed $96 million worldwide.[60]Garner reprised the character of Elektra in the 2005Daredevilspin-off filmElektra; it was a box office and critical failure.[61]Claudia Puig ofUSA Todayconcluded that Garner "is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in13 Going on 30".[62]Garner next starred in the romantic dramaCatch and Release. Although filmed in 2005 in between seasons ofAlias, it was not released until early 2007 and failed to recoup its production budget.[63]Peter Travers ofRolling Stonepraised Garner's ability "to blend charm and gravity"[64]but Peter Hartlaub of theSan Francisco Chroniclefelt that, while her "natural beauty and likability are still assets, [she] seems occasionally challenged by what should be an easy role".[65]
After a one-year break following the conclusion ofAlias, her wedding to Affleck, and the birth of her first child, Garner returned to work in 2007. Her supporting role inJunoas a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan ofNew York Magazineas a turning point in her career: "She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ... WriterDiablo Codyand directorJason Reitmanexpertly deploy Garner's innate humanity as a trump card."[66]Lisa Schwarzbaum ofEntertainment Weeklysaid Garner had never "been lovelier or more affecting".[67]Also that same year, she played an FBI investigator in the action thrillerThe Kingdom.[68][69]She was nursing her baby during filming in Arizona and was hospitalized on two occasions with heatstroke.[70]

In preparation for the role, Garner worked with vocal and movement coaches and took French lessons.[28]Ben Brantley ofThe New York Timesdescribed her performance as "captivating": "Ms. Garner, I am pleased to report, makes Roxane a girl worth pining over ... [She] speaks Anthony Burgess's peppery rhymed translation with unaffected sprightliness. If she's a tad stilted in the big tragic finale, her comic timing is impeccable."[71]The New Yorker's theater critic was impressed by her "feistiness" and "lightness of comic touch".[72]The play was recorded before a live audience and aired onPBSin 2008. In 2007, Garner became a spokesperson of skin care brand Neutrogena.[73]

While the film received lukewarm reviews, it grossed $102.2 million worldwide.[74]Michael Phillips ofThe Chicago Tribunefound Garner "easy to like and sharp with her timing"; he was disappointed to see her as "the love interest, which is not the same as a rounded character".[75]Similarly, Manohla Dargis ofThe New York Timeswas dismayed to see Garner appear as "less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words "enter generic female lead" in [the] screenplay)".[76]
Garner's second performance of 2009 was in comedianRicky Gervais's directorial debutThe Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner—"always happy and always pleasant to everyone"—against type.[77]In the film, she played the love interest of the first human with the ability to lie in a world where people can only tell the truth. Reviews for the movie were mixed and it made $32.4 million worldwide.[78]David Edelstein ofNew York Magazinesaid Garner "proves again (the first time was13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on,"[79]while Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chroniclesaid Garner "has never been better onscreen ... Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before."[80]

Distributed for a limited release in certain parts of the United States only,Butterreceived mixed reviews and grossed $105,018.[89][90]Peter Debruge ofVarietypraised "the best bigscreen use of Jennifer Garner's comedy gifts since13 Going on 30".[91]while Peter Travers ofRolling Stonedescribed her as the "best in show": "[She] knows how to play comedy of the absurd."[92]However, Scott Bowles ofUSA Todayremarked: "Garner is a terrific actress, but here she's asked to cackle her lines in a voice a full octave above her natural one."[93]Also in 2012, she appeared in the YouTube shortSerena,[94]and became a spokesperson for food company Luvo.[95]
Garner reunited withMatthew McConaugheyin the 2013 biographical dramaDallas Buyers Club, portraying the role of a doctor treatingAIDSpatients in Texas during the mid-1980s.[96][97]The film received significant acclaim and was a box office success.[98]Peter Travers ofRolling Stonedescribed Garner as "a radiant actress of rare spirit and sensitivity"[99]and Betsy Sharkey of theLos Angeles Timessaid: "Garner is once again cast as a quintessentially decent, all-American girl, albeit a doctor. But the question of whether the actress has deeper emotional layers to bring to the screen is not answered here."[100]David Edelstein ofNew Yorkmagazine said: "It's not a well-shaped role, but I've gotten to the point where I'm happy to see Garner in anything. She's incapable of phoniness."[101]Also in 2013, Garner became the first celebrity spokesperson of the Italian fashion brandMax Mara.[102]
In 2014, Garner starred in the sports dramaDraft Day, as the fictional salary cap analyst of theCleveland Browns. Critical reception toward the film was mixed and Mick LaSalle ofThe San Francisco Chronicle, describing her part, remarked: "It's not much of a role, but she's perfectly nice in it. Perhaps someday someone will give Garner a chance to be something other than perfectly nice."[103]Garner also co-starred withSteve Carellin the 2014 Disney adaptation of the popular children's bookAlexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day, taking on the role of the mother of the titular character. The film grossed $101 million worldwide.[104]Sandie Angulo Chen of theWashington Postsaid: "Garner, who has long mastered the art of playing harried and overworked moms, is pleasantly frazzled."[105]Her other film role in 2014 was that of an overprotective mother in the dramedyMen, Women & Children, directed byJason Reitmanand co-starringRosemarie DeWitt,Judy Greer,Dean Norris, andAdam Sandler. The film made $2.2 million worldwide,[106]and Christopher Orr ofThe Atlanticsaid: "Garner does what she can as the Snooping Mom from Hell, but ultimately it's not much. The role is like a caricature of her performance inJuno, minus the ultimate (and essential) redemption."[107]In late 2014, Capital One signed Garner as their spokesperson for their Capital One Venture Air Miles credit card.[108]
In 2015'sDanny Collins, a drama inspired by the true story of folk singerSteve Tilstonand starringAl PacinoandAnnette Bening, Garner played the supporting role of the wife ofBobby Cannavale's character.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
