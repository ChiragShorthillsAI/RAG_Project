Sound of Freedomis a 2023 Americanthriller film[5]directed and co-written byAlejandro Monteverde, and starringJim Caviezel,Mira Sorvino, andBill Camp. Caviezel playsTim Ballard, a former U.S. government agent who embarks on a mission to rescue children fromsex traffickersinColombia.[6]It is produced byEduardo Verástegui, who also plays a role in the film. The plot centers around Ballard'sOperation Underground Railroad(O.U.R.), ananti-sex traffickingorganization.
The film was released on July 4, 2023, byAngel Studios, and was asleeper hit, grossing$251 millionagainst a$14.5 millionbudget to become one of the most successful independent films in history.[7]It received mixed reviews from critics,[8]while audience reception was highly positive.[9][10][11][12]
In 2013, Roberto Aguilar, a poor father of two fromTegucigalpa,Honduras, is approached by a former beauty queen, Giselle. She offers to sign his young children, Rocío and Miguel Aguilar, tochild modelingcontracts. He accepts and takes them to the photoshoot. When he returns to pick his children up, they are gone. It is revealed that the children have been abducted and sold to be used assex slaves.
InCalexico, California,Tim Ballardis aSpecial AgentforHomeland Security Investigations(HSI), where he arrests people who possess and distributechild pornography. The painful work takes a great toll on his personal life, and this is only worsened when another agent, Chris, points out that despite arresting and prosecuting numerouschild predators, they are largely unable to prevent more children from being exploited. Ballard knows this is because most of them are outside the U.S., but Chris' words stick with him. He speaks to a suspect he arrested, Ernst Oshinsky, deceiving the man into believing he is a secretpedophilehimself and using quotes from Oshinsky's novel. Once he gains Oshinsky's trust, he sets up a meeting with a trafficked child, prompting Ballard to arrest Oshinsky on child trafficking, and is able to arrest Earl Buchanan, the man who purchased Miguel.
Ballard rescues Miguel and asks him for information that would help him find other missing children. Ballard learns that Miguel's sister Rocío is still missing, and the boy asks him to save her. Ballard arranges for Miguel to return home to Roberto, but not before Miguel gives Ballard his sister'sSaint Timothynecklace. Ballard starts looking for Rocío, and his search leads him toCartagena,Colombia. He meets with Vampiro ("Vampire"), a formerCali Cartelaccountant who now works to save children from sex trafficking, and gains information on Giselle.
After reading about a child sex club inThailandwhich was shut down, Ballard decides that this is the perfect cover story to acquire a large number of Giselle's children in asting operation. Vampiro gets a Colombian police officer, Jorge, and a wealthy citizen named Paulo Delgado to help with Ballard's mission. Ballard's supervisor, Frost, orders Ballard to return to the U.S. as he does not have the authority to conduct such an operation on foreign soil. Ballard resigns his position rather than abandon the search for Rocío.
Sympathizing with Ballard's decision, Frost secretly persuades the staff of theU.S. Embassy in Colombiato assist him however they can. With Jorge acting as a middleman, Ballard and Vampiro pose as sex traffickers and convince Giselle to sell them 54 children, enabling the police to identify and arrest her while dismantling her operation. Rocío is not among the freed youths. Beforehand, Ballard set up the traffickers' lawyer, Carne, to look like a snitch, while everyone else was detained.
After interrogating one of Giselle's associates, Fuego, and revealing a photo of a dead Carne, unaware of the circumstances of Carne's death, Fuego breaks and tells Jorge that Rocío was sold toFARC, entrenched deep in theAmazon natural region. Jorge informs Ballard that there is no way to retrieve the girl, because the region is a largely unmapped jungle wilderness, and any rebel territory is ano-fly zonefor theColombian government. Vampiro notes that medical personnel are allowed to enter on humanitarian grounds, and Jorge reluctantly agrees to help them obtain documentation to pose as doctors. The rebels refuse to let Vampiro enter, and Ballard is forced to continue by himself.
Tim gains access to the FARC camp where Rocío is being held and learns that she is the personal sex slave for a FARC leader, El Alacrán ("The Scorpion"), and along with others is required to mashcoca leavesto producecocaine. At night, Ballard is forced to kill El Alacrán while freeing Rocío, and despite the rebels pursuing and firing on them, gets her to safety. Before they part, he gives her back the necklace Miguel gave him earlier. Rocío is finally returned to her father and brother, and the family goes home to Honduras.
An epilogue says that Tim Ballard testified before theUnited States Congressand states that his testimony resulted in laws being passed that require the government to cooperate with foreign countries on sex trafficking investigations. The epilogue also claims that there are more people enslaved today than at any other time in history, including when slavery was legal.
Sound of Freedomwas inspired by the work ofTim Ballard, the founder ofOperation Underground Railroad(O.U.R.), a non-profit started to stop trafficking. Work on the script began in 2015.[2]He personally requested thatJim Caviezelportray him because he had been impressed with Caviezel's performance asEdmond DantesinThe Count of Monte Cristo(2002).[14][15]Caviezel said that he considersSound of Freedomthe second most important film he has ever appeared in, ranking it behind his starring role asJesus ChristinThe Passion of the Christ(2004).[16][15]
The film was executive produced byMel Gibson,[17]Tony Robbins, who also partly financed the film's distribution;[18][19]John Couch;[18]John Paul DeJoria;[18]Paul Hutchinson;[20]Patrick Slim,[18]and Andrew McCubbins,[21][22][23]who was convicted in 2020 of running an$89 millionMedicare fraud scheme.[24]
The film's score is composed byJavier Navarrete.[25]The film features the song "La Maza," composed by Cuban musicianSilvio Rodriguez, and performed by Argentine singerMercedes Sosa.[26]
Principal photographybegan in the summer of 2018. The majority of the film was shot inCartagena, Colombia.[27]Additional scenes were shot inCalexico, California.[28][29]
The film was completed in 2018 and a distribution deal was made with the Latin American subsidiary of20th Century Fox.[30]When the studio waspurchasedbythe Walt Disney Company, it shelved the film. Subsequently, the filmmakers bought the distribution rights back from the studio.[31]
Verástegui approachedAngel Studioswith the release rights. Angel presented the film to an online group of 100,000 investors in its past projects called the Angel Guild, which gave it a "yes" vote within days.[2]In 2023, Angel Studios had acquired the worldwide distribution rights, with a planned release during the second half of 2023.[31]In May of the same year, it received a release date ofJuly 4, 2023.[32]
Angel usedequity crowdfundingto raise the funds needed to distribute and market the film. Seven thousand people invested, allowing Angel to meet its$5 milliongoal in two weeks.[2]They also encouraged patrons to "pay it forward" to allow people who might not otherwise see the film to watch it in theaters for free.[33]Sound of Freedomis Angel Studios' second theatrical release afterHis Only Son.[34]
On July 26, Angel Studios confirmed thatSound of Freedomwould be released in 23 international markets throughout 2023. The film was released in UAE on August 17, in South Africa, Iceland and Lithuania on August 18 and Australia and New Zealand on August 24. Other countries where the film was shown include Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Belize, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Croatia,[35]Bosnia and Herzegovina[36]and Serbia[37]on August 31. In addition, the film was released in the Philippines on September 20,[38]as well as in the United Kingdom and Ireland on September 1 and in Spain on October 11.[39][40]
During the film's theatrical run, multiple outlets and moviegoers reported theaters claiming to be sold out, though seats in the auditoriums were empty. Some attribute this topay-it-forwardsales by Angel Studios. A message at the end of the film urges viewers to buy an extra ticket "for someone who would not otherwise be able to see the film," suggesting many of the extra tickets were left unused, resulting in almost empty sold out shows and unoccupied seats.[41][42]Supporters paid for$26.1 millionin tickets (roughly 1.8 million seats) for people to see the film for free. Angel Studios said that$21.8 million, or about 84%, of those ticket purchases were redeemed by moviegoers.[43]
The film was inspired by the life of Tim Ballard, who left the Department of Homeland Security around 2013 and foundedOperation Underground Railroad(O.U.R.) to work with local police in other countries to catch child sex traffickers. The film's central plot point, that of a brother and sister lured to a photo shoot in Honduras, is not an event that Ballard has claimed actually happened.[44]According toAmerican Crime Journalreporters, Ballard embellished details about the story told in the film.[45]
Ballard stated that, "Some things are definitely overreported." He did not go into the jungle by himself to rescue a little girl, nor did he kill a man to rescue a child. According to Ballard, the island rescue Operation Triple Take involved both minors and adults, while the film portrays all victims as children. Ballard claimed that his team not only rescued 54 minors, but 123 individuals at two additional locations.[46][47]
The real-life O.U.R. has been criticized for its conduct during sting operations and has been accused of exaggerating claims regarding its work.[48]The actual organization's practices have come under scrutiny, including using inexperienced donors and celebrities as part of its jump team, a lack of meaningful surveillance or identification of targets, failing to validate whether the people they intended to rescue were in fact actual trafficking victims, and conflating consensualsex workwith sex trafficking.[49]Ballard himself was removed as the head of O.U.R. following an internal investigation in 2023. In a December 2023 statement posted on its website, the organization said an independent law firm reached the conclusion that Ballard had "engaged in unprofessional behavior that violated O.U.R.'s policies and values."[50]
Many experts in the anti-trafficking movement voiced concern about the movie's portrayal of human trafficking. Anti-trafficking experts noted that the movie's focus on human trafficking constitutes a very small segment of the overall problem, that trafficking is often perpetrated by people known to the victim rather than kidnapping by strangers, that anti-trafficking interventions have changed significantly since the ten-year-old story depicted in this movie, and that self-liberation rather than heroic rescues is the predominant way through which individuals escape trafficking situations.[51]
While the film does not mention anyQAnonconspiracy theories,[30][52][53][54]some critics and anti-trafficking experts have opined that the film embellishes the reality of child exploitation and stokes QAnon conspiracy theories,[6]referring to a "belief that a core group of devil-worshiping elite run the world."[55]Both Ballard and star Caviezel have been public about their belief in conspiracy theories of the QAnon movement.[44][56]OnNPR'sAll Things Considered, Mike Rothschild, author ofThe Storm Is Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement, Cult, and Conspiracy Theory of Everything, argued that the film is "being marketed to QAnon believers, it's being embraced by this community, and its leading actor is a huge part of the QAnon community."[5]While promoting the film in an interview withJordan Petersonin July 2023, Ballard claimed to have recently raided a West African "baby factory" where children are sold for organ harvesting and "Satanic ritual abuse," echoing another QAnon myth.[57][58]In July 2020, in a video post, he lent credence to a QAnon conspiracy theory that falsely accused furniture companyWayfairof laundering money gained from child sex trafficking.[59][60]Ballard has criticized those drawing a connection between the film and QAnon, saying, "They make zero connection to the actual story. It's very difficult to make that connection when it's actually based on a true story." He toldThe New York Times, "Some of these theories have allowed people to open their eyes, so now it's our job to flood the space with real information so the facts can be shared."[45][61]In an interview withVariety, the film's director Alejandro Monteverde responded to the QAnon allegations, characterizing them as "misconceptions" and saying that the movie's origins came from a network TV news segment on child sex trafficking which he saw two years before the QAnon movement emerged (work on the script began in 2015).[2]He also said that he has to "keep [his] distance" from "people that are too close to the film that are in politics."[62]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 57% of 83 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's consensus reads: "Sound of Freedomis an effective and suspenseful call to action against human trafficking, yet not free of issues in its depiction of the sensitive subject matter."[63]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 36 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[64]
Variety'sOwen Gleibermangave the film a positive review, writing, "Let's assume that, like me, you're not aright-wingfundamentalistconspiracy theoristlooking for a dark, faith-based suspense film to see over the holiday weekend… Even then, you needn't hold extreme beliefs to experienceSound of Freedomas a compelling movie that shines an authentic light on one of the crucial criminal horrors of our time, one that Hollywood has mostly shied away from."[65]The Detroit News'Adam Graham gave the film a C+ grade, writing "Even as the film's pacing starts to thud ... its work has been done, competently if not altogether artfully. Sometimes, obvious works just fine."[66]Film Threat's Alan Ng recommended the film, writing, "Sound of Freedomis almost as if you're listening to Tim Ballard tell his incredible story of rescuing children and having it dramatized onscreen. It's heartfelt, informative, and inspiring."[67]National Review's Madeleine Kearns called the film "provocative and gripping," adding that it "remind[s] us that as long as children are being abused, no matter where they are or how many there are, the rest of us ought to care."[68]Faith-based reviews were largely positive.[69]
Glenn Kenny, writing forThe New York Times, gave a critical review: "The queasiness derives from the contemporary-thriller vibes of the police procedural material... Then there are the scenes in which actual child actors perform being prepped for provocative pictures by adult groomers. What are the ethics of depiction here? The makers of this film initially seem to be grappling with how to properly tell this story." He went on to say "The director Alejandro Monteverde does have some sense of flourish, what with several single-point perspective shots and considered dissolves," but concluded "Oddly, the picture's muted tone ultimately undercuts its solemn sense of mission."[70]RogerEbert.com's Nick Allen was also negative, writing: "Sound of Freedomis a solemn, drawn-out bore with a not particularly bold narrative stance—caring about the safety of children is roughly the easiest cause for any remotely decent human being... But while being so committed to such solemnity and suffering, the truncated storytelling by co-writers Monteverde and Rod Barr neglects to flesh out its ideas or characters or add any more intensity to Ballard's slow-slow-slow burn search for two kids in particular (Lucás Ávila's Miguel and Cristal Aparicio's Rocío) whose faces haunt him."[71]
Slate's Sam Adams said in his review that the film appears to be "a straightforward search-and-rescue thriller, in which Ballard, a special agent at the Department of Homeland Security, goes rogue to free a young girl from the clutches of a Colombian sex-trafficking ring. But it arrived in theaters surrounded by a cloud of innuendo put forth by its star and its noisiest right-wing supporters—conspiratorial insinuations about who doesn't want this story to be told and what real-world traffickers arereallyup to."[72]The Times of Israel's Shira Li Bartov wrote that the film draws upon multiple conspiracy theories that includeanti-Jewish canards, including theblood libel, while its star, actor Jim Caviezel, has floated antisemitic theories in interviews promoting the film.[73]
The Telegraph's Ed Power gave the "bizarrely dull" film one star out of five, calling it a "creepy and breathtakingly dreary child trafficking thriller" whose success in American theaters "proves America is not only a different country – it's a different planet".[74]Peter BradshawofThe Guardianalso panned it as "an odd, uncertainly acted, opaquely intended movie,"[75]while Wendy Ide gave it two stars out of five in a review for its sister paperThe Observer, calling it both "an earnest and well-intentioned attempt to engage with a very real and harrowing issue" and "a thunderously crass and manipulative movie that is hampered by erratic pacing, pantomime bad guys and an overfondness for shots of Caviezel weeping God-fearing, manly tears."[76]
Sound of Freedomgrossed$184.2 millionin the United States andCanada, and$66.4 millionin other territories, for a worldwide total of$251 million.[3]It is the tenth highest-grossing film of 2023 in the U.S. and Canada.[77]By late-August 2023, it was considered "one of history's most successful independent films."[7]In March 2024,Deadline Hollywoodreported that of the film's box-office gross (at that point,$249.5 million), 52% ($129.6 million) went to "theater access costs", while 8% ($18.96 million) was withheld by taxes, 19% ($47.6 million) accounted forprint and advertisingcosts, 14% ($47.6 million) served as payment to the filmmakers, and the remaining 7% ($17.8 million) returned to Angel Studios.[43]
The film was released in the United States on July 4, 2023. Prior to its release, the film sold$10 millionin ticketpre-salesat 2,626 theaters.[78]According to/Film, the film received little coverage in the mainstream media leading up to its release.[79]Originally,Sound of Freedomwas projected to gross$11–15 millionover its first week of release, with some estimates reaching$20 million.[80]The film grossed$14.2 millionon its first day of release,$3.6 millionon its second, and$3.5 millionon its third, for a Tuesday—Thursday total of$21.3 million, raising six-day estimates to$36 million. It went on to make$18.2 millionin its opening weekend (with a six day total of$40.2 million), finishing third at the box office.[81][82]Its success surprised many industry experts, especially considering it was only released in 2,850 theaters, considerably fewer thanInsidious: The Red Door(3,188 theaters) andIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny(4,600 theaters).[6]Playing in 3,265 theaters in its second weekend, the film made$24.7 million(an increase of 26%), finishing second behind newcomerMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.[83]Sound of Freedomcrossed the$100 millionmark at the box office on 16th day of release.[84]In its third weekend the film made$20.1 million, finishing third behind newcomersBarbieandOppenheimer.[85]Playing in 3,411 theaters the film continued to hold well in its fourth weekend of release, grossing$12.8 millionand finishing in fourth.[86]
After its opening week, rumors and videos on social media claimed thatAMC Theatreswas canceling screenings and disrupting viewing by inventing technical difficulties and disabling air conditioning. Angel Studios' head of theatrical distribution Brandon Purdie said "these rumors are not accurate" and stated that due to the positive reception and consumer demand, AMC had added 450 additional theaters on July 14.[87][88]
The film, which various contemporary sources describe as a "Christian thriller",[5][89][90][91][92]received highly positive reviews from viewers—at one point it earned an audience score of 100% onRotten Tomatoes.[9][10][11][12]Some movie industry analysts attributed the film's success in part to its appeal to an overlooked segment of the film audience.[93]"This is yet another example of a faith-based distributor breaking the rules and coming out a winner," Comscore senior analyst Paul Dergarabedian said. "[It] also shows that agrassrootsmarketing strategy and tapping into the power of the faith-based audience has proven to be a very effective method to generate profits."[34]
Christian websiteMovieGuideattributed the film's unexpected success to its wide demographic appeal and strong moral values.[94]Varietywrote that ticket buyers have been predominately female, while more than 50% of cinemagoers were over the age of 45.[6]One third of the audience has been Hispanic.[6]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an "A+," a standard grade for faith-based titles.[80]
TheLos Angeles Timesnoted that the film had become a part of theculture war, stating that "supporting the film has become a cause du jour for the MAGA crowd."[95]TheNational Postargued that the film was an example of an independent studio "beat[ing] Hollywood at its own game."[96]
Mel Gibson,Dana White,Elon Musk,Ben Shapiro,Jewel,Manny Pacquiao,Tim Tebow, and theFamily Research Councilendorsed the film.[97][98][99]Donald Trumphosted a special screening atTrump National Golf Club Bedminsteron the night of July 19, 2023.[100][101][102]

Angel Studios, Inc.is an American independent media company andfilm distribution studiobased inProvo, Utah.[1]It operates theover-the-topvideo on-demandserviceAngel Studios.[2]Thestreaming serviceis available worldwide and can be accessed viaweb browsersor viaapplication softwareinstalled onsmartphones,tablet computers, andsmart TVs.[3]
Angel Studios emerged as the result of a bankruptcy reorganization fromVidAngel,[4]usingequity crowdfundingthrough Angel Funding[5]to finance its original productions by offering individual investors the opportunity to purchase shares in the company and its titles.[6]Content produced by Angel Studios is distributed for free on their own streaming service.[2]Some titles are also available in other third-party streaming services asdistribution deals.[7]
The studio has become known for itsChristian-themed films. Notable titles that Angel Studios has produced include the filmSound of Freedom,[8][9]and the television seriesThe Chosen.[10][11][12]
Angel Studios was originally founded as VidAngel in 2014 by Neal Harmon, Jeffrey Harmon, Daniel Harmon, Jordan Harmon, and Benton Crane. According to Neal Harmon, the brothers wanted to be able to show any movie to their children without worrying about explicit material.[13]VidAngel provided a filtering service that allowed viewers to skip or mute scenes they did not want to watch from streamed movies and TV shows, by allowing viewers to set customized filters on graphic violence, nudity, and profanity.[14]
In 2016, VidAngel was sued by several major Hollywood studios for copyright violations, accusing the service of streaming unlicensed content that was not created by VidAngel.[15]VidAngel fought the lawsuit for several years, asserting its method was legal under the Family Movie Act of 2005, and then eventually reached a settlement in 2020.[16]
As a result of the lawsuit, the Harmon brothers decided to sell the filtering service business and instead focus on producing original content through equity crowdfunding.[17]The previous VidAngel service was sold to VidAngel Entertainment, and the company was rebranded as Angel Studios in 2021.[18]
In December 2016, VidAngel was undergoing a lawsuit. To raise money for operations and lawsuit costs, the company conducted a Regulation A+ securities offering with a goal of $5 million in investment. It met its goal after 28 hours and had crowdfunded over $10 million after five days.[19]
In 2017, the company conducted another Regulation A+ securities offering to crowdfund Season 1 ofThe Chosen.[20]Neal Harmon and Jeff Harmon worked together with Dallas Jenkins and Derral Eves to produce and stream a multi-season television series about the life of Jesus and his disciples. After a pilot episode was developed, the company raised $13 million in equity crowdfunding to finance the first season, the largest amount ever crowdfunded for a TV show.[21]
Also in 2017, a third foray into equity crowdfunding came from the launch ofDry Bar Comedy, a series of 52 originalstand-up comedysets filmed in Utah that are generallycleanand performed by lesser-known comedians. Much of its content went viral, withDry Bar Comedyvideos receiving over two billion views as of 2021.[22]
The success ofDry Bar ComedyandThe Chosengave way to a new business model that would allow the company to produce and distribute original content. The founders decided to focus on developing original content using its equity crowdfunding model and rebrand as Angel Studios.[23]
Angel Studios was named after the "angel investors" that participate in the new model that uses equity crowdfunding to finance original productions. These productions are distributed via the Angel Studios streaming platform for free. The company relies on apay what you wantrevenue model, coined "Pay It Forward", in which viewers can optionally pay for the content if they choose to support it.[24]
In early 2021, Angel Studios purchased the domain angel.com for $2 million.[25]Soon after, Angel Studios launched an investment portal called Angel Funding that offered investment opportunities through Regulation Crowdfunding securities offerings.[26]
Several productions were successfully funded through the investment portal after its launch in March 2021.Tuttle Twins, a show for children with educational themes on economic freedom raised $4.6 million in equity crowdfunding for its production.[27]The Wingfeather Saga, an animated series based on the award-winning book collection of the same name raised $1 million in the first 48 hours and $5 million in 20 days.[28]
In April 2021,The Chosen, which was originally distributed through the VidAngel platform, was made available on Angel Studios for the launch of Season 2. The show became a viral hit with renowned success worldwide.[29]
In 2022, Angel Studios raised $47 million in an investment round led by a Gigafund, a venture capital company.[30]In May 2022, the studio reported that it had $123 million in revenue, and that 50,000 people have invested over $100 million for production of new original content on its platform.[31]
As of 2022, Angel Studios had 50,000 individual investors and had over $100 million worth of original content, including 12 titles, in production.[32]
The Angel Guild, launched in 2023, is a  group of approximately 1 million members who review and vote on completed episodes and movies to help Angel Studios decide if they should take on a project. If a film or show's voting results meet the Guild's minimum eligibility requirements, the project enters into a due diligence process to determine its potential for distribution.
Angel Guild members pay a monthly or annual membership fee to receive exclusive benefits such as access to Angel Studios’ entire library, new monthly releases, merchandise discounts, two complimentary movie tickets to every release, and more. The Angel Guild supports Angel Studios’ mission to share stories that amplify light.
Notable films greenlit by the Angel Guild includeHis Only Son, which earned $13 million at the worldwide box office, andSound of Freedom, which grossed $250 million after Angel Guild members voted for its distribution.
On February 7, 2025, Angel Studios signed a deal with U.K.'s only faith-based distributor Kova Releasing as well as previous partnerships with A Contracorriente (Spain), Blitz (Croatia and ex-Yugoslavia), Filmone (Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria), Neema Media (Benelux), Nos (Portugal), Paris Films (Brazil) and Santa Barbara Films (Colombia). On February 10th, 2025, Angel Studios partnered with more studios include Saje Distribution (France), Kinostar (Germany), Rialto (Australia, New Zealand), Role (multiple Latin American countries), Crystalsky (Philippines), Empire (multiple African countries), Shaw (Singapore) and Skyline Entertainment (Sri Lanka).
The Chosen, a streaming multi-season television series created byDallas Jenkinsand about the life of Jesus, was first produced under the VidAngel umbrella and later distributed by Angel Studios.[55]The series was supported byequity crowdfundingand raised over $13 million, the largest amount ever crowdfunded for a TV show.[55]Following the Season 3 finale in February 2023,The Chosenand Jenkins broke away from Angel Studios.  The show is now handled by the Come and See Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation formed specifically to produce, license, and distributeThe Chosen.[56]
Following months of legal arbitration between Angel Studios and The Chosen LLC, a decision by the arbitrator in favor of The Chosen was given in late May 2024.  One day after Jenkins announced the ruling, Angel Studios' CEO Neal Harmon announced his company planned to appeal.[57][58]
Dry Bar Comedywas one of the preceding company's first forays into original content, launched in 2017.
