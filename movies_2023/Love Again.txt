Love Againis a 2023 Americanromanticcomedy-dramafilm written and directed byJames C. Strouse. It is an English-language remake of the 2016 German filmSMS für Dich, itself based on a novel by Sofie Cramer.[6]The film starsPriyanka Chopra Jonas,Sam Heughan, andCeline Dion, in her first feature film, portraying a fictionalized version of herself.
Love Againwas released in the United States on May 5, 2023, bySony Pictures Releasing.
Mira Ray and her boyfriend John are very much in love, and often communicate via flirtatious text messages. Directly after they have a loving interaction in a café, he goes outside and is promptly hit by a car before Mira's eyes.
Two years later, Mira is living outside of the city with her parents, and her sister Suzy regularly calls, trying to convince her to move back in with her. She is ultimately successful, and greets Mira with open arms.
Rob Burns is miserable, recovering from being dumped a week before his wedding. He unhappily follows his ex Elizabeth on social media. Called in to work, Rob is assigned to write a piece on Céline Dion and is warned that if he does not write about her with heart, he might be out of a job.
Given a new corporate mobile phone, Rob chats with his workmates Lisa and Billy, who encourage him to date again. However, he has become cynical about love. Simultaneously, Mira opens a box given to her by John's parents, containing clothes and the engagement ring he never had the chance to give her. A children's book author and illustrator, she is threatened by her publisher to either produce another upbeat book soon, or be blamed for an intern's dismissal and be forced to return her last advance.
Rob begins to receive private, lovesick messages from a mystery woman on the new work mobile phone. Discovering that this person has a blind date via a dating app, he goes to the bar to connect a face to the number. Believing he has spotted her, Rob is disappointed to see her leave with her date. Unbeknownst to him, Mira shortly throws the guy out of the cab for being too sexually aggressive.
Going to the interview with Céline, she detects Rob's cynicism toward love. She asks him probing questions until he opens up. Rob is encouraged by Céline to follow his heart, then he runs out of time to conduct the interview, but she encourages him to try the interview again once he has worked through his issues with dating and love.
Deciphering a text, Rob deduces the texter will be going to a specific opera at The Met, so decides to stay for all performances until he finds her. He finally finds her and introduces himself, both discovering her name is Mira Ray and exchanging personal mobile numbers.
Meeting for cheeseburgers another day, Rob and Mira continually find ways they are compatible, and are up all night talking. The next night they make dinner together at her place, she falls asleep afterwards, and he takes to the sofa. Mira freaks out when she finds Rob and Suzy getting on very well.
Rob finds Céline rehearsing, and she notes he has transformed. Mira contacts him again, they play basketball, and then spend the night together at his place. In the morning, upon discovering her texts to John on Rob's computer screen, she feels betrayed and tells Rob to never contact her again.
In lieu of writing the profile on Céline, Rob instead writes how she and her music inspired him to pursue love, which he found with Mira. He swears that Mira has transformed him and begs that she give him a second chance, proposing they meet where he first began to hear the music again. Rob's boss publicly chews him out for going against his assignment, but quietly praises him, promising him a podcast.
Rob eventually finds Mira somewhere between The Met andCentral Park. Once Rob agrees to several promises, they seal the deal with a kiss.

Screen Gemsis an American film production company owned bySony Pictures Entertainment, a subsidiary of Japanese multinational conglomerate,Sony Group Corporation.[1]TheScreen Gemsbrand has served several different purposes for its parent companies over the decades since its incorporation, initially as a cartoon studio, then a television studio, and later on as a film studio. The label currently serves as a film production that specializes in genre films, mainly horror.[2]
Screen Gems is a member of theMotion Picture Association(MPA).[3]
When producerPat Sullivancame toHarry Warnerto sign a contract with him on his andOtto Messmer's seriesFelix the Cat, he declined and instead told his soon-to-be former secretaryMargaret J. Winklerthat she should form her own company and take control of the distribution of the series. Winkler formed M.J. Winkler Productions and soon also took control ofMaxandDave Fleischer's seriesOut of the Inkwell. By 1923 she and Sullivan were arguing, and that same year the Fleischer Brothers formed their own distribution company named Red Seal. Winkler saw an unreleased short calledAlice's Wonderland, a cartoon produced and directed byWalt Disney, and became impressed with the short. The two agreed to make a series about the cartoon. In 1924,Charles Mintzmarried Winkler, and the latter's career began to decline. Mintz quickly assumed Winkler's role in the company, later rebranding it Winkler Pictures.
In 1925 Winkler's renewal contract for the Felix shorts was written, yet Winkler declined to renew due to her dispute with Sullivan. The following year theAlice Comediesstopped being distributed by Winkler. After Mintz become involved with the progress it was clear that Disney was unhappy with the production costs on cartoons, and he asked Disney andUb Iwerksto develop a new character. The result wasOswald the Lucky Rabbit, the first animated character forUniversal Pictures.[4]In February 1928, when the character proved more successful than expected, Disney sought to meet with Mintz over the budget, wanting to spend more on the cartoons. Mintz refused, and hired away all ofWalt Disney Studios's animators except Iwerks, Les Clark, and Johnny Cannon, who all refused to leave Disney. He moved the production of the Oswald cartoons to Winkler Pictures, along with Margaret Winkler's brother, George. After losing the Oswald contract toWalter Lantz, Mintz focused onKrazy Kat(a character from a comic strip by cartoonistGeorge Herriman), which was the output of a Winkler-distributed property.
M.J. Winkler Productions became known as Winkler Pictures after Mintz took over in 1926 and partnered withColumbia Picturesfor distribution in 1929. In 1931, when the studio moved from New York to California, it was renamed The Charles Mintz Studio.[5]
The Charles Mintz studio became known as Screen Gems in 1933. The name was originally used in 1933, whenColumbia Picturesacquired a stake in Charles Mintz's animation studio.[6]The name was derived from an early Columbia Pictures slogan, "Gems of the Screen"; itself a takeoff on the song "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean".[7]Mintz was nominated for twoAcademy Awardsfor Best Short Subject. His first nomination was in 1935 forHoliday Land, and he was nominated again in 1937 forThe Little Match Girl. For about a decade,Charles MintzproducedKrazy Kat,Scrappy, and theColor Rhapsodyanimated short series Columbia Pictures. Also, between 1937 to 1940, several Color Rhapsody films were subcontracted toUb Iwerkswith the use of his ownanimation studio.
The studio's color cartoons were well received, while some other cartoons were not, mainly the laterKrazy KatandScrappyshorts. Animator Isidore Klein was particularly frustrated with theKrazy Katcartoons as it bear little resemblance to Herriman's comic strip by the mid 1930s (despite attempting to make a more faithful cartoon with the 1936 shortLil' Ainjil, which Klein was disappointed by the final product).[8]Furthermore, Columbia gave Mintz strict financial obligations where they advance a certain amount of money, resulting Mintz repeatedly running intocost overruns.[9]In 1939, after becoming indebted to Columbia and suffering from declining health, Mintz relinquished ownership of his studio and the Screen Gems name to Columbia to settle longstanding financial problems.[10]He would later pass away on December 30, 1939, from a heart attack.Krazy Katwas discontinued the following year, while the Scrappy cartoons ended a year afterwards.
By 1940, Columbia would oversee management of the studio following ownership. The studio's production manager, Jimmy Bronis, became the studio head but was shortly replaced by Mintz's brother-in-law, George Winkler. The following year, Columbia decided to hireFrank Tashlin, previously a writer forWalt Disney Productionsand director forLeon Schlesinger Productions, as the studio head instead.[11]Tashlin had a profound effect to the studio as he planned to revitalize it to greater heights. There, he would hire many displaced animators from the 1941Disney animators' strike, as well as making the decision of firing the bulk of their initial in-house staff (includingArthur Davis,Manny Gould,Lou Lilly, Ben Harrison and Winkler). He would also direct the shortThe Fox and the Grapes. Based on theAesop fable of the same name, the short would inadvertently spawn Columbia's most successful characters withThe Fox and the Crow, a comic duo of a refined Fox and a street-wise Crow. Tashlin was later replaced by Ben Schwalb as producer in April 1942, but continued to work there as a creative supervisor.[12]
Tashlin proved to be very influential to his staff, as he allowed and encouraged them to pursue the wildest of ideas under his supervision. However, his stay at Screen Gems would be short-lived, as he would later leave the studio in June following an argument with Columbia higher-ups.[12][13]When interviewed by Michael Barrier, he said that the management "can't stay happy long when things are going well, so we ended up in another fracas and I left."[11]He was replaced byDave Fleischer(who produced the 1942 WWII shortSong of Victoryunder Tashlin's supervision), previously the co-founder and head supervisor ofFleischer Studios.John Hubleydescribed Fleischer as being very detached from his employees, calling him "one of the world's intellectual lightweights". He was also known for editing completed cartoons in a way that broke continuity.[14]He was later fired and succeeded by a revolving door of producers, including musician Paul Worth,Three StoogesproducerHugh McCollumand ex-Schlesinger assistants Ray Katz and Henry Binder. The studio would also create several more recurring characters around this time, includingTito and His Burrito,Flippy,Flop the Cat, Igor Puzzlewitz,Willoughby Wren,and an adaptation ofAl Capp'scomic seriesLi'l Abner, with varying levels of success.
Tashlin's departure had an immediate effect to the studio in a direction standpoint, with animation historians noting that the quality of there cartoons had declined soon after. Film historianLeonard Maltinclaimed that after Tashlin left, the studio "tried to maintain some spirit on-screen, with varying results. Screen Gems cartoons of the 1940s feature some of the least endearing cartoon characters ever created, and suffer from misguided story direction," which was seen in shorts such asMass Mouse Meeting(1943) andGiddy-Yapping(1944).[15]Hubley, who went on to directProfessor Tall and Mr. Small,He Can't Make It StickandThe Rocky Road to Ruin(all 1943) with Paul Sommer, said to have disliked his work at the studio, and that Columbia "hated" the cartoons they were making.[14]Capp was also reportedly displeased with the quality of theLi'l Abnercartoons, which was discontinued after five cartoons,[16]and the shorts produced by Katz and Binder were criticized for being "pale carbons of the Warner Brothers shorts,"[17]to the point of creating clone characters ofSylvester the Cat, andDaffy Duck, respectively.[18]
In addition to Tashlin's departure, many of the ex-Disney animators that he hired also left for other studios; the inability to hire and maintain more experienced directors and storymen, as well as Columbia's mismanagement were also argued as other key factors to the studios diminished quality. Some staff members during this period included Bob Wickersham, Alec Geiss, Sid Marcus (one of the few pre-Tashlin artists who stayed in the studio), Howard Swift andAlex Lovy.Bob Clampettwas also brought in as a gag writer before setting up his own brief animation studio forRepublic Pictures, whileLooney TunewritersMichael MalteseandTedd Piercewere said to have moonlighted for a few cartoons.[19][20]
Screen Gems was, in an attempt to keep costs low, the last American animation studio to stop producing black and white cartoons. The final black-and-white Screen Gems shorts appeared in 1946, over three years after the second-longest holdouts (Famous Studiosand Leon Schlesinger Productions). During that same year, Columbia, still dissatisfied of the studios output, decided to shut its doors for good, but continured to release a back catalog of shorts up until 1949.[21]The studio name was later repurposed for a television division, while the former Seward Street facility, which Screen Gems occupied since 1940, was taken over byWalter Lantz Productionsin 1947.[22]
The Screen Gems cartoons were regarded as ones of varying quality, comparable to those produced byFamous StudiosandTerrytoons. In spite of the studio's internal affairs, the Screen Gems' cartoons were still moderately successful, with three more cartoons achievingAcademy Awards nominations. The cartoons produced and supervised by Tashlin were also praised for his attempts at revitalizing the studio. However, Screen Gems never achieved a level of success comparable toWalt Disney Productions,Warner Bros. Cartoons,Walter Lantz Productionsand theMGM Cartoon Studio. The studio's purpose was assumed by an outside producer,United Productions of America(UPA), whose cartoons, includingGerald McBoing-Boingand theMr. Magooseries, were major critical and commercial successes. Following UPA, a deal withHanna-Barberawas made in 1957, which lasted until 1967.
In 1999,Columbia TriStar International TelevisionproducedTotally Tooned In- a syndicated TV package showcasing Columbia's classic cartoon library. With the aid of animation historianJerry Beck, Columbia restored and remastered the majority of the color Screen Gems cartoons (as well as all the UPA cartoons) from their original 35mm elements. The show aired in several international markets before making its American television debut onAntenna TVon January 8, 2011. They would later be aired onToon In With Meon theMeTVNetwork in November 2021.[23]Despite these restoration efforts,Sony Pictures Home Entertainmenthas no current plans to release these shorts on DVD or Blu-ray. Since CPE Holdings, Inc. became dormant on May 9, 2024,Sony Pictures Releasingnow owns the theatrical distribution on behalf ofColumbia Pictures, whileSony Pictures Televisionowns the television distribution on behalf of CPT Holdings, Inc. to the majority of the color Screen Gems cartoons (as well as all the UPA cartoons) library.
All series were distributed by Columbia unless otherwise noted.[24]
Ralph Cohn, the son of Columbia co-founderJack Cohnand nephew of Columbia headHarry Cohn, founded Pioneer Telefilms, a television commercial production company, in 1947. Ralph later wrote a 50-page memo arguing that Columbia should be the first major film studio to move into television. Although Harry wasn't convinced by the suggestion, Columbia invested $50,000 acquiring Pioneer and reorganized it as Screen Gems.[26]The studio started its new business in New York on April 15, 1949.[27]
By 1951, Screen Gems became a full-fledged television studio by producing and syndicating several popular shows(seebelow). Within a few months, Ralph Cohn had sold a half-hour dramatic anthology concept to theFord Motor Companywhich becameFord Theatre, which was one of the first times a major Hollywood movie studio had produced content for television. They also produced seven episodes of the first season ofCavalcade of America.[28][29]
The name "Screen Gems," at the time, was used to hide the fact that the film studio was entering television production and distribution. Many film studios saw television as a threat to their business, thus it was expected that they would shun the medium. However, Columbia was one of a few studios who branched out to television under a pseudonym to conceal the true ownership of the television arm. That is until 1955, when Columbia decided to usethe woman from its logounder the Screen Gems banner, officially billing itself as a part of "the Hollywood studios of Columbia Pictures", as spoken in announcements at the end of some Screen Gems series.
By 1952, the studio had produced a series of about 100 film-record coordinated releases for television under the brand "TV Disk Jockey Toons" in which the films "synchronize perfectly with the records".[30]
In 1954, the studio started producingFather Knows Beston CBS andThe Adventures of Rin Tin Tinon ABC, which became their biggest successes at the time.[26]
On July 1, 1956, studio veteranIrving Briskinstepped down as stage manager of Columbia Pictures and formed his own production company Briskin Productions, Inc. to release series through Screen Gems and supervise all of its productions.[31]On December 10, 1956, Screen Gems expanded into television syndication by acquiring Hygo Television Films (a.k.a. Serials Inc.) and its affiliated company United Television Films, Inc. Hygo Television Films was founded in 1951 by Jerome Hyams, who also acquired United Television Films in 1955 that was founded by Archie Mayers.[32]
During that year, the studio began syndicating Columbia Pictures' theatrical film library to television, including the series of two-reel short subjects starringThe Three Stoogesin 1957. Earlier on August 2, 1957, they also acquired syndication rights to "Shock Theater", a package ofUniversal Pictureshorror films (later shifted toMCA TV), which was enormously successful in reviving that genre.[33]
From 1958 to 1974, under President John H. Mitchell and Vice President of ProductionHarry Ackerman, Screen Gems delivered TV shows and sitcoms:Dennis the Menace,The Donna Reed Show,Hazel,Here Come the Brides,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,Gidget,Bewitched,I Dream of Jeannie,The Flying Nun,The Monkees,The Girl with Something ExtraandThe Partridge Family.
It was also the first distributor forHanna-Barbera Productions, an animation studio founded byWilliam HannaandJoseph Barberaafter leavingMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and was also the distributor of theSoupy Salesshow. The company also entered a co-production deal withCanada'sCTV Television Networkand produced several shows, many of which were filmed or taped inTorontofor distribution to Canadian stations (Showdown,The Pierre Berton Show).[citation needed]The company even expanded as far asAustralia, opening Screen Gems Australia to produce shows for that country's networks, includingThe Graham Kennedy Showfor theNine Network.[34]
In the late 1950s, Screen Gems also entered into ownership and operation of television stations. Stations owned by Screen Gems over the years included KCPX (Salt Lake City; nowKTVX, owned byNexstar Media Group),WVUE-DT(New Orleans; now owned byGray Television),WAPA-TV(San Juan; now owned by the Hemisphere Media Group),WNJU(Linden, NJ; nowTelemundo/NBCUniversalO&O), and several radio stations as well, including 50,000-watt clear channelWWVA(Wheeling, WV; now owned byiHeartMedia). As a result, in funding its acquisitions, 18% of Screen Gems' shares was spun off from Columbia and it became a publicly-traded company on the NYSE until 1968. Screen Gems also provided technical assistance and partial control of a private television station inVenezuela,Canal 11 Televisión, which existed from 1966 to 1968.[35][36]
In 1963, William Dozier, who was one of the top Screen Gems employees, and senior vice president of production left to start out Greenway Productions, with a non-exclusive agreement with the studio for joint distribution of its TV productions.[37]Even though none of Greenway's shows went to SG, Greenway immediately struck out a deal with rival television producer20th Century-Fox Televisionin 1964.[38]
In 1963, Screen Gens entered music publishing with the purchase ofDon Kirshner'sAldon Musicwith Kirshner named head of the Columbia-Screen Gems music division.  Four years later, he departed Screen Gems after coming into conflict withThe Monkeesover their desire to play on their records.Lester Sillreplaced Kirshner, and remained head of music publishing until 1985.  Screen Gems-Columbia Music was sold to EMI for $23.5 million in 1976.
From 1964 to 1969, former child starJackie Cooperwas Vice President of Program Development. He was responsible for packaging series (such asBewitched) and other projects and selling them to the networks.
For the 1965–1966 season, Screen Gems announced that they would sign three big creative programmers to develop new series, which was announced in June 1964. Among them was writerSidney Sheldon, directorHy Averback, and writerDavid Swift.[39]
In 1965, Columbia Pictures acquired a fifty per cent interest in the New York-based commercialproduction companyEUE, which was incorporated into Screen Gems and renamedEUE/Screen Gems. The studios were sold in 1982 to longtime Columbia Pictures executive George Cooney shortly after Columbia Pictures was sold toThe Coca-Cola Company.
On December 23, 1968, Screen Gems merged with its parent company Columbia Pictures Corporation and became part of the newly formed Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. for $24.5 million.[40]
In the following year, formerABCvice president of programmingLeonard Goldbergjoined Screen Gems, displacing Jackie Cooper as vice president of program development.[41]Goldberg failed to receive the same level of success as Cooper. His shows all tanked after one season, with the exception ofThe Partridge Family, and he abruptly left after three years, with the most notable other production of Goldberg's tenure at Screen Gems being the 1971 television movieBrian's Song. He then formed a production company with producerAaron Spelling.[42]
In 1971,Douglas S. Cramer, former executive VP in charge of production atParamount Television, set up a SG-affiliated production firm, The Douglas S. Cramer Company, to produce projects for feature films and TV projects via Columbia Pictures.[43]In 1972,David Gerber, who had left20th Century Fox Television, set up a SG-affiliated production company to produce his own projects with that company. The most notable of these productions wasPolice Story, an NBC police crime drama.[42]In 1973, Allan Blye andChris Beardevia Blye-Bearde Productions signed an independent production agreement with Screen Gems to develop their own projects.[44]Also that year, Harry Ackerman, who was vice president of production left the studio to start his own production company to be affiliated withParamount Television.[45]
On May 6, 1974, Screen Gems was renamed toColumbia Pictures Televisionas suggested by then-studio presidentDavid Gerber, who succeeded Art Frankel as his studio president.[46]The final notable production from this incarnation of Screen Gems before the name change was the 1974miniseriesQB VII. Columbia was, technically, the last major studio to enter television by name.
Changes in corporate ownership of Columbia came in 1982, when Coca-Cola bought the company, although continuing to trade under the CPT name.  In the mid-1980s, Coca-Cola reorganized its television holdings to create Coca-Cola Television, merging CPT with the television unit of Embassy Communications as Columbia/Embassy Television, although both companies continued to use separate identities until January 2, 1988, when it andTri-Star Televisionwere merged under the CPT name.[47]Columbia also ranColex Enterprises, a joint venture withLBS Communicationsto distribute most of the Screen Gems library, which ended in 1987.[48]In 1985, the name was brought back byColumbia Pictures Televisionto distribute classic television series from its vaults to first-run syndication.[49]
On December 18, 1987, Coca-Cola spun off its entertainment holdings and sold it toTri-Star Pictures, Inc.for $3.1 billion. It was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc., also creating Columbia/Tri-Star by merging Columbia and Tri-Star. Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names.[50]In 1989,SonyCorporation of Japan purchased Columbia Pictures Entertainment. On August 11, 1991, Columbia Pictures Entertainment was renamed asSony Pictures Entertainmentas a film production-distribution subsidiary and subsequently combined CPT with a revived TriStar Television on February 21, 1994 to formColumbia TriStar Television. The name "Screen Gems" was also utilized for a syndicated hour-long program for classic television calledScreen Gems Networkthat first aired in 1999 and ran until 2002.[51]
The television division is presently known asSony Pictures Television.

On December 8, 1998, Screen Gems was resurrected as a fourth speciality film-producing arm of Sony's Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group. It was created afterTriumph Filmsclosed.[55]Screen Gems produces and releases "films that fall between the wide-release films traditionally developed and distributed by Columbia Pictures and those released bySony Pictures Classics".[56]Many of its releases are of the horror,[2]thriller, action, drama, comedy and urban genres, making the unit similar toDimension Films(part ofLantern Entertainment),Hollywood PictureswithSearchlight Pictures(divisions ofThe Walt Disney Company), andRogue Pictures(when it was formally owned byRelativity Mediaand before that,Universal Pictures).
As of 2023,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter(2016) is Screen Gems' highest-grossing film with over $300 million dollars worldwide in box office earnings.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
