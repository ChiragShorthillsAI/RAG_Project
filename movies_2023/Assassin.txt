In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
