Under the Boardwalkis a 2023 American animatedmusicalcomedy filmdirected byDavid Soren, who co-wrote the screenplay withLorene Scafaria. The film features the voices ofKeke Palmer,Michael Cera, andBobby Cannavale. The story follows two hermit crabs from conflicting families who, after a storm casts them far from home, journey back to their community.
Under the Boardwalkhad a limited theatrical release on October 27, 2023, followed by avideo-on-demandrelease on November 7.
A community of landhermit crabsunderneath aNew Jerseybeach boardwalk often play host to a community of sea hermit crabs that come to the land for vacation and both species of crabs can't stand each other. Armen, a timid land crab, is reluctant to go out and socialize due to how his parents died in a storm when he was a child and his rotting shell, inhabited by a fun-loving organism named Anemone, is the only reminder of them. However, three muscular crabs and Armen's friends, Bobby, Manny and Jimmy, drag him to a club owned by his uncle Bruno. The crabs get into a fight with an arrogant sea crab named Mako when Armen inadvertently bumps into Ramona, a tourist sea crab he fell in love with earlier. The land crabs get evicted as a result and Armen frustratedly takes his leave. As he is sulking by the seashore, Mako and his goons come to hassle him and steal his shell. Ramona intervenes, but she and Armen get swept away in a high tide that ruins the land crab civilization.
Armen ends up in the far end of the beach and above the boardwalk where he is captured by a human collector to sell as a pet and is given an artificial shell to boot. He soon reunites with Ramona and together, they escape and work together to get back home. On their journey, they each share their insecurities, Armen for being too frightened to do anything besides stay in his shell and Ramona from wanting to get away from her overbearing mother Val, who expects perfection from her. Armen and Ramona's disappearances soon intensifies the rivalry between the land and sea crabs, mostly due to how Mako made up the story of how Armen tried to steal Ramona way from him. Bobby begins second-guessing his tendency to use physical force against his enemies and soon encounters Ramona's deaf sister Shelly looking for Ramona. However, as he walks her home, Val sends him away and when he tries to break up a fight between his friends and Mako's gang, he accidentally snaps off Mako's right arm. Mako vows revenge and claims that Armen is dead, giving them Armen's shell and a shell-shocked Anemone. The land crabs then declare war.
As Armen and Ramona fall in love, two of the crabs they met while at the pet shop begin judging them, making Armen feel hesitant about his feelings, much to Ramona's distress. Eventually, Ramona begins to get dehydrated and passes out, prompting Armen to carry her into the water, moving past the conflict between the land and sea crabs, who cease their fighting to see Armen carrying Ramona and dragging her into the water. Ramona wakes up and kisses Armen and they go back to the surface where Armen is praised for his heroism and Mako is outed as a liar. The land and sea crabs work past their differences with Mako giving Bobby a new shell as a peace offering and Armen giving his shell to a new crab who needs it more.

Paramount Animationis an Americananimation studio, serving as the animation division and label ofParamount Pictures, a subsidiary ofParamount Global.[4]The division was founded on July 6, 2011, following the box office success of Paramount's ownRangoand the end of their distribution deal withDreamWorks Animationin 2012.
The studio's first filmThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Waterwas released on February 6, 2015, and its latest release wasTransformers Oneon September 20, 2024, with their next release beingSmurfson July 18, 2025.[5]
Films produced by Paramount Animation have grossed a total of $832 million at the box office. Its highest-grossing film to date isThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, which grossed $325.1 million.
After the closure ofParamount Cartoon Studios(formerly named Famous Studios) in December 1967, Paramount distributed a few animated films from 1973 to 1992 that were produced by outside studios, includingCharlotte's Web,Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown,Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don't Come Back!!), andBebe's Kids.
In the fall of 1993, Canadian animation studioNelvanasigned a multi-year deal to produce five animated feature films in collaboration with Paramount Pictures, withKathleen KennedyandFrank Marshallproducing; the first two began production the following summer, at a cost of over US$20Â million each.[6][7]Three of the projects were based on books byE. B. White(The Trumpet of the Swan),Clive Barker(The Thief of Always) andGraeme Base(The Sign of the Seahorse); an original production calledMask Visionwas also in the works.[8]However, none of the films were produced in this deal.
Following Paramount's merger withViacom, the studio started releasing several animated films based onNickelodeon's TV shows, including theRugratsfilm trilogy,The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, andJimmy Neutron: Boy Genius; the films produced byNickelodeon Movies. The studio also released features based onMTV'sBeavis and Butt-HeadandComedy Central'sSouth Park.
In 2005, Paramount's new CEOBrad Greyconsidered building an in-house animation division, because he saw family films as the "sweet spot" of the movie business.[9]The following year, Paramount signed a distribution deal withDreamWorks Animation, starting withOver the Hedgeand ending withRise of the Guardians. During this deal, the studio released Nickelodeon Movies'Barnyardin 2006 andImageMovers'Beowulfin 2007.
On March 4, 2011, the studio released its first in-house animated film, Nickelodeon Movies'Rango. The film was critically acclaimed and grossed over $245 million at the box office. The success ofRangohelped Paramount discover its potential in making successful animated features on its own. In June of that year, the studio acquired the rights to produce an animated film based onPenny Arcade's 2010 webcomicThe New Kid.[10]
In July 2011, in the wake ofRango's success, the high hopes forThe Adventures of Tintin, and the departure ofDreamWorks Animationupon completion of their distribution contract withMadagascar 3: Europe's Most WantedandRise of the Guardiansin 2012, Paramount announced the formation of a new animation division. The studio would initially produce one animated film a year with a maximum budget of $100 million. A key portion of the films would be co-produced with Nickelodeon and they would be cross-promoted at Nickelodeon's theme parks and hotels.[4]
In October 2011, Paramount named a former president ofWalt Disney Feature Animation,David Stainton, president of Paramount Animation.[11]In February 2012, Stainton resigned for personal reasons, with Paramount Film Group's president, Adam Goodman, stepping in to directly oversee the studio.[12]It was also announced thatThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, astandalone sequelto 2004'sThe SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, would be the studio's first film and would be released in 2014. A short time after, the film was delayed to early 2015.[13]
In August 2012,Varietyreported that Paramount Animation was in the process of starting development of several animated films in collaboration with Nickelodeon,Mary Parent, andJ. J. Abrams. Besides theSpongeBobsequel, Paramount Animation considered adaptingDora the Explorer,The Legend of Korra, andMonkey Questinto films. The increase in animated film production was due to DreamWorks Animation being in talks with other studios to distribute their post-2012 animated films.[14]
On July 31, 2013, Paramount Animation announced that they were developing a new live-action/animated franchise in the vein of theTransformersseries, which was titledMonster Trucks.Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Bergerwere set to write the film's script,Chris Wedge(director of 2002'sIce Age) was set to direct the film, andMary Parentwas set to produce the film, with an initial release date set for May 29, 2015.[15]
The studio's first film,The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, was released on February 6, 2015, to positive reviews[16]and was a box office success, grossing over $325 million worldwide and becoming the fifth highest grossing animated film of 2015.[17]That same month, Paramount fired Adam Goodman due to the studio's thin film slate and Goodman greenlighting box office bombs at the studio.[18]Paramount announcedanotherSpongeBobfilmlater that year.[19]
In the summer of 2015, Paramount Pictures participated in a bidding war againstWarner Bros.andSony Pictures Animationfor the rights to produceThe Emoji Movie, based on a script byTony Leondisand Eric Siegel. Sony won the bidding war in July and released the film in 2017.[20]The studio's head Bob Bacon also left Paramount Animation that summer.[18]
In June 2015, it was revealed that Spain'sIlion Animation Studios(the studio behind 2009'sPlanet 51) won a bidding war against other animation studios to produce a 3D animated tentpole film for Paramount Animation, which was already in production since 2014.[21]In November 2015, Paramount Animation officially announced the project asAmusement Park, (later renamedWonder Park) with formerPixaranimator Dylan Brown helming. The studio also announcedMonster Trucks,The Little Prince,Sherlock Gnomes, and the thirdSpongeBobfilm.[22]
The studio's second film,The Little Prince, was released on July 29, 2015, in France. It was scheduled to be released on March 18, 2016, in the United States, but Paramount canceled the American release due to the French producers not paying an additional, previously agreed $20 million for the North American prints and advertising budget, however they still retained the distribution rights in France. It was later released ontoNetflixon August 5, 2016, as aNetflix original film.[23][24]

In March 2017,Skydance Mediaformed a multi-year partnership withIlion Animation Studios, formingSkydance Animation.[29]
In April 2017, Paramount ended its deal with Locksmith Animation when Paramount chairman and CEOBrad Greywas replaced byJim Gianopulos, who decided that their projects did not fit in with Paramount's other upcoming releases. Locksmith formed a multi-year production deal with20th Century Foxfour months later.[30][31]
In July 2017, Paramount Pictures named formerDreamWorks Animationco-presidentMireille Soriaas the president of the studio.[32]Soria restructured the studio, increasing its number of employees from 10 to over 110, and created a new goal of releasing two tentpole animated films a year with different animation styles and genres. She would also look over the completion ofSherlock GnomesandWonder Park, which were in production before her arrival. That same month, Skydance announced its first two animated feature films for Skydance Animation âSplit(later retitledSpellbound) andLuck.[33]Both films would be distributed by Paramount Pictures as part of their deal with Skydance. On October 10, 2017,Bill Damaschkewas hired to head the division as president of animation and family entertainment.[34]

On January 14, 2019, Mireille Soria announced that the team at Paramount Animation will no longer work with Skydance Animation because of their hiring of formerWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixarCCOJohn Lasseteras the head of animation.[42]LuckandSpellboundwere still going to be released by Paramount Pictures without the Paramount Animation brand[43]untilApple TV+acquired the distribution rights to both films in December 2020 and made a larger pact with Skydance Animation in February 2021.[44][45]Apple Original Filmswould replace Paramount for bothLuckandSpellbound, although the latter film would later be distributed byNetflixinstead.
The studio's sixth film,Wonder Parkwas released on March 15, 2019. It received mixed reviews[46]and it became a box office flop, grossing only $119.6 million worldwide on a budget of less than $100 million.[47]

On September 30, 2021, shortly afterBrian Robbinsreplaced Jim Gianopulos as the chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures, it was announced that Ramsey Ann Naito would replace Mireille Soria as the president of Paramount Animation in addition to her current role as the president ofNickelodeon Animation Studio.[1]
The studio's eighth filmRumblewas released on December 15, 2021, onParamount+. It was originally expected to be released in theaters on February 18, 2022, but due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, it was later moved to Paramount+. It received mixed reviews.
On January 20, 2022, Latifa Ouaou (a veteran of bothIlluminationand DreamWorks Animation viaUniversal Pictures) was hired as the executive vice president of movies and global franchises for both Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Animation Studio. In this position, Ouaou will oversee both streaming and theatrical films for the two companies. It was also revealed thatThe Tigerâs Apprentice(which was originally being directed byCarlos Baena) will now be directed byRaman Hui, with Paul Watling andYong Duk Jhunbeing co-directors.Bob Persichetti(the Academy Award-winning co-director of Sony Pictures Animation'sSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse) had also joined the film as a producer.[2]
On July 26, 2023, Robbins revealed in aVarietyarticle that the original filmUnder the Boardwalkwould be released straight to Paramount+ instead of theaters (similarRumble). He stated, âWeâre not going to release an expensive original animated movie and just pray people will come,â while also pointing to the box office underperformances of Pixar animated films such asLightyearandElemental.[55]This statement received widespread criticism on social media, including from those in the industry such asGuillermo del Toro,Jorge R. Gutierrez, andChristopher Miller.[56][57][58]This also contradicts an earlier statement by the divisionâs president Naito, who stated in aDeadlineinterview that she plans to release original animated features to continue building franchises.[59]Under the Boardwalk, the studio's ninth film was instead given a limited theatrical release under the Nickelodeon Movies imprint. It was released on October 27, 2023, with a video-on-demand release on November 7.[60]
The studio's tenth film,The Tiger's Apprentice, was released on February 2, 2024 on Paramount+, after facing several theatrical delays and its theatrical release being cancelled.[61]It received mixed reviews from critics.
On March 5, 2024, Paramount Animation signed a multi-year first-look deal with theTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant MayhemdirectorJeff Rowe. Under this deal, Rowe will produce and direct both animated and live-action films, including the 2026Mutant Mayhemsequel.[62]
The studio's eleventh film,Transformers One, was released on September 20, 2024. It received positive reviews from critics but became a financial disappointment grossing $128.9 million worldwide on a budget of $75â147 million.
If the pending merger of Paramount Global andSkydance Mediahappens,John Lasseter, who is head of Skydance Animation will become head of Paramount Animation.[63]
Initially, Paramount Animation did not have its own opening logo. Its first six features (and new features starting withTransformers One) just used the standard Paramount logo. On September 19, 2019, Paramount Animation introduced a new animated logo featuring a character nicknamed "Star Skipper".[64]When Mireille Soria came to Paramount Animation, one of the first goals set by Jim Gianopulos was to make a logo for the division. The crew wanted to put a female character in the logo because the studio's team is mostly female, and according to Soria, it captures "the magic" of the division. The logo and the character of Star Skipper were designed byCaptain Underpants: The First Epic Movielead visual development artist and art director Christopher Zibach and animated by ATK PLN andReel FX Creative Studios.[64]This logo debuted in front ofThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Runin 2020. The logo's music is the same as the standard Paramount Pictures logo, which is composed byMichael Giacchino.
Similar toWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,Illumination, andSony Pictures Animation, Paramount Animation outsources its animation production to other animation studios such as Mikros Image, Reel FX,[65]andIndustrial Light & Magic(Transformers One).Rumblewas developed outside of Paramount Animation by Reel FX, but the studio acquired the rights to the film and co-produced it.[66][67]
Like20th Century Animationwith animated films under20th Century Studios, the studio also acts as somewhat of a distribution label for animated films that are made under or acquired byParamount Pictures. The earliest case of this would be the aborted deal with Locksmith Animation.[25]Additionally,Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank, originally expected to be distributed byOpen Road FilmsandSTX Entertainment, was acquired by Paramount to be distributed under Paramount Animation, later being distributed  under Nickelodeon Movies.[5]
Paramount Animation does not have an in-house animation style. According to Mireille Soria, each film has their own unique style created by the filmmakers, which would be helped by outsourcing animation to different vendors.[68]
When Ramsey Ann Naito took charge of Paramount Animation in September 2021, she brought over the culture of theNickelodeon Animation Studio, which she describes as "artist-driven" and "creative". Both companies are now united under one team, in a move different from Disney and Universal's animation studios (Walt Disney Animation StudiosandPixarpost-Lasseterfor the former andIlluminationandDreamWorksfor the latter).[69]
All films listed are distributed byParamount Picturesunless noted otherwise.

Lorene Scafaria(born May 1, 1978) is an American filmmaker, playwright, musician, and actress. She wrote and directed the filmsSeeking a Friend for the End of the World(2012),The Meddler(2015), andHustlers(2019), as well as writing the filmNick & Norah's Infinite Playlist(2008).
Scafaria directed theSuccession(2018â2023) episodes "Too Much Birthday", "Honeymoon States", and "Living+". She earned nominations for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Seriesfor "Too Much Birthday" and "Living+", in addition to a nomination for theDirectors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing â Drama Seriesfor "Too Much Birthday".
Scafaria was born inHolmdel, New Jersey, on May 1, 1978, the daughter of Gail (nÃ©e Kiernan)[1]and Joseph Scafaria (1939â2009).[2]Her mother is a Canadian-American, while her father was an Italian immigrant fromGioia Tauro.[2][3]She has a brother named Vincent.[2]She became interested in writing when she began making a book report on a fake book every month in order to winPizza Hutgift certificates from her school.[4]By the age of 17, she had written and staged her first play inRed Bank, New Jersey.[5]After graduating fromHolmdel High Schoolin 1995, she attendedLafayette CollegeinEaston, Pennsylvania. Unable to afford the tuition fees, she soon transferred toMontclair State UniversityinMontclair, New Jersey, where she earned aBAin English with a minor in theater.[5][6]
After moving toNew York City, Scafaria wrote and directed a play at the Producer's Club Theatre calledThat Guy and Others Like Him, in which she also acted. She had a small role in the acclaimed short filmBullet in the Brain, which won awards at festivals and was produced by CJ Follini.[5]Her writing agent had still yet to find her a job, so she took on more acting roles, appearing in many theater productions in addition to films such asBig Helium DogandA Million Miles.
Seeking new representation for her writing career, she sent out queries to 20 different agents; one of the agents who replied said that they required her to move toLos Angeles. Although she did not anticipate real success with the agent, she moved there and became roommates with screenwriter Bryan Sipe, whom she had previously met while making a film in her native New Jersey.[5]Neither of their work was considered "commercial" enough by studios, so they paired up to write a children's adventure film calledLegend Has It. The screenplay was purchased byRevolution Studios; however, after the studio asked the pair to make changes to the script which Scafaria described as "far less interesting", the project was shelved.[5]
In 2005, Scafaria was hired byFocus Featuresto adapt the bookNick & Norah's Infinite Playlistinto afilm of the same name.[5]It was her ninth screenplay but her first adaptation.[7]She toldMovieMaker, "I grew up in suburban New Jersey, so I immediately identified with the characters, especially Norah. Everything from feeling uncomfortable in my own skin to having a father who's larger than life (even if only in your mind), her plight really spoke to me and seemed like it would speak to a lot of young girls. It wasn't hard to get inside the characters' headsâthe authors' voices are so strong." She said the filmBefore Sunrisewas a big inspiration for the structure of her adaptation and said that she wanted to bring a nostalgic take on the teen comedy: "It was just a real challenge to kind of bring it back to those movies that I grew up on in the '80s,John Hughesmovies andCameron Crowe."[8]
In 2012, the "Fempire" (a trio of writers consisting of Scafaria and her close friendsDiablo CodyandLiz Meriwether)[7]received theAthena Film FestivalAward for Creativity and Sisterhood.[9][10]Scafaria wrote theIraq WardocudramaSweet ReliefforParamount PicturesandThe Mighty Flynn, a spec script which she set up atWarner Brothers.[11]She also wrote the filmMan and Wife, which hadGabriele Muccinoattached to direct.[11]

She released her second album,Laughter and Forgetting, in April 2010.
In 2009, Mandate Pictures bought Scafaria's scriptSeeking a Friend for the End of the World,[12]a romantic comedy focusing on a man's quest for a meaningful connection during the apocalypse. It was the first film Scafaria also directed, and was released in June 2012. In an interview, she said, "Two people at the end of the worldâall the chaos that's around them that they're sort of wheeling throughâand obviously some people are just mowing their lawn and other people are doing heroin... but there's something to me that becomes even more romantic, and that's what I was excited to explore and see. I love relationships. I love intimate stories about people; whether it's a guy and a girl or whatever it is, I like intimate stories of people and how they relate to each other."[13]
In 2015, Scafaria wrote and directed the comedy-drama filmThe Meddler.[14]The film tells the story of a mother and daughter trying to move on with life after the loss of their husband and father. Scafaria toldThe New York Times, "There's a reason that it's all from [the daughter] Marnie's perspective because I never wanted to get a break from her. More than anything I wanted it to inspire empathy from people who might find themselves in this situation, whether it's through loss or some other circumstance that creates strife. Once I started showing people the script, that there was something so relatable about being the adult child of someone and trying to stay best friends."[15]
In 2019, Scafaria wrote and directed the crime drama filmHustlers, which was based on a 2015New Yorkmagazine article byJessica Pressler.[16]The film was a critical and commercial success. Scafaria said toVoxon the real story, "There are a lot of movies that I think have touched upon these themesâThe Wolf of Wall Streetor movies likeThe Big Shortâwhich explain [financial downturns] from the bullpen. But I'm really interested in seeing the impact that the 2008 recession had on these women who worked inWall Street's backyard." When mentioning the relationship between Destiny and Ramona, she said, "It felt like there was something more in between the linesâthe story of these two women who became friends and formed this business together, and then here they are being interviewed separately years later."[17]In a 2019 interview, the real-life stripper who went through the events of the film told her side of the story and discussed how accurate it was while praising Scafaria.[18]
Between 2021 and 2023, Scafaria directed three episodes of theHBOseriesSuccession. For its third season, she directed the episode "Too Much Birthday",[19]for which she received aDirectors Guild of America Awardnomination forOutstanding Directorial Achievement in Dramatic Series[20]as well as aPrimetime Emmy Awardnomination forOutstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[21]For the fourth and final season of the series, Scafaria directed the episodes "Honeymoon States" and "Living+",[22]with the latter earning her another nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[23]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (FullÂ list...)

She was the fourth child ofEugÃ¨ne de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with AmÃ©lie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria AmÃ©liawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and AmÃ©lie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of AmÃ©lie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich DÃ¼rck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
