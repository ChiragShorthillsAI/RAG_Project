Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieveshad its world premiere atSouth by Southweston March 10, 2023, and was released in the United States on March 31 by Paramount. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of the cast, the direction, visual effects, writing, score, humor, and tone. It grossed $208.2 million worldwide on a $150 million budget, making it abox office disappointment.[13]
Prior to imprisonment,bardEdgin Darvis served in the Harpers, an order of peacekeepers, until his wife was killed by disciples of aRed Wizardhe arrested.
Accompanied bybarbarianHolga Kilgore, Edgin attempted to make a new life for himself and his daughter Kira by turning to theft, teaming with amateursorcererSimon Aumar,roguecon artist Forge Fitzwilliam, and Forge's mysterious acquaintance Sofina. While raiding a Harper stronghold, Edgin attempted to steal a "Tablet of Reawakening" to resurrect his wife, but he and Holga were captured, though their accomplices escaped.
After two years' imprisonment in frozen Revel's End, Edgin and Holga escape toNeverwinterand learn Forge has become Lord there after its prior Lord was mysteriously incapacitated. He has been taking care of Kira, convincing her that Edgin's greed led to his arrest. It is revealed that Sofina is a Red Wizard and together they orchestrated Edgin and Holga's capture.
Sofina orders Edgin and Holga's execution, but they escape and decide to rob Forge's vault and bring Kira home during the upcoming High Sun Games, needing the tablet to prove their innocence to Kira and resurrect Edgin's wife. Edgin and Holga track down Simon to help. With his help, the group also recruits Doric, adruidwhose forest community is fighting forced logging ordered by Forge.
Aftershapeshiftinginto a fly, Doric infiltrates Forge's castle and finds the vault has magical defenses fromMordenkainen, which Simon cannot disable. He believes the magic relic, "The Helm of Disjunction," could help, and the group travels to a graveyard to ask Holga's ancestors where to find it. Simon resurrects the dead with atalismanlong enough for them to answer the group's questions. The corpses reveal they gave the Helm to Xenk Yandar, apaladinwho fled Thay, his country, when Red WizardSzass Tamturned Thayans into an undead army.
After forcing Edgin to swear to distribute any gained bounty to the people, Xenk guides the group through theUnderdarkto retrieve the Helm. With the help of a teleportation staff obtained from Holga'shalflingex-husband, they find the relic but are attacked by Thayan assassins sent by Sofina. Xenk fights them off and helps the group escape from the obesered dragonThemberchaud before departing.
Simon has trouble mastering the Helm's power, so they decide to use the staff to enter the vault during the games. Simon and Holga infiltrate the vault but find the room empty except for a magical trap. Sofina, disguised as Kira, subdues Edgin. The group is captured and forced to participate in the games, but escapes the stadium. Doric discovers Forge has loaded the treasure onto a boat and is preparing to flee. The group steals the boat for themselves and rescues Kira from Forge.
As they escape, the group realize Sofina organized the games to draw a massive crowd and turn them into an undead army using the curse that destroyed Thay. The group returns, transporting Forge's stolen riches out of the boat with the teleportation staff and spreading them across the city byhot-air balloon, drawing people out of the stadium before Sofina's spell takes effect.
Enraged at her failure, Sofina attacks the group. Simon nullifies her time-stop spell, allowing Kira to use the invisibility pendant Edgin and Holga gave her as a child to place an anti-magic bracelet on Sofina. Although the group manages to incapacitate Sofina, Holga is fatally injured. Edgin uses the tablet to bring her back to life, realizing he wanted to bring back his wife only for his own sake, while Holga had become a true part of their family. Doric expresses being open to a relationship with Simon.
Restored, the old Lord of Neverwinter declares the team heroes of the realm. Xenk sends Forge to Revel's End, where he fails to escape as Edgin and Holga did when his pardon is denied.

In May 2013,Warner Bros. PicturesandCourtney Solomon's Sweetpea Entertainment announced a film based onDungeons & DragonswithDavid Leslie Johnson-McGoldrickwriting the script andRoy Lee, Alan Zeman, and Solomon producing.[30]Two days later,Hasbroissued a lawsuit saying that they were co-producing aDungeons & Dragonsfilm atUniversal PictureswithChris Morganwriting and directing.[31][32][33][34][35]In August 2015, after U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee urged Sweetpea Entertainment and Hasbro to settle thefilm rightscase, the Warner Bros. film was set for pre-production with Hasbro.[36]In March 2016,Rob Lettermanwas in negotiations to direct Johnson-McGoldrick's script,[37]with his role confirmed in May 2016.[38]In April 2017, actorJoe Manganiello, an avid fan ofDungeons & Dragons, revealed that he had written a script with John Cassel for the project and was "talking to all the right parties" to make the film happen.[39]Upon completing the script, Manganiello worked in collaboration withBrad PeytonandDwayne Johnson, who were both in negotiations to develop the film.[40]
In December 2017, after varying degrees of progression, the film wasmovedby Hasbro toParamount Picturesand was scheduled for a release date of July 23, 2021.[41]In February 2018, Paramount was in talks with bothChris McKayandMichael Gilioto direct and write the film, respectively.[42]In March 2019, it was revealed that Gilio had completed a first draft and studio executives expressed excitement for the film. The studio began negotiations with various talent, as the casting process began.[43]In July 2019,Jonathan GoldsteinandJohn Francis Daleywere in talks to direct.[44]Goldstein and Daley began meeting with Paramount following Daley talking about his career with aliterary agentat asports barinSherman Oaksduring a game between theChicago Cubs, which Daley is a fan of, and theLos Angeles Dodgers. After saying to the agent that he and Goldstein had left directing duties onThe Flash, the agent asked if they were looking for work. The agent tipped off Paramount, who presented Goldstein and Daley with the script forDungeons & Dragons.[45]
In June 2016,Ansel Elgortwas in talks to star in Letterman's iteration of the film.[46]In December 2020,Chris Pinewas cast to star in the film.[47]Michelle Rodriguez,Justice Smith, andRegé-Jean Pagewere added in February 2021.[48][49]Hugh GrantandSophia Lilliswould join the next month, with Grant cast as the antagonist.[50]In April,Chloe Colemanjoined the ensemble cast.[51]In May,Jason WongandDaisy Headjoined the cast.[52][53]During post-production,Bradley Cooperwas cast in a cameo role. He filmed his part on blue screen and was inserted into preexisting footage shot with Rodriguez.[54]
By January 2020, Goldstein and Daley announced that they had co-written a new draft of the script.[55][56]Ultimately, Daley, Goldstein, and Gilio received screenplay credit, while McKay and Gilio received story credit.[57]The film is set in theForgotten Realmscampaign setting ofDungeons & Dragons.[58][2]Goldstein stated that "ours is a movie that doesn't take itself with great seriousness, but it's never a spoof. It honors the world ofD&Dand celebrates it but, hopefully, it gives the audience an engaging and fun ride".[59]Daley commented that the film's influences includeThe Princess Bride,Monty Python and the Holy Grail,The Lord of the Rings, andIndiana Jones, with theIndiana Jonesstructure evoking both a "dungeon crawl" and theheist filmgenre that they wanted to draw on. Daley highlighted that the heist genre is familiar to the audience, which provides the framework for the "uninitiated" so that "they understand what our characters are setting out to do without being overwhelmed by lore or proper nouns".[59]Daley also wanted the film to be accessible for those unfamiliar with thefantasygenre.[60]The Austin Chroniclehighlighted "since the basis of most tabletop campaigns is a group of strangers coming together to complete a job, the thematic parallels between heist movies and fantasy roleplaying campaigns offer a shared language for newcomers".[60]
Goldstein commented that they use the sorcerer character in the film to address why magic can't "solve all problems"—"it makes storytelling nearly impossible if you can solve any problem with a magical spell".[59]Goldstein stated that when discussing the visual presentation of the film with Daley that they decided they didn't want "two people standing there with their hands out and rays coming out of their hands".[60]As a result, the film pulls directly from themagic system ofDungeons & Dragonswith magic users "combining physical components and verbal spellcasting to show a variety of magical effects onscreen".[60]Justice Smith, who plays the sorcerer, commented that he worked with the choreographer "to create unique gestures for each spell" with many of the spells incorporating actualsign languageinto the gestures.[61][62]
Filming began in early April 2021, with a crew of 60–70 people inIceland.[63]Principal photographycommenced inBelfast,Northern Irelandlater that month.[64][65]Goldstein stated that when the cast arrived in Northern Ireland they "played a several-hours-long game ofD&D" with the actors role-playing as their film characters which "gave those who were not familiar with [D&D] a quick taste of what the game is like and how you interact".[59]This game "also informed the directors' takes on the characters" with Goldstein commenting that "I think we incorporated some of the things we learned from that game into the film".[59]On August 19, 2021, Daley announced that filming had completed.[66]The visual effects are provided byIndustrial Light & Magic,Moving Picture Companyand Crafty Apes.[67]
Lorne Balfescored the film; Balfe stated "I used to play Dungeons, so when I heard they were making that, I knew I wanted to be part of the team".[68]On March 10, 2023,Tame Impalareleased the single "Wings of Time" for the film.[69][70]Marisa Mirabal, forIndieWire, wrote that "Balfe heightens the tension with a unique mixture of verbal chanting and rhythmic beats that properly enhance the meticulous stuntwork. The score morphs into a creature of its own and is unlike the soothing, sweeping scores of other fantasy films. Balfe also successfully leans into the bard lore of Pine's character by composing songs that are light-hearted, poetic, and heavy with string instruments".[71]The soundtrack album for the film was released on March 31, 2023, byMercury Classics Soundtracks & Scoreslabel.[72]
On March 19, Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez revealed that the track "l'Emprise" appearing onMylène Farmer'seponymous albumwill be on the soundtrack in French-speaking countries.[73]

After the premiere at South by Southwest, A.A. Dowd atChronnoted that "the reaction at theParamount Theatrelast night suggests that this could be a bigger hit than plenty have predicted, if word of its canny exploitation of the Marvel model travels fast and far."[112]In the United States and Canada,Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieveswas released alongsideA Thousand and OneandHis Only Son, and was projected to $30–40 million from 3,850 theaters in its opening weekend.[10][11]The film made $15.2 million on its first day, which included $5.6 million in advance screenings in the week leading up to its release, with $4.1 million coming from Thursday previews.[113]It went on to debut to $37.2 million, topping the box office; 61% of the opening weekend audience was male and 63% was between 18 and 34 years old.[114]The film made $13.9 million in its second weekend (a drop of 62%), finishing in third.[115]In its third weekend, the film grossed $7.5 million, a decline of 46% from the previous weekend.[116]Kayleena Pierce-Bohen ofScreen Rantcalled the film a "box office bomb" and said that the film's disappointing profits were due to poor marketing of the film, tough competition withThe Super Mario Bros. Movie, and the fans boycotting the companiesWizards of the CoastandHasbro.[117]
Outside of the US and Canada, the film grossed $33 million from 60 markets in its first weekend.[118]In its second weekend,Honor Among Thievesgrossed $15.5 million, for a drop of 45%.[119]The film earned another $13.8 million from 64 markets in its third weekend.[120]

Nicholas Barber, forBBC, stated that "fantasy adventures might be getting ever more gloomy and portentous on television, but the producers ofDungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieveshave followed the Marvel Studios tactic of hiring comedy directors to make a blockbuster [...]. The film they've made is a feelgood, family-friendly caper, which is not a description you can apply to HBO'sHouse of the Dragonor Amazon'sThe Rings of Power". Barber commented that Goldstein and Daley went for "a bright, snappy heist movie" instead of "an epic odyssey".[123]Christian Holub, forEntertainment Weekly, highlighted that adapting theDungeons & Dragonsgame is different from adapting "novels byJ.R.R. TolkienorGeorge R.R. Martin" as "the goal is to capture anexperiencerather than a specific story—andDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thievesdelightfully nails the fun of role-playing as fantasy characters with your friends".[124]Rafael Motamayor, forPolygon, commented that the film feels like the "latest session" in a years-longDungeons & Dragonscampaignand thatHonor Among Thieves"does a great job of capturing the different tones players might experience in their own campaigns, from horror to campy fun, and from epic high fantasy to a thrilling heist".[125]Linda Codega ofIo9called it a "solid film"—"the comedy is a little rushed, but the jokes all land" and "the characters mostly come together as charming iterations of classic D&D classes".[126]John Kirk atOriginal Cinwrote thatDungeons & Dragonsis a "shared and collaborative storytelling" game where the players via role-playing "respond to a presented setting and antagonists and other characters by the Dungeon Master.Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thievesmanages to present all of these aspects so well that you can see theD&Dplayers in the audience actually miming the rolling of dice".[127]
Benjamin Lee, forThe Guardian, wrote that "the script does a solid job of making it an accessible world to those not already steeped in it although Goldstein and Daley, writing alongside Michael Gilio, are less effective with the film's many attempts at comedy. It's a shame as the cast are game and Pine and Rodriguez have a fizzy platonic chemistry but it's just never as funny as it should be despite ample set-ups".[128]G. Allen Johnson at theSan Francisco Chronicleasserted, "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thievesfeels like Daley and Goldstein, who also co-wrote with Michael Gilio, askedChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI: 'Write a Marvel movie except withDungeons & Dragonscharacters.' Seconds later, this spit out."[129]Katie Walsh at theLos Angeles Timesopined that "Aside from its clunky title,Dungeon[s] & Dragons: Honor Among Thieveshas a relaxed, loose energy that puts the viewer at ease" and "yet there is some ineffable quality lacking—perhaps an emulsifying ingredient—that prevents all these elements (the stars, the lore, the creatures) from coming together into something truly magical. Maybe on the next roll of the 20-sided die."[130]Glen Weldon, forNPR, commented that "the film's plot is purely, ruthlessly episodic—it comes down to a series of fetch quests [...]. But to complain about the number of fetch quests in a D&D film would be like complaining that a movie about Scrabble features too much spelling".[131]Richard Lawson, forVanity Fair, also highlighted that the film is structured around a series of quests and the "new sidekicks" who are picked up along the way.[132]Lawson wrote that "the film is stuffed with all manner of mythology and moves at frenzied pace, sometimes wobbling in its speed and density but usually regaining control just before things topple into irksome incoherence".[132]
On the cast, Weldon highlighted that Pine's Edgin is "a character who not only rides the razor's edge between charm and smarm but who sets up housekeeping there" and Grant's Forge evokes similar smarm to Grant's character inPaddington 2. He commented that "Rodriguez doesn't get the chance to do a lot that you haven't seen Michelle Rodriguez do before, but she remains great at it" and Page as a paladin "nails the necessary hauteur and supreme confidence while layering them with a guileless sincerity that turns his character into a weapon aimed at Pine's character's every insecurity".[131]Holub highlighted that the cast "seem to be having fun" and "what's especially welcome about the humor inHonor Among Thievesis that it doesn't wink or mock its material; the characters just say funny things and bounce off each other as organically as a real-life friend group".[124]Codega stated that "there's not a poor performance out of the group".[126]However, Johnson felt that characters were "thinly written and predictable" resulting in the actors "playing pleasing versions of themselves. They are merely foreground; it's the green screens behind them that provide the manufactured magic".[129]Multiple critics referred to the character of Xenk as an "NPC" who helped move the plot along.[133][134][135]In terms of visuals, Barber highlighted that neither the architecture nor the clothing are attempting to evoke a specific "historical period" but instead "the designers simply stick in whichever castles and costumes seem cool".[123]Barber was more critical of the film's special effects stating that theCGI"doesn't convince you for a second that the characters are in an actual dungeon or facing an actual dragon".[123]In contrast, Codega praised the blend of practical effects andVFX.[126]Kirk commended the film's CGI stating that "the magic is rich, and the effects do not disappoint".[127]Motamayor also highlighted the unique "portrayal of magic" in the film.[125]
In an interview withPolygonin April 2023 on the potential for a film sequel, Daley stated that "it was never our intention when we came on board this film to make a franchise".[143]Goldstein commented that they would continue with the characters established inHonor Among Thievesif they returned to theD&Dworld—"the audience knows them, and you can jump into the plot more quickly. And obviously, we have great affection for both the actors and these roles that they play. But we'd want to introduce some new figures along the way".[143]
In July 2023, Paramount Pictures CEOBrian Robbinsstated in an interview withVarietythat a sequel could still happen, on the condition that it be produced on a smaller budget due to the disappointing box-office reception of the film.[144]
In February 2022, aspin-offtelevision series was announced to be in development. A part of a "multi-pronged approach" for television projects, the show is described as the "flagship" and "cornerstone" live-action series of the multiple projects in development; while the series is to "complement" the film side of the franchise.Drew Crevellowas set to serve as executive producer and showrunner for the series, whileRawson Marshall Thurberwrote and directed thepilot episode.[145]Various networks and streaming companies bid on distribution rights.[146]In January 2023, it was announced thatParamount+gave the show a straight-to-series order that consists of eight episodes, withEntertainment One(eOne) andParamount Picturesserving as the production companies.[147]However, in May 2024, Paramount+ announced that they were no longer moving forward with the series.[148][149]Deadlinereported that the series will now be overseen "by Hasbro's in-house division Hasbro Entertainment following eOne's December 2023 sale to Lionsgate" with a new creative team and "will undergo a creative update before being taken out to other potential buyers".[148]

Lionsgate Canadais a Canadian entertainment company and a subsidiary ofLionsgate Studios. Based inToronto, the company is primarily involved in the acquisition and production of films and television series.
The company began on June 1, 1970 as the Canadian music distributorRecords on Wheels Limited. After it was acquired by music retailer CD Plus, the company becameROW Entertainment; with its vice president of operationsDarren Throopbecoming president and CEO. ROW later acquired American music and home entertainment distributorKoch Entertainment. By 2007, the company—now known asEntertainment One—had begun to acquire other production companies and film distributors including Canadian distributorsLes Films SévilleandAlliance Films. By 2015, eOne had begun to expand its American operations, including investing inAmblin Partners, and acquiring a stake inThe Mark Gordon Company.
On December 30, 2019, eOne was acquired by American toy and entertainment companyHasbrofor US$4 billion. The company saw cutbacks under Hasbro, which sold eOne's original music distribution business (nowMNRK Music Group) toBlackstoneon April 26, 2021, and closed its theatrical distribution operations in Australia, Canada, Spain, and the United Kingdom on June 29, 2022, and July 17, 2023. The cutbacks were part of a planned sale of entertainment assets not strongly tied to eOne's children's entertainment brands, such asPeppa Pig, which would be folded into Hasbro'sintellectual propertyand merchandising business following the acquisition.
On August 3, 2023, Hasbro announced that it would sell eOne's assets toLionsgate(another Canadian-founded business, now known as Starz Entertainment) for $500 million. The deal closed on December 27, 2023.[3][4]The company's assets would then be restructured, with the main division initially becomingeOne Canadabefore adapting its current name.eOne Filmswas placed underLionsgate Films, while eOne Television merged with other assets intoLionsgate Television, with eOne's unscripted production assets being transferred to the newly formedLionsgate Alternative Television.[5][6][7]

The combined company later became known asROW Entertainment, with Throop as president and CEO. The company listed itself on theToronto Stock Exchangeas anincome trust, meaning that its taxes were paid by its shareholders, rather than the company itself.[11][12][13][14]
On June 1, 2005, it acquired the U.S. independent music distributor and home entertainment publisherKoch Entertainment.[15][13]Afterwards, it was re-incorporated asEntertainment One Income Fund. On March 29, 2007, the company accepted a $188 million public equity takeover by Marwyn Investment Management to fund its expansion; the company was listed on London'sAlternative Investment Marketas Entertainment One Ltd.[16]
On June 14, 2007, Entertainment One acquired Montreal-based film distributorSeville Picturesand British distributor Contender Entertainment Group;[17][18]Contender Entertainment Group included a short lived publishing division, Contender Books, based in London.[19][20][21]The same year, the company secured its first film output agreement withSummit Entertainment, handling distribution in Canada and the United Kingdom.[11][22]Acquisitions continued on January 9, 2008 with the purchase of the Benelux distributor RCV Entertainment.[23]The same year, Entertainment One acquired the television studios Blueprint and Barna-Alper, and international television distributor Oasis International.[24][25]Also on July 4, 2008, the company listed itself on theLondon Stock Exchange.[11]

The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
