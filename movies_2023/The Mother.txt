While the Mother is being interrogated at asafe houseby FBI Special agent William Cruise, Lovell attacks the property; Cruise is shot and wounded, and the other FBI agents are killed. The Mother saves Cruise's life and crafts a time-delayedbomb. Lovell confronts her in the bathroom and stabs her in the womb before getting knocked out and burned by the explosion. After the ordeal, the Mother gives birth to a girl prematurely in the hospital.
SAICEleanor Williams informs the Mother that Lovell's body was missing and that her newborn daughter will be placed with a foster family for protection. Understanding that the child will never be safe with her, she waives parental rights. The Mother visits Cruise, giving him three conditions: the child will have a life as ordinary as possible, she'll get a photo every birthday, and to call her if she is in jeopardy. The Mother then moves to a remote cabin inAlaskawith the help of her former army colleague, Jons.
Twelve years later, Cruise contacts her to meet inOhio. He informs her that when theATFbusted some of Álvarez's men inMexico, they found a photo of her daughter, Zoe, suggesting they're onto The Mother. While Cruise and the Mother are shadowing Zoe playing at a park, Álvarez's men kidnap Zoe. The Mother manages to gun down several of them before escaping the cops with Cruise. While he thinks Zoe's kidnapping is for ransom, she knows it was done to lure her out of hiding.
They head toHavana, Cubain hopes of uncovering a clue to Zoe's whereabouts. They catch Tarantula, Álvarez's lieutenant, who reveals under interrogation that she is being held at Álvarez's house on "the Plantation". Infiltrating his heavily-guarded home, they rescue Zoe.

While escorting Zoe back home, the Mother's gaze upon her makes Zoe realize that she is her biological mother. The Mother decides to part ways and let Cruise return her to her foster parents. Lovell manages to intercept them, but the Mother arrives and escapes with Zoe. Angered, Lovell kills Cruise.
Realizing Zoe is not safe if she returns home, the Mother takes her to the cabin. Over time, she teaches the reluctant girl training insurvival skills, self-defense and small arms. They start to bond but when the Mother learns Lovell and a group of mercenaries is coming for them, she decides to leave Zoe with Jons. Upset to know she's being abandoned again by her own mother, Zoe is comforted by Jons, who encourages her to see the Mother through her actions and not her words. After she finds a letter from the Mother, explaining everything she has ever done has been for her, Zoe decides to go back to the cabin and help her mother defend herself from the attackers.
Lovell and his men have a final confrontation with the two. The Mother manages to kill all of Lovell's men before finally facing him. After she is knocked out during a hand-to-hand fight with Lovell, he grabs Zoe and speeds away, but the Mothersnipesand kills him.

Linked page for 'Niki Caro' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niki_Caro):
Nikola Jean CaroMNZM(born 20 September 1966) is a New Zealand film, television, and music video director andscreenwriter. Her 2002 filmWhale Riderwas critically praised and won a number of awards at internationalfilm festivals.[1]She directed the2020 live action versionof Disney'sMulan, making her the second woman and the second New Zealand director hired byDisneyto direct a film budgeted at over $100 million.[2]Caro's works ranged from music videos, commercials, television dramas, and films, etc.
Caro was born inWellington, New Zealand. She attended Kadimah College, Auckland, thenDiocesan School for Girls, where she received an alumni award.[3]Caro graduated with a BFA from theElam School of Fine Artsat theUniversity of Aucklandin 1988 and received aPostgraduateDiplomainFilmfrom theSwinburne University of TechnologyinMelbourne,Victoria, Australia.[4][5]
Caro first found interest in working with metalsculptures, but later turned her interests toward film. She did not receive any formal training in the field, but instead began by reading narrative film books and writing rough drafts for scripts. Caro's mother would type her handwritten drafts after she finished writing each one.[6]
Caro's first experience in directing was when she was hired to create commercials for different companies such as theNew Zealand Land Transport Safety Authority,NikeandTower Insurance, but it was only after being signed by a production company to write and direct for the television series,Another Countrythat she had her first breakthrough. She did not have any experience in directing, but it felt it was instinctual once she started working with the actors.[6][5]
Caro's work also includes short films, an award-nominated episode of Kiwi TV seriesJackson's Wharf, and a number of music videos — including an award-winning interpretation ofStraitjacket Fitssingle "Bad Note for a Heart" which was later judged Best Music Video at the 1990New Zealand Music Awards.
Her focus then turned into TV dramas after producer Owen Hughes invited her to contribute to a trilogy of half-hour TV dramas in 1992.The Summer the Queen Came,which was contributed by Caro, earned three nominations at the 1994NZ Film and Television Awards. Notably, Caro's other works:Sure To RiseandLemming Aidwere selected to compete at theCannes Film Festivalin France.[7]
Caro's earlier works were intentionally depicting women's search for life goals, relationships, and desires. Her acclaimed dramaPlain Tasteswas about a middle-class woman searching for the ultimate happiness and love and was nominated for "Best Television Drama" and "Best Writer" at the 1996NZ Film and Television Awards.
Along with her productions of television dramas, she has also made documentaries, including her short filmOld Bastards(1994) andFootage(1996), "that seemed at times to have been infected by fiction."[8]
Caro's first feature film,Memory & Desire, was meant to be a showcase of New Zealand's culture and lifestyle (aligning with the start of the 100% Pure New Zealand tourism campaign by the New Zealand tourism section of the government), but it fell short; seeing disappointing results at the box office and mixed international reviews.[9]This was especially true inJapan, where the film was deemed to have not captured the essence of Japanese culture, despite its attempts to evoke money and consult from possible Japanese investors.[10]The film is meant to use landscapes to juxtapose the characters and their origins. The calm and relaxed outdoor setting of New Zealand is meant to oppose the hustle and bustle of the big, busy city ofTokyo. It works twofold because the contrast also works for the comparison of the "civilized" parts of New Zealand against the wild outdoors, showing off the two different sections of the country in an effort to advertise to multiple groups of people considering visiting the country. The tourism board looked to use landscapes as the most enticing factor in a tourist's eyes, along with people, adventure and culture.[11]The film shows evidence of this by implying that Keiji and Sayo are unable to consummate their marriage anywhere but in the outdoors due to Keiji being unable to achieve an erection in an urban setting, emphasizing the "natural" state of humanism of being connected to the surrounding landscapes.[10]Along the couple's trip they encounter different New Zealand tourist hotspots such as; the Museum of Technology and Rotorua's spa pools on the West Coast Beach. It is also in contrast of the bland hotel rooms that the couple stay in; as if to say that the only time they are truly free is when they are outside in nature, specifically New Zealand's nature.[10]
It was chosen for Critics' Week at Cannes week in 1998.[12]In 1999 the film was voted best new film at theNew Zealand Film Awards.[citation needed][13]
Caro went on to write and directWhale Rider, which is about aMāorigirl that has to stand up against her grandfather and the other men in the tribe to show she can be as much of a leader as the boys who were being trained to be leaders. This film is the reproduction of the bookWhale Rider, while according to the authorWiti Ihimaera, this book is the one "that the Māori community accepts best, and a response to theKatherine Mansfieldcentenary celebrations which rewrites her stories from a Māori perspective."[14]However, in order to strengthen her idea on women development and bringing out women's position in the society, Niki Caro intelligently modified this  retelling of a Maori legend.
Caro argues thatWhale Rideris more about leadership than sexism because the Māori are also profoundly matriarchal. Caro says there is a Māori saying that "women lead from behind".[15]She directed thirteen-year-oldKeisha Castle-Hughesto a performance nominated for anOscar for Best Actress. The film had a budget of $2 million,[9]which is considered small for a major film, but it was still considered to be a good interpretation of the indigenous story that it was trying to interpret and demonstrate.Whale Riderwould also go on to become New Zealand's most financially successful film and either the film, or Caro herself, would win or be nominated for over 50 different awards by different, international film festivals.[5]
With the success ofWhale Riderunder her belt, Caro was chosen to direct her firstHollywoodfilm,North Country(2005), starringCharlize Theron. [article] This is another story of a female being told things she couldn't manage due to gender stereotypes. Pointing to the sexual harassment issues existing in the workplace, Caro was inspired by a landmark American court case in which the  a woman in a remote mining town dares to stand up against major forces. The role played byCharlize Theron, Josey Aimes, is based on Lois Jenson, who endured thirteen years of harassment before filing her first lawsuit, which was known asJenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.Based on this true story and the previous book "Class Action: The Story of Lois Jensen and the Landmark Case That Changed Sexual Harassment Law", Caro challenged herself to make this piece of work with intentions in presenting women's journey of feminist equality. Caro argued that despite being warned about the challenges of working with a Hollywood studio as a female filmmaker calling for women's rights, funders Warner Brothers "couldn't have been more respectful of my creative choices". It was later nominated for Best Actress for lead and supporting role at theOscars, and also was nominated for aGolden Globe.[16]
The Zookeeper's Wifewas released in 2017 based on thenon-fiction book of the same namewhich recounts the true story of the couple, Jan and Antonina Żabiński, who secretly sheltered Jews during the German invasion of Poland from 1939 to 1945 on their premises of the Warsaw Zoo. The original composition of this writing piece was imbued with female's energetic contributions, mainly created by the female author, Diane Ackerman, and other female artists. Furthermore, with a script by "Snow Flower and the Secret Fan" scribe Angela Workman, Caro tended to bring out female's significant position and fill the gender gap even further. "Along with Caro, Workman and Ackerman, "The Zookeeper's Wife" features a slew of female producers (Diane Levin, Kim Zubick and Katie McNeill), a female camera operator (Rachael Levine), a female stunt coordinator (Antje "Angie" Rau), a female production designer (Suzie Davies), a female set decorator (Charlotte Watts) and that's just the start."[17]Caro claimed that she didn't meant to create a "big conspiracy of women", but only hired all best people assigning to different roles in the production ofThe Zookeeper's Wife, while they intuitively are best fits for the various positions.
After doingNorth Country, Caro went back to New Zealand to write and direct the feature filmThe Vintner's Luck(2009), which is about a peasant winemaker who sets out to make the perfect vintage wine.[18]The film reunited her with herWhale RiderstarKeisha Castle-Hughes.
In 2013, Caro planned to direct the film adaptation ofThe Zookeeper's Wife, based onDiane Ackerman's non-fiction book.[19]It was released in 2017 and received generally mixed to positive reviews.[20]In an interview withFF2 Media, Caro states that "female sexuality from a female's point of view is rather under-explored in cinema" and so felt it necessary to include such a perspective in her film.[21]
Caro directedMcFarland, USAstarringKevin Costner. It was released in February 2015 and has received a critical success.[22][23]Caro will also be writing and directing the biographical filmCallas, about the famous opera singerMaria Callasand her relationship with billionaireAristotle Onassis.[24]
In 2016, Marvel has decided to hire women filmmaker to direct the Super Hero movieCaptain Marvel, while Caro was one of the contenders withJennifer Kent.[25]Later, she has rather been designated as directing a live action adaptation of 1998 animated hitMulan.[26]In February 2017, Caro was hired to directDisney'slive-action adaptationofMulan, which was released in 2020, to mixed reviews.Mulanwas nominated by the 46thSaturn Award for Best Director. She is the second woman at the studio to direct a film budgeted at over $100 million, afterAva DuVernay(2018'sA Wrinkle in Time),[27]and the second New Zealander, afterTaika Waititi(2017'sThor: Ragnarok).
On 18 November 2019, Caro will direct multiple episodes ofAmazonTV seriesDaisy Jones and the Sixwhich is based on novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid and produced by Reese Witherspoon.[28]
Caro is married to architect Andrew Lister, and they have two daughters, Tui and Pearl.[29]Their first daughter was born shortly after the success ofWhale Rider. Because Caro was pregnant, she was unable to attend any of the premieres for the film. Caro said she was sad, but at the same time thought it may not be such a bad thing because success in America is so radical.[30]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
