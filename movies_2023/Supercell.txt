Bill and Quinn Brody are legendary storm chasers. When they have a child, William, Quinn decides to stay home and monitor the situations while Bill goes on the storm chases. During a storm chase, Quinn pleads with Bill to get out of the "bears cage" as the system is exploding. However he ignores her and he and two college students are killed by the tornado.
Several years later, Quinn is a house cleaner living in Florida assisted by the teenage William. William has been friends for years with Harper, who is teaching him how to drive. She also longs to be his girlfriend. William has interest in storm chasing which Quinn is trying to discourage. One day he goes to the roof of his high school during a thunderstorm with an instrument invented by his parents that is supposed to find tornadoes by a sound frequency, and is subsequently expelled. After receiving his parents chase log in the mail from his dad's former chase partner Roy Cameron who was like an uncle to William, William hitchhikes to Texas to the return address on the envelope. When he meets up with Roy, Roy at first wants to send him home, but acquiesces for him to tag along on a chase.
William finds out that Roy is an employee of Brody Storm Chase Tours, operated by the acerbic Zane Rogers who uses the legend of the Brody name to lure clients into purchasing tours. He grudgingly allows William along with the other "tourists" and is shown to be a risk-taker. When they are near a super cell, he tells Roy to pull off the road into a muddy field where they witness a tornado forming in the distance. However another part of the storm forms right over them and they take shelter in the van which is stuck in the mud as it is pelted with large hail. The damage to the van forces Roy to head to a garage a couple hours away to retrieve their back-up vehicle. Meanwhile Quinn has contacted Roy as she figures William is with him. She and Harper head west in Harper's car to track him down.
When Roy returns with the back-up van, he and Zane are forced to leave William behind at a gas station when a super cell forms nearby. However, a tornado forms right over the gas station and William rides it out in a phone booth. When the press shows up to interview William, Zane attempts to use the spotlight to promote his storm chasing tour, causing Roy to punch him and then quit. Roy and William head to a warehouse where William shows Roy the tornado frequency instrument, while Roy shows him his dad's original storm chasing vehicle. They then go witness what it looks like at night in the back of a super cell and it's incredible lightning display.
The next morning as many chase crews congregate at a diner, Roy tells William that his mom is coming to get him and he is to stay there and wait for her. When Roy leaves the table, William sneaks out and joins with Zane and his latest storm tourists. They head to an area where a large super cell is forming, and when Quinn and Harper arrive at the diner they head after them with Roy. Zane stops the van on a hill and when William walks a distance away from the van, the tornado frequency instrument reveals a tornado bearing down on them. With the van stuck in the mud, William who barely knows how to drive, drives the van in reverse as Zane pushes it out of the mud and is subsequently sucked into the tornado. Continuing to drive in reverse, William narrowly escapes the tornado and just misses hitting the vehicle containing Roy, Quinn and Harper by turning the van's emergency lights on.
Running low on gas and with another large tornado heading towards them, Roy, Harper, Quinn, William and the storm tourists head for shelter in a nearby town. While others head for the underground shelter, William goes back to the van to retrieve his father's chase log. Quinn, Roy and Harper go after him and are cut off from the shelter by the approaching tornado. They dive into a swimming pool and survive underwater despite the van being tossed into the pool.
The next morning William and Harper confirm their romantic feelings for each other and Quinn tells William how proud his father would be as the van is fished out of the pool.

Anne Celeste Heche was born on May 25, 1969, inAurora, Ohio, the youngest of five children of Donald "Don" Joe Heche andNancy Heche(néePrickett).[13][14]During her early childhood, the Heche family lived in various towns around Ohio, including suburbs ofClevelandandAkron.[15]Heche's parents werefundamentalist Christiansand the family was raised in a deeply religious environment,[16][17][18]a situation that she later likened to being "raised in acult".[19]At the same time, her father led an unstable lifestyle, often changing professions and prone to frequentget-rich-quick schemes,[20][21]though also with a real gift for music that led to jobs as achoir directorin several churches.[20][22]Heche noted in her memoir that her family changeddenominationsseveral times depending on which church her father found work in.[23]
Because of Don Heche's often unstable lifestyle and financial situation, the family moved numerous times during her childhood.[16][17][24]One of his financial schemes led the family to resettle in theAtlantic City, New Jersey, area in 1977, first inVentnor Cityand laterOcean City.[24][25][26]One of Anne's first jobs was at aboardwalkhamburger stand, where she would sing songs fromAnnieto attract customers.[24][27]
The Heche family's precarious financial situation led to theforeclosureof a home her father owned and later theirevictionfrom a rental home. They moved in with a family from their church who offered them a place to live as an act of charity.[28][29]Anne's motherseparatedfrom her father and demanded he leave the household. Her mother and all of the children then took jobs to support the family and be able to live on their own.[17]Anne found work at adinner theaterinSwainton, her first professional acting job, earning $100 a week (about $300 per week in 2022 dollars).[24][30][31]
Don Heche moved toNew York City, where Anne and her sisters would occasionally visit him, noticing his declining health. He claimed it was cancer, when in fact he had developed late-stageAIDS. Although he lived as a gay man in New York, Don kept his sexuality and the nature of his illness from his family. They did not know about his diagnosis and had not even heard of AIDS until coming across an article on the disease inThe New York Timesabout a month before his death.[32][33][34]Don died from AIDS-related complications on March 3, 1983, aged 45.[35]In a 1998 interview, Anne reflected that her father beingclosetedultimately "destroyed his happiness and our family. But it did teach me to tell the truth. Nothing else is worth anything."[36]
Three months after her father's death, Anne's 18-year-old brother Nathan was killed in a car crash when his vehicle missed a curve and struck a tree.[31][37]The remainder of her immediate family subsequently moved to Chicago to be closer to other family members.[38][39]Anne, her mother and her older sister Abigail, who had left college, were all living together in a one-bedroom apartment, which lacked privacy and which Anne would compare to living in adorm room.[40]
Heche attended theprogressiveFrancis W. Parker School, where she continued to be active in theater, performing in such plays asThornton Wilder'sThe Skin of Our TeethandIrwin Shaw'sBury the Dead.[41][42][43]When she was aged 16, atalent scoutspotted her in a school play and invited her to audition for the daytime soap operaAs the World Turns. Heche flew to New York with her mother, auditioned, and was offered a part. She was not able to accept the offer, as it would have entailed moving with her family to New York in the middle of her school year and having her mother leave a new job at abrokerage firm. In her memoir, Heche notes that she really wanted to move out on her own and "escape [her] mother's grasp", but this was not an option while she was still a minor.[31][44]
In 1987, at the end of hersenior year, Heche was offered another audition, this time for the soap operaAnother World. She was offered a role after two auditions and accepted, in spite of her mother's opposition. She moved to New York City and started work on the series, in her debut television role, just days after her high school graduation.[41][42][45]In a later interview she stated, "I did my time with my mom in a one-bedroom, skanky apartment and I was done."[31]

Heche was unsure about her future as an actress after leavingAnother World, having not performed in any other onscreen roles during her time on the soap opera and not having any acting jobs in place at the time she decided to leave. She knew that she did not want to continue in soap operas, something that was considered fairly insignificant in the larger world of professional acting. As a backup plan, she applied to and received an offer of acceptance fromParsons School of Designin New York City. However, right after applying to design school, she was offered a smallsupporting rolein theHallmark Hall of Fametelevision film adaptation of theWilla CathernovelO Pioneers!, featuringJessica Lange. Heche decided to take that offer rather than attend design school and to continue with her career as an actress.[48]
Heche received news of her Daytime Emmy Award forAnother Worldwhile inNebraskafilmingO Pioneers!. "Does this mean I'm an actress?" was her response in a telephone call with her agent following the news. The agent suggested that she relocate from New York City to Los Angeles, which she did days after shooting was completed on the film.[49]O Pioneers!would air in February 1992 and was Heche's first TV movie. Her performance garnered some positive critical notice.[50]After completingO Pioneers!, Heche starred in aguest appearancein an episode ofMurphy Brown.[51][52]Though this episode was shot afterO Pioneers!, it aired in November 1991 and hence was herprimetime televisiondebut and her first screen appearance outside ofAnother World. After herMurphy Brownappearance, however, she felt that guest spots on television episodes would be detrimental to her long-term career success and mostly avoided TV guest spots[52]until the 2000s.[53]
Heche also starred in several roles in Los Angeles theater productions in 1991 and 1992, including "Us & Them", aGeneration Xslice-of-lifepiece,[52][54]andGetting Away With Murder, a stage adaptation of theJames M. CainstoriesDead ManandThe Baby in the Icebox, which were produced as part of theMark Taper Forum–sponsored "Sundays at the Itchey Foot" series.[55][56]In early 1993, Heche made her theatrical film debut in the little-seenindependent filmAn Ambush of Ghosts, directed byEverett Lewis.[57]Soon afterward, she appeared in theDisneyfilmThe Adventures of Huck FinnwithElijah Wood.

By the late 1990s, Heche continued to find recognition and commercial success as she took on supporting roles in three other 1997 high-profile film releases—Volcano,I Know What You Did Last SummerandWag the Dog. The disaster filmVolcano, about the formation of a volcano in Los Angeles, had her star withTommy Lee JonesandGaby Hoffmann, playing aseismologist.

Heche's first lead role in a major film came in the 1998 romantic adventureSix Days, Seven Nights, where she appeared oppositeHarrison Ford, portraying a New York City journalist who ends up with a pilot (Ford) on a deserted island following a crash landing.[69]She had been cast in the film one day before hersame-sex relationshipwithEllen DeGenereswent public.[70]Although she was cast in a second starring role shortly thereafter asVince Vaughn's love interest in the dramaReturn to Paradise(1998), Heche felt that her relationship with DeGeneres destroyed her prospects as a leading woman.[71]According to Heche, "People said, 'You're not getting a job because you're gay'."[72]She commented: "How could that destroy my career? I still can't wrap my head around it."[71]Six Days, Seven Nightsreceived mixed reviews, but grossed US$74.3 million in North America and US$164.8 million worldwide.[73]On her appearance in the dramatic thrillerReturn to Paradise, a writer forThe New York Timesremarked, "as Ms. Heche's formidable Beth Eastern does her best to manipulate the other characters on [costarJoaquin Phoenix's character] behalf,Return to Paradisetakes on the abstract weightiness of an ethical debate rather than the visceral urgency of a thriller."[74]
Heche starred inGus Van Sant'sPsycho(1998), aremakeof the1960 filmdirected byAlfred Hitchcock. In the updated version, she took on the role originally played byJanet LeighasMarion Crane, an embezzler who arrives at an old motel run by serial killerNorman Bates(played by Vince Vaughn in their second collaboration).Psychoearned negative reviews, and despite a US$60 million budget it made US$37.1 million worldwide.[75]In an otherwise negativeTimesreview of the film, Janet Maslin felt that Heche was "refreshingly cast in Marion's role", while noting that her portrayal was "almost as demure as Ms. Leigh's, yet she's also more headstrong and flirty."[76]Heche's 1998 films were the only theatrically released films in which she had a leading role.[77]She also starred oppositeEd Harrisin the 1999 film,The Third Miracle, directed byAgnieszka Holland.[78]
Heche spent much of the 1998 to 2001 working on film directing projects, often writing her own screenplays. She pulled back from acting roles during this period and had relatively few acting appearances from 1999 to 2001.[17]Her first effort at writing and directing was a 1998 short film titledStripping for Jesus, which was about an evangelical Christian stripper who writes Bible verses on her body so as to reach clients "in a language that they understand".[79]According to Heche, the film was ametaphorfor "my life as I saw it". The film was fully self-financed.[80]Heche starred in the film along withSuzanne KrullandKaren Black.[79]
Heche's next several films were made for cable television and featured then-partner Ellen DeGeneres in varying degrees of participation. The first of these (and the one with the widest release) came in 2000, when Heche directed a segment ofIf These Walls Could Talk 2for HBO. An anthology film, it consisted of a series of segments about lesbian life in individual years over several decades. In Heche's segment, "2000", DeGeneres andSharon Stonestarred as a contemporary lesbian couple trying to have a baby together viaartificial insemination.[81]DeGeneres was also one of the executive producers of the film. In 2001, Heche directed another anthology film segment, this time part ofOn the Edge, aShowtimeanthology of science fiction stories directed by different actresses.[82]Heche's segment, titledReaching Normal, was her screenplay adaptation of the short storyCommand PerformancebyWalter M. Miller Jr.[83]The segment featuresAndie MacDowellandPaul Ruddin the story of a housewife who enters into atelepathicextramarital affair; the segment includes a cameo appearance by DeGeneres.[84]
Heche also directed a documentary that was to be released in 2001,Ellen DeGeneres: American Summer, about DeGeneres' 2000 stand-up comedy tour.[85]The project was never completed.[86]DeGeneres, who financed the documentary, states that she "burned" the film after attempting to salvage the project following the couple's split, but that the memories that it brought back were too painful.[87]
Most of Heche's roles in the early 2000s were in independent films and television; she played the role of Dr. Sterling in thefilm adaptationofElizabeth Wurtzel's autobiography about depression,Prozac Nation, withChristina Ricciand Jessica Lange. Premiered at the 2001Toronto International Film Festival, the film received a DVD release in 2005.

In 2001, Heche published a memoir titledCall Me Crazy,[134]which discussed her family and career background, as well as disclosed her history of mental illness and allegedchildhood sexual abuseby her father.[86]In 2021, on herBetter Togetherpodcast, she said that she was working on a second memoir tentatively titledCall Me Sane.[135]In September 2022, the second memoir, now titledCall Me Anne, was submitted in manuscript form shortly before her death and was announced for a January 2023 publication.[136][137][138]
Heche also narrated severalaudiobooks, notably, a self-narrated audiobook ofCall Me Crazy,[139]as well as narrating audiobook versions ofStephen King'sThe Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon(1999) andTess Gerritsen'sVanish(2005; co-narrated by Ilyana Kadushin).[140]In 2017, Heche hosted a weekly radio show onSiriusXMwithJason EllisentitledLove and Heche.[141]In late 2020, Heche and Heather Duffy Boylston launched apodcasttitledBetter Together.[5][142][143]
Heche's mother, Nancy Heche, has been a Christian therapist since 1997, and since 2005 has focused on "overcoming homosexuality", frequently speaking at events sponsored by evangelical Christian andChristian rightgroups, notably theex-gayministryLove Won Out.[18][71]
Heche had four older siblings, three of whom predeceased her. The eldest,Susan Bergman(1957–2006), died of abrain tumor. Bergman was a university lecturer inliteratureand aChristian writer, whose 1994 memoir titledAnonymitydescribed their closeted gay father and the effects that his legacy had on the rest of the family.[144][145][146][147]Another sister, Cynthia, died of a heart defect at two months.[31]Heche's only brother, Nathan (1965–1983), died in a car crash at age 18, three months after the death of their father. Heche said his death was a suicide, though her mother and surviving siblings dispute this.[148][149][150]Abigail is the fourth sibling, followed by Anne.[151]
Heche wasestrangedfrom the surviving members of her family for many years. A rift with her mother began when she first disclosed her relationship with Ellen DeGeneres. The rift deepened when she alleged sexual abuse by her father inCall Me Crazy, creating a rift with her two sisters as well. Heche said she had been estranged from her mother since she confronted her about the sexual abuse.[12]Heche's mother said it was Anne who cut off communication.[152]
In her 2001 memoir, Heche wrote that her mother was in denial about the alleged sexual abuse. For example, when she contractedgenital herpesas an infant, her mother insisted that it was adiaper rashand refused to take her to a doctor.[153]Heche also wrote that her father repeatedly raped her from the time she was an infant until she was 12.[17]When she was asked, "But why would a gay man rape a girl?" in a 2001 interview withThe Advocate, Heche replied, "I don't think he was just a gay man. I think he wassexually deviant. My belief was that my father was gay and he had to cover that up. I think he was sexually abusive. The more he couldn't be who he was, the more that came out of him in [the] ways that it did."[154]
Heche's mother has denied her daughter's allegations and responded in a discussion of the book on aninternet forum: "I am trying to find a place for myself in this writing, a place where I as Anne's mother do not feel violated or scandalized. I find no place among the lies and blasphemies in the pages of this book."[12][152]Anne's sister Abigail added, "It is my opinion that my sister Anne truly believes, at this moment, what she has asserted about our father's past behavior; however, at the same time, I would like to point out that Anne, in the past, has expressed doubts herself about the accuracy of such memories. Based on my experience and her own expressed doubts, I believe that her memories regarding our father are untrue. And I can state emphatically, regardless of Anne's beliefs, that the assertion that our mother knew about such behavior is absolutely false."[12][152]
In 2009, Heche toldThe New York Times:
My mother had a very tragic life. Three of her five children are dead, and her husband is dead. That she is attempting to change gay people into straight people is, in my opinion, a way to keep the pain of the truth out. People wonder why I am so forthcoming with the truths that have happened in my life, and it's because the lies that I have been surrounded with and the denial that I was raised in, for better or worse, bore a child of truth and love. My mother preaches to this day the opposite of that core of my life. It is no mistake that she still stands up against love. And one wonders why I'm not rushing to have her meet my children.[71]
In 2011, Heche toldThe Daily Telegraphthat she had reconciled with her remaining sister Abigail, but doubted she would be able to repair her relationship with her mother.[31]
Elliot andNatalie Bergman, of the bandWild Belle, are Heche's nephew and niece. In 2017, she said that their albumDreamlandwas her favorite album and described herself as a "proud aunt".[155]
Heche was in a relationship withLindsey BuckinghamofFleetwood Macfor about one year in the early 1990s[156]and also in a relationship withSteve Martin, whom she had met on the set ofA Simple Twist of Fate, for about two years during the mid-1990s.[157]
Heche's relationship with DeGeneres and the events following their breakup became subjects of widespread media interest.[69][158][159]They were described as "the world's first gaysupercouple".[10]Heche and DeGeneres started dating in 1997, and at one point said they would get acivil unionif such became legal inVermont.[160]They broke up in August 2000.[161][162]Heche stated that all of her other romantic relationships were with men.[31][163]In the memoirCall Me Anne, submitted shortly before her death, she wrote that she never identified as a lesbian and did not regard the terms "gay" or "straight" as relevant to her.[136]
Heche claims that there was professional fallout due to her relationship with DeGeneres. She recounts that she was warned not to attend the 1997 premiere ofVolcanowith DeGeneres, and when the couple did so anyway, they were escorted out before the film had ended.[164][165][166]Heche said that she was told that she would be denied the part inSix Days, Seven Nightsfor going public with her romance with DeGeneres, but landed the role nevertheless.[164]However, Heche did not work in a studio picture for 10 years afterward.[165][166]In a later podcast, Heche claimed that DeGeneres tried to put her in an institution[135]and that she was effectively blacklisted fromDeGeneres' talk show, which negatively affected her career as studios were reluctant to hire her for films they would be unable to publicize on the widely viewed program.[167]
In 2000, Heche left DeGeneres for Coleman "Coley" Laffoon, a cameraman whom she met when she hired him as part of the camera crew for the television documentaryEllen DeGeneres: American Summer, which she was directing. On September 1, 2001, she and Laffoon married.[67]They had a son, Homer Heche Laffoon, in March 2002.[67][168]Laffoon filed for divorce in February 2007, after five and a half years of marriage.[169]In a separate court filing, he said that Heche "exhibited bizarre and delusional behavior for which she refuses to seek professional help."[170]The divorce was finalized in March 2009.[171][172][173]
Heche left Laffoon forMen in Treesco-star James Tupper.[174]During their relationship, Heche described herself and Tupper as being "eternally engaged".[175]She and Tupper had a son, Atlas Heche Tupper, in March 2009.[176][177]Tupper and Heche separated in January 2018.[178]
Heche and formerHungco-starThomas Janeannounced that they were in a relationship in 2019; they were together into 2020, but had separated by the time of her death.[179][180]
In her memoirCall Me Crazy, Heche discusses her struggles with mental health issues and the long-term effect of her childhood abuse. She wrote that she had blocked out much of her childhood[181]and had first gone into therapy during her time onAnother World, undergoing various types of therapy through the mid-1990s.[182]Heche soon beganReichianbody psychotherapy, and wrote that the release ofbody memoriesthrough this technique helped herrecover memoriesof her alleged sexual abuse and confront the emotional aftermath of childhood trauma.[183]This process was later continued through guidedLSD therapy, which she claimed had led to a full recovery of childhood memories.[184]
Heche underwent another crisis that began about the time she had finished filmingDonnie Brasco, in which she said that she began hearingGod speaking directlyto her.[185]In this state, she said that she was told that she had an inner being called "Celestia" who was anincarnationof God and theSecond Comingof Jesus. She believed that it was her mission to enlighten humanity and that she had achieved fame in order to fulfill this role.[186]Heche's initial experience of hearing and being directed by what she claimed was God lasted for twelve days,[185]and her spiritual experiences andalter egoas Celestia continued for another four years.[187]During this time, Heche claimed to have had experiences withglossolalia,automatic writinganddrawing,clairvoyance, the ability topsychically healothers and havingstigmataappear on her feet.[188]
On August 19, 2000, immediately following her separation from DeGeneres,[161]Heche drove onInterstate 5from Los Angeles to theSan Joaquin Valley. Exiting where she later said she "had been told" to go, she ended up inCantua Creek, a rural area in westernFresno County, California.[189][190]Heche left her vehicle at the side of a rural road and, wearing only a bra and shorts, walked 1.5 miles (2.4 km) in extremely hot weather without water, before feelingdehydratedand knocking on the door of a ranch house.[189][191]The homeowner recognized Heche fromSix Days, Seven Nightsand was astonished that a celebrity would show up at her "in the middle of nowhere" location.[189][b]
After the homeowner let Heche in and gave her a glass of water, Heche took off her shoes and requested to take a shower, with which the homeowner obliged.[189][192]She assumed that Heche was notunder the influenceof alcohol or drugs, but Heche later revealed to officers that she had takenecstasy.[86][193]After taking a shower, Heche entered the living room, asked for a pair of slippers, and suggested that they should watch a movie.[189]Unsure of what to do after Heche had been at the house for a half an hour without contacting anyone, the resident contacted theFresno County Sheriff's Department.[189]Heche later told the deputies that she was "God, and was going to take everyone back to heaven…in a spaceship."[193]She was then taken toFresno's University Medical Center by ambulance and was admitted to itspsychiatric unit, but she was released within a few hours.[189][194]The unit's personnel described the incident as apsychotic break.[11]
Heche stated that she wasinsanefor the first 31 years of her life, and that her insanity was triggered by the sexual abuse that her father subjected her to during her childhood.[195][196]In a series of nationally televised interviews to promoteCall Me Crazyin September 2001, she stated that she created a fantasy world called the "Fourth Dimension" and the alter ego "Celestia" to make herself feel safe.[12][197]Heche said she recovered from her mental health concerns following the incident in Cantua Creek and had put her alter ego behind her.[86][197]
In a January 2018 interview on the podcastAllegedly with Theo Von and Matthew Cole Weiss, Heche alleged thatHarvey Weinsteinhadexposed himselfto her and demandedoral sex, and claimed to have been fired from an unspecifiedMiramaxfilm in retaliation after she refused Weinstein's advances. She said that there were many other incidents ofsexual harassmentthat took place during her career and stated that her survival of childhood sexual abuse had given her the strength to stand up to unwanted advances such as those made by Weinstein. A spokesman for Weinstein said that he had been "friendly" with Heche, but denied all of her allegations.[198][199]
On August 5, 2022, Heche was involved in a sequence of three motor vehicle collisions in theMar Vistaneighborhood of Los Angeles, the final collision being the most serious, inflicting critical injuries on Heche and destroying a house.[200][201][202]
The first collision took place when Heche's vehicle struck an apartment garage and caused minor damage. A video released byTMZshows her vehicle, aMini Clubman,[203]at the scene of the collision and an unidentified man repeatedly shouting, "Out of the car!" at the driver. The vehicle then reversed and left the scene of the collision. The driver in the photo released by TMZ was identified as Heche.[201][203][204][205]
TMZ also reported a secondhit-and-runin which Heche's Mini struck aJaguarwithout stopping, though without injury to the other driver. An accompanying video shows the Mini speeding down an alleyway and nearly hitting a pedestrian.[206]Adoorbellvideo recorded in the moments before the final crash shows Heche's vehicle driving along a neighborhood street at a very high speed, followed a few seconds later by the sound of a crash.[200][204][207]
In the final crash, Heche's vehicle struck a house, broke through a wall and embedded itself 30 feet (9.1 m) into the building, trapping Heche inside. The vehicle caught fire, which rapidly spread through the entire building. The resulting house fire took 65 minutes to be fully extinguished and required 59 firefighters.[201][202][208][209]Firefighters were unable to access and fullyextricateHeche from the vehicle for 45 minutes after their arrival on the scene, and initially were not aware that a person was trapped in the vehicle itself.[210]Heche had sustained severe burns andsmoke inhalationinjuries by the time she was rescued.[201][202]The house was leftstructurally compromisedand uninhabitable.[203][204][208]The tenant living in the house was in the rear of the structure at the time of the collision and only sustained minor injuries, but her attorney said that she and her pets "almost lost their lives" and that she had lost all of her personal property in the fire.[202][209][211]
Law enforcement officials initially stated that Heche was "deemed to be under the influence and acting erratically" at the time of the crashes.[201]TheLos Angeles Police Departmentsaid that a preliminary blood analysis showed the presence of bothcocaineandnarcotics, includingfentanyl, in her system; however, the coroner's report concluded that she was not impaired at the time of the crash.[212][213][214]
As Heche was being removed from the crash scene, she was filmed sitting up on the stretcher and struggling with firefighters while she was being wheeled into the ambulance but lost consciousness soon afterward.[207][215]Heche was taken toRonald Reagan UCLA Medical Centerfor emergency care, and then to Grossman Burn Center atWest Hills Hospitalfor specializedburn centercare.[210]On August 8, a representative for Heche said that she was in a coma incritical condition, requiringmedical ventilationforpulmonary injurysustained in the accident.[216][217]The representative also said that prior reports that Heche was in "stable condition" were "inaccurate".[217]
On August 11, the representative said that Heche was not expected to survive ananoxic brain injuryshe had sustained, but that she was being kept onlife supportto determine if her organs were viable for donation, in accordance with her expressed wish to be anorgan donor.[218][219]Heche was declaredbrain deada few hours later, but remained on life support to assess organ donor viability and locate recipients.[213][220][221][222]Heche was consideredlegally deadat that time under California law.[223]
Police had investigated the crash as a felony DUI collision but said there would be no more investigative efforts after Heche was declared brain-dead.[224]
On August 14, it was announced that organ recipients had been found and that her body would undergo the organ donation procedure that day.[225]To honor her organ donation, hospital staff held anhonor walkfor Heche.[226]That evening, her publicist announced that she had been "peacefully taken off life support." The office of the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner recorded the cause of death as "inhalationandthermal injuries", with "sternal fracturedue toblunt trauma" listed as an "other significant condition", and ruled herdeath an accident.[2][6][227][228]
On December 6, 2022, theLos Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coronerannounced the results of Heche'sautopsy, stating that she was not impaired by illicit substances at the time of the incident and that no active drugs were found in her system. An inactivemetaboliteof cocaine was found through a blood test taken when Heche arrived at the hospital, which the coroner's office said indicates the drug was used in the past, but not at the time of the crash.Cannabinoidswere detected in Heche's urine but not in the blood test, which was consistent with prior use, but not during the time of the incident. Fentanyl was also detected in Heche's system, but it was determined that it was from treatment she received at the hospital.[229][230][231]
Heche'scrematedremains wereinterredin amausoleumatHollywood Forever Cemetery[232]on May 14, 2023.[233]
On August 31, 2022, Heche's older son Homer Heche Laffoon filed apetitionin theLos Angeles Countyprobate courtclaiming that Heche had diedintestate, asking that he be named her estate'sadministrator. Laffoon's lawyer also stated that they wished to have a third party appointedguardianad litemfor Heche's younger son (and Laffoon's half-brother), Atlas Heche Tupper.[234]
On September 15, Heche's former boyfriend,James Tupper, filed a petition raising objections to Laffoon's. He argued that an email sent by Heche in 2011 describing her wishes in the event of her death should be treated as her will.[235][236]Tupper's petition challenged Laffoon's qualifications to administer the estate, claiming that at 20 years of age he lacked the maturity required of an administrator, and that Laffoon's lack of personal assets and income would render him unable to post the requiredbond. Tupper concluded that he wished to act asexecutorand hire a professionalfiduciaryto manage the estate.[235][236]
Lynne Mishele, the tenant of the house into which Heche crashed filed lawsuits against Heche's estate, seeking "compensatory damages" of $2 million.[237]
In November 2022, the court appointed Homer Heche Laffoon as general administrator of his mother's estate.[238]In early 2024, Laffoon stated the estate cannot pay its debt of over $6 million, including the $2 million in damages sought by Mishele.[224]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
