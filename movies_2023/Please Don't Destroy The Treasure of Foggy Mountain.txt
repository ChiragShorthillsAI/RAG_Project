Ben, John, and Martin are childhood friends who live and work together at Trout Plus, anoutdoor storeowned by Ben's father Farley. John, who is becoming anxious at his friends' new interests—Ben in taking over Trout Plus from his father, Martin in his new religious girlfriend Amy—discovers through aTikTokvideo that a compass the three found as children may be a clue to a treasure hidden by explorer Jean Pierre La Roche. The treasure, a bust ofMarie Antoinette, is worth $100 million.
The three set off for Foggy Mountain State Park, where they encounter park rangers Lisa and Taylor. Lisa and John take an instant interest in each other, and John reveals the goal of their trip. After meeting up with the trio in the park and Lisa sharing an intimate night with John, the two steal the boys' map and attempt to search for the treasure themselves. The boys discover that the compass points the way to the treasure, and after Ben unsuccessfully tries to fly to the location with awingsuit, they are led to a hidden chamber inside a rock formation. The three fend off a wild animal and retrieve the bust.
After escaping from Lisa and Taylor, the boys come across acultmade up of treasure hunters who failed to find the bust. John attempts to hide the treasure, but it is found by the cultists, who prepare to ritually burn it as a rejection of their former greed. The cult's leader, Deetch Nordwind, has second thoughts, but before he can retrieve the bust John usesstage magicto disappear with the treasure; however, he decides to turn it over to Ben and Martin and return to the cult.
Two weeks later, Ben and Martin meet on the day the bust is to be sold. They are interrupted by John, who begs the two to rescue him from the cult. After initial reluctance, the two rush to save John and Lisa, who has also joined the cult. John accidentally reveals to the cult that the bust will be sold, and they rush to Trout Plus to steal the bust for themselves, leaving John behind. Ben and Martin rescue John and successfully use their wingsuits to fly back to the store, where the bust is being delivered toGaten Matarazzo, only for him to be murdered by the cult. A battle ensues, with Nordwind retrieving the bust, only for a hawk the trio befriended to snatch it away. After Nordwind rushes to chase the hawk, it returns the bust to the boys. With the money from the bust, each of the boys achieve their dreams: John takes a trip to London with his friends, Ben starts his own business—a hair salon for boys—and Martin and Amy purchase a house together.

Yang was born inBrisbane,Queensland, Australia, to a family that hademigrated from Chinain 1986.[4][7][8][9]His father, Ruilin, was raised in a rural part of theInner Mongoliaregion ofmainland China, growing up in a straw and mud hut.[10]Ruilin's parents were 'English illiterate'[clarification needed], but he read books for hours by candlelight and eventually got into university. Yang's mother, fromShenyang, was a highly educated, now retired physician who was an obstetrician-gynecologist in China before working indiagnostics.[9][10][11]The couple moved to Brisbane so Ruilin could earn his doctorate inmining explosives.[10]
Yang has an older sister.[9]The children spokeMandarinin their home, and attended Chinese Sunday school.[10]When Bowen was six months old, the family moved to Canada and eventually settled inMontreal,[12]where Bowen first discoveredSaturday Night Live(SNL). When he was nine, they moved again, toAurora, Colorado.[7][10][13]As a child, he was drawn to late-night comedians and hostsDavid LettermanandConan O'Brien.[11]
Yang's high schoolcalculusteacher, Adrian Holguin, was also his coach forSmoky Hill High School'simprovisational comedy group, Spontaneous Combustion.[14]Yang got a near perfect score on theACT(a 35) and a 2200 on hisSAT, and graduated from high school in 2008.[15][16]He was named homecoming king and also voted "Most Likely to Be a Cast Member onSaturday Night Live" in his high school'syearbook.[16][17]
When he was seventeen, Yang's father found out his son was gay from an "openchat window" on the family's computer.[11]His parents were not receptive to the news, stating that such things "did not happen in China".[18]Yang's father cried often over the revelation and, being non-religious but wanting to "solve problems", arranged for him to attend eight sessions ofgay conversion therapy.[11][18]He agreed to attend the sessions to appease his parents, who said they would otherwise not allow him to move to New York to attendNew York University, which his sister was already attending.[9]He was immediately alarmed by the counselor's mix of religion and use ofpseudo-scientificreasoning to explain away positive homosexual manifestations.[10][11]In an interview forThe New York Times,Maureen Dowdquestioned why his parents, both scientists, did not see the disconnection.[10]Bowen said, "It was a cultural thing for them, this cultural value around masculinity, around keeping the family line going, keeping certain things holy and sacred." He also said "It was me wanting to meet them halfway but realizing it had to be pretty absolute. It was an either-or thing."[10]
In 2008, Yang moved to New York City and joined his sister at NYU.[9]His father assigned her to chaperone him during this period as Bowen tried "straightnesson for size and fail[ed] miserably."[18][19]He came to accept being gay, incorporating it into his comedy, and hoped his parents would learn to accept that aspect of him.[18]They have since found a truce and enjoy a "great relationship."[11]At NYU, he was in the improv group Dangerbox, and he occasionally performed withStephanie Hsu, a member of the school's sketch comedy group.[20][21]
Yang was inspired bySandra Oh's characterCristina YangonGrey's Anatomyfor her neurotic and relentless pursuits, and aspired to be a doctor.[10][22]He went to pre-med classes and graduated from NYU with a bachelor's degree in chemistry.[10][23][14]After realizing he was actually inspired by Oh for her acting ability, he decided to pursue a career in comedy instead.[22]At NYU, he metMatt Rogers, with whom he startedLas Culturistas, a weekly comedy podcast where Yang "unapologetically expresses his personality, story and himself by sharing his experiences as a member of the LGBTQ community".[8][22]
Yang taught himselfAdobe Photoshopandgraphic designsoftware and later worked atOne Kings Lane, a luxuryinterior and home designwebsite, from 2013 to 2018 as a graphic designer.[10][24]The company was flexible with Yang's time-off needs for comedy.[10]Yang has also performed improv at theUpright Citizens Brigade.[25]During this time, Yang designed graphics for his own shows and for his friends' comedy shows.[24]
Thepodcastthat Yang co-hosts withMatt Rogers,Las Culturistas, is described byVultureas both "delightfully screwy" and a "two-headedsnarkroutine".[26]The podcast premiered in 2016 and as of September 2019[update], has over 300 episodes.[27]Each one opens with an interview with a pop culture guest, then goes to one-minute rounds of "I Don't Think So, Honey!" (IDTSH) where the hosts and guests each expound onpet peeves.[26]IDTSH has also morphed into its own live show.[26]Yang credits theLas Culturistaspodcast with Rogers for building hisfanbase. In 2018 it was nominated for aShorty Awardrecognizing the best in social media.[4][28][29]

Yang performed stand-up onHBO's2 Dope Queens.[30]He played fashion designerAlexander Wangin a sketch series on Comedy Central,Up Next.[32]In 2019, Yang received press coverage for his viral Twitter posts consisting of "expertly-timedlip-syncvideos of famous movie scenes", in which he "reproduces dialogue fromdivascenes" and well-known moments in popular culture. Past videos featured a monologue byMiranda PriestlyinThe Devil Wears Prada,Tyra Banksyelling at contestantTiffany RichardsononAmerica's Next Top Model, and a viral video ofCardi Btalking about the2019 government shutdown.[10][22]Each garnered thousands of likes andretweets.[5][33]
In 2018, Yang was hired as astaff writeronSaturday Night Livefor the show's44th season.[11]He said he "always lovedSNLgrowing up, but had trouble imagining himself on the show, because he'd never seen people who looked like him associated with the series".[34]Yang has writing credits on 21 episodes of the show for the 2018–2019 season.[27]His writing included: "GPYass", a play on a vehicle'sGPS navigation devicethat utilizesdrag queensto deliver driving directions; and two sketches co-written withJulio Torres, which features Yang's talent for infusing "drama, tension, and exquisite backstory" into an everyday activity like paying bills in "Cheques" withSandra Oh, and an actress doing acameoin agay pornographyfilm, "The Actress" withEmma Stone.[30]"The Actress" was hailed by Out as the "gayestSNLsketch of all-time," and featured Stone as an earnestmethod actresstaking her role as a cheated-on housewife too seriously alongside real-life gay porn actorTy Mitchell.[35][36]The pre-tape—so-called as it is filmed days ahead rather than acted live—was championed by Stone to be included on air.[35][36]SNLcreatorLorne Michaelsknew Yang would be an on-air talent but wanted him to be comfortable on their stage first.[11]Yang made a cameo appearance during theSandra Oh/Tame Impalaepisode as North Korean leaderKim Jong-Unwhile Oh played his translator.[37]

Yang is the third gay male, and sixthLGBTQcast member.[c]The announcement of Yang's casting onSaturday Night Livewas reported internationally, and within hours was overshadowed by revelations that comedianShane Gillis, who had been hired at the same time, airedhomophobicandanti-Asianjokes.[47][48]Gillis issued an apology, but within days was fired bySNL.[49][48]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
