Showing Upis a 2022 Americancomedy-dramafilm co-written and directed byKelly Reichardt, in her fourth collaboration with actressMichelle Williams. The film follows a sculptor managing the competing attentions of her art, job, family, and friendships.
Showing Uppremiered at theCannes Film Festivalon May 27, 2022, where it was nominated for thePalme d'Or.[4]The film was released theatrically in the United States byA24on April 7, 2023.[5]It received largely positive reviews, with particular praise for Williams' performance and Reichardt's direction. It was also named one of the top 10 independent films of 2023 by theNational Board of Review.[6]In 2024, the film received theRobert Altman Awardat the39th Independent Spirit Awards.
Lizzy is a sculptor and arts administrator assistant for her mother at her alma mater, theOregon College of Art and Craft. She is also working on a showing of her work, clay sculptures of women in joyful or anguished movement.
Lizzy's landlord and neighbor Jo, a rival artist, frequently spars with her. For days, Lizzy is continuously reminding Jo to fix Lizzy's hot water heater, but Jo prioritizes everything else, like hanging a tire swing in the backyard and her two upcoming shows. To have enough time to finish her sculptures, Lizzy takes Tuesday off from work. In the middle of the night, Lizzy's cat maims apigeonthat flew into the house. Lizzy throws the pigeon outside, but Jo discovers and rescues it the next morning, before dumping the work of taking care of it on Lizzy. Lizzy is at first actively resentful before she begins to bond with the bird. She ends up taking it to the vet, which costs her $150. When Jo finally comes for the bird, Lizzy lets her know it distracted her and kept her from herglazing.
Lizzy visits her father at home. She does not trust the hippies who have invited themselves to stay with him, who are more grifters than friends. Lizzy discovers that he has not had contact with her brother Sean for six months. Concerned, Lizzy goes to see Sean. He has become reclusive, and is delusional, convinced that his neighbors are behind his TV antenna not working. Contacting their mother about it, Lizzy believes her brother needs more than just emotional help, but is told he is simply a misunderstood genius.
The weekend right before her show, Lizzy's final piece burns on one side in thekiln. Visiting Sean, he is digging a massive pit in his backyard and insists he is hearing voices, which Lizzy and others choose not to hear. She convinces her mother to come watch him. Lizzy's mother puts Sean to sleep after he suffers the mental episode. Although it was arranged that he would come to the show, when she arrives he is not there. Lizzy is nervous, hearing that he has wandered off alone.
At Lizzy's show, her family shows up, even Sean, having taken the bus. Jo comes and brings the pigeon. It has its bandages removed by two unsupervised girls. Everyone watches as Sean releases the bird and it flies away. Jo and Lizzy go looking for it, but eventually accept it was ready to fly.

The project was originally conceived as a biopic of Canadian artistEmily Carrand the 10 years she spent as a landlord hoping it would offer her more free time to work on her art, but instead forced her to paint less.[14]Reichardt said the film officially pivoted away from Carr when she first embarked to Canada to research for the film and "the passport guy asked us what we were doing, and we said, 'We're coming to research a painter named Emily Carr.' And he goes, 'Oh yeah. We learned about her.' That took the wind out of our sails, that she was so famous."[14]

The website's consensus reads: "A deceptively simple drama about the artist's life,Showing Upreunites Kelly Reichardt and Michelle Williams to absorbing effect."[15]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 86 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[16]

During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, A24 was approved to continue filming and promotional activities since they do not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP).[57]
In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

It was named one of the best films of 1995 by theBoston Globe,Film Comment, andThe Village Voice. Reichardt then had trouble making another feature film, saying, "I had 10 years from the mid-1990s when I couldn't get a movie made. It had a lot to do with being a woman. That's definitely a factor in raising money. During that time, it was impossible to get anything going, so I just said, 'Fuck you!' and didSuper 8shorts instead."[11]
In 1999, Reichardt completed the short filmOde, based onHerman Raucher's novelOde to Billy Joe. Next she made two more short films,Then a Year, in 2001, andTravis, which deals with theIraq War, in 2004.[12]In these two films, critics have noted that she subtly makes clear her displeasure with theBush administrationand its handling of theIraq War.[11]
Most of Reichardt's films are regarded by critics to be part of the minimalist movement in films,[11]though Reichardt sees a difference between her work and the movement as a whole.[13]
AfterTodd Haynes, a close friend of Reichardt, madeSafe, she drove Haynes to Portland from the Seattle Film Festival, where she met writerJon RaymondandNeil Kopp, who respectively wrote and produced several of Reichardt's films.[13]Raymond has been cited as the largest influence on Reichardt's decision to base her films in thePacific Northwest, his specific humanist portraits of the region inspiring Reichardt's critically acclaimed streak of films.[14]In 2006, she completedOld Joy, based on a short story in Raymond's collectionLivability.Daniel Londonand singer-songwriterWill Oldhamportray two friends who reunite for a camping trip to theCascadesandBagby Hot Springs, near Portland.[15]The film won awards from theLos Angeles Film Critics Association,Rotterdam International Film Festival, andSarasota Film Festival.

In 2013, Reichardt's filmNight Movesdebuted in competition at the70th Venice International Film Festival. A more intense thriller about a secret plot to blow up a dam, it was considered a shift in tone from her other slower, more melancholic films.

Reichardt is an Artist-in-Residence in the Film and Electronic Arts program atBard College.[24]She has received a 2009 John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship[25]and a 2011 United States Artists (USA) Fellowship.[26]She edits her films herself.[11]
First Cow(2019) debuted at the2019 Telluride Film Festival,[27]it was screened at the2019 New York Film Festival, and in February 2020 was selected to the main competition of the70th Berlin International Film Festival. It was Reichardt's return to films set in Oregon after shootingCertain Womenin Montana. Released byA24to a limited number of theaters in March 2020, the film was pulled from distribution due to the onset of theCOVID-19 pandemicand became avideo on demandtitle in June 2020.[28]
Reichardt's next film,Showing Up, was set inPortlandwith Williams in the lead role as a sculptor. It premiered at the2022 Cannes Film Festival, and was the director's first feature to be included in the main competition for thePalme d'Or.[29]The film was released by A24 in the United States on April 7, 2023.[30]
Reichardt's films have often been called minimalist and realist, with film criticA. O. ScottdescribingWendy and Lucyas part of a new American Independent cinema he termed "Neo-Neo Realism", primarily due to its thematic and aesthetic similarity to classic Italian neorealist films such asRome Open CityandPaisan.[11]Reichardt has called her films "just glimpses of people passing through".[31]She also recognizes her style as minimalist, saying, "A movie is a series of reveals, essentially, and then you're supposed to sit in a room and tell someone what it all means. That goes against everything that I just worked for, so I have no interest in summing it all up. It's all out there".[32]Her films' realist tendencies position them in line with Matthew Flanagan's idea of slow cinema. Their long takes, minimal dialogue and minimalist action are all characteristics of slow cinema that allow the audience time for contemplation.[33]This style may also be in response to more mainstream films; Reichardt has said, "when I go to the movies and I sit through the previews, I literally feel assaulted."[13]
Reichardt's films often focus on characters on the margins of society, who are not usually represented on screen, or who are seeking a better quality of life and place in the world. She is interested in characters "who don't have a net, who if you sneezed on them, their world would fall apart".[34]Her films tackle aspects of the American experience the commercial film industry seldom explores. Eric Kohn ofIndiewirehas called her films "a mesmerizing statement on the solitude of everyday life for working-class people who want something better. They're trapped between a mythology of greatness and the personal limitations that govern their drab realities. By attending to atmosphere and attitude as much as plot, Reichardt has quietly become one of the country's best chroniclers of the American experience".[35]In his contemporary review ofOld Joy,Slant Magazine'sNick Schagerpraises how "Reichardt’s delicate touch is such that it creates room for an interpretative flexibility. The film’s pauses in dialogue and the unseen spaces between scenes breathe with palpable, mysterious life."[36]
Reichardt's films often contain references to modern times and political events.[37]OfMeek's Cutoff, she said, "Here was the story of this braggart leading a bunch of people into the desert without a plan and becoming completely reliant on the locals who are socially different from him and who he is suspicious of. All of which seemed relevant to the moment"[11](in reference to theIraq WarandGeorge W. Bush). Reichardt has confirmed that the character Meek was meant to resemble Bush.Wendy and Lucyalso reflects the economic hardships that affected millions of Americans (particularly women, whom the film suggests are affected more than men) as a result of the high costs and collateral damage from the war.[11]Reichardt's 2013 filmNight Moveshas more overt political references. The three protagonists are radical environmentalists,[38]and the film is set in Oregon, a state with many notable instances of environmental protest, particularly against its lumber industry[39]and in defense of theNorthern Spotted Owl, an indicator species of the Pacific Northwest.[40]
Critics have noted that Reichardt's films often have ambiguous endings that leave the audience hanging and unsatisfied. Xan Brooks ofThe Guardianuses the examples of "wonky Kurt, left wandering city streets at the end ofOld Joy, hapless Wendy, still looking for Alaska, orMeek's Cutoff's lost pioneers, forever strung between triumph and disaster. These films do not so much resolve as dissolve. They leave us dangling, forced to write their third acts in our heads".[31]Reichardt has said, "Maybe I'm suspicious of absolutes. I mean, yes, there is something satisfying about watching an old film when the music rises up and the words come at you: The End. But it would seem absurd to do that at the end of one of my films. It would just make them feel lopsided, because they're all so short, they cover so little time. We don't know where these people were before. We spent a week with them and then on they went".[31]She has also said that she enjoys films that let the audience find their own way in and come to their own conclusions.[31]
Reichardt's films contain feminist ideas in both style and content, rejecting mainstream commercial filmmaking methods and focusing on gender (most have female lead characters), but she rejects the label "feminist filmmaker". She rejects mainstream methods by using small budgets, filming on location (most of her films are shot in Oregon), and refusing to romanticize her characters and their struggles. InOld Joy, which stars two men and was spoken about at festivals as an LGBT film,[41]the theme of male friendship is highlighted and addressed through feminized qualities of sensitivity and vulnerability rarely seen in mainstream Hollywood cinema. InNight Moves,Dakota Fanning's character serves as a strong female counterpoint toJesse Eisenberg's male protagonist, and the film's environmental storyline reflects eco-feminist values. Reichardt also diverges from the mainstream with her films' avant-garde content.River of Grasssegments the narrative into numbered sections, andCertain Womenis also divided into episodes. Reichardt's realism and camera angles reject the objectification of bodies and challenge audience expectations by lingering on seemingly insignificant images after characters have left a scene.[33]
Reichardt has frequently collaborated with actressMichelle Williams, saying that she enjoys Williams's confidence and inquisitive nature, and that she can never guess what she's going to do.[42]

Buoyed by the success of the single "Player's Ball", the album was certifiedplatinumby theRIAAthe same year, and Outkast was named "Best New Rap Group of the Year" at the 1995Source Awards.
On their next two albums,ATLiens(1996) andAquemini(1998), Outkast experimented with their sound by adding elements oftrip hop,soul, andjungle. The albums were also influenced by a return to traditional black music genres, withfunkbeing the most prominent example. Outkast's style and lyricism again received commercial and critical acclaim. With the duo's portrayal of themselves as out-of-place extraterrestrials inATLiens, Benjamin's lyrics, in particular, were noted for theirsurreal, space-age tinge: "thefunkadelic, futuristic, and seemingly unfamiliar, weird, or eccentric persona projected by André 3000 creates the chance to transcend the more pronounced characterizations of gangstas and pimps so regularly assumed by black men rap artists."[13]During the recording of these albums, Benjamin took up guitar, painting, and a relationship with singerErykah Badu.
Outkast's fourth album,Stankonia(2000), introduced Benjamin's new alias André 3000 (largely to distinguish himself fromDr. Dreand to announce a new persona following his split with Badu) and increased the group's crossover appeal with the single "Ms. Jackson", which hit #1 on theBillboardHot 100. The song was written in the aftermath of Benjamin's breakup with Badu and was a fictionalized account of the disintegration of their relationship. In 2002, Outkast released a greatest hits album,Big Boi and Dre Present... OutKast, which contained three new tracks, one of which, "The Whole World", won aGrammyforBest Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Later that year, Benjamin participated in theDungeon Familygroup album, which saw some prominent Atlanta-based hip-hop groups combine into asupergroup. In 2002, André 3000 was referenced on the song "Till I Collapse" byEminem, who considered him one of the best rappers ever.
In 2003 Outkast releasedSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below, a double album that highlighted the differences in the musical styles of the group's two members. Though Big Boi's half of the album,Speakerboxxx, spawned the number-one hit "The Way You Move" and the relatively successful "Ghetto Musick", Benjamin'sThe Love Belowgarnered the most attention from mainstream audiences, with the popular singles "Hey Ya!" and "Roses" and theirmusic videosreceiving heavy radio and television airtime. "Prototype", the album's fourth single and video (Benjamin's third), was released shortly after. UnlikeSpeakerboxxx,The Love Belowis an exercise in funk,jazz, andalternativemusic, featuring vocals from Benjamin which are mostly sung instead of rapped.Rolling Stonecompared Benjamin to "anindie-rockLittle Richard" on "Hey Ya!" and later declared the international hit one ofThe 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[14]
In 2006, Outkast released their sixth album as a group,Idlewild, which also served as a soundtrack to the group's musical filmIdlewild. The film depicts life in a 1930s setting and the album takes influences from the music of that era, particularlyblues. Benjamin had a few rapped verses on the album, including on the first single "Mighty O", but mostly stuck with singing, as he had onThe Love Below. The album postponed the release of the theatrical film, as Benjamin and Patton were concentrated more on the production of the music than the movie. In an interview withBillboardin 2006, Benjamin explained that Outkast and its associates had developed the idea of creating a movie before the release ofAquemini, so that when it finally came time to collaborate on the movie, they already had most of the details worked out, including a script, and the movie was ultimately finished before the album was.[15]
In January 2014, it was announced that Outkast would be reuniting to celebrate their 20th anniversary by performing at more than 40 festivals worldwide during the spring/summer of 2014, beginning with a headline spot at theCoachella Valley Music and Arts FestivalinIndio, Californiain April.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
