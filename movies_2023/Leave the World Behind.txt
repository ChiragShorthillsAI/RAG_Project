MisanthropeAmanda Sandford arranges an impromptu weekend getaway at a vacation rental with her husband Clay and their kids, Archie and Rose. After arriving at the rental, Amanda goes to the store. While shopping for groceries, Amanda sees a man stocking up on large quantities of canned food and water. Later, while the family relaxes at a nearby beach, they evade an oil tanker crashing on shore. When they return to the house, they notice the TV and Wi-Fi are not working and a pair ofdeerstare at them.
That night, the owner, George H. ("G.H.") Scott, and his daughter, Ruth, arrive at the house. Seeking shelter, G.H. explains that a blackout caused their return. Amanda is suspicious and doesn't want them to stay. Clay, however, trusts them and lets them stay the night. Later in the night, the television switches to displaying anEmergency Action Notificationfrom theEmergency Alert Systemon all channels.
The next morning, Rose is frustrated that the Wi-Fi and TV are still down, which has prevented her from watchingthe series finale ofFriends. Amanda notices four news alerts on her phone, two of which are about the blackout affectingthe East Coast, the third alert about a hacker attack being behind the power outage and the final one beginning with the word "Breaking" and containing corrupted or encrypted text. Rose sees a much larger herd of deer standing motionless in the backyard.
Attempting to learn about the disruptions and fix the Wi-Fi, Clay drives to town while G.H. heads to his neighbor's house. Clay gets lost and exits his car to look around, missing a few seconds of clear reception on the radio broadcasting news of the cyber attack having catastrophic environmental effects inthe South. He finds aSpanish-speaking woman seeking help, but abandons her and eventually encounters a drone dropping leaflets written inArabic. G.H. searches the neighbor's home, finds asatellite phoneinside, and finds there is no signal from the satellites. On the beach nearby, he discovers the wreckage of a plane crash just before narrowly escaping anotherairlinercrashing.
Rose walks with Archie in the woods, where they come across an empty shed and Archie removes atickfrom his ankle on the way back. Returning to the house, G.H. confides to Amanda the events he has witnessed. He thinks that satellite connectivity has been disrupted, but he is cut off by a loud, shrill noise that lasts several seconds. Amanda recalls the man stockpiling supplies, whom G.H. assumes to be Danny, his contractor. Clay returns shaken with the leaflet, which Archie partially translates as "Death to America". The Sandfords decide to drive to Amanda's sister in New Jersey but find the expressway jammed with collided brand-newself-drivingTeslas; they narrowly avoid more incoming Tesla cars continuing to drive into the pile-up, and are forced to return to G.H.'s house.
Throughout the night, Ruth asks Clay provocative questions and they later discoverflamingosin the pool. Amanda and G.H. establish a friendly bond but they are cut off by a second shrill noise, and the power fails. Later, Rose tells Amanda a version of theparable of the drowning manfrom an episode ofThe West Wing.
The next morning, Archie's teeth inexplicably fall out. Believing it is related to the tick bite, G.H. suggests visiting Danny for medicine. Rose is now missing and G.H. and Clay take Archie to visit Danny, while Amanda and Ruth search for Rose. At the shed, the two are confronted by an even larger herd of deer, which they scare away. G.H. and Clay attempt to convince Danny to help Archie, which results in an armed standoff between G.H. and Danny. Clay intervenes, convincing Danny to help Archie. Danny informs them that another neighbor may be equipped with an underground bunker and suggests that the shrill noises which have most likely led to Archie's teeth falling out result from use ofmicrowave weapons.
Shaken, G.H. tells Clay and Archie that on the basis of his work with military contractors that the country is in a three-stage campaign leading first to breakdown of social order and resulting in acoup d'étator civil war. At the same time, Amanda and Ruth watchNew York Citybeing bombed. Rose then finds the neighbor's house with the bunker. Inside, a computer message warns of attacks by rogue military elements and elevated radiation levels in many U.S. cities. She finds a DVD ofFriendsand watches the series finale.
Netflixwon abidding warfor the rights to thenovel by Rumaan Alamin July 2020, withSam Esmailattached to write and direct.Julia RobertsandDenzel Washingtonwere set to star in and produce the film.[3]
Former U.S. PresidentBarackand First LadyMichelle Obamaexecutive-produced the film through theirHigher Ground Productionsbanner. Obama included the novel on his 2021 summer reading list.[4]
Obama offered Esmail his thoughts on the screenplay during the writing process. Esmail said, "He had a lot notes [sic] about the characters and the empathy we would have for them. I have to say he is a big movie lover, and he wasn't just giving notes about things that were from his background. He was giving notes as a fan of the book, and he wanted to see a really good film."[4]
In September 2021,Mahershala Alihad been cast in the film, replacing Washington, who had left the project.[5]Ethan HawkeandMyha'la Herroldjoined in January 2022.[6][7]
Filming began in April 2022 onLong Island,[8]in a home designed by The Up Studio.[9]Additional filming took place inKatonah, New York, in May 2022.[10]
Mac Quaylecomposed an original score for the film which consisted of nine notes and was inspired by French composerOlivier Messiaenand hisMessiaen modes, namely Mode 3. Quayle said, "I started playing around with them and I found that Mode 3, which is essentially a scale, was producing a really interesting harmonic feeling," going on to say "And I got this idea that I might do the entire film in this one mode... I didn't know if it would carry me through the entire film, but it did."[11]
Esmail tried to pick songs that had not been used on TV or film before as he was worried viewers would have associations with those songs that would "interfere or complicate what the scene's about or what the viewer is feeling as they're watching the scene". For example, Esmail chose "Too Close" byNext, a song that he felt was "really funny and sweet at the same time" and had not been overused in film, for a scene that "goes from lighthearted and playful to sad and dark within a matter of a minute".[11]
Leave the World Behindhad its world premiere as the opening film of theAFI Feston October 25, 2023, with the cast not attending due to the2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[12]It was released in limited theaters on November 22, before streamingNetflixon December 8, 2023.[13]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 73% of 161 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website's consensus reads: "An exceptionally well-acted apocalyptic thriller,Leave the World Behindsteadily draws the viewer in despite its leisurely pace and somewhat simplistic messaging."[14]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[15]
In a positive review forThe Washington Post, Michael O'Sullivan wrote, "It plays like anM. Night Shyamalanmovie, but without the supernatural element and with a thick vein of social critique running throughout. What happens may be extreme, but it feels based on mundane reality."[16]Wenlei Ma writing forThe Sunday Timescalled the film "jittery and suspenseful", and that some overhead cinematography "emphasises that we're all puppets in someone's else  [sic] marionette theatre ... we're not in control, but Esmail is of his startling, character-driven doomsday story".[17]
Bilge EbiriforVulturecompared the film unfavorably to Alam's book: "every change made for the adaptation happens to be for the worse. ... the film doesn't demonstrate any kind of interest in, or affection for, its characters. ... This feels more like a collection of cool ideas than scenes that belong to the same emotional and consequential continuum."[18]Alissa Wilkinson forThe New York Timeswrote, "After a while, the movie plays like a bulleted list of everything wrong with America ... the narrative tension dulls into passivity, both for us and for the characters", and that the "ending seems like a punchline."[19]
Esmail said he hoped the film's ending would provoke conversation: "...the expectation is at the end of [traditional disaster] films, your cast of characters overcomes the disaster and the world reverts back to some sane semblance of normalcy. I knew that I wasn't going to do that."[20]
From December 4 to December 10, 2023, the film topped the streaming charts and was the number one film on Netflix, with 41.7 million views.[21]By the end of 2023, it had accumulated 121 million views.[22]In January 2024, the film entered Netflix's most popular films of all-time list at eighth place, scoring 136.3 million views in its first 52 days.[23]As of September 2024, it is placed as the fifth most popular film in English of all time on Netflix, with 143.4 million views.[24]
The plot of the filmLeave the World Behindis anapocalypticscenario in which external threats and internal strife break down societal order. The narrative portrays humanity and modern civilization as vulnerable to coordinated attacks.[28]
As the white parents prepare for bed at a vacation rental, the property owner, a black father and his daughter unexpectedly arrive at their doorstep, fleeing from a dire situation unfolding inManhattan, potentially affecting the entire United States. Withinternet,phones, and television all down, the family's confusion mounts. However, aWall Streetspeculator, forewarned by a wealthy client, understands the gravity of the situation. America's enemies have launched a three-stage attack: first, they disablecommunication networksand infrastructure; second, they spreadmisinformation; and finally, they rely on Americans to descend into a kind ofsurvival-of-the-fittestchaos. The ensuing pandemonium sees cities in flames and people turning on each other, marking thecollapse of society.[28]
The oil tanker namedWhite Lionrunning aground helps set the stage for the apocalyptic turn, immediately creating a sense of mystery and impending doom. Once the characters become aware of a widespread disaster, Ethan Hawke's character Clay Sandford attempts to connect the grounding of the tanker with an attack on America. Clay justifiably believes that whoever attacked the U.S. in "Leave the World Behind" would want to disrupt the Americanoil supply. However, the ship's name hints at a deeper meaning.The White Lionis a reference to the ship attributed to beginningslavery in America, symbolizing the arrival of the firstAfrican slavesto Virginia in 1619.[29]
In the novel, Amanda's character is "more alarmed by the fact that the [Scotts] are Black—'those people didn't look the sort to own such a beautiful house,'[30]she and husband Clay question how theirAirbnblandlords could bewealthyandblack, and they were described as arriving in a car that was "not so new as to be luxurious or so old as to be bohemian".[31]
Narrative techniquesframe the contemporary disaster throughout the film within a broader context of the enduring moral reckoning aroundracismandpoverty in the United States.[29][32][33]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
