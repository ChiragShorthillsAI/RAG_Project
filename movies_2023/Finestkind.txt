Finestkindis a 2023 Americancrime thrillerfilm written and directed byBrian Helgeland. The film starsBen Foster,Toby Wallace,Jenna Ortega, andTommy Lee Jones.[2][3][4][5]
On a visit toNew Bedford, Massachusetts, college alumnus Charlie pays a visit to his elder half-brother Tom Eldrige, ascallopfisherman. Disillusioned with his systematic life, he asks Tom to take him on his upcoming fishing excursion, which he reluctantly agrees to. Sailing out on Tom's boat, theHarmony, Charlie is introduced to the crew—Nunes a.k.a. "Nunesy", family man Costa, and drug addict Skeemo. Hours into the voyage, theHarmonysuffers an internal explosion on rough seas, causing it to sink; the crew narrowly survives.
Upon being rescued the following morning, the five go to a bar to celebrate their ordeal, where Charlie encounters Mabel, a small-time drug dealer. His wealthy father, Gary Sykes, who tracks him down, attempts to convince him against fishing, but is bluntly rebuffed. Later, the brothers visit Tom's employers; there, both Tom and his egotistic boss accuse each other of incompetence, which leads to a brawl, causing Tom to be fired.
Later, Tom is approached by his aging father, Ray, who asks him to captain his boat, theFinestkind, on a dredging excursion in his stead, which Tom reluctantly acquiesces to. Later, at a house party hosted by Costa, Tom informs the others of the assignment; whilst there, Mabel takes Charlie for a drug run, during which he meets her skeptical mother. After the meeting ends poorly, he crashes at Mabel's apartment, where the two share a passionate night. Waking up late the next day, the two learn that Tom is about to leave without him, in response, Mabel rushes Charlie to the harbor, barely making it to theFinestkindjust before it departs. At sea, Tom decides to take the boat to illegally fish in Canadian waters in the hopes of securing more lucrative catches. The gambit nearly succeeds, but the boat accidentally ensnares itself in its fishing dredge and is spotted by a Canadian pilot who reports them.
Returning to port, theFinestkindis seized by U.S. authorities, much to the crew's dismay. Resolving to tell Ray of the incident, the two learn he is hospitalized with terminal stomach cancer—the actual reason for his absence. Not wanting his father to die without his beloved boat, Tom approaches his former employers to bail him out on the $100,000 fine that had been conditioned for the boat's release but is scornfully rejected. Sympathetic to their plight, Mabel arranges for the crew to participate in a one-time heroin smuggling gig with Weeks, her mother's partner. Despite the crew's acceptance, Tom fears of being caught but is convinced otherwise.
The crew sail out to the drop spot, where a plane delivers the heroin. Returning to port, the brothers head off alone to meet Weeks, but are cornered by rival dealers, who make away with the heroin after subduing them. Realizing they had been betrayed, Tom accuses Mabel of snitching on them, leading to a fight, which is witnessed by Ray. Consequently, Weeks corners the crew at Costa's home, having taken Costa's pregnant wife hostage. He forces them to deliver the heroin by the following morning, promising them death should they fail; he reveals that he had assaulted Mabel.
After they leave, the crew helps Costa's wife, whereupon Tom disappears. Whilst searching for him, Ray corners Charlie, who divulges their quagmire. The next morning, Charlie meets Nunesy, who tells him that Tom had taken a pistol with him to see Skeemo. Realizing Skeemo was the snitch, Charlie races over to his place, arriving just as Tom is about to execute him. Nevertheless, Charlie manages to convince him otherwise, opting to take their chances instead.
Ray appears at Weeks' meeting point with an offer of $15,000 in exchange for leaving the crew alone. When Weeks refuses and proceeds to mock him, Ray shoots and kills him and two associates, just as the brothers arrive. Ray explains to an emotionally moved Tom that he would do anything to save him.
Gary agrees to pay the fine on the boat, realizing he cannot change his son, whilst Mabel prepares to enter college. Finally free, the crew prepare to sail on theFinestkindonce more, while an incarcerated, yet happy, Ray watches from a distance.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
