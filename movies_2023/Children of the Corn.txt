Children of the Cornis a 2020 Americansupernaturalslasherfilm written and directed byKurt Wimmer. It starsElena Kampouris,Kate Moyer,Callan MulveyandBruce Spence. The film is the third adaptation of Stephen King's short story "Children of the Corn" (1977) and the eleventh installment in theChildren of the Cornseries. It is the first film based on King's story to be theatrically released sinceChildren of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice(1992).
The film is set in Rylstone, a small farming community whose principal crop, corn, is failing despite attempts to fix things with GMOs and herbicides. The adults agree to destroy their crops so they can receive acrop subsidyfrom the government, infuriating Eden, an orphan being raised by the town preacher. One of the local teenagers, Boleyn, schemes with her friends to hold a mock trial that night where they will hold the adults accountable. They enlist Eden's assistance, but are horrified when this results in Eden imprisoning and slaughtering several adults. The remaining adults are then forced into the corn as a sacrifice for a monstrous green entity called "He Who Walks" while Eden rants about how they will eradicate all adults from the world.
Boleyn is knocked unconscious; when she awakens she discovers that they intend to sacrifice her as well. She is able to escape, but is soon recaptured by Eden, who intends to kill her using a cattle gun. Boleyn is granted a cigarette as a final wish; however, the teen instead uses the lighter to set fire to the highly flammable corn. This successfully kills "He Who Walks"; however, Eden also perishes while trying to save the monster. The following day Boleyn returns to the fields to survey the damage, where she is devoured by Eden, who has been transformed into a monster akin to "He Who Walks".
In 2020, the project was announced to be a remake ofChildren of the Corn.[3]ProducerLucas Fosterlater elaborated that it was going to be a new adaptation to King's story with "almost nothing to do with" the 1984 film.[4]
Principal photographybegan inNew South Walesin April 2020, at the beginning of theCOVID-19 pandemic, andwrappedthat June.[4][5]Thevisual effectswere produced byDigital Domain, who also executive produced.[6]
Children of the Cornpremiered inSarasota, Florida on October 23, 2020.[7]The film was originally scheduled to be released theatrically in fall 2022, but was pushed back.[8]In January 2023,RLJE Filmsand streaming serviceShudderacquired distribution rights. The film was released in an 18-day theatrical window starting on March 3, 2023, and was released on demand on March 21, 2023.[9][10]It was also released on Blu-ray and DVD on May 9, 2023.[11]The film was released on Shudder on June 30.[12]
The film received negative reviews from critics. On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 12% of 58 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.2/10. The website's consensus reads: "Bereft of a single kernel of fear or excitement, thisChildren of the Cornsuggests the franchise is irrevocably lost in a maize of sub-mediocrity."[13]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 22 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[14]
Owen GleibermanofVarietywrote, "Like a virus that keeps coming back but growing weaker each time,Children of the Cornis now a horror movie that lacks the strength to infect you with even a speck of fear."[15]Meagan Navarro ofBloody Disgustinggave the film a score of 1/5, writing, "Expectations might be low at this stage of the franchise, but nothing aboutChildren of the Cornworks. Motivations are confusing at best, and Wimmer never manages to set-up who these characters are, let alone establish any rules or worldbuilding that would explain why they behave so erratically... It does get one thing right, though; maybe it's time to just let it all die."[16]Polygon's Katie Rife wrote, "IfChildren of the Cornwere just an empty-headed hybrid of a creature feature and a killer-kids movie, it might have been kind of fun. What really brings this remake down is the fact that it sets up so many sociopolitical themes that Wimmer never follows up on, raising the question of whether he stumbled onto them by accident."[17]
Jeff Ewing ofInversecalled the film "a mixed bag", praising the leads' performances, but noted, "The script's logic could use some retooling, the supporting performances are inconsistent, and more attention could be paid to making it feel like a town instead of a limited collection of shooting locations."[18]

In August 1994, Image entered theCD-ROMmarket, releasing movies on the CD-ROM format.[5]
As the 1990s came to a close and Laserdiscs gave way to DVDs, Image re-focused on the fledgling format that quickly came to dominate the home video marketplace. While studios were busy managing the transition from VHS to DVD, Image began to acquire DVD rights to long-form music concert programs, television programming, foreign films and a broad array of special interest programming fromGRB Entertainment,20th Television/Foxstar Productions,Orion Pictures,Playboy Home EntertainmentandUniversal Pictures, all of which were being ignored by the major studios and music labels.[6]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
