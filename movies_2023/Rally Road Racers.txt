Vainglorious does, however, agree to challenge Zhi in an upcomingrally racefor the fate of the village.
Gnash (J. K. Simmons), a retiredgoatracer-turned-mechanic, reluctantly agrees to help Zhi train, out of a sense of duty to Zhi's deceased mother.

Williamsand Neil Braun.[1]The studio has offices inVancouver, British Columbia,CanadaandEaling StudiosinLondon,England,United Kingdom.Starz Distributionowns a minority stake in the studio.
The studio was founded in 2002 byJohn H.

The company was part of the then-new "pipeline-free" trend (reported byVarietyin 2006[5]) in animation production, where the companies did not keep the talent on  payroll and instead were "establishing a team from scratch to execute each new feature", allowing them to secure tax breaks from the governments. For example, the feature "Valiant" was produced in the UK in order to collect the tax incentives there. With UK incentives ending, the production (for "Space Chimps") moved to Canada (Vancouver).[6]

She appeared in the 2011 music video forSouth KoreanbandBIGBANG's "Tonight".[9]While pursuing an acting career in Hollywood, she changed her name to "Chloe Bennet," after having trouble booking gigs with her last name. According to Bennet, using her father's first name rather than his last name avoids difficulties being cast as an ethnicAsian Americanwhile respecting her father.[6][10]
From 2012 to 2013, she had a recurring supporting role in theABCdrama seriesNashvilleas Hailey.[11]In December 2012, she was cast as a series regular on the ABC seriesAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,[11][12][13]which premiered on September 24, 2013.

"I think what's really dangerous with what, continuously, is happening with Asian-Americans in Hollywood is there's a narrative that white Hollywood, or just any other ethnicity really in Hollywood gives to Asian-Americans that, 'You're the butt of the joke.' They're determining that we're the nerds, that we're the shy girls or that the guy that can't be sexy because he's an Asian man."
In 2018, she revealed that she has hadanxietyandADHDsince childhood.[24]
Bennet has described the American film and television industry as racist against Asian Americans and other people of Asian descent. In a 2016 interview, she noted, "Oh, the first audition I went on after I changed my name [from Wang to Bennet], I got booked. So that's a pretty clear little snippet of how Hollywood works."[25]
In September 2017, after actorEd Skreinstepped down from his role as MajorBen Daimioin the then-in production filmHellboyfollowing backlash over the fact that Skrein, a white actor, was playing Daimio, a character who isJapanese-Americanin theHellboycomics, Bennet wrote a since-deleted post onInstagramin which she applauded Skrein's decision, and addressed her own experiences as an actress of Asian descent in Hollywood, saying, "Changing my last name doesn't change the fact that my BLOOD is half Chinese, that I lived in China, speak Mandarin or that I was culturally raised both American and Chinese. It means I had to pay my rent, and Hollywood is racist and wouldn't cast me with a last name that made them uncomfortable."[25]
In an interview for the 2024 showInterior Chinatown, Bennet said that her Chinese heritage is "always a part of every role that [she's] done". She described her upbringing as "very culturally Chinese". However, she said that she often views work as a "very 'white' thing" in which she often has to assimilate, and theInteriorset was the first one where she heard Mandarin being spoken and was surrounded by a largely Asian cast and crew.[26]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
