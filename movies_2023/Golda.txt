It received its world premiere at the2023 Berlin International Film Festivalon February 20, 2023. It was released in the United States byBleecker Streetand Shivhans Pictures on August 25, 2023, and in the United Kingdom and Ireland byVertical Entertainmentand MetFilm Distribution on October 6, 2023.

In October 1973,Mossadreceives intelligence implying that Egypt and Syria are preparing to commence a military campaign against Israel, which it promptly relays to theIsraeli prime minister,Golda Meir. Golda is dismissive of the intelligence, noting her inability to initiate a counter-plan without the support of herdefense minister,Moshe Dayan, who too, is equally speculative.
On 6 October, the day ofYom Kippur, Golda's inner circle informs her that Egypt has amassed a large force opposite theSuez Canal, concluding that hostilities would begin by sundown. Although realizing her tardiness in adequately preparing, Golda refuses to make a pre-emptive move, instead ordering a partial mobilization to face the threat; nevertheless, the attack commences early, which surprises her. Elsewhere, Dayan, who had been sent to inspect theGolan Heights, is horrified to discover that Syria has launched a thorough attack against the ill-prepared Israeli troops. Dazed, he attempts to resign, but Golda talks him out of it, nonetheless, she loses her confidence in him.
Between 7–8 October, with Egypt and Syria making gains into Israel,IDF chief of staffLt. Gen.David Elazarproposes to relieve Israeli fortifications in theSinai Peninsulausing the162nd Divisionled by Maj. Gen.Avraham Adan. Despite opposition from Mossad chiefZvi Zamir, the plan proceeds, but the Egyptians defeat the Israeli force. The next day, with the Syrian offensive having slowed, Dayan proposes an air strike onDamascusto put pressure on Egypt. However, with a shortage of planes, theIAFis unable to proceed; in response, Golda requestsU.S. secretary of stateHenry Kissingerto provide surplus jets, which he reluctantly agrees to.
On the fifth day, amidst increasing tensions, Maj. Gen.Ariel Sharonproposes an operation to cross the canal using the 143rd Division to challenge the EgyptianSecondandThird Armies. Zvi informs Golda that the Egyptian 4th and 21st Divisions would cross the canal in two days, leavingCairoundefended in the event of an attack. Per the intelligence, the Egyptians cross the canal and are met with resistance from Israeli tank forces led by Lt. Gen.Haim Bar-Levand are defeated.
On 15 October, Sharon’s forces cross the canal at an undefended point called the "Chinese Farm". They are ambushed by Egyptian units, regardless, they maintain their positions. Meanwhile, Elazar prepares to barricade the Third Army by cutting Suez from Cairo, which would accordingly force Egypt into negotiations. Concurrently, Kissinger pays a private visit to Golda and urges her to accept a ceasefire. Golda proceeds with her plan anyway, which finally forces Egypt into talks.
By the twentieth day, both sides agree to further diplomatic talks and to exchange POWs, effectively concluding the conflict. However, Zvi privately informs Golda thatIDF military intelligencechief Maj. Gen.Eli Zeirahad neglected to properly monitor signals intelligence from the Egyptian side, which allowed Israel to be attacked unawares; although appalled, she chooses to bear the blame instead to shield the IDF from controversy. Despite the victory, the conflict's intensity inflicts an emotional toll on the aged Golda, who is stricken with cancer.
One year later, in 1974, Golda testifies before theAgranat Commissionfor her conduct during the war. She states off the record that despite her initial uncertainty, she had genuinely felt that war was certain. Four years later, on 8 December 1978, a bedridden Golda dies watching footage of her meeting with Egyptian presidentAnwar Sadata year earlier.
The film's monologue informs that the commission cleared Golda of any wrongdoing and that she lived to see the signing of theCamp David Accords, the first formal measures of peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.

AThe New York Timesreview by Amy Nicholson concluded that against the backdrop of a surprise attack on Israel, the script, by Nicholas Martin, focuses on the haunting body count rather than the righteousness of the conflict, where one is “left with a sense that the stress of those thousands of lives cut short may have killed her (Golda) too.”[27]

While with the RSC, she played Castiza inTrevor Nunn's 1966 staging ofThe Revenger's Tragedy, Diana inAll's Well That Ends Well(1967), Cressida inTroilus and Cressida(1968), Rosalind[31]inAs You Like It(1968), Julia inThe Two Gentlemen of Verona(1970), Tatiana inGorky'sEnemiesat theAldwych(1971), and the title role inMiss JulieatThe Other Place(1971). She also appeared in four productions, directed byBraham Murrayfor Century Theatre at the University Theatre in Manchester, between 1965 and 1967.[32]
In 1970, the director and producerJohn Goldschmidtmade a documentary film,Doing Her Own Thing, about Mirren during her time with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Made forATV, it was shown on the ITV network in the UK.

In 1976, she appeared withLaurence Olivier,Alan BatesandMalcolm McDowellin a production ofHarold Pinter'sThe Collectionas part of theLaurence Olivier Presentsseries.
Sally Beaumanreported, in her 1982 history of the RSC, that Mirren—while appearing in Nunn'sMacbeth(1974), and in a letter toThe Guardiannewspaper—had sharply criticised both theNational Theatreand the RSC for their lavish production expenditure, declaring it "unnecessary and destructive to the art of the Theatre", and adding, "The realms of truth, emotion and imagination reached for in acting a great play have become more and more remote, often totally unreachable across an abyss of costume and technicalities..." This started a big debate, and led to a question in parliament. There were no discernible repercussions for this rebuke of the RSC.[33][34]
At theWest End'sRoyal Court Theatrein September 1975, she played the role of a rock star named Maggie inTeeth 'n' Smiles, a musical play byDavid Hare; she reprised the role the following year in a revival of the play atWyndham's Theatrein May 1976.

That same year she also won acclaim for her performance in the title role ofJohn Webster'sThe Duchess of Malfi, a production of Manchester'sRoyal Exchange Theatrewhich was later transferred toThe RoundhouseinChalk Farm, London. Reviewing her portrayal forThe Sunday Telegraph,Francis Kingwrote: "Miss Mirren never leaves it in doubt that even in her absences, this ardent, beautiful woman is the most important character of the story." In her performance as Moll Cutpurse inThe Roaring Girl—at theRoyal Shakespeare Theatrein January 1983, and at theBarbican Theatrein April 1983—she was described as having "swaggered through the action with radiant singularity of purpose, filling in areas of light and shade that evenThomas MiddletonandThomas Dekkeromitted." –Michael Coveney,Financial Times, April 1983.[35]During this time, Mirren took roles inCaligula(1979),[36][37]The Long Good Friday(1980)—co-starring withBob Hoskinsin what was her breakthrough film role,[38]Excalibur(1981),2010(1984),White Nights(1985),The Mosquito Coast(1986),Pascali's Island(1988) andWhen the Whales Came(1989).

At the beginning of 1989, Mirren co-starred withBob Peckat theYoung Vicin the London premiere of theArthur Millerdouble-bill,Two Way Mirror, performances which prompted Miller to remark: "What is so good about English actors is that they are not afraid of the open expression of large emotions. British actors like to speak. In London, there's a much more open-hearted kind of exchange between stage and audience" (interview bySheridan Morley:The Times11 January 1989).[39]InElegy for a Ladyshe played the svelte proprietress of a classy boutique, while as the blonde hooker inSome Kind of Love Storyshe was "clad in a Freudian slip and shifting easily from waif-like vulnerability to sexual aggression, giving the role a breathy Monroesque quality".[40]
Mirren is known for her role as detective Jane Tennison in the widely viewedPrime Suspect, a multiple award-winning television drama series that was noted for its high quality and popularity. Her portrayal of Tennison won herthree consecutive British Academy Television Awards for Best Actressbetween 1992 and 1994 (making her one of four actors to have received three consecutiveBAFTA TV Awardsfor a role, alongsideRobbie Coltrane,Julie WaltersandMichael Gambon).[41]Primarily due toPrime Suspect, in 2006 Mirren came 29th onITV's poll ofTV's 50 Greatest Starsvoted by the British public.[42]A further stage breakthrough came in 1994, in anYvonne Arnaud Theatreproduction bound for the West End, whenBill Brydencast her as Natalya Petrovna inIvan Turgenev'sA Month in the Country.

The production received poor reviews;The Guardiancalled it "plodding spectacle rarely informed by powerful passion", whileThe Daily Telegraphsaid "the crucial sexual chemistry on which any great production ultimately depends is fatally absent".[46]In 2000Nicholas Hytner, who had worked with Mirren on the film version ofThe Madness of King George, cast her as Lady Torrance in his revival ofTennessee Williams'Orpheus Descendingat theDonmar Warehousein London. Michael Billington, reviewing forThe Guardian, described her performance as "an exemplary study of an immigrant woman who has acquired a patina of resilient toughness but who slowly acknowledges her sensuality."[47]
She portrayedAyn Randin the television film,The Passion of Ayn Rand(1999), where her performance won her anEmmy;Door to Door(2002); andThe Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone(2003). At the National Theatre in November 2003 she again won praise playing Christine Mannon ("defiantly cool, camp and skittish",Evening Standard; "glows with mature sexual allure",Daily Telegraph) in a revival ofEugene O'Neill'sMourning Becomes Electradirected byHoward Davies. "This production was one of the best experiences of my professional life, The play was four and a half hours long, and I have never known that kind of response from an audience ... It was the serendipity of a beautifully cast play, with great design and direction, It will be hard to be in anything better."[28]She played the title role inJean Racine'sPhèdreat the National in 2009, in a production directed byNicholas Hytner.

Isaac Liev Schreiber was born on October 4, 1967, inSan Francisco,California,[1]the son of Heather Milgram,[2]a painter, and Tell Schreiber, an actor and carpenter.[3][4]His father wasProtestantand his mother isJewish.[5][6][7]His maternal grandfather, Alex Milgram, emigrated fromUkraine. Milgram, who was the most significant male in Schreiber's youth, played thecelloand ownedPierre-Auguste Renoiretchings, and made his living by delivering meat to restaurants.[8][9][10][11]His mother, who is an aficionada ofclassical musicandRussian literature, has said that she named Live after her favorite Russian author,Leo Tolstoy, while his father has stated that Schreiber was named after the doctor who saved his mother's life. His family nickname, adopted when Schreiber was a baby, is "Huggy".[12][8]
When Schreiber was one year old, his family moved to theunincorporated rural communityofWinlaw, in the southern interior ofBritish Columbia.[13]Over the next four years, his mother was hospitalized on several occasions and underwent therapy related to a bad experience onLSDthat she had near the beginning of her marriage (in San Francisco), according to Schreiber's father.[8]After Schreiber's father threatened to have Schreiber's mother admitted to amental institution, Schreiber was kidnapped by his mother, eventually leading to his mother gaining full custody of him.[14]Theysquattedon theLower East Sidein New York City.[15]
Schreiber has described his mother as a "far-outSocialist Labor Partyhippiebohemianfreakwho hung out withWilliam Burroughs".[8][16][17]She was "a highly cultured eccentric" who earned a living by splitting her time between driving a cab and creatingpapier-mâchépuppets." In 1983, his mother bought him amotorcycleon his 16th birthday to "promote fearlessness."[8]The criticJohn Lahrwrote in a 1999New Yorkerprofile that, "To a large extent, Schreiber's professional shape-shifting and his uncanny instinct for isolating the frightened, frail, goofy parts of his characters are a result of being forced to adapt to his mother's eccentricities. It's both his grief and his gift."[8]
Her bohemian proclivities led to actions such as making Schreiber take the Hindu name Shiva Das, wear yoga shirts, consume a vegetarian diet, and briefly attendSatchidanandaAshraminPomfret, Connecticut, when he was 12.[18]Schreiber's mother also forbade her son from seeing color films. As a result, his favorite actors wereCharlie Chaplin, Andrew Cartwright, andBasil Rathbone. In retrospect, Schreiber said in a 2008 interview that he appreciates his mother's influences, saying: "Since I've had Sasha, I've completely identified with everything my mother went through raising me ... and I think her choices were inspired."[19]
Subsequently, Schreiber attendedFriends Seminary, a Quaker school.[20]In high school, Liev played thebass clarinet.[21][22]
Schreiber went on to attendHampshire CollegeinAmherst, Massachusetts, where he began his acting training at theUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst, through theFive Collegesconsortium.

In 1995 he had supporting roles in the independent filmsMad LoveandParty Girl. His first leading film roles in theGreg Mottolacomedy-dramaThe DaytrippersandNicole Holofcener'sWalking and Talkingwere both released in 1996. Following Schreiber's string of supporting roles in various independent films, his big break came when he played the accused murdererCotton Wearyin theScreamtrilogy of horror films. Though the success of theScreamtrilogy led Schreiber to roles in several big-budget studio pictures,Entertainment Weeklywrote in 2007 that "Schreiber is [still] best known for such indie gems asWalking and Talking,The Daytrippers, andBig Night."[26]
AfterScream,Schreiber was cast asOrson Wellesin theHBOfilmRKO 281(1999). Laura Fries ofVarietywrote of his performance, "Schreiber, as Welles, manages to capture the essence of a man of many passions, and creates a nice balance of hubris and self-loathing to give the part real depth".[27]He earned nominations for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or MovieandGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film. He then played supporting roles in several studio films, includingRon Howard's 1996 remake ofRansom, the 1999 filmThe Hurricane,A Walk on the Moon(1999), the 2000 film adaptation ofHamletstarringEthan Hawke, and as a spy inThe Sum of All Fears(2002) acting oppositeBen AffleckandMorgan Freeman.

In 2000, he went on to playLaertesin the filmHamlet, a modern adaptation of the play.[36]His performance in the title role ofHenry Vin a 2003 Central Park production of that play causedThe New Yorkermagazine critic John Lahr to expound upon his aptitude for playing Shakespeare characters. "He has a swiftness of mind," Lahr wrote, "which convinces the audience that language is being coined in the moment. His speech, unlike that of the merely adequate supporting cast, feels lived rather than learned."[37]
Schreiber toldThe New Yorkerin 1999, "I don't know that I want to be an actor for the rest of my life."

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
