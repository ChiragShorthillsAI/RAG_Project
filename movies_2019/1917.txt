DreamWorks Pictures(also known asDreamWorks SKGcommonly referred to asDreamWorks) is an Americanfilm studioanddistributionlabel ofAmblin Partners. It was originally founded on October 12, 1994, as a live-action and animationfilm studiobySteven Spielberg,Jeffrey Katzenberg, andDavid Geffen(which together form the SKG of DreamWorks SKG), of which they owned 72%. The studio formerly distributed its own and third-party films. It has produced or distributed more than ten films with box-office grosses of more than $100 million each.
DreamWorks Pictures was sold toViacom, parent ofParamount Picturesin February 2006 (this version is now named DW Studios). In 2008, DreamWorks announced its intention to end its partnership with Paramount and made a deal to produce films with India'sReliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group,[2]re-creating DreamWorks Pictures as an independent entity. The following year, DreamWorks entered into a distribution agreement withWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, wherein Disney would distribute DreamWorks films through theTouchstone Pictureslabel; the deal continued until August 2016. Since October 2016,Universal Pictureshas distributed most of the films produced by DreamWorks Pictures. Currently, DreamWorks operates out of offices atUniversal Studios Hollywood.
DreamWorks is also distinct from itsformer animation division of the same name, which was spun off in 2004 and became a subsidiary ofNBCUniversalin 2016.[3]Spielberg's company continues to use the original DreamWorks trademarks under license from DreamWorks Animation.[4][5]
The original company was founded followingJeffrey Katzenberg's resignation fromThe Walt Disney Companyin 1994. Katzenberg approachedSteven SpielbergandDavid Geffenabout forming a live-action and animation film studio, which had not been done in decades due to the risk and expense, but all three were very successful. They agreed on three conditions: They would make fewer than nine movies a year, they would be free to work for other studios if they chose, and they would go home in time for dinner. They officially founded DreamWorks SKG on October 12, 1994, with financial backing of $33 million from each of the three partners[6]plus $500 million fromMicrosoftco-founderPaul Allen, and $300 million fromCJ GroupheiressMiky Lee, giving the CJ Group an 11% stake in DreamWorks; the deal was also initially understood to include distribution rights to DreamWorks films across Asia excluding Japan, although CJ ultimately handled rights for only China, South Korea and Hong Kong, with all other international territories handled byUnited International Pictures.[7][8][9]Their new studio was based at offices on theUniversal Studios lot, in the same bungalow asAmblin Entertainment. Despite access tosound stagesandsets, DreamWorks preferred to film motion pictureson location. Usually, however, the company would film in a soundstage or set in amajor studio.
In December 1994,DreamWorks Televisionwas formed after DreamWorks agreed to a $200 million seven-year television production joint venture withCapital Cities/ABC.[10]The company was set up to produce series for broadcast networks, cable channels and first run syndication, with nofirst-lookguarantee forABC, but financial incentives favored the network.[11]Their first show,Champions, was scheduled as a mid-season replacement for ABC. Dan McDermott was named the division's chief executive in June 1995.[12]DreamWorks Television's first success wasSpin Cityon ABC,[11]the parent company of which was bought byThe Walt Disney Companyin February 1996.[13]In 2002, the DreamWorks joint venture agreement with ABC ended. That agreement was replaced by a development agreement withNBC, with a first look clause.[11]In 2013, DreamWorks Television merged withAmblin Television.
In 1995,traditional animationartists fromAmblimationjoined the new studio, which led to DreamWorks buying part ofPacific Data Images, a company specializing in visual effects, and renaming it PDI/DreamWorks in 2000. Both were software divisions and would merge later on. By then, DreamWorks had the traditional animators working for their animation department, and the computer animators worked on CG films.Amblimationwould be shut down in 1997, leading the staff to joinDreamWorks Animation.[citation needed]The same year, DreamWorks Interactive, a computer and video game developer andjoint venturebetween DreamWorks andMicrosoft, was founded. On February 24, 2000,Electronic Artsannounced the acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive and merged it withEA PacificandWestwood Studiosto formEA Los Angeles, laterDanger Close Games.[citation needed]
In June 1995, DreamWorks announced that it had signed a $1 billion deal withMCA Inc.(then parent company ofUniversal Pictures) to distribute its theatrical releases in other countries and its home video releases worldwide over 10 years, while DreamWorks itself would distribute them for the company as a film production label in America.[14][15]MCA also bought a 2% stake in the company for $54 million.[16]
In 1996, the company's record label,DreamWorks Records, was founded, the first project of which wasGeorge Michael's albumOlder. The first band signed to the label waseels, who released their debut albumBeautiful Freakthat year. The record company never lived up to expectations, though, and was sold in October 2003 toUniversal Music Group, which operated the label asDreamWorks Nashville. That label was shut down in 2005 when its flagship artist,Toby Keith, departed to form his own label.[17]
In 1997, DreamWorks Pictures released its first three feature films,The Peacemaker, a film about terrorism;Amistad, Spielberg's first film for the studio about an African slave rebellion and the aftermath of the massacre; andMouse Hunt, the studio's first family film about two brothers trying to fight a mischievous mouse.[citation needed]
In 1998, theUnited States 9th Circuit Court of Appealsupheld a lawsuit against DreamWorks for trademark infringement by Dreamwerks Production Group, Inc.,[18]a company mostly specializing inStar Trekconventions.[19]The same year, DreamWorks Animation produced its first full-length animated features,AntzandThe Prince of Egypt, which were distributed by DreamWorks Pictures. DreamWorks Pictures continued to distribute DreamWorks Animation productions through their distribution name until 2004.
In 2000, DreamWorks was planning on building a studiobacklotafter buying 1,087 acres of land in thePlaya Vistaarea in Los Angeles. It was to be complete with 18sound stages, with many office buildings and a lake. There would also be new homes, schools, churches, and museums. The project was to be completed in 2001, but was cancelled for financial reasons.[20]Starting in 1999, DreamWorks won three consecutiveAcademy AwardsforBest PictureforAmerican Beauty,GladiatorandA Beautiful Mind(the latter two were co-productions with Universal Pictures). DreamWorks became the first new majorHollywoodmotion picture studio sinceRKO Pictureswas founded in 1928.Go Fish Pictures, a division of DreamWorks with the objective to distributeart-house,independentandforeignfilms, was founded in 2000. The division experienced success with theanimefilmsMillennium Actress(2003) andGhost in the Shell 2: Innocence(2004), respectively, which led them to venture into releasing live-action films, with the release ofThe Chumscrubber. However,The Chumscrubberwas a commercial and critical failure, which led DreamWorks to shut down the division in 2007 shortly after the release of the Japanese filmCasshern.[citation needed]In 2002, DreamWorks signed a deal with In Demand.[21]
For the period beginning October 1, 2004, to January 31, 2006, DreamWorks Pictures distributed its films in the North American domestic theatrical and worldwide television market, with international theatrical and worldwide home entertainment distribution by Universal Pictures.[22]On October 27, 2004, DreamWorks Animation was spun off into a separate public company.
David Geffen admitted that DreamWorks came close to bankruptcy twice. Under Katzenberg's watch, the studio suffered a $125 million loss onSinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas,[23]and also overestimated the DVD demand forShrek 2.[24]In 2005, out of their two large budget pictures,War of the Worldswas produced as a joint effort withParamount Pictureswhich was the first to reap a significant amount of profits, whileThe Islandbombed at the domestic box office but turned a profit internationally throughWarner Bros. Pictures.[23]
In December 2005, theoriginal Viacom, the then-parent of Paramount Pictures, agreed to purchase the live-action studio, still keeping the original name and producing/distribution name. The deal was valued at approximately $1.6 billion, an amount that included about $400 million in debt assumptions.[25]The acquisition of the live-action DreamWorks studio was completed by thesecond iteration of Viacom, which had recentlysplitfrom the original at the end of 2005, on February 1, 2006.[26]
On March 17, 2006, Viacom agreed to sell a controlling interest in the DreamWorks Pictures live-action library toSoros Strategic PartnersandDune EntertainmentII.[27]The film library was valued at $900 million. Paramount Pictures retained the worldwide distribution rights to those films, as well as various ancillary rights, including music publishing (the music publishing rights were later licensed toSony/ATV Music Publishingwhen the company acquired Viacom'sFamous Musicsubdivision), sequels and merchandising. The sale was completed on May 8, 2006.[28]On February 8, 2010, Viacom repurchased Soros' controlling stake in the DreamWorks Pictures library for around $400 million.[29]
In June 2008, it was reported that DreamWorks was looking for financing that would allow it to continue operations, but as an independent production company, once its deal with Paramount ended later that year.[30]Several public equity funds were approached for financing, includingBlackstone Group, Fuse Global,TPG Capitaland several others, but all passed on the deal given their understanding of the Hollywood markets. On September 22, 2008, it was announced that DreamWorks closed a deal with Indian investment firmReliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Groupto create a $1.2 billion stand-alone production company and end its ties with Paramount.[2]In January 2009, Spielberg entered a licensing agreement with DreamWorks Animation to use the DreamWorks trademarks, logo, and name for film productions and releases.[31]
On February 9, 2009, DreamWorks Pictures entered into a long-term, 30-picture distribution deal withWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, by which DreamWorks' films would be released through theTouchstone Picturesbanner, with Disney collecting a 10 percent distribution fee.[32]The deal also included co-funding via a $175 million loan byWalt Disney Studiosto DreamWorks for production and access to slots in Disney's pay television agreement, then withStarz.[32]The agreement was reported to have come after negotiations broke off with Universal Pictures just days earlier.[33]DreamWorks raised $325 million from Reliance Entertainment and an additional $325 million in debt in 2009.[1]On August 18, 2009, DreamWorks and Reliance signed a three-year, $825 million pact for up to six films a year.[34]
DreamWorks' slate of films in 2011,I Am Number Four,Cowboys & Aliens, andFright Nightfailed, whileThe Help,Real Steeland Spielberg'sWar Horsehad success at the box office. This left DreamWorks so financially drained that by 2011, DreamWorks was seeking additional funding from Reliance. Reliance gave a $200 million investment on April 10, 2012. Under the deal, DreamWorks Pictures scaled back production to three films per year and sought co-financiers on big budget films, such as20th Century Fox, who co-financed and handled international distribution forLincolnandBridge of Spies. DreamWorks continued to have Disney distribute and market their films.[1]On August 29, 2012, after re-negotiating their agreement with Disney, DreamWorks formed a deal withMister Smith Entertainmentto distribute its films internationally, while Disney would continue to distribute in North America, Latin America, Australia, Russia, and some territories in Asia.[35]
On September 2, 2015, it was reported that DreamWorks and Disney would not renew their distribution deal, which was set to expire in August 2016,[36][37]withThe Light Between Oceansbeing released in September as the final DreamWorks film distributed by Disney under their original distribution agreement.[38]During that time, DreamWorks was in early negotiations with Universal Pictures to distribute its upcoming films.[36][37]The contract allowing Spielberg to license the DreamWorks name and logo from Jeffrey Katzenberg's DreamWorks Animation was set to expire on January 1, 2016, leading to media speculation that Spielberg would not renew the pact.[31]Disney retained the film rights to the fourteen DreamWorks films it released,[39]as well as acquiring the "DreamWorks II Distribution Co. LLC" copyright from DreamWorks and Reliance on December 11, 2015.[40][41]
On December 16, 2015, Spielberg, Reliance,Entertainment OneandParticipant Mediapartnered to launch the content production companyAmblin Partners,[42]relegating DreamWorks to a brand for adult-themed films produced under the new company.[42][43]In addition to DreamWorks, the new company also would produce films under the Amblin Entertainment and Participant banners. On the same day, Amblin Partners announced a five-year distribution deal with Universal, under which the company's films would be distributed and marketed by either the main Universal label or its specialty label,Focus Features.[44][45]The Girl on the Trainwas the first film released under the new agreement,[39]though a few films, likeGhost in the ShellandThe Postwere released by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox respectively.
The original DreamWorks logo features a boy sitting on acrescent moonwith a fishing rod at night. The general idea for the logo was the idea of the company's founder,Steven Spielberg, who wanted aCGIimage. IllustratorRobert Huntwas commissioned to execute the idea as a painting, and he used his son as the model.[46]The logo was then turned into amotion graphicatIndustrial Light & Magic, in collaboration with Kaleidoscope Films, Dave Carson and Clint Goldman.[47]It was animated by ILM animation supervisorWes Takahashi.[48][49]Music accompanying the logo to start in many live-action DreamWorks films was specially composed byJohn Williams.
The reimagined animation logo had music adapted from the track "Fairytale" forShrek, based on thechildren's picture book of the same nameby authorWilliam Steig. The logo was composed byHarry Gregson-Williamsand made its debut in 2004, with the release ofShrek 2, a film which Gregson-Williams also composed. Two years after its acquisition byUniversal Picturesin 2016, the logo received a new fanfare composed byJohn Powelland incorporate some cues fromShrek 2and tones from Williams' original DreamWorks fanfare to create the music for the logo. The new fanfare debuted in 2019, with the release ofHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, a film for which Powell also composed. In 2022, Harry Gregson-Williams returned to compose a new version of the fanfare, with the debut ofPuss in Boots: The Last Wish.
DreamWorks Home Entertainmentwas a home media unit of DreamWorks Pictures and banner for other home media units, formed on March 10, 1998. Its releases were first distributed byUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment(then known as Universal Studios Home Entertainment and initially throughCIC Videointernationally). After DreamWorks Pictures was purchased byParamount Pictureson February 1, 2006, DreamWorks Home Entertainment was merged intoParamount Home Entertainmentand started being used as a label for films released under the live-action DreamWorks banner until it was shuttered in 2009 after when DreamWorks spun itself off from Paramount and became an independent company.
Their releases are currently distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment for the DW Studios, LLC catalog (with some catalogues - includingSmall Soldiers- currently licensed out overseas including theUnited Kingdom) andStudio Distribution Services, a joint venture between Universal Pictures Home Entertainment andWarner Bros. Home Entertainment, via UPHE for theStoryteller Distribution Co., LLCandDreamWorks Animationcatalogs, who released those catalogs on home video from 2016 to 2021 and 1999 to 2006/2019 to 2021, respectively, and through a distribution deal withSony Pictures Home Entertainmentfor the DreamWorks II Distribution Co., LLC catalog viaWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment,[b]who released that catalog on home video very briefly in 2024 after Disney released it from 2011 to 2024.

Mendes had an early interest in cinema and applied to theUniversity of Warwick(then the only university in the UK that offered an undergraduate film course), but was turned down.[11][14]He was then accepted byPeterhouse, Cambridge, where he graduated withfirst-class honoursin English.[10][15][16]Having developed a passion for theatre only in his late teens, Mendes became a member of theMarlowe Societyat Cambridge and directed several plays. His first play wasDavid Halliwell'sLittle Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs, and one of his later productions wasCyrano de BergeracwithTom HollanderandJonathan Cakeamong the cast members.[11][17]During his time at Cambridge, Mendes also became enthusiastic about cinema in earnest. He citedParis, Texas,Repo ManandTrue Storiesas three "seminal film moments" that influenced his stage and film career.[18]
Mendes was noted as a "brilliant schoolboy cricketer" byWisden Cricketers' Almanack, scoring 1,153 runs at 46 and taking 83 wickets at under 16 for Magdalen College School in 1983 and 1984.[19]He also played cricket forCambridge University Cricket Club,[20]and in 1997 played forShipton-under-Wychwoodin the final of the Village Cricket Cup, the only winner of theAcademy Award for Best Directorto have played atLord's.[21]

The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actor for Newman; it won for Best Cinematography.
In 2003, Mendes establishedNeal Street Productions, a film, television and theatre production company he would use to finance much of his later work. In 2005, Mendes directed the war filmJarhead, in association with his production company Neal Street Productions. The film received mixed reviews, with a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 61%, and a gross revenue of US$96.9 million worldwide. The film focused on the boredom and other psychological challenges of wartime.
In 2008, Mendes directedRevolutionary Road, starring his then-wife,Kate Winslet, along withLeonardo DiCaprioandKathy Bates. In a January 2009 interview, Mendes commented, about directing his wife for the first time, "I would open my eyes in the morning and there Kate would be, going, 'Great! You're awake! Now let's talk about the second scene.'"[36]Mendes's comedy-dramaAway We Goopened the 2009Edinburgh International Film Festival. The film follows a couple (John Krasinski,Maya Rudolph) searching North America for the perfect community in which to settle down and start a family. The film was well received by critics but performed poorly at the box office.
In 2010, Mendes co-produced a critically acclaimed documentary filmOut of the Ashesthat deals with cricket in Afghanistan.[37][38]On 5 January 2010, news broke that Mendes was employed to direct the 23rdEon Productionsinstalment of theJames Bondfranchise.[39]The film,Skyfall, was subsequently released on 26 October 2012, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Bond films. Mendes had been employed as a consultant on the film when it was in pre-production, and had remained attached to the project during the financial troubles of MGM. The film was a major critical and commercial success, becoming the 14th film to gross over $1 billion worldwide.[40][41]
In 2012, Mendes's Neal Street Productions produced the first series of theBBC Onedrama series,Call the Midwife, following it with a second season which began transmission in early 2013.[42]
After the success ofSkyfall, Mendes was asked if he was returning to direct the next Bond film. He responded, "I felt I put everything I possibly could into this film and it was the Bond film I wanted to make. And if I felt I could do the same again, then absolutely I would consider doing another one. But it is a big task and I wouldn't do it unless I knew I could."[43]It was reported that one reason Mendes was reluctant to commit was that one proposal involved making two films back-to-back, based on an idea bySkyfallwriterJohn Logan, which would have resulted in Mendes and other creative personnel being tied up with filming for around four years. It was reported in February 2013 that this idea had since been shelved and that the next two films would be stand-alone. Mendes said in an interview with film magazineEmpirein March 2013 that "it has been a very difficult decision not to accept Michael and Barbara's very generous offer to direct the next Bond movie." He cited, amongst other reasons, his commitments to the stage version ofCharlie and the Chocolate FactoryandKing Lear.[44]
However, on 29 May 2013, it was reported that Mendes was back in negotiations with producersMichael G. WilsonandBarbara Broccolito direct the next Bond film,[45]going back on his previous comments.[34][46]Wilson and Broccoli were willing to postpone production of the film to ensure Mendes's participation. On 11 July 2013, it was announced that Mendes would direct the 24th James Bond film,Spectre; it was released in October 2015.[47]This made him the first filmmaker sinceJohn Glento direct two Bond films consecutively. In April 2016, Mendes was named as the president of the jury for the73rd Venice International Film Festival.[48]
Mendes's next film, war epic1917, was released byUniversal Pictureson 25 December 2019 in the US and on 10 January 2020 in the UK.[49]Based in part on an account told to Mendes by his paternal grandfather,Alfred Mendes, it chronicles the story of two young British soldiers in the spring of 1917 at acritical pointduringWorld War I. Mendes went on to win theGolden Globe Award for Best Directorfor his achievement in directing; in his acceptance speech, he saluted his grandfather, as well as acknowledging the contribution to cinema of fellow nomineeMartin Scorsese, who was nominated forThe Irishman.[50]On 25 January 2020, he won theDirectors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film, following which he was installed by the press as the favourite to win theAcademy Award for Best Directorat the then approaching92nd Academy Awards.[51]However that plaudit went instead toBong Joon-hofor the South Korean filmParasite.[52]The two directors had shared the honours for directing at the25th Critics' Choice Awardsseveral weeks prior.[53]
In 2022, his next feature was the romantic dramaEmpire of Light, starringOlivia ColmanandMicheal Ward.[54]
In February 2024, it was reported that Mendes would produce and direct four separate feature films about each of the members ofthe Beatles, to be released in 2027. The films will be the first Beatles biopics to have full cooperation fromPaul McCartney,Ringo Starr, and the families ofJohn LennonandGeorge Harrison.[55]The films will starPaul Mescal(McCartney),[56]Barry Keoghan(Starr),[57]Joseph Quinn(Harrison),[58]and an actor to be named as Lennon.
Mendes has listedStanley Kubrick,the Coen brothers,Alfred Hitchcock,Martin Scorsese,Wim Wenders,Howard Davies,David Lynch,Peter Brook,Ingmar Bergman,Orson Welles, andFrancis Ford Coppolaas amongst his cinematic and theatrical influences. He citedParis, Texas,Repo ManandTrue Storiesas three "seminal film moments" that influenced his stage and film career, and is also heavily influenced by British comedy acts such asMonty Python,The Goons,Tommy Cooper, andMorecambe and Wise.[18]
Much of his film directing techniques were informed by his background in theatre, which consisted of meticulous attention to detail, slow pacing,pictorialistcomposition, close collaborations with actors, use of tranquil atmosphere, periods of wordlessvisual storytelling, and long takes. Even though he was widely known for his use of long takes inSpectreand1917, he has used them sinceAmerican Beauty.[59]His first two films established a reputation for him of utilising a visual style that was considered formalist and classical, preferring to shoot and stage scenes with theatrical-stylemise-en-sceneand use ofchiaroscuro. His third film,Jarhead, which would mark the first of a long-time collaboration between him and cinematographer Roger Deakins, served as a stylistic departure from the former two films as it relied heavily on a gritter feel with improvised dialogue and looser handheld close-ups. Despite this, it shared a similar attention to detail and flawed characters.[60]
Although he has tackled a variety of genres over the course of his career, Mendes has frequently explored themes of family and isolation in his work. The protagonists in his films are realistically flawed and struggle to fit in a world that is hostile towards them, a theme that was initially established inAmerican Beautyand would be further explored in his subsequent films, includingSkyfallandSpectre, and1917. The exploration of such themes are owed to his early childhood experiences, particularly with his parents, with the most direct being his grandfather and his mother serving as inspirations for the characters of Schofield and Hilary Small in1917andEmpire of Light, respectively.[61][62][63]
In an interview in 2014, Mendes explained his reasoning for exploring such themes: "If you are doing a play or a film, you have to have a secret way in if you are directing it. Sometimes it’s big things.American Beauty, for me, was about my adolescence.Road to Perditionwas about my childhood.Skyfallwas about middle-age and mortality."[64]
Mendes has been married to British Classical musicianAlison Balsomsince 5 January 2017. Their daughter was born in September 2017. Mendes has a son born on 22 December 2003 from his first marriage to actressKate Winsletand a stepson, born March 2010 from Balsom's previous relationship with conductorEdward Gardner. Mendes had a stepdaughter from Winslet's first marriage to filmmakerJim Threapleton.[65]
Mendes was appointed aKnight Bachelorin the2020 New Years Honours Listfor services to drama.[66]
In 2009, Mendes signed a petition in support of film directorRoman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his1977 chargefor drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.[67]
Mendes is an opponent ofBrexit. In 2017, he stated: "I'm afraid that the winds that were blowing before theFirst World Warare blowing again. There was this generation of men fighting then for a free andunified Europe, which we would do well to remember."[68]
In 2012, Mendes participated in theSight & Soundfilm polls of that year. Held every ten years to select thegreatest films of all time, contemporary directors were asked to select ten films of their choice.[69]

He has also campaigned on issues of asylum seekers, refugees' rights and the environment. He commissioned and co-authored a scientific paper on a study of the differences in brain structure between people of differing political orientations.[7]
Firth was born in the village ofGrayshott, Hampshire,[8]to parents who were academics and teachers. His mother, Shirley Jean (néeRolles), was acomparative religionlecturer at King Alfred's College (now theUniversity of Winchester); and his father, David Norman Lewis Firth, was a history lecturer at King Alfred's and education officer for theNigerian government.[9][10][11]Firth is the eldest of three children; his sisterKateis an actress and voice coach, and his brotherJonathanis also an actor.[12]His maternal grandparents wereCongregationalistministers and his paternal grandfather was anAnglicanpriest. They did overseasmissionarywork, and both of his parents were born and spent part of their childhoods inIndia.[13][14][15]
As a child, Firth frequently travelled due to his parents' work, spending some years inNigeria.[16]He also lived inSt. Louis,Missouri, when he was 11, which he has described as "a difficult time".[17]On returning to England, he attended the Montgomery of Alamein Secondary School (nowKings' School, Winchester), which at the time was a statecomprehensive schoolinWinchester, Hampshire. He was still an outsider and the target ofbullying. To counter this, he adopted the local working-class Hampshire accent and copied his schoolmates' lack of interest in schoolwork.[18]
Firth began attending drama workshops at age 10, and by 14 had decided to be a professional actor. Untilfurther education, he was not academically inclined, later saying in an interview, "I didn't like school. I just thought it was boring and mediocre and nothing they taught me seemed to be of any interest at all."[17]However, atBarton Peveril Sixth Form CollegeinEastleigh, he was imbued with a love ofEnglish literatureby an enthusiastic teacher, Penny Edwards, and has said that his two years there were among the happiest of his life.[19]
After hissixth formyears, Firth moved to London and joined theNational Youth Theatre, where he made many contacts and got a job in thewardrobe departmentat theNational Theatre.[18]He subsequently studied atDrama Centre London.[20]
Firth playedHamletin the Drama Centre end-of-year production, and in 1984, Firth made his film debut as Tommy Judd, Guy Bennett'sstraight,Marxistschool friend in thescreen adaptation of the play Another Country(withRupert Everettas Guy Bennett).[21][22]It was the start of a longstanding public feud between Firth and Everett, which was eventually resolved.[23]He starred with SirLaurence OlivierinLost Empires(1986), a TV adaptation ofJ. B. Priestley's novel.[24]
In 1987, Firth and other up-and-coming British actors such asTim Roth,Bruce PayneandPaul McGannwere dubbed the 'Brit Pack'.[25]That year, he appeared withKenneth Branaghin the film version ofJ. L. Carr'sA Month in the Country.[26]Sheila Johnston observed a theme in his early work of playing those traumatised by war.[27]He portrayed real-life British soldierRobert LawrenceMCin the 1988 BBC dramatisationTumbledown. Lawrence was severely injured at theBattle of Mount Tumbledownduring theFalklands War, and the film details his struggles to adjust to his disability whilst confronted with indifference from the government and public. It attracted controversy at the time, with criticism coming from left and right sides of the political spectrum.[27]Despite this, the performance brought Firth a Royal TV Society Best Actor Award, and a nomination for the 1989BAFTATelevision Award.[28]In 1989, he played the title role inMiloš Forman'sValmont, based onLes Liaisons dangereuses.[29]Released just a year afterDangerous Liaisons, it did not make a big impact in comparison. That year he also played a paranoid, socially awkward character in theArgentinianpsychological thrillerApartment Zero.[30]
Firth finally became a British household name through his role as the aloof, haughty aristocratMr. Darcyin the 1995BBCtelevision adaptation ofJane Austen'sPride and Prejudice. Producer Sue Birtwistle's first choice for the part, he was eventually persuaded to take it despite his unfamiliarity with Austen's writing.[31]He and co-starJennifer Ehlebegan a romantic relationship during the filming, which received media attention only after their separation.[32]Sheila Johnston wrote that Firth's approach to the part "lent Darcy complex shades of coldness, even caddishness, in the early episodes".[27]The series was an international success and unexpectedly elevated Firth to stardom[32]—in some part due to a scene not from the novel, where he emerges from a lake swim in a wet shirt.[33]Although he did not mind being recognised as "a romantic idol as a Darcy with smouldering sex appeal"[34]in a role that "officially turned him into a heart-throb",[35]he expressed the wish not to be associated withPride and Prejudiceforever.[36]He was, therefore, reluctant to accept similar roles and risk becomingtypecast.[18]
For a time, it did seem as if Mr. Darcy would overshadow the rest of Firth's career, and there were humorous allusions to the role in his next five movies.[37]The most notable was his casting as the love interestMark Darcyin thefilm adaptationofBridget Jones's Diary, itself a modern-day retelling ofPride and Prejudice. Firth accepted the part as he saw it as an opportunity to lampoon his Mr. Darcy character.[38]The film was very successful[39]and critically well-liked.[40]A2004 sequelwas mostly panned by critics[41]but still financially successful.
Prior to this, Firth had a significant supporting role inThe English Patient(1996) as the husband ofKristin Scott Thomas's character, whose jealousy of her adultery leads to tragedy.
