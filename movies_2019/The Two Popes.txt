The Two Popesis a 2019biographicaldrama filmdirected byFernando Meirellesand written byAnthony McCarten, adapted from McCarten's playThe Popewhich premiered atRoyal & DerngateTheatre in 2019.[4][5]Predominantly set inVatican Cityin the aftermath of theVatican leaks scandal, the film followsPope Benedict XVI, played byAnthony Hopkins, as he attempts to convince CardinalJorge Mario Bergoglio, played byJonathan Pryce, to reconsider his decision to resign as an archbishop as he confides his own intentions toabdicate the papacy.[6]
The film premiered at theTelluride Film Festivalon August 31, 2019. It began alimited theatrical releasein the United States on November 27, 2019, and in the United Kingdom on November 29, and started digital streaming on December 20, byNetflix. The performances of Pryce and Hopkins, as well as McCarten's screenplay, received high praise from critics, and all three received nominations for their work at theAcademy Awards,Golden GlobesandBritish Academy Film Awards.
In April 2005, CardinalJorge Mario Bergoglio,Archbishop of Buenos Aires, is called to theVaticanafter thedeathofPope John Paul IIto elect a new pope. CardinalJoseph Ratzinger, a prominent Germanprelate, is elected Pope Benedict XVI; Cardinal Bergoglio receives the second-highest vote count. Seven years later, theCatholic Churchis embroiled in theVatican leaks scandal, and Benedict's tenure has been tainted by public accusations regarding his role in the coverup.
Bergoglio has submitted his resignation as archbishop, but the Vatican has not responded. 
As he prepares to go toRomeand personally deliver his resignation, he is summoned to the Vatican. Bergoglio and Benedict meet at thePalace of Castel Gandolfo, the Pope's summer residence. The two debate the roles of God and the Church. Benedict recounts what led him to the priesthood and talks about his interests. The two watch Benedict's favorite TV show,Inspector Rex, which further delays their discussion about Bergoglio's resignation.
Bergoglio recounts his early life and path into the church. He ended his marital engagement and joined theJesuits. He was met by FatherFranz Jalicsand Father Orlando Yorio, who become his spiritual friends. Benedict rejects Bergoglio's resignation, saying the world would perceive it as a vote of no confidence in his leadership and weaken the Catholic Church. Benedict and Bergoglio put aside their differences and chat informally, gradually warming to each other.
The next day, the two go to the Vatican by helicopter. Benedict continues to avoid discussing Bergoglio's resignation. Benedict meets with Bergoglio in theRoom of Tearswithin theSistine Chapel, where he confides his intention to resign the papacy. Shocked, Bergoglio objects and argues for church tradition and continuity. Benedict says his opinions regarding tradition are different now and believes change is essential. Benedict says Bergoglio could be his successor, but Bergoglio rejects the idea, citing the perception that he had collaborated with theArgentine military dictatorship, and his failure to protect his friends and confront thejuntamay have damaged his reputation. Following the "Dirty War", Bergoglio was removed as head of the Argentine Society of Jesus and exiled to serve as an ordinary parish priest to the poor for the next ten years.
Over time, Father Jalics reconciled with Bergoglio, but Bergoglio regrets never reconciling with Father Yorio. Memories of his actions and inaction during the dictatorship continually haunt him. Benedict comforts Bergoglio, reminding him that the freedom to choose to help is often stifled; he gives Bergoglioabsolution. Then Benedict confesses he was aware of FatherMarcial Maciel's long-term sexual misconduct and regrets staying silent, implying that this is the reason why he wants to resign: Benedict no longer hears God's words and affirms his wish to abdicate. Bergoglio comforts Benedict and offers him absolution as well. The two emerge from the room, surprising tourists. Benedict goes outside to greet the masses and take selfies with them. Bergoglio departs for Argentina.
One year later, Pope Benedict XVI delivershis resignationto the world. Bergoglio is elected as his successor in the2013 papal conclaveand becomes Pope Francis; in his firstUrbi et Orbi, he prays for Benedict, who watches the speech on television from Castel Gandolfo. The two popes watch the2014 FIFA World Cup finalbetween their national home teams,GermanyandArgentina, together.
On September 6, 2017,Netflixannounced that it would produce the film, directed byFernando Meirellesand written byAnthony McCarten.Jonathan PryceandAnthony Hopkinswould playCardinal BergoglioandPope Benedict XVI, respectively. Filming was set to begin that November in Argentina.[7][8]The film began production in Rome in April 2018.[9][10]
Filming locations included a refugee camp in Rome, a full-size reproduction of theSistine Chapelinterior created at theCinecitt√†studios in Rome, an area outsideCastel Gandolfo(the pope's summer palace), various locations in Rome as stand-ins for scenes at the Vatican, and poor areas ofBuenos Aires. TheSt. Peter's Squareplaza was recreated usingcomputer-generated imagery.[11][12][13]Some scenes were shot inRoyal Palace of Casertaand invilla Farnesein Caprarola, near Rome. The poster image is the hunting lodge of villa Farnese.[14]
Much of the coverage of the film in the news media has centered on the reconstructed Sistine Chapel, built in a studio during an eight-week period. To create a realistic look for the artwork, the producers hired a company that produced a "stick-on tattoo"[15]of the walls and ceiling. "The ink from the tattoo is absorbed into the plaster so [...] we got all the texture and the vibrancy", said production designer Mark Tildesley.[16][13]
The film had its world premiere at theTelluride Film Festivalon August 31, 2019.[17]It also was screened at the2019 Toronto International Film Festivalon September 9.[18]Netflixgave the film a theatricallimited releasein the United States beginning November 27, 2019, and in the United Kingdom beginning November 29, 2019. It then started streaming it on its service on December 20, 2019.[19]
Although Netflix does not publicly disclose the theatrical box office of its films,IndieWireestimatedThe Two Popesgrossed around $32,000 from four theaters in its opening weekend (and a total $48,000 over its five-day Thanksgiving opening weekend). The site wrote that "the drama is starting more modestly than other recent Netflix titles. Attendance at the two high-end Landmark theaters in New York and Los Angeles has been modest. Neither small-scale auditorium sold out."[20]The film then made an estimated $50,000 from 19 theaters in its second weekend, and $200,000 from 150 in its third.[21][22]In its fourth week, upon being released digitally onto Netflix, the film made $90,000 from 44 theaters.[2]
According toVariety,The Two Popeswas "an unexpected hit" at its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival, receiving praise for its humor and the two lead actors' performances.[23]On the review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 229 reviews, with an average of 7.3/10. The site's critics consensus reads, "Led by outstanding performances from its well-matched leads,The Two Popesdraws absorbing drama from a pivotal moment in modern organized religion."[24]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[25]
Although much of the content is based on historic events, including speeches and philosophical debates that were published, most other aspects were fictionalized: "What you always do is you speculate", McCarten said in an interview withTheWrap. "Hopefully that speculation is based in facts and the truth, and hopefully it's inspired", he added.
In its coverage of the film,Timepointed out that the two popes' relationship has not been as smooth as in the fictionalized version. In April 2019, Pope Benedict released a 6,000-word letter blaming theclergy sex abuse scandalon factors including the "dangerously liberal theological ideas" within the Church. While the letter[33]did not criticize Francis' papacy,[34]its content was described byThe New York Timesas "the most significant undercutting yet of the authority of Pope Francis".[35][36]The Guardianalso discussed a letter that Benedict had written, complimentary of CardinalJoachim Meisner, who was an outspoken critic of Pope Francis, and added that a 2020 book partly authored by Benedict "was intervening to halt Pope Francis relaxing celibacy rules".[37]
In one scene, Pope Benedict confesses to Bergoglio (Francis) and mentionsMarcial Macielbefore the audio fades out. The audience sees but does not hear the rest of his confession. J. Peter Nixon, in the publicationU.S. Catholic, decried "the film's implication that it was Benedict who allowed Father Marcial Maciel Degollado to remain leader of theLegionaries of Christdespite mounting evidence that he was a sexual predator. It was during the papacy ofPope John Paul II, however, that efforts to investigate Maciel were repeatedly frustrated. It was Benedict who ultimately removed him."[38]However, publications includingNational Catholic Reporter[39]andSlate Magazinehave disagreed, withSlatewriting: "For years, Joseph Ratzinger also refused to act against Maciel. As the prefect responsible for enforcing church doctrine, he chose to handle thechurch's sexual abusethrough secrecy rather than transparency. For almost a quarter-century, Ratzinger failed to push for the detachment of Marcial Maciel from the position of privilege he enjoyed for so long. He finally did so in 2006, when, as Pope, he found the courage to remove Maciel from the priesthood and send him to Mexico to supposedly focus on a 'discreet life of penance and prayer'. If Maciel followed Benedict's spiritual marching orders, it certainly did not lead to atonement. He never admitted any wrongdoing, much less showed remorse. He died in 2008 without ever asking for forgiveness."[40]
BishopRobert Barroncriticized the film for its characterization of Benedict in an article on theWord on Firewebsite titled "The One Pope".[41]

He also directed the2008 adaptationofJos√© Saramago's novelBlindness, and the 2011 film360. In 2019, Meirelles directedThe Two PopesforNetflix.
In television, Meirelles directed and produced in Brazil theHBOoriginal seriesJoint Venture. In 2024, he led directing work for the crime seriesSugarand the historical miniseriesThe Sympathizer.
"A great tragedy for the family. For a long time, it was a taboo. No one mentioned it. I was four when it happened, but I still remember him."
Meirelles was born inS√£o Paulo, Brazil.[2]Meirelles' father, Jos√© de Souza Meirelles, is agastroenterologistwho travelled regularly toAsiaandNorth America(among other regions of the world), which gave Fernando the opportunity for contact with different cultures and places. His mother, S√¥nia Junqueira Ferreira, worked inlandscape architectureandinterior design.[3]
Fernando is the second youngest of four children. He saw his older brother, Jos√© Marcos, die in a car-bike accident when he was 4 years old. His two sisters, M√°rcia and Silvinha, graduated in theater and psychology, respectively. Fernando grew up inAlto dos Pinheiros, West Zone of S√£o Paulo, and spent every vacation on the farms of relatives from both sides of his family. "Even I have a farm. I don't know why I bought it", he was quoted as saying.[4]
His first experience with cinema was with his father, who often directed8 mm filmsduring his job at the university. He produced mostlywesternandthrillerparodies, using his relatives and friends as actors. At 11, in 1967, Fernando spent a year in theUnited StatesinCalifornia, where he had contact with thehippie movement, which impressed him. At 13, with a borrowedSuper 8 camera, Meirelles started producing small films, inspired byNorman McLaren's animations.[citation needed]
He studied at theArchitecture and Urbanism Collegein theUniversity of S√£o Pauloduring the 1980s. His graduation work was done in the form of a film, instead of the traditional designs of the other students: he went toJapanand bought professional video equipment to do the job. He presented it and graduated with the minimum acceptable grade.
While studyingarchitectureat the University of queens mary, Meirelles became involved in experimental film-making. After several years in independent television, he became an advertisement film director. He is still one of the partners of O2 Filmes, the biggest Brazilian advertisement firm, which has producedCity of God,Dom√©sticasandViva Voz.
Along with four friends (Paul Morelli, Marcelo Machado, D√°rio Vizeu and Bob Salatini), Meirelles began his career with experimental films. Eventually, they formed an independent production companyOlhar Eletr√¥nico. Subsequently, new friends joined the group: Renato Barbiere, Agilson Araujo, Toniko andMarcelo Tas. In 1982, the company aired TV programs on current affairs, as well as the children seriesCastelo R√°-Tim-Bum, with 180 episodes. In addition to obtaining high ratings, they also introduced a refreshing humorous informality in news reporting.
By the end of the 1980s, he became increasingly interested on the advertising market. In 1990, Meirelles and friends closed downOlhar Eletr√¥nico, opening an advertising business, O2 Films. One decade was enough for him to become one of the most important and sought-after advertising producers.
In 1997, Meirelles read the bookPaulo Lins'sCity of God. He decided to adapt it to film, which was done in 2002, and decided that the actors in it would be selected among the inhabitants of slums. In a final triage, from 400 children, they selected 200, with whom they worked for the shooting of the film. The filming was done with a professional crew. The film was a national and international success.
In 2004, he was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best DirectorforCity of God. Also, at the2004 Cannes Film Festival, the movie received four nominations: Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Editing.
With the recognition, he was offered a job inHollywood. WithThe Constant Gardener, he again received critical acclaim, receiving several nominations, including for fourAcademy Awardsand theGolden Globe Award for Best Director.Rachel Weiszwent on to win theAcademy Awardand theGolden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Meirelles insisted that the soundtrack be based on the music of African countries, and most of the filming was done in Kenya.
In 2007, he began shootingBlindness, a film adaptation of Nobel-prize winnerJos√© Saramago's book,Ensaio Sobre a Cegueira. The film, which was released in 2008, was the opening film of theCannes Film Festival.
He was one of the creative directors of the opening ceremony of the2016 OlympicsinRio de Janeiro, working alongsideDaniela ThomasandAndrucha Waddington[5]on a shoestring budget equivalent to less than ¬£5 million.[6]
In 2019, Meirelles directed and produced theHBOoriginal seriesJoint Venture, in which marijuana has been legalized in Brazil. The series follows the story of a young drug trafficker from S√£o Paulo who, after the legalization of marijuana in Brazil, decides to abandon his life on crime and sell his weed legally along with an inexperienced investor partner.
