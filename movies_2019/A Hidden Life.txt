A Hidden Lifeis a 2019epichistorical dramafilm written and directed byTerrence Malick. It starsAugust Diehl,Valerie Pachner, andMatthias Schoenaerts, withMichael NyqvistandBruno Ganzin their final performances. The film depicts the life ofFranz Jägerstätter, an Austrian farmer and devout Catholic who refused to fight for the Nazis inWorld War II.
The title is taken fromGeorge Eliot'sMiddlemarch:
...for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.
The film premiered at theCannes Film Festivalin May 2019 and was theatrically released in the United States on December 13, 2019.[7]It received critical acclaim upon release and was the final feature film to be released under the Fox Searchlight Pictures name beforeWalt Disney Studioschanged the company's name to Searchlight Pictures on January 17, 2020.
Austrian peasant farmerFranz Jägerstätter, born and brought up in the small village ofSt. Radegund, is working his land when war breaks out. Married to Franziska, colloquially Fani, the couple are important members of the tight-knit rural community. They live a simple life with the passing years marked by the arrival of the couple's three girls. Franz is called up for basic training in the German army and is away from his beloved wife and children for months. Eventually, whenFrance surrendersand it seems the war might end soon, he is sent back from training.
With his mother and sister-in-law Resie, he and his wife farm the land and raise their children amid the mountains and valleys of upper Austria, cutting hay and gathering. As the war goes on, Jägerstätter and the other able-bodied men in the village are called up to fight. Their first requirement is to swear anoath of allegiancetoAdolf Hitlerand theThird Reich. Despite pressure from the mayor and his neighbors, who increasingly ostracize him and his family, and from the Bishop ofLinz, Jägerstätter refuses. Wrestling with the knowledge that his decision will mean arrest and even death, he finds strength in his faith in God, his prayers, and Fani's love and support. He is taken to prison, first inEnns, then inBerlinand waits months for his trial. During his time in prison, he and Fani write letters to each other and give each other strength. Fani and their daughters are victims of growing hostility in the village over her husband's decision not to fight. Fani is eventually able to visit her husband in Berlin.
After months of brutal incarceration, Jägerstätter's case goes to trial. He is found guilty and sentenced to death. Despite many opportunities to sign the oath of allegiance, and the promise of non-combatant work, he continues to refuse and is executed by the Third Reich on August 9, 1943, while his wife and daughters survive.
On June 23, 2016, reports emerged that the film, then titledRadegund, would depict the life of Austria'sFranz Jägerstätter, aconscientious objectorduring World War II who was put to death at age 36 for undermining military actions, and was later declared amartyrandbeatifiedby theCatholic Church. It was announced thatAugust Diehlwas set to play Jägerstätter andValerie Pachnerto play his wife, Franziska Jägerstätter.[8]Jörg Widmer was appointed as thedirector of photography, having worked in all of Malick's films sinceThe New World(2005) as acamera operator.
Malick saidA Hidden Lifewould have a more structured narrative than his previous works: "Lately—I keep insisting, only very lately—have I been working without a script and I've lately repented the idea. The last picture we shot, and we're now cutting, went back to a script that was very well ordered." This makes it his first linear, plot-driven film sinceThe New World(2005). He added, "There's a lot of strain when working without a script because you can lose track of where you are. It's very hard to coordinate with others who are working on the film. Production designers and location managers arrive in the morning and don't know what we're going to shoot or where we're going to shoot. The reason we did it was to try and get moments that are spontaneous and free. As a movie director, you always feel with a script that you're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. And with no script, there's no round hole, there's just air. But I'm backing away from that style now."[9]
Malick obtained rights to the bookFranz Jägerstätter: Letters and Writings from Prison, edited byErna Putz, for the film.[10]
The film began production inStudio BabelsberginPotsdam, Germanyin summer 2016. From 11 July to 19 August 2016 the production shot on location inSouth Tyrol. Locations there were the church of St. Valentin inSeis am Schlern, the valley ofGsies, the village ofRodeneck, the mills inTerenten, the meadows of Albions inLajen, theSeiser Alm, theTaufersCastle, the Fane Alm inMühlbach, thePuez-Geisler Nature Park, the renaissance Velthurns Castle in the village ofFeldthurns, theFranzensfeste Fortress, the gardens of the bishop's Hofburg inBrixenand the Neustift cloister.[11][8]
In August 2016, reports emerged that some of the film's scenes were shot in the small Italian mountain village ofSappada.[12]
Actor Franz Rogowski said in a March 2019 interview that no one knew how the film would turn out or when it would be released, considering that it had been in post-production for more than two years at that point. Rogowski added that Malick is "a director who creates spaces rather than produces scenes; his editing style is like that."[13]
The film's score is byJames Newton Howardand features violinistJames Ehnes, who also performed Howard's violin concerto released in 2018.[14][15]It was released bySony Classical Recordson December 6, 2019. Of the score, Howard said, "It is a spiritual-sounding score... Terry often spoke about the suffering inherent in love, and you feel yearning, suffering and love in that piece". The score features 40 minutes of original score mixed with selected classical works byBach,Handel,Dvořák,Górecki,Pärtand others. It was recorded atAbbey Road StudiosinLondonin one day in June 2018 with a 40-piece string section conducted by Pete Anthony withShawn Murphyas score mixer.[16]

A Hidden Lifepremiered in competition at the72nd Cannes Film Festivalon May 19, 2019.[17]The following day,Fox Searchlight Picturesacquired rights for the U.S. and several other regions for $12–14 million in a competitive situation that also includedA24,Netflix,Paramount Pictures,Sony Pictures Classics, andFocus Features.[18][5][19]The film screened at theVatican Film Libraryon December 4, 2019, with Malick making a rare public appearance to introduce the film.[20]It was released in limited release in the U.S. on December 13, 2019, followed by a wide release in January.[21]
On review aggregation websiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 234 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Ambitious and visually absorbing,A Hidden Lifemay prove inscrutable to non-devotees—but for viewers on Malick's wavelength, it should only further confirm his genius."[22]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted averagescore of 80 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[23]
Peter DeBruge ofVarietywrites: "Whether or not he is specifically referring to the present day, its demagogues, and the way certain evangelicals have once again sold out their core values for political advantage,A Hidden Lifefeels stunningly relevant as it thrusts this problem into the light."[24]
Jägerstätter biographerErna Putzwas touched by the film's spirituality after a private screening in June 2019, saying that Malick had made an "independent and universal work". She also considered Diehl's and Pachner's performances to be accurate representations of who Franz and Franziska were ("Franz, as I know him from the letters, and Franziska, as I know from encounters").[25]

Terrence Frederick Malick(/ˈmælɪk/; born November 30, 1943) is an American filmmaker.[1]Malick began his career as part of theNew Hollywoodgeneration of filmmakers and received awards at theCannes Film Festival,Berlin International Film Festival, andVenice International Film Festival, and nominations for threeAcademy Awards, aGolden Globe Award, aCesar Award, and aDirectors Guild of America Award.
Malick made his feature film debut with the crime dramaBadlands(1973), followed by the romantic period dramaDays of Heaven(1978), which earned him a nomination for theGolden Globe Award for Best Director.[2]He then directed theWorld War IIepicThe Thin Red Line(1998), for which he was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Director, the historical romantic dramaThe New World(2005), and the experimentalcoming-of-agedramaThe Tree of Life(2011), for which he was again nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Directorand won theCannes Film Festival'sPalme d'Or.
Malick's directorial output became more consistent and experimental withTo the Wonder(2013),Knight of Cups(2015),Song to Song(2017), andA Hidden Life(2019). During this time he also directed the documentary filmVoyage of Time(2016) about the birth and death of the universe. Malick has frequently collaborated withEmmanuel Lubezki, who served as thedirector of photographyon seven of his films.
Malick's films explore themes such astranscendenceand conflicts between reason and instinct as well as nature versus nurture. They typically have broad philosophical and spiritual overtones and employ meditativevoice-oversby their characters. Malick's style has polarized scholars and audiences; many praise his films for their lavish cinematography and aesthetics, but others fault them for lacking plot and character development. His work has nonetheless ranked highly in retrospective decade-end and all-time polls.
Malick was born inOttawa, Illinois.[3][4]He is the son of Irene (née Thompson; 1912–2011)[5]and Emil A. Malick (1917–2013),[6]a geologist.[7]His paternal grandparents were ofLebaneseandAssyriandescent fromUrmia,[7][8][9][10]while his mother was anIrish Catholic.[11]Malick attendedSt. Stephen's Episcopal SchoolinAustin, Texas, while his family lived inBartlesville, Oklahoma.[12]
Malick had two younger brothers, Chris and Larry. Larry Malick was a guitarist who went to study in Spain withAndrés Segoviain the late 1960s. In 1968, Larry intentionally broke his own hands due to pressure over his musical studies.[13]Their father Emil went to Spain to help Larry, but his son died shortly after, possibly by suicide.[14]The early death of Malick's younger brother has been explored and referenced in his filmsThe Tree of Life(2011) andKnight of Cups(2015).[15][16]
Malick graduated fromHarvard Collegein 1965 with aBachelor of Arts,summa cum laude, and was elected toPhi Beta Kappa. He received aRhodes Scholarship, which he used to study philosophy atOxford University'sMagdalen College. After a disagreement with his advisor,Gilbert Ryle, over Malick's thesis on the concept of world inKierkegaard,Heidegger, andWittgenstein, Malick left Oxford without a degree.[17]In 1969,Northwestern University Presspublished Malick's translation of Heidegger'sVom Wesen des GrundesasThe Essence of Reasons.
After returning to the United States, Malick taught philosophy at theMassachusetts Institute of Technologywhile freelancing as a journalist. He wrote articles forNewsweek,The New Yorker, andLife.[18]
Malick started his film career after earning anMFAfrom the brand-newAFI Conservatoryin 1969, directing the short filmLanton Mills. At the AFI, he established contacts with people such as actorJack Nicholson, longtime collaboratorJack Fisk, and agentMike Medavoy, who procured for Malick freelance workrevising scripts. He wrote early uncredited drafts ofDirty Harry(1971) andDrive, He Said(1971), and is credited with the screenplay forPocket Money(1972).[19]Malick also co-wroteThe Gravy Train(1974) under the pseudonym David Whitney.
Malick's first feature-length work as a director wasBadlands, anindependent filmstarringMartin SheenandSissy Spacekas a young couple on a crime spree in the 1950s Midwest. It was influenced by the crimes of convicted teenage spree killerCharles Starkweather.[20]Malick raised half the budget by approaching people outside of the industry, including doctors and dentists, and by contributing $25,000 from his personal savings. The rest was raised by executive producerEdward R. Pressman.[21][22]After a troubled production that included many crew members leaving halfway through,Badlandsdrew raves upon its premiere at theNew York Film Festival. As a result,Warner Bros.bought distribution rights for three times its budget.[23]
Malick's second film was theParamount-producedDays of Heaven, about a love triangle that develops in the farm country of theTexas Panhandlein the early 20th century. Production began in the fall of 1976 inAlberta, Canada. The film was mostly shot during thegolden hour, with primarily natural light. Much like Malick's first feature,Days of Heavenhad a lengthy and troubled production, with several members of the production crew quitting before shooting was finished, mainly due to disagreements with Malick's idiosyncratic directorial style.[24]The film likewise had a troubled post-production phase.Billy Weberand Malick spent two years editing it, during which they experimented with unconventional editing and voice-over techniques once they realized the picture they had set out to make would not fully work.[25]
Days of Heavenwas finally released in 1978 to mostly positive responses from critics.[26][27]Its cinematography was widely praised, although some found its story lackluster.[28][29]InThe New York Times, Harold C. Schonberg wrote that it "is full of elegant and striking photography; and it is an intolerably artsy, artificial film."[30]It won theAcademy Award for Best Cinematographyand the prize for Best Director at the1979 Cannes Film Festival. Its reputation has since improved,[31]having been voted one of the 50 greatest American films ever made in a 2015 critics' poll published by theBBC.[32]
Following the release ofDays of Heaven, Malick began developing a project for Paramount, titledQ, that explored the origins of life on earth. During pre-production, he suddenly moved to Paris and disappeared from public view for years.[33]During this time, he wrote a number of screenplays, includingThe English Speaker, aboutJosef Breuer's analysis ofAnna O.; adaptations ofWalker Percy's novelThe MoviegoerandLarry McMurtry'sThe Desert Rose;[33]a script aboutJerry Lee Lewis; and a stage adaptation of the Japanese filmSansho the Bailiffthat was to be directed by Polish filmmakerAndrzej Wajda, in addition to continuing work on theQscript.[34]AlthoughQhas never been made, Malick's work on the project provided material for his filmThe Tree of Life[35]and eventually became the basis forVoyage of Time. Jack Fisk, a longtime production designer on Malick's films, has said Malick was shooting film during this time as well.[36]
Malick returned to directing in 1997 withThe Thin Red Line, released two decades after his previous film. A loose adaptation ofJames Jones's World War IInovel of the same name, it features a largeensemble cast, includingSean Penn,Adrien Brody,Jim Caviezel,Nick Nolte,Ben Chaplin,Elias Koteas,Woody Harrelson,George Clooney, andJohn Travolta. Filming took place predominantly in theDaintree RainforestinQueensland, Australiaand in theSolomon Islands.[37]
The film received critical acclaim,[38][39]was nominated for sevenAcademy Awards, and won theGolden Bearat the49th Berlin International Film Festival.[40]The Thin Red Linehas since been ranked among the best films of the 1990s inComplex,[41]The A.V. Club,[42]Slant,[43]Paste,[44]andFilm Comment.[45]
After learning of Malick's work on an article aboutChe Guevaraduring the 1960s,Steven Soderberghoffered Malick the chance to write and direct a film about Guevara he had been developing withBenicio del Toro. Malick accepted and produced a screenplay focused on Guevara's failed revolution inBolivia.[46]After a year and a half, the financing had not come together entirely, and Malick was given the opportunity to directThe New World,[47]a script he had begun developing in the 1970s.[48]He left the Guevara project in March 2004,[47]and Soderbergh took over as director, leading to the filmChe(2008).The New World, based on the story ofJohn SmithandPocahontasin the Virginia Colony, was released in 2005. Over one million feet of film were shot, and three different cuts of varying length were released.
While the film was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Cinematography, critical reception was divided throughout its theatrical run; many praised its visuals and acting while finding its narrative unfocused.[49]Five critics later namedThe New Worldone of the best films of its decade,[50]and it ranked 39th in a 2016BBCpoll of the greatest films since 2000.[51]
Malick's fifth feature,The Tree of Life, was filmed inSmithville, Texas, and elsewhere during 2008. StarringBrad Pitt,Jessica Chastain, andSean Penn, it is a family drama spanning multiple time periods; it focuses on an individual's struggle to reconcile love, mercy and beauty with the existence of illness, suffering and death. It premiered at the2011 Cannes Film Festival,[52]where it won thePalme d'Or. It later won theFIPRESCI Awardfor the Best Film of the Year. At the84th Academy Awards, it was nominated for three awards, including theAcademy Award for Best Picture,[53]Best Directorfor Malick, andBest CinematographyforEmmanuel Lubezki.[54]A limited theatrical release in the United States began on May 27, 2011.[55]
Malick scholars Christopher B. Barnett and Clark J. Elliston wrote that it became "arguably [Malick's] most acclaimed work".[56]It was voted the 79th greatest American film of all time in a 2015BBC Culturepoll of 62 international film critics.[57]The work was also ranked the seventh-greatest film since 2000 in a worldwide critics' poll by BBC.[51]
Malick's sixth feature,To the Wonder,[58]was shot predominantly inBartlesville, Oklahoma; a few scenes were filmed inPawhuska, Oklahoma, and at the Tulsa Port of Catoosa.[59]The film starsBen Affleck,Rachel McAdams,Olga Kurylenko, andJavier Bardem.[60]To the Wonderhad its world premiere at the69th Venice International Film Festivalon September 2, 2012, and opened theatrically in the U.S. on April 12, 2013. Critical response to the film was markedly divided, and it has been called "arguably [Malick's] most derided".[56]
On November 1, 2011, Filmnation Entertainment announced international sales for Malick's next two projects:Lawless(later released asSong to Song) andKnight of Cups. Both films have large ensemble casts, with many actors appearing in both. The films were shot back-to-back in 2012,Song to Songprimarily inAustin, Texas, andKnight of Cupsin Los Angeles andLas Vegas.[61]During the weekend of September 16, 2011, Malick and a small crew were seen filming Christian Bale and Haley Bennett at theAustin City Limits Music Festivalas part of preliminary shooting forSong to Song.[62]Malick was also seen directing Ryan Gosling andRooney Maraat theFun Fun Fun Feston November 4, 2011.[62][63]Knight of Cupshad its world premiere at theBerlin International Film Festivalin February 2015, and was met with mixed reactions.[64][65][66]It was released in the U.S. on March 4, 2016, byBroad Green Pictures.[67]
Song to Songhad its world premiere atSouth by Southweston March 10, 2017, before being released theatrically in the U.S. on March 17 by Broad Green Pictures, and was met with mixed reactions.[68][69]Concurrent with these two features, Malick continued work on anImaxdocumentary,Voyage of Time, that examines the birth and death of the known universe.The Hollywood Reportercalled it "a celebration of the Earth, displaying the whole of time, from the birth of the universe to its final collapse." The film is the culmination of a project Malick had been working on for over 40 years, and has been described by Malick as "one of my greatest dreams".[70]It features footage Malick and collaborators shot over the years, and expands on the footage that special effects luminariesDouglas Trumbull(2001) and Dan Glass (The Matrix) created forThe Tree of Life. It was released in two versions: a 40-minute IMAX version (Voyage of Time: The IMAX Experience) with narration byBrad Pitt, and a 90-minute feature-length version (Voyage of Time: Life's Journey) with narration byCate Blanchett.[71]The feature-length version had its world premiere on September 7, 2016, at the73rd Venice International Film Festival.[72]The IMAX version was released on October 7, 2016, byIMAX Corporationand Broad Green Pictures.[73]
Malick's next film,A Hidden Life, depicts the life of Austria'sFranz Jägerstätter, aconscientious objectorduring World War II who was put to death at age 36 for undermining military actions and was later declared a martyr andbeatifiedby theCatholic Church.August Diehlstars as Jägerstätter, withValerie Pachneras his wife, Franziska.[74]The film was shot inStudio BabelsberginPotsdam, Germany, in the summer of 2016, and in parts of northern Italy, such asBrixen,South Tyrol, and the small mountain village ofSappada.[74][75]It was released in 2019. Malick has said that, compared to his more recent films, withA Hidden Lifehe had "repented and gone back to working with a much tighter script".[76]
In August[77]and/or September 2016, Malick directed a commercial, "Notes of a Woman", released on February 26, 2017,[78]forMon Guerlainperfume.[79]StarringAngelina Jolie, it was shot at her andBrad Pitt'sChâteau Miravalestate inCorrens[80][81]and photographed by Austrian cinematographerChristian Berger.[82]
On June 7, 2019, Malick reportedly started shooting his next film, code-namedThe Last Planet, nearRome, Italy.[83]The film will tell the story ofJesus's life through a series of parables. On September 8, the cast was revealed to includeGéza Röhrigas Jesus,Matthias SchoenaertsasSaint Peter, andMark Rylanceas four versions ofSatan.[84]On November 20, 2020, it was announced that the film's name would beThe Way of the Wind.[85]
Critics have noted the philosophical themes of Malick's films.[86]According to film scholar Lloyd Michaels, Malick's main themes include "the isolated individual's desire for transcendence amidst established social institutions, the grandeur and untouched beauty of nature, the competing claims of instinct and reason, and the lure of the open road".[86]He namedDays of Heavenas one in a group of acclaimed films from the 1970s that were intended to revolutionize the Americanfilm epic. LikeThe Godfatherfilms(1972, 1974),Nashville(1975), andThe Deer Hunter(1978), Michaels argued that the movie delves into "certain national myths" as an idiosyncratic type of Western, "particularly the migration westward, the dream of personal success, and the clash of agrarian and industrial economies".[87]Roger Ebertconsidered Malick's body of work to have a unifying common theme: "Human lives diminish beneath the overarching majesty of the world."[88]In Ebert's opinion, Malick was among the few remaining directors who yearned "to make no less than a masterpiece".[89]While reviewingThe Tree of Life,The New York TimescriticA. O. Scottcompared Malick to innovative "homegrown romantics" such as the writersWalt Whitman,Hart Crane,James Agee, andHerman Melville, in the sense that their "definitive writings" also "did not sit comfortably or find universal favor in their own time" but nonetheless "leaned perpetually into the future, pushing their readers forward toward a new horizon of understanding".[90]
Malick's body of work has inspired polarized opinions. According to Michaels, "few American directors have inspired such adulation and rejection with each successive film" as Malick. Michaels said that in all of American cinema, Malick is the filmmaker most frequently "granted genius status after creating such a discontinuous and limited body of work".[87]Malick makes use of broad philosophical and spiritual overtones, such as in the form of meditativevoice-oversfrom individual characters. Some critics feel these elements made the films engaging and unique, while others find them pretentious and gratuitous, particularly in his post-hiatus work.[91]Michaels believed the opinionsDays of Heavencontinues to elicit among scholars and film enthusiasts exemplify this: "The debate continues to revolve around what to make of 'its extremities of beauty', whether the exquisite lighting, painterly compositions, dreamy dissolves, and fluid camera movements, combined with the epic grandeur and elegiac tone, sufficiently compensate for the thinness of the tale, the two-dimensionality of the characters, and the resulting emotional detachment of the audience."[87]Reverse Shotjournalist Chris Wisniewski regarded bothDays of HeavenandThe New Worldnot as "literary nor theatrical" but "principally cinematic" in their aesthetic, intimating narrative, emotional, and conceptual themes through the use of "image and sound" instead of "foregrounding dialogue, events or characters". He highlighted Malick's use of "rambling philosophical voiceovers; the placid images of nature, offering quiet contrast to the evil deeds of men; the stunning cinematography, often achieved with natural light; the striking use of music".[92]
While the perception of Malick as arecluseis inaccurate,[93][94][95]he is nevertheless famously protective of his private life.[96]His contracts stipulate that his likeness may not be used for promotional purposes, and he routinely declines requests for interviews.[33][97]
From 1970 to 1976, Malick was married to Jill Jakes.[98]His companion in the late 1970s was director and screenwriter Michie Gleason.[98]In 1985 in France, he married[98]Michèle Marie Morette,[99][100]whom he met in Paris in 1980; in 1996, Malick asked for a divorce, which was granted.[98][100]Afterward he married Alexandra "Ecky" Wallace, his high-school sweetheart.[101]
Malick's semi-autobiographical filmTo the Wonderwas inspired by his relationships with Morette and Wallace.[15][102]
Since at least 2011[update], Malick has lived inAustin, Texas.[103]
Malick has received threeAcademy Awardnominations;[104][105]two forBest Director, forThe Thin Red Line[106]andThe Tree of Life,[107]and a nomination forBest Adapted Screenplayfor the former film.[108]He was awarded theGolden Bearat the49th Berlin International Film FestivalforThe Thin Red Line, and thePalme d'Orat the64th Cannes Film FestivalforThe Tree of Life.[109]
