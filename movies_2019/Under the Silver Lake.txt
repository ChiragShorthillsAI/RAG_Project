Under the Silver Lakeis a 2018 Americansurrealistneo-noirblack comedythriller filmwritten, produced and directed byDavid Robert Mitchell. Set in 2011 Los Angeles, it follows a young man (Andrew Garfield) investigating the sudden disappearance of his neighbor (Riley Keough), only to stumble upon an elusive and dangerous conspiracy.
Under the Silver Lakepremiered on May 15, 2018, at the2018 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for thePalme d'Or, before being released nationwide in France on August 8. It was theatrically released in the United States on April 19, 2019, byA24. The film received polarized reviews from critics.
In the summer of 2011, Sam is an aimless 33-year-old inSilver Lake, Los Angeles, interested inconspiracy theoriesandhidden messagesinpopular culture, and uninterested in paying his overdue rent. One morning, Sam sees a news report detailing the disappearance of billionaire Jefferson Sevence. While spying on a topless neighbor feeding her birds he notices a mysterious new neighbor, Sarah. Sarah notices him in turn and later gets high with Sam while watchingHow to Marry a Millionaire. As they begin to kiss, Sarah's two roommates interrupt and Sarah suggests Sam come back the next day.
In the morning, Sam discovers that Sarah and her roommates have moved out overnight, and becomes obsessed with learning what happened. He breaks into the empty apartment, finding a strange symbol on the wall, and flees when a woman, Troy, comes by to pick up a box. Sam follows Troy and her two friends to a rooftop party inDowntown Los Angeles, where he meets his friend Allen and Emerald. Emerald points out Sevence's daughter, Millicent, who becomes upset and leaves upon learning of her father's death. He also sees a Balloon Girl doing performance art and talks to one of the "brides" from a band called Jesus & the Brides of Dracula. The bride gives Sam a cookie that doubles as a ticket to a private show atHollywood Forever Cemetery. On television, Sam discovers that Sevence burned to death in a car with three women. Sarah's hat was found at the scene, and a small dog similar to hers was found dead.
Sam visits the Comic Fan, the author of azinecalledUnder the Silver Lake. Sam learns that the symbol seen in Sarah's apartment is ahobo codemeaning "stay quiet." The Comic Fan explains that hidden messages are everywhere in modern society. Sarah's disappearance, a mysterious Dog Killer, and the Owl's Kiss - a homicidal supernatural entity appearing to be a nude woman in an owl mask - may all be part of the same conspiracy. He shows Sam a collector's cereal box with a map of Los Angeles on the reverse which he believes holds all the answers.
Sam attends the Jesus & the Brides show at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, where the bouncer requires him to take a bite of the admission cookie; Sam eats the whole cookie. At the show Sam is given one of the band's albums and again encounters the Balloon Girl. When he asks her about Sarah she takes him downstairs to the Crypt Club, then ditches him when he becomes sick from the drugged cookie. Attempting to follow the Balloon Girl he spots Troy and gives chase but passes out in front ofJanet Gaynor's grave.
After decoding a hidden message within the lyrics of a song by Jesus & the Brides of Dracula, Sam makes his way to theGriffith Observatory. There he is met by the Homeless King, a vagrant wearing a robe and crown, who blindfolds him and takes him to a hidden cave before letting him venture alone into a secret space that resembles a bomb shelter.
Sam makes his way back to the Comic Fan’s house to find police investigating the Fan's apparent suicide. Sam views the footage from the Fan'sCCTV, and confirms that the Fan was murdered by the Owl's Kiss. Terrified, he leaves the house, taking the cereal box with him. He phones his friend Allen, who takes him to a chess party attended by the band members of Jesus & the Brides of Dracula. Sam follows Jesus to the bathroom and forces him to reveal that three songs on the album are not his but were written by someone Jesus knows only as "the Songwriter." Sam has the Balloon Girl and two Shooting Stars (employees of an escort agency) lead him to the Songwriter, a very old man who reveals that he has encoded many songs with secret messages over the decades. He claims thathe wrote most of the musicthat Sam grew up with, includingBeethoven's Symphony No. 9, which was composed in the 1820s. When Sam demands to know who paid him to write the songs, the Songwriter tries to kill him, but Sam beats him to death with an electric guitar.
The Owl's Kiss attempts to kill Sam but he is saved by the arrival of his landlord with a police officer, who gives Sam one last day to pay the rent. Remembering something the Homeless King had said, Sam follows a coyote which leads him to another party, where he encounters Millicent Sevence again. As they swim in theSilver Lake, Millicent gives Sam a bracelet engraved with letters and numbers which she had found in her father's office. While in the water, the two are shot at by persons unknown. Millicent is fatally shot, dying in a pose eerily similar to one on a vintagePlayboymagazine cover that Sam owns.
The next morning, Sam realizes that the codes on the bracelet are chess moves. By overlaying the map from the Comic Fan's cereal box on a pull-out map fromNintendo Power magazinehe is able to plot the moves and pinpoint the shadow entity'soff-the-gridlocation. Making his way there, he finds a man and three women (one of them Troy) in a small hut. As Sam holds them at gunpoint, the man offers him tea and reveals the truth: throughout history, wealthy men such as himself have chosen to seal themselves in underground tombs, like the "bomb shelter" Sam explored earlier, in order for their souls to "ascend," accompanied by three wives, to an unexplained and unearthly domain. Sarah and her roommates were Sevence's wives, and their deaths were faked. Their tomb has already been sealed, but Sam speaks with Sarah on a video phone. She confirms that she entered the tomb willingly and is at peace with her fate, and she and Sam share a brief farewell. As Sam begins to pass out from the (drugged) tea he sees the Homeless King approaching. When he wakes up the Homeless King has him chained to a chair and interrogates him, but finally lets him go, warning him to reveal nothing of what he has learned.
Returning home, Sam has sex with the Topless Bird Woman, whoseparrotrepeats incomprehensible words. From the Bird Woman's balcony, Sam watches as his landlord and the police officer enter his own apartment toevicthim. They notice one of his walls has been painted with the Hobo code symbol for "stay quiet".

Principal photographybegan on October 31, 2016.[12]It took place throughoutLos Angeles, includingSilver Lake neighborhood,Silver Lake Reservoir,Griffith ObservatoryandThe Last Bookstore.[13]
In May 2016,A24acquired U.S distribution rights to the film.[14][15][16]The film had its world premiere at theCannes Film Festivalon May 15, 2018. The first country it was released in nationwide was France on August 8, followed by Belgium on August 15.[17]
The film was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on June 22, 2018, but on June 4 was pushed back to December 7, 2018.[18][19]The theatrical release was then pushed back again to April 19, 2019, and three days later it was available to stream.[20][21]
Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 59% based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 6.10/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Under the Silver Lakehits its stride slightly more often than it stumbles, but it's hard not to admire - or be drawn in by - writer-director David Robert Mitchell's ambition."[22]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[23]
Joshua Rothkopf ofTime Outgave the film a perfect five rating, calling it "Hypnotic, spiraling and deliriously high" and stating "the ambition ofUnder the Silver Lakeis worth cherishing. It will either evaporate into nothingness or cohere into something you'll want to hug for being so wonderfully weird."[24]Eric Kohn ofIndieWiregave a positive review, calling it "a bizarre and outrageous drama grounded in the consistency of Garfield's astonishment at every turn... It's fascinating to watch Mitchell grasp for a bigger picture with the wild ambition of his scruffy protagonist."[25]
Owen GleibermanofVarietygave a positive review, calling it "a down-the-rabbit-hole movie, at once gripping and baffling, fueled by erotic passion and dread but also by the code-fixated opacity of conspiracy theory. The movie is impeccably shot and staged, with an insanely lush soundtrack that's like Bernard Herrmann-meets-Angelo-Badalamenti-on-opioids."[26]A.A. Dowd ofThe A.V. Clubgave the film a B rating, stating "Mitchell is taking a big swing with his third feature, trying something not just new but also more unconventional, ambitious, and even potentially off-putting."[27]
Emily Yoshida ofVulturestated about the film's message: "I kept coming back to the women in this extremely boy-driven movie—Mitchell suspects that they're all on one bigconveyor beltto be chewed up and spit out by Hollywood, or if they're lucky, locked away in the dungeons of the rich and powerful. It's a rather pedestrian imagining for an otherwise admirably cuckoo film—you keep hoping for Mitchell to land on something weirder, more radical."[28]Despite praising Garfield's performance and the film's originality, Bilge Ebiri ofThe Village Voicegave a negative review, stating: "If you're going to make a postmodern neo-noir sex-conspiracy... set in Los Angeles, it helps to have some personality, or at least a sense of style... Mitchell has interesting ideas, and his actors seem to be having fun, but that's not enough when the film itself lacks atmosphere, or tension, or emotional engagement."[29]
In 2018, the film had positive reactions at theNeuchâtel International Fantastic Film Festivalin Switzerland where it was awarded with the Denis-De-Rougemont Youth Award.[30]AtSitges Film FestivalUnder the Silver Lake was awarded with the Special Mention of the Jose Luis Guarner Critics' Award.[31]
While not initially a box-office success with audiences,[3]Under the SilverLakehas garnered acult followingwho are convinced that there are hidden meta-clues, codes andcipherssprinkled throughout the film waiting to be discovered.[32]These include references to the mystery surrounding the identity of the dog killer, various different cyphers or codes, geocoding systems, and even analysis of fireworks in the film, connecting the sound pattern they emit toMorse code.[32]In certain scenes in the film there is graffiti that can be seen in the toilets and on a wall and which are coded with theCopiale cipher. The film's cryptography consultant was computer scientist Kevin Knight, who in 2011 co-created a program to translate the Copiale cipher.[33]

In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces.
