The film begins with the meeting of a support group in Los Angeles, during which the unnamed leader of the group,The Man, takes a call asking him to come to London.
Once in London, he meets Jade in a bar in broad daylight, asks her why Senator Kyle is still alive and advises her to leave. The subsequent film opener shows a fight between Krystal and Jade in a club, which Jade loses.
Alice enters a church and meets the priestess Joanna.
Joanna has set up a support group called "Killers Anonymous" in the church hall of her parish in London. The group's participating killers, who meet to talk about their mental problems after the murders and how their consciences are bothering them, include the feisty Violet, an unnamed old-school gangster, a doctor with his own idea of euthanasia, the emotional Leandro and the constantly nervous Ben. On this evening, they are all extremely nervous because the streets are swarming with police officers due to the shooting of US Senator Kyle.
They find Senator Kyle, who has been shot, in the church hall. Joanna reveals that she shot at Kyle but missed after Jade's previous attempt on his life failed. She also reveals that she works for the CIA, which is in fact behind the orders of the assassins participating in the support group. But now she is working forthe Russians, who pay better.
Morgan, Alice's adopted sister who was also raised in Russia, is hiding in the church hall. The two of themtestthe participants in the support group for loyalty to their new employer.
