While walking home, Hawthorne College student Lindsay is killed by a masked individual. Riley Stone, a member of the Mu Kappa Epsilon sorority, struggles withPTSDafter beingrapedby Delta Kappa Omicron fraternity president Brian Huntley. Meanwhile, her sorority sister Kris has angered the DKO fraternity and Professor Gelson following a petition from her requesting that university founder Calvin Hawthorne's bust be moved from the main building and another requesting Gelson be fired due to his refusal to teach books written by women.
Riley and Kris, along with their friends Marty, Jesse and Helena, arrive at the DKO fraternity for the talent show where Riley discovers new pledges for DKO engaging in a ritual around Hawthorne's bust. She saves a drunken Helena from being sexually assaulted by a DKO member and takes Helena's place in the talent show. Upon seeing Brian in the crowd, she performs a song with her sorority sisters condemning therape cultureat the fraternity. Later, Helena is abducted by Lindsay's attacker while Riley begins to bond with Landon, a kind-hearted fellow student. The girls start to receive threatening text messages from an account posing as Calvin Hawthorne, similar to what Lindsay had received before she was murdered. The next day, sorority sister Fran is attacked and killed by the masked assailant. While searching for Helena, Riley encounters Gelson and finds his list of the MKE girls. She reports the disappearances tocampus police, but they refuse to help.
That night, Riley and Kris argue over Kris's posting of the performance in which Riley reveals at the end that Brian raped her. As Riley blames Kris for the threatening messages from DKO, Marty argues with her boyfriend Nate and demands that he leave. After Jesse is killed by the assailant, the girls are also attacked, leaving Marty injured. Kris discovers Jesse's body while Nate arrives to apologize and is also murdered. Riley kills the assailant, but the girls are attacked by two other individuals. Marty dies while Riley and Kris kill the attacker and identify him as a DKO pledge she saw at the ritual earlier.
The two escape in Nate's car and Riley theorizes that Hawthorne, who was known for practicingblack magic, is responsible for the murders via his bust which emits black liquid. Kris suggests they go to the police, but Riley demands they go to the fraternity and the two separate. Riley enlists Landon to help her enter the fraternity. Kris discovers Lindsay’s sorority sisters also being attacked by DKO and rescues them. At the DKO house, the frat brothers force Landon to become a pledge. Riley discovers Helena, who is tied up, before being knocked unconscious by a DKO member.
She awakens bound and is confronted by Gelson, Brian and other DKO members. Gelson reveals that after Kris forced the bust's relocation, they discovered Hawthorne's plan, involving a spell and the black liquid, to control women. The liquid allows the spirit of Hawthorne to possess the fraternity's pledges and send them out to murder women they deem unruly. Helena has been secretly working with the fraternity and stole items from her sisters that allowed the possessed pledges to locate their targets. Helena is murdered before Kris and other sorority sisters attack the fraternity. Riley overpowers Brian and smashes the Hawthorne bust. Kris sets Gelson on fire and the women and Landon escape, locking the frat brothers inside and leaving them to burn to death.
An international co-production film between the United States, New Zealand and Canada. In June 2019,Jason Blumwas revealed to produce a remake of the 1974 filmBlack Christmasthrough his studioBlumhouse Productions, alongside Adam Hendricks from the studioDivide/Conquerand Ben Cosgrove.[13]In addition, Greg Gilreath and Zac Locke, also from Divide/Conquer, served as executive producers for the project.[14]

Director Takal worked extensively to make this vision ofBlack Christmasas feminist as she could,[a]stating in an interview: "I wanted to make a movie where instead of feeling objectified or watched from a distance, the audience felt seen".[19]It is the firstBlack Christmasfilm in whichBob Clarkwas not involved in the production process, as Clark had died in 2007.[20]Bob Clark had produced as well as directed the originalBlack Christmas(1974) and had been an executive producer onthe 2006 remake.
Unlike the previous two versions ofBlack Christmas, the remake was ratedPG-13by the MPAA, a rating Takal sought in hopes of making it accessible to new audiences, especially young women who were interested in horror and opening up discussions on major issues like sexual assault,[21]although she was ready to fully commit to utilizing the higher R rating if the ratings board would not grant the PG-13 rating. However, she would not use the PG-13 rating to water down the film's violence to a large degree, making it only slightly less violent than the original film.[22]
Production began in New Zealand on June 23, 2019.[23][24][25]Principal photography occurred for 27 days aroundDunedinandOamaru, with theUniversity of Otagoproviding the setting.[26]Filming concluded on July 31.[27][28]

Black Christmasgrossed $10.4 million in the United States and Canada and $8.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $18.5 million.[4]
Initially projected to gross $10–12 million from 2,100 theaters in its opening weekend, the film was released alongsideJumanji: The Next LevelandRichard Jewellin the United States.[30]However, after making $1.4 million on its first day (including $230,000 from Thursday night previews), estimates for the film were lowered to $4.5 million. It ended up debuting to just $4.2 million, finishing fifth at the box office.[31]The film fell 57% to $1.8 million in its second weekend, finishing in tenth.[32]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 39% of 114 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The website's consensus reads: "Better than the 2006 remake yet not as sharp as the original, thisBlack Christmasstabs at timely feminist themes but mostly hits on familiar pulp".[33]OnMetacriticthe film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100 based on reviews from 25 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[34]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "D+" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an "awful" average of 1.5 out of 5 stars, with 38% saying they would definitely recommend it.[31]
Simon Abrams ofRogerEbert.comgave the film three out of four stars, saying that it "mostly feels personal and urgent thanks to some atmospheric scare scenes and some sharp dialogue that reflect the world outside the movie theater in ways that most other studio-distributed horror films don't".[35]
David Fear ofRolling Stonegave the film three out of five stars, writing: "The best part about Takal and Wolfe's take on the material is that it's angry — righteously, deservedly, properly enraged about the crap that many people, but one gender in particular, have had to put up with for way, way too long".[36]Kimber Myers of theLos Angeles Timeswrote: "Fans of the original ... might not love writer-director Sophia Takal's take, butBlack Christmasis a fun film that gets its kicks out of literally smashing the patriarchy".[37]
Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiangave it one out of five stars: "It's quick, cheap-looking and entirely devoid of suspense, atmosphere and dramatic tension, so inept at times that it makes 2006's questionable remake suddenly seem like a misremembered masterwork".[38]Ed Potton ofThe Timesalso gave it one out of five stars and wrote: "The final half-hour brings ludicrous supernatural developments, some astonishing leaps in deduction from Riley and the least dramatic unmasking in screen history".[39]
John DeFore ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "Unfortunately, Takal'sBlack Christmasis far more ordinary, a blunt object in a fight demanding either sharp knives or explosives".[40]Rex ReedofThe New York Observergave it zero out of four stars: "Despite its desperate efforts to justify the homicides, there's nothing remotely innovative or even goofily satirical about it".[41]

Headmaster Narrow and a school legacy.
Anthony Justin ‘AJ’ James– teen male of color. Senior at the school. Roommates with Pharus.
Mr. Pendleton- white male professor. Has been teaching at the school for a long time.
The play begins at the graduation ceremony at the Charles R. Drew Prep School for Boys. As Pharus sings a song for the ceremony, Bobby calls him racial and homophobic slurs, causing Pharus to freeze. Later, Headmaster Stephen Marrow scolds Pharus for freezing, but Pharus refuses to snitch on his peers. Summer passes.
On the first day of class, Bobby and Jr serve their punishment for disturbing the ceremony. Bobby accuses Pharus of snitching, but he denies it. This culminates in Pharus kicking Bobby out of choir. Pharus, Jr, David, and AJ continue to sing together. Months later, Headmaster Marrow threatens to remove Pharus as the choir lead for not being able to get along with its members. Pharus says that he will appeal to the board and lightly accuses him of making that choice because he is queer. Headmaster Marrow takes back the threat and allows Pharus to continue as lead. Pharus and Bobby bicker in Mr. Pendleton’s class, leading Bobby to leave class. In the shower room, AJ calls Pharus out for singing loudly. In retaliation, Pharus begins talking about AJ’s penis size. AJ also calls Pharus out for using neutral pronouns when describing who AJ might have sex with. David enters and informs the two that he overheard their conversation, but Pharus explains that they were just joking. Later, inside Pharus and AJ’s dorm room, they begin jokingly arguing. They begin play-fighting, tackling, and tickling, and Pharus becomes aroused and pushes AJ off him. AJ realizes what has happened.
During a call home to Pharus’ mom, he tells her that he will not be singing at Commencement, but he hopes that she will continue to be proud of him. Later in the shower room, Pharus enters and starts talking to someone, but they remain unseen to the audience. Pharus tells the person that he misses him. Jr. reenters, and the audience hears the sound of Pharus getting punched. 
Afterwards, the Headmaster starts to question people about the incident. Pharus insists that he fell and repeats that he is “a Drew man”. AJ and David both deny hitting Pharus, but David is suspended and his scholarship is taken away, causing him to no longer be able to attend the school. When the headmaster and Mr. Pendleton discuss the school, the headmaster says that he never expected to deal with queer issues. The teachers then explain how Pharus cannot sing during commencement because “boys with black eyes” are not allowed to represent the school.
The day before commencement, Pharus wakes AJ up with his practicing in hopes that the headmaster will change his mind. AJ cuts Pharus’ hair and tells him the story of the last time he went to the barbershop, where he was called a homophobic slur. After, AJ lets Pharus sleep beside him. In the final scene of the play, Bobby sings the commencement music. Bobby pauses at the same moment where Pharus did at the beginning of the play, turns around to look at him, and then continues the song.
