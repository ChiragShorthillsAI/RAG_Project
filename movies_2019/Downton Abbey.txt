In 1927, the Crawleys receive word thatKing George VandQueen Maryintend to visit Downton during their royal tour of Yorkshire, exciting both the family and the staff. As the servants begin preparations, Lady Mary feels that house butler Barrow is ill-equipped to manage such an important event and thus recruits former butler Carson to briefly exit retirement in order to assist, much to Barrow's chagrin. When theboilerbreaks down, a repairman shows up and seems to be flirting with Daisy, making Andy jealous. Shortly thereafter, members of the royal staff begin to arrive at Downton in advance of the King and Queen themselves. While Richard Ellis, the King's valet, treats the Downton staff kindly, the rest of the entourage are arrogant and rude, making it clear that the royal staff intends to supplant that of Downton for the duration of the visit. In addition, small items keep disappearing from the house.
Bertie and Edith Pelham, Marquis and Marchioness of Hexham, arrive the day before the royal couple is due to visit. Later that evening, chairs for the parade seating are delivered during heavy rain and Lady Mary leads a messy group effort to position the chairs for the next day. The weather clears and the King and Queen arrive at Downton, where they are introduced to the Crawley family. Violet exchanges cold pleasantries with the queen's lady-in-waiting Maud, who is Robert's first cousin once removed and Tom meets her maid Lucy Smith. Violet begrudges Maud for her decision to bequeath her estate to Lucy rather than to Robert.
Meanwhile, in the village, Tom encounters a mysterious man identifying himself as Major Chetwode, whom Tom initially believes is assessing security ahead of the royal visit and parade. Later, when the parade is set to begin, Chetwode prepares to assassinate the King in the staging area but is thwarted by Tom, whom Chetwode mistakenly believed was an ally because of their shared Irish origins, and Lady Mary, who disarms him after Tom pins him to the ground. After the parade, Tom encounters a woman sobbing on Downton's lawn. Unbeknownst to him, the woman isPrincess Mary. She laments her failing marriage, but Tom lifts her spirits and ultimately motivates her to remain with her husband.
Anna and Mr Bates rally the Downton staff into retaking control of Downton's operations while the royal couple is still visiting. Barrow and Ellis trick Mr Wilson, thePage of the Backstairs, into ordering some of the royal staff to return home toLondonearly. Anna slips a strong sedative into the tea of the royal chef, Monsieur Courbet, and Wilson himself is "accidentally" locked in his room. Anna has surmised that Miss Lawton, the Queen's dresser, is stealing the house's items and leverages her knowledge of Lawton's crimes to compel her to alter a gown for Lady Hexham. Then the Downton staff, with the assistance of Mr Molesley and Albert, manage the dinner that marks the end of the royal visit. The revised menu elicits high praise from the King, which in turn prompts Molesley to break protocol and announce that it was the Downton staff, not the royal staff, that produced it.
That evening, Barrow and Ellis make a trip toYork. Ellis visits his parents, while Barrow waits for him at a pub. A man at the pub invites Barrow to an underground gay nightclub, but shortly after their arrival there, police raid the venue and arrest the attendees. Ellis, also a closeted gay man, soon learns what happened and uses his position in the royal household to get Barrow released from police custody. Isobel deduces that Lucy is Maud's illegitimate daughter, which is why she stands to inherit Maud's estate. Isobel challenges Maud to explain the situation to Violet.
The next morning, Henry returns home after travelling abroad and joins the Crawleys atHarewood House, along with the royal family. During the ball that evening at Harewood, Princess Mary informs her parents that Tom helped save her marriage by convincing her to remain with her husband and she encourages the King to speak with Tom. He approaches Tom and expresses gratitude, also implying that he's aware of Tom's role in thwarting the assassination attempt at the parade.
The King releases Bertie from his obligation to join the Prince of Wales on a three-month tour of Africa, which the King had requested earlier in the visit. Bertie had initially accepted the commitment, but he later wished to back out of the trip after learning of Edith's pregnancy. Thanks to Cora and the Queen's intervention, the King had a change of heart and rescinded his request. Meanwhile, Maud privately confesses to Violet that Lucy is her daughter, which is why she made Lucy her heir instead of Robert. Violet finally understands the situation and the two reconcile. Violet then begins plotting to keep Maud's estate in the Crawley family in the future through a union of Tom and Lucy, as she had taken notice of the pair's budding romance earlier.
Finally, Lady Mary quietly asks Violet about her visit to London. Violet informs her that she had gone for a doctor's visit, during which she learned that she may not have long to live. Mary is distraught, but Violet assures her that Downton and its legacy are safe in Mary's hands. As this conversation continues, Tom finds Lucy on the terrace and the two dance in the dark while listening to the music played inside at the ball.

June Thomas writing forSlatepraised the film, writing: "The plot of theDownton Abbeymovie is brilliant, not so much because it is surprising, but because it allows every member of the cast to do what we expect of them".[55]In a more lukewarm reaction,Peter Bradshaw, writing forThe Guardian, said: "TheDownton Abbeymovie is not as spectacularly star-studded asGosford Park, but it's got its share of A-list talent, however: Maggie Smith, of course, as the dowager Countess of Grantham, Hugh Bonneville as Lord Grantham (absent-mindedly fondling his retriever at breakfast) – there's also Imelda Staunton in a new role and Jim Carter as the beetle-browed former butler Mr Carson. All are very underused".[56]
Writing in the British publicationRadio Times, Eleanor Bley Griffiths writes that Downton the film is "frankly disappointing". She explains that "What the film lacks is any sense of real jeopardy. As we found out from the trailer, the big plot-line is this: the King and Queen are coming to dinner and Downton must be made perfect! But that simple story is stretched out to a full two hours of incredibly low-stakes, predictable drama with an overabundance of sub-plots". Griffiths goes on to unfavourably compare the new film with the TV series: "On TV, there was time to explore different threads and highlight specific characters as the series went on; but the movie gives us a whole series-worth of storylines draped over one lacklustre main plot".[57]
The cast and crew were featured in a short interview segment onPBSpublic television on 20 September 2019, as recognition of the influence which the film and related series have had on American popular culture.[58]

In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Julian Alexander Kitchener-Fellowes, Baron Fellowes of West StaffordDL(born 17 August 1949), known professionally asJulian Fellowes, is an English actor, novelist, writer, producer, film director, andConservativepeer. He has receivednumerous accolades, including anAcademy Awardand twoEmmy Awardsas well as nominations for fourBAFTA Awards, aGolden Globe Award, twoOlivier Awards, and aTony Award.
Fellowes won theAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplayfor the murder mystery filmGosford Park(2001). He gained renown as the creator, writer and executive producer of themultiple award-winningITVtelevision seriesDownton Abbey(2010–2015) and theHBOseriesThe Gilded Age(2022–present). He also wrote books for stage musicals, includingMary Poppins(2006) andSchool of Rock(2015).
Fellowes was born into a family of theBritish landed gentryinCairo, Egypt, the youngest of four boys, to Peregrine Edward Launcelot Fellowes (1912–1999) and his British wife, Olwen Mary (néeStuart-Jones).[1]His father was a diplomat andArabistwho campaigned to haveHaile Selassie,Emperor of Ethiopia, restored to his throne duringWorld War II.[2]His great-grandfather wasJohn Wrightson, a pioneer in agricultural education and the founder ofDownton Agricultural College.[3]Peregrine's uncle was Peregrine Forbes Morant Fellowes (1883–1955),Air Commodoreand DSO.
Fellowes has three older brothers: Nicholas Peregrine James, actor; writer David Andrew; and playwright Roderick Oliver.[4]The siblings' childhood home was at Wetherby Place,South Kensington,[5]and afterwards atChiddingly, East Sussex, where Fellowes lived from August 1959 until November 1988, and where his parents are buried.
The house in Chiddingly, which had been owned by thewhodunitwriterC. H. B. Kitchin, was within easy reach of London where his father, who had been a diplomat, worked as an executive forShell. Part of Fellowes' formative years were also spent inNigeria, where his father helped run Shell operations during the transition from thecolonial eratoNigeria's Independence.[6][7]Fellowes has described him as one "of that last generation of men who lived in a pat of butter without knowing it. My mother put him on a train on Monday mornings and drove up to London in the afternoon. At the flat she'd be waiting in a snappy littlecocktail dresswith a delicious dinner and drink. Lovely, really."
The friendship his family developed with another family in the village, the Kingsleys, influenced Fellowes. David Kingsley was head ofBritish Lion Films, the company responsible for manyPeter Sellerscomedies. Sometimes "glamorous figures" would visit the Kingsleys' house.

In 2018, it was reported that Fellowes was slated to serve as a writer on a TV drama series about theRothschild banking dynasty, executive produced byJemima Goldsmith.[21]As of 2025, it remains unproduced.
Fellowes was the screenwriter and one of the producers forDownton Abbey, which was released in September 2019, and its sequel,Downton Abbey: A New Era. Most members of the cast of the television programme appear in the movie versions.[22][23]
In April 2015,The Hollywood Reporterreported that Fellowes was at work on a new period drama series forNBC television, to be set in late 19th-centuryNew York City, entitledThe Gilded Age.[24]Fellowes suggested that a younger version ofMaggie Smith's Dowager Countess character from hisDownton Abbeydrama might appear in the new series, saying: "Robert Crawley would be in his early teens, Cora would be a child. A young Violet [the Dowager Countess] could make an appearance."[24]As the title suggests, the series would be set during the time of America's so-calledGilded Age– the industrial boom era in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries – and portray the upper echelons of New York'shigh societyduring that period.[24]
Production and writing forThe Gilded Agewas updated in January 2016 indicating that filming would start at the end of 2016. As reported in RadioTimes: "NBC'sThe Gilded Ageis set to start shooting later this year, Fellowes tells RadioTimes.com. Asked whether he'd written the script yet, Fellowes replied, 'No I haven't, no. I'm doing that this year', before adding: 'And then hopefully shooting at the end of the year.'"[25]In April 2016, it was announced that Fellowes would be the producer ofThe Gilded Agewhen it was reported that Fellowes is "about to begin writingThe Gilded Agefor NBC, a sort of AmericanDowntonabout fortunes made and lost in late 19th century New York, which he will also produce."[26]
On 4 June 2016, Fellowes was asked byThe Los Angeles Times, "Where doesThe Gilded Agestand?" Fellowes replied,
It stands really with me up to my neck in research, and I'm clearing the decks, so that when I startGilded Age, I'm only doingGilded Age.These people were extraordinary. You can see why they frightened the old guard, because they saw no boundaries. They wanted to build a palace, they built a palace. They wanted to buy a yacht, they bought a yacht. The old guard in New York weren't like that at all, and suddenly this whirlwind of couture descended on their heads. The newcomers redesigned being rich. They created a rich culture that we still have – people who are rich today are generally rich in a way that was established in America in the 1880s, '90s, 1900s. It was different from Europe. Something like Newport would never have happened in any other country, where you have huge palaces, and then about 20 yards away, another huge palace, and 20 yards beyond that another huge palace. In England right up to the 1930s, when people made money, they would buy an estate of 5,000 acres and they'd have to look after Nanny. The Americans of the 1880s and '90s didn't want too much of that.[27]
In August 2016, Fellowes indicated that his plans forThe Gilded Agewould not overlap substantially with the characters inDownton Abbeysince most of them would have been children in those earlier "prequel" decades. Writing forCreative Screenwriting, Sam Roads asked Fellowes, "Will there be any connection betweenThe Gilded AgeandDownton Abbey?" to which Fellowes stated:
I can't see it really. Someone asked if you would you see any of theDowntoncharacters, but most of them would be children. They said that Violet wouldn't be a child, and I replied that "Yes, I suppose you could see a younger Violet", and this became a newspaper story. "Violet comes from Downton to appear inThe Gilded Age!" It might be fun, but I doubt at the beginning, because I want it to be a new show with new people.[28]
Fellowes wrote an adaptation of the novelDoctor Thorneby one of his favorite writers,Anthony Trollope.[29][30]TheITVadaptation aired on 6 March 2016.[31]A report in early September 2018 stated that Fellowes had two projects underway, both in development: the Netflix seriesThe English GameandThe Gilded Agefor NBC.[22]In May 2019,The Gilded Agemoved toHBO, and it premiered in January 2022.[32]

She is also a great-grandniece ofHerbert, 1st Earl Kitchener.[41]He proposed to her only 20 minutes after meeting her at a party, "having spent 19 minutes getting up the nerve". On 15 October 1998 the Fellowes family changed its surname from Fellowes to Kitchener-Fellowes.[42][43][44]
Fellowes publicly expressed his dissatisfaction that theproposals to change the rules of royal successionwere not extended tohereditary peerages, which had they been would have allowed his wife to succeed her uncle asCountess Kitchenerin her own right. He said: "I find it ridiculous that, in 2011, a perfectly sentient adult woman has no rights of inheritance whatsoever when it comes to a hereditary title."[45]Instead, thetitlebecame extinct on her uncle's death because there were no male heirs, as he was unmarried.
On 9 May 2012, QueenElizabeth IIissued aroyal warrant of precedencegranting Lady Fellowes the same rank and style as the daughter of anearl, as would have been due to her if her late father had survived his brother and therefore succeeded to the earldom.[46]Fellowes and his wife have one son, Peregrine Charles Morant Kitchener-Fellowes (born 1991).[43]
