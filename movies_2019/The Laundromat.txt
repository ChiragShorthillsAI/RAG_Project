The Laundromatis a 2019 Americancomedy-dramafilm directed bySteven Soderberghwith a screenplay byScott Z. Burns. It is based on the bookSecrecy Worldabout thePanama Papersscandal by authorJake Bernstein. The film starsMeryl Streep,Gary Oldman,Antonio Banderas,Robert Patrick,Jeffrey Wright,David Schwimmer,Matthias Schoenaerts,James Cromwell, andSharon Stone.
The Laundromathad its world premiere at the76th Venice International Film Festivalon September 1, 2019,[2]and was released inselect theatersin the United States on September 27, 2019, before its streaming release on October 18, 2019, byNetflix. The film received mixed reviews from critics.
LawyersJürgen Mossack(Gary Oldman) andRamón Fonseca(Antonio Banderas) introduce themselves, along with the concept of money and credit. The pair serve as narrators for three stories of people around the world who are adversely affected by the machinations of their company,Mossack Fonseca. While the story has been somewhat fictionalized, the names of the law firm at the center of the scandal,[3]along with those of its founders, were not.[4]Neither were the names and roles of individuals involved in theWang Lijun incidentchanged.
Characters Ellen Martin (Meryl Streep) and her husband, Joe, are on a pleasure boat, theEthan AllenatLake George, New York, when it capsizes, drowning Joe and many others. When Ellen tries to get compensation from the boating company for Joe's death, she cannot because thereinsurancecompany that the boat company's owner and son, Matthew (David Schwimmer), bought their policy from, was sold to another company based out ofNevis. The Nevis-based company is actually atrustof one of Mossack'sshell corporations, which is under investigation by theInternal Revenue Service(IRS) for fraud.
When her attempts to contact Mossack and the Nevis-based company are unsuccessful, Ellen travels there to confront Malchus Boncamper (Jeffrey Wright), the manager of the trust. When Ellen bumps into Malchus, not knowing who he is, she asks questions about his firm's location. He lies and walks away. When Malchus travels toMiamihe is arrested byIRS-CI Special Agentsat the airport.
The second story is about Simone (Jessica Allain), who is the daughter of Charles (Nonso Anozie), an African billionaire. When Simone discovers her best friend is having an affair with Charles, he offers her shares (supposedly worth $20 million) in one of his investment companies to keep her silence. She accepts his offer, but when she travels to Mossack's offices inPanama Cityto claim the shares, they turn out to be worthless because the company was owned by another Mossack shell (itself presumably owned by Charles) that had recently emptied the company's bank account.
The third story is a dramatization of the death ofNeil Heywood, part of theWang Lijun incident. Heywood (played byMatthias Schoenaertsand renamed "Maywood" in the film), is an intermediary for wealthy Chinese looking to funnel money abroad. He visits aChongqinghotel to meetGu Kailai(Rosalind Chao). Maywood demands and pressures Gu for a much higher price if she wants him to continue laundering money for her family through a shell company Mossack owns. Gu responds by poisoning Maywood's drink. Gu discloses the incident and reports Maywood to Chongqing police chiefWang Lijun(Ming LoatIMDb) who secretly records the conversation; Wang then reports Gu to the Chinese government. The story ends with the arrest of Gu and her husbandBo Xilaifor Maywood's murder and for corruption.
The film ends with the leaking of thePanama Papersand subsequent police raids on Mossack Fonseca, the brief imprisonment of Mossack and Fonseca, and the shutdown of the firm. Mossack (Gary Oldman) and Fonseca (Antonio Banderas), along with Meryl Streep as herself,then remind viewersthat many such companies still exist, and the practice of money laundering and corruption using fake trusts and shell companies based intax havensis still widespread. Streep closes the film with a statement about the immediate need for campaign finance reforms in the US before adopting theStatue of Liberty's pose.
In a 2019 interview with Risa Sarachan inForbes, Steven Soderbergh described his goal for the take away from this film: "... my response is two-fold. One, well, in terms of policy you might want to think about supporting people who believe this is an issue that needs to be addressed. And do a little dive into how they think it should be addressed. Part two is to look around you and realize to what extent we are all touched by it. Whenever you think about, well, who owns this block? Who owns the real estate in my neighborhood? Who owns the real estate where I go shopping? It's sort of like the dark matter of our socio-economic life, these companies that behave like this. This is everywhere, and just being aware of it - I think if you're being inoculated to think that way or look at things that way, that's better than being oblivious or ignorant."[5]
In July 2016, it was announced thatSteven Soderberghwould produce a then-untitledPanama Papersproject.[6]Later, in April 2018, it was announced that Soderbergh would also direct the film, now titledThe Laundromat.Scott Z. Burnswrote the screenplay and production was set to commence in the fall of 2018.[7]In May 2018, it was reported thatMeryl Streep,Gary OldmanandAntonio Banderaswere in talks to star in the film, withNetflixinterested in acquiring the distribution rights.[8][9]Soderbergh affirmed that Netflix would likely be the film's distributor in July.[10]In October, Netflix was confirmed to be releasing the movie, withDavid SchwimmerandWill Forteadded to the cast.[11]That same month,Matthias Schoenaerts,Jeffrey Wright,Chris Parnell,James Cromwell,Melissa Rauch,Larry WilmoreandRobert Patrickjoined the cast.[12][13]
Principal photographybegan on October 15, 2018.[14]
The Laundromathad its world premiere at the76th Venice International Film Festivalon September 1, 2019.[15][2]It also screened at theToronto International Film Festivaland theSan Sebastián International Film Festivalin September 2019.[16][17]It was released inselect theatersin the United States on September 27, 2019, before being released for digital streaming on October 18, 2019, byNetflix.[18]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval of 41% based on 177 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "The Laundromatmisuses its incredible cast by taking a disappointingly blunt and unfocused approach to dramatizing the real-life events that inspired it."[19]Based on 37 critics onMetacritic, the film's weighted average score is 57 out of 100, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[20]
Todd McCarthyofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "there's a kind of off-putting effrontery about Soderbergh's approach here that rather sours the whole experience. The tone is brittle, the attitude arch, the performances by a savvy and diverse cast uneven."[21]
Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timescalled it "a muddled, meandering, hit-and-miss social satire and political commentary that's too heavy on the latter category and often lacking in the former."[22]Alonso DuraldeofTheWrapwrote: "The Laundromatflails about, with an excess of bad ideas that undercut the justifiable outrage over the events depicted."[23]
Owen GleibermanofVarietygave it a positive review and wrote: "The Laundromatis Soderbergh at his most playful, and also Soderbergh at his most wonkish, and damned, in this case, if the two don't chime together."[24]A.O. ScottofThe New York Timeswrote: "Soderbergh and his top-notch cast (Sharon Stone shows up, as do Jeffrey Wright and Matthias Schoenaerts) keep things lively, playing out parables of betrayal and deception with pulpy, TV-movie flair."[25]
The film was criticized for its use ofbrownface, casting Streep in a secondary role as a Panamanian woman called Elena.[26][23][27][28]Soderbergh acknowledged the controversy, but felt that in the context of the story the dual role was justifiable. He also felt that as a comedy trope it was acceptable and compared it to Oldman's impression of a German person, and that there are different rules for comedy.[26]
On October 16, 2019, weeks after its limited theatrical release and just two days before its scheduled streaming release, the twoMossack Fonsecalaw firm partners at the center of the film,Jürgen MossackandRamón Fonseca, sued Netflix in an attempt to block the film's release.[29][30]They argued the film defamed them. Netflix responded the next day, calling the suit "laughable," and argued the film was "constitutionally protected speech."[31]A Connecticut judge denied the injunction and moved the case to California, allowing the film to be released as planned.[4][32]The Panamanian government also expressed strong objections to the film's release. In December 2019, a U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the film did not defame Mossack and Fonseca; and was protected under theFirst Amendment to the United States Constitutionas free speech.[33][34]Panama's vice presidentJosé Gabriel Carrizopledged that Panama would do everything in its power to "fix" the country's image worldwide.[35][36]
Because the movie involves disgraced Chinese politicianBo Xilai, and the sensitive topic oforgan harvestingofFalun Gongpractitioners, it was blocked from release in China and itsDoubanentry deleted.[citation needed]The film is mentioned in the Douban entries of Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman.[37]

Steven Andrew Soderbergh(/ˈsoʊdərˌbɜːrɡ/SOH-dər-burg; born January 14, 1963)[1]is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, cinematographer, and editor. A pioneer of modernindependent cinema, Soderbergh later drew acclaim for formally inventive films made within thestudio system.
Soderbergh's directorial breakthrough, the indie dramaSex, Lies, and Videotape(1989), lifted him into the public spotlight as a notable presence in the film industry. At 26, Soderbergh became the youngest solo director to win thePalme d'Orat theCannes Film Festival, and the film garnered worldwide commercial success, as well asnumerous accolades. His next five films, including the critically laudedKing of the Hill(1993), found limited commercial success. He pivoted into more mainstream fare with the crime comedyOut of Sight(1998), the biopicErin Brockovich(2000) and the crime dramaTraffic(2000). ForTraffic, he won theAcademy Award for Best Director.
Soderbergh found further popular and critical success with theOcean'strilogy and film franchise(2001–18),Che(2008),The Informant!(2009),Contagion(2011),Haywire(2011), theMagic Miketrilogy (2012-23),Side Effects(2013),Behind the Candelabra(2013),Logan Lucky(2017),Unsane(2018),Let Them All Talk(2020),No Sudden Move(2021), andKimi(2022). His film career spans a multitude of genres but his specialties arepsychological,crime, andheist films. His films have grossed over US$2.2 billion worldwide and garnered fourteenAcademy Awardnominations, winning five.
Soderbergh's films often revolve around familiar concepts which are regularly used for big-budget Hollywood movies, but he routinely employs anavant-gardearthouseapproach. They center on themes of shiftingpersonal identities, vengeance,sexuality, morality, and thehuman condition. His feature films are often distinctive in the realm ofcinematographyas a result of his having been influenced byavant-garde cinema, coupled with his use of unconventionalfilmandcamera formats. Many of Soderbergh's films are anchored by multi-dimensional storylines withplot twists,nonlinear storytelling,experimental sequencing, suspensefulsoundscapes, and third-person vantage points.
Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, inAtlanta, Georgia, to Mary Ann (néeBernard) and Peter Andrew Soderbergh, who was a university administrator and educator. Soderbergh hasSwedish,Irish, andItalianroots.[2]His paternal grandfather immigrated to the U.S. fromStockholm.[3]
As a child, he moved with his family toCharlottesville, Virginia, where he lived during his adolescence, and then toBaton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father became Dean of Education atLouisiana State University(LSU).[2]Soderbergh discovered filmmaking as a teenager and directed short films with aSuper 8and16 mm cameras.[4]He attended theLouisiana State University Laboratory Schoolfor high school before graduating and moving toHollywoodto pursue professional filmmaking.
In his first job, he worked as a game showcomposerand cue card holder; soon after which he found work as a freelance film editor. During this time, he directed the concert video9012Livefor the rock bandYesin 1985, for which he received aGrammy Awardnomination forBest Music Video, Long Form.[5]
After Soderbergh returned to Baton Rouge, he wrote the screenplay forSex, Lies, and Videotapeon alegal padduring an eight-day cross-country drive.[6]The film tells the story of a troubled man who videotapes women discussing their lives and sexuality, and his impact on the relationship of a married couple.[7]Soderbergh submittedSex, Lies, and Videotapeto the1989 Cannes Film Festivalwhere, at age 26, he became the youngest solo director to win thePalme d'Or, the top prize.[8][9]Its critical performance led it to become a worldwide commercial success, grossing $36.7 million on a $1.2 million budget.[10]
Sex, Lies, and Videotapeis considered to be the most influential catalyst of the 1990sIndependent Cinemamovement.[11][12]Film criticRoger Ebertcalled Soderbergh the "poster boyof theSundancegeneration".[13]His relative youth and sudden rise to prominence in the film industry had him referred to as a "sensation" and a prodigy.[14][15]In 2006,Sex, Lies, and Videotapewas selected by theLibrary of Congressfor preservation in the United StatesNational Film Registry, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and theAmerican Film Institutenominated it as one of the greatest movies ever made.[16][17]
When I say this is the most important motion picture you'll ever attend, my motivation is not financial gain, but a firm belief that the delicate fabric that holds all of us together will be ripped apart unless every man, woman, and child in this country sees this film and pays full ticket price, not some bargainmatinéecut-rate deal.
Soderbergh's directorial debut was followed by a series of low-budget box-office disappointments.[18][19]In 1991, he directedKafka,a biographical film ofFranz Kafkawritten byLem Dobbsand starringJeremy Irons. The film returned one tenth of its budget and received mixed reviews from critics.[20]Roger Ebert's review stated: "Soderbergh does demonstrate again here that he's a gifted director, however unwise in his choice of project".[21]Two years later, he directed the dramaKing of the Hill(1993), which again underperformed commercially, but fared well with critics.[22]Based on the memoir of writerA. E. Hotchner, the film is set during theGreat Depressionand follows a young boy (played byJesse Bradford) struggling to survive on his own in a hotel inSt. Louisafter his mother falls ill and his father is away on business trips.[23]Also in 1995, he directed a remake ofRobert Siodmak's 1949 film noirCriss Cross, titledThe Underneath, which grossed $536,020 on a $6.5 million budget and was widely panned by critics.[24]Soderbergh has since called the film "dead on arrival" and described the making of it as his bottoming out.[25]
Soderbergh, formerly a member ofWriters Guild of America West, left and maintainedfinancial corestatus in 1995.[26]
Soderbergh directedSchizopolisin 1996, a comedy which he starred in, wrote, composed and shot as well as directed. The film was submitted to theCannes Film Festivalto such a "chilly response" that he reworked the entire introduction and conclusion before releasing it commercially.[27]In the movie's introduction, he said: "In the event that you find certain sequences or events confusing, please bear in mind this is your fault, not ours. You will need to see the picture again and again until you understand everything".[28]He starred inSchizopolisas Fletcher Munson, a spokesman for aScientology-esque lifestyle cult, and again as Dr. Jeffrey Korchek, a dentist having an affair with Munson's wife.[28]The film switched languages multiple times mid-scene without subtitles, leaving large parts of it incomprehensible.[28]It was viewed by a critic as a "directorial palate cleanse" for Soderbergh.[29]During the months following his debut ofSchizopolis, he released a small, edited version of theSpalding Graymonologue filmGray's Anatomy.Soderbergh would later refer toSchizopolisas his "artistic wake-up call".[28]Soderbergh co-wrote the script for the 1997 horror-thrillerNightwatchwith Danish filmmakerOle Bornedal.Nightwatchis an English-language remake of Bornedal's ownfilm of the same name, which was produced three years earlier in Denmark.[30]
Soderbergh's reemergence began in 1998 withOut of Sight, a stylized adaptation of anElmore Leonardnovel, written byScott Frankand starringGeorge ClooneyandJennifer Lopez.[31]The film was widely praised, though only a moderate box-office success.[32]The critical reception of the movie began a multi-movie artistic partnership between Clooney and Soderbergh. Soderbergh followed up on the success ofOut of Sightby making another crime caper,The Limey(1999), from a screenplay byLem Dobbsand starring actorsTerence StampandPeter Fonda. The film was well-received and established him within thecinematic nicheof thriller and heist films.[33]He ventured into his first biographical film in 2000 when he directedErin Brockovich, written bySusannah Grantand starringJulia Robertsin herOscar-winning role as a single mother taking on industry in a civil action.[34]In late 2000, Soderbergh releasedTraffic, a social drama written byStephen Gaghanand featuring an ensemble cast.[35]Timecompared him to a baseball player hittinghome runswithErin BrockovichandTraffic.[35]Both films would be nominated at the2001 Academy Awards, making him the first director to have been nominated in the same year forBest Directorfor two different films since Michael Curtiz in 1938. He was awarded theAcademy Award for Best DirectorforTrafficand received best director nominations at the year'sGolden Globeand theDirectors Guild of AmericaAwards.[36][37]
In early 2001, he was approached to directOcean's Eleven, a reboot of the 1960sRat Pack-movieOcean's 11written byTed Griffin. After Griffin wrote the screenplay, Soderbergh signed on to direct. The film opened to critical acclaim and widespread commercial success.[38]It quickly became Soderbergh's highest-grossing movie to date, grossing more than $183 million domestically and more than $450 million worldwide.[39][40]Rolling Stonecredited the movie with "[spawning] a new era of heist movies".[38]In the same year, Soderbergh madeFull Frontal, which was shot mostly on digital video in an improvisational style that deliberately blurred the line between which actors were playing characters and which were playing fictionalized versions of themselves.[41]A year later, he was asked by executives atWarner BrosStudios to direct the psychological thrillerInsomnia(2002), starring Academy Award winnersAl Pacino,Robin Williams, andHilary Swank. Despite their insistence, Soderbergh declined, preferring to see it directed by up-and-coming directorChristopher Nolan.[42]
Before returning to theOcean'sseries, Soderbergh directedK Street(2003), a ten-part politicalHBOseries he co-produced with George Clooney.[43]The series was both partially improvised and each episode being produced in the five days prior to airing to take advantage of topical events that could be worked into the fictional narrative.[44]Actual political players appeared as themselves, either incameosor portraying fictionalized versions of themselves, notablyJames CarvilleandMary Matalin.[44]
The reason my career took such a left turn at a certain point was because I realized I was in danger of becoming aformalist. But that wasn't the best representation of me–even as a person. It's easy to fall into that because it's a very isolated position to occupy and it's easy to keep other elements–people and ideas–at a distance.
Soderbergh directedOcean's Twelve, a sequel toOcean's Eleven, in 2004. The second installment received muted critical reviews, and was another commercially successful film, grossing $362.7 million on a $110 million budget.[46]Matt Singer ofIndieWirecalled it a "Great Sequel About How Hard It Is to Make a Great Sequel."[47][48]Also in 2004, Soderbergh produced and co-wrote the adapted screenplay for the filmCriminal—a remake of the Argentine filmNine Queens—with his longtime assistant directorGregory Jacobs, who made his directorial debut with the film.[49]
A year later, Soderbergh directedBubble(2005), a $1.6 million film featuring a cast of nonprofessional actors. It opened in selected theaters andHDNetsimultaneously, and four days later onDVD. Industry heads were reportedly watching how the film performed, as its unusual release schedule could have implications for future feature films.[50][51]Theater-owners, who at the time had been suffering from dropping attendance rates, did not welcome so-called "day-and-date" movies.[52]National Association of Theatre Ownerschief executive John Fithian indirectly called the film's release model "the biggest threat to the viability of thecinema industrytoday."[53]Soderbergh's response to such criticism: "I don't think it's going to destroy the movie-going experience any more than the ability to get takeout has destroyed the restaurant business."[54]A romantic drama set in post-war Berlin,The Good German, starringCate Blanchettand Clooney, was released in late 2006. The film performed poorly commercially grossing $5.9 million worldwide against a budget of $32 million.[55]
Soderbergh next directedOcean's Thirteen, which was released in June 2007 to further commercial success and increased critical acclaim.[56]Grossing $311.3 million on an $85 million budget, it is the second highest-grossing film of his career after the firstOcean's.[57]The film concluded what would later be known as theOcean'strilogy, a collection of heist movies that would go on to be described as defining a new era of heist films.[58]Soderbergh directedChe, which was released in theaters in two parts, titledThe ArgentineandGuerrilla, and was presented in the main competition of the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, on May 22.Benicio del Toroplayed the Argentine guerrillaErnesto "Che" Guevarain an epic four-hour double bill which looks first at his role in theCuban Revolutionbefore moving to his campaign and eventual death in Bolivia.[59]Soderbergh shot his feature filmThe Girlfriend Experiencein New York in 2008. Soderbergh cast adult film starSasha Greyas the film's lead actress to great reception and controversy.[60][61]
Soderbergh's first film of 2009 wasThe Informant!, a black comedy starringMatt Damonas corporate whistleblowerMark Whitacre. Whitacre wore a wire for2+1⁄2years for theFBIas a high-level executive at aFortune 500company,Archer Daniels Midland(ADM), in one of the largestprice-fixingcases in history. The film was released on September 18, 2009. The script for the movie was written by Scott Z. Burns based onKurt Eichenwald's book,The Informant. The film grossed $41 million on a $22 million budget and received generally favorable reviews from critics.[62][63]Also in 2009, Soderbergh shot a small improvised film with the cast of the play,The Last Time I Saw Michael Gregg, a comedy about a theatre company staging Chekhov'sThree Sisters. He has stated that he does not want it seen by the public, and only intended it for the cast. Soderbergh nearly filmed a feature adaptation of the baseball bookMoneyball, starringBrad PittandJonah Hill. The book, byMichael Lewis, tells of howBilly Beane, general manager ofOakland Athletics, usedstatistical analysisto make up for what he lacked in funds to beat the odds and lead his team to a series of notable wins in 2002. Disagreements between Sony and Soderbergh about revisions toSteven Zaillian's version of the screenplay led to Soderbergh's dismissal from the project only days prior to filming in June 2009. In 2010, Soderbergh shot the action-thrillerHaywire, starringGina Carano,Ewan McGregor,Michael FassbenderandChanning Tatumwhich, even though was shot in early 2010, was not released until January 2012.[64]
In 2010, Soderbergh shot the epic virus thrillerContagion, written byScott Z. Burns.[65]With a cast includingMatt Damon,Kate Winslet,Gwyneth Paltrow,Laurence Fishburne,Marion CotillardandJude Law, the film follows the outbreak of a lethalpandemicacross the globe and the efforts of doctors and scientists to discover the cause and develop a cure. Soderbergh premiered it at the68th Venice Film Festivalin Venice, Italy on September 3, 2011, and released it to the general public six days later to commercial success andwidespread critical acclaim.[66]Grossing $135.5 million on a $60 million budget,Manohla DargisofThe New York Timescalled his film a "smart, spooky thriller about a thicket of contemporary plagues—a killer virus, rampaging fear, an unscrupulous blogger—is as ruthlessly effective as the malady at its cool, cool center."[67]
In August 2011, Soderbergh served as asecond unit directoronThe Hunger Gamesand filmed much of the District 11 riot scene.[68][69]In September and October 2011, he shotMagic Mike, a film starringChanning Tatum, about the actor's experiences working as a male stripper in his youth. Tatum played the title mentor character, whileAlex Pettyferplayed a character based on Tatum. The film was released on June 29, 2012, to a strong commercial performance and favorable critical acclaim.[70]Throughout 2012, Soderbergh had announced his intention to retire from feature filmmaking. He stated that "when you reach the point where you're saying, 'If I have to get into a van to do another scout, I'm just going to shoot myself,' it's time to let somebody who's still excited about getting in the van, get in the van."[71]Soderbergh later said that he would retire from filmmaking and begin to explore painting.[72]A few weeks later, Soderbergh played down his earlier comments, saying a filmmaking "sabbatical" was more accurate.[73]For his then-final feature film, he directed the psychological thrillerSide Effects, which starredJude Law,Rooney Mara,Channing TatumandCatherine Zeta-Jones. It was shot in April 2012 and was released on February 8, 2013.[74]Screened at the63rd Berlin International Film Festival,A. O.

Burns.George Clooneywas set for the lead role ofNapoleon Solobut had to drop out due to a recurring back injury suffered while filmingSyriana.[78]In November 2011 Soderbergh withdrew from the project due to budget and casting conflicts,[79]and was eventually replaced byGuy Ritchie. His final televised project before heading into retirement wasBehind the Candelabra. Shot in the summer of 2012, it starredMichael Douglasas legendarily flamboyant pianistLiberaceandMatt Damonas his loverScott Thorson. The film is written byRichard LaGravenese, based on Thorson's bookBehind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace, and produced byHBO Films.[80]It was selected to compete for thePalme d'Orat the2013 Cannes Film Festival.[81]
In May 2013—only months into his retirement—Soderbergh announced that he would direct a ten-part miniseries forCinemaxcalledThe Knick.

This is how we want to do this so that every two years, whoever comes on, has the freedom to create their universe."[84]
After his work withThe Knick, Soderbergh began working on a variety of personal projects starting with directing anOff-Broadwayplay titledThe Library, starringChloë Grace Moretzin January 2014.[85]On February 24, 2014, Soderbergh released a mash-up of Alfred Hitchcock'sPsycho(1960)and Gus Van Sant's1998shot-by-shot remake on his website, titledPsychos.[86][87]On April 21, 2014, Soderbergh released an alternate cut ofMichael Cimino's controversial 1980 WesternHeaven's Gateon his website.

Soderbergh's visual style often emphasizes wealthy urban settings, natural lighting, and fast-paced working environments.[8][2][130]Film critic Drew Morton has categorized his stylistic approach to films akin to theFrench New Wavemovement in filmmaking.[131][132]Soderbergh's experimental style and tendency to rejectmainstream film standardsstems from his belief that "[filmmakers] are always, in essence, at the beginning of infinity... there is always another iteration... always will be."[133]
On a technical level, Soderbergh prefers sustainedclose-ups,tracking shots,jump cuts, experimental sequencing and frequently skipsestablishing shotsin favor of audio and alternative visuals.[8]Many of his films are noted for a milieu of suspense through the usage ofthird-personvantage points and a variety ofover-the-shoulder shots. In his filmContagion(2011), he used amulti-narrative "hyperlink cinema" style, first established withintheOcean'strilogy.[134]He is known for tracking aesthetic transitions with a variety ofcolored washes, most notably yellow to symbolize open, socially acceptable situations while blue washes typically symbolize illegal or socially illicit endeavors.[135]In line with these washes, Soderbergh is liberal in his usage ofmontagesas he believes that they are equally important story-telling as dialogue.[136]
Soderbergh is known for having a combative relationship withHollywoodand the standards ofstudio filmmaking.[2]Film criticRoger Eberthas commented in this stylistic antagonism, "Every once in a while, perhaps as an exercise in humility, Steven Soderbergh makes a truly inexplicable film... A film so amateurish that only the professionalism of some of the actors makes it watchable... It's the kind of film where you need the director telling you what he meant to do and what went wrong and how the actors screwed up and how there was no money for retakes, etc."[137]
InOcean's Twelve(2004), he had actressJulia Robertsplay the part of Tess, a character then forced to play a fictionalized version of Roberts.[138]During the production stages ofThe Girlfriend Experience(2009) he cast adult film starSasha Greyin the lead role.[138]InHaywire(2011), Soderbergh cast and eventually launched the film career of professionalmixed martial arts(MMA) fighterGina Carano.[139]Soderbergh'sLogan Lucky(2017) made reference to his trilogy by alluding to an "Ocean's7–11", noting the trilogy's influence on the Southern heist film.[138]
Soderbergh's films are centered on suspenseful and ambientsoundscapes.[140]A primary way he achieves suspenseful soundscapes is by introducing audio before visuals in cut scenes, alerting the viewer of a sudden change in tone.[140]His frequent collaborations with composersCliff Martinez,David Holmes, and most recentlyThomas Newman, provide his films with "the thematic and sonic landscapes into which he inserts his characters."[44]
The simplest way that I can describe it is that a movie is something you see, andcinemais something that's made…. Cinema is a specificity of vision. It's an approach in which everything matters. It's the polar opposite of generic or arbitrary and the result is as unique as a signature or a fingerprint. It isn't made by a committee, and it isn't made by a company, and it isn't made by the audience.
Soderbergh's early films—on account of his youth and lack of resources—were primarily filmed onSuper 8and16 mm filmformats.[142]A variety of his feature films have been shot using a diverse range of camera equipment. He filmed all ofThe Girlfriend Experience(2009) on aRed Onecamera, which has retailed for $17,500[143]—a relatively inexpensive camera for a movie produced for $1.3 million.[144]Soderbergh filmed the entirety ofUnsane(2018) on aniPhone 7 Pluswith its4K digital camerausing the app FiLMiC Pro.[145]He filmed with three rotating iPhones using aDJI stabiliserto hold the phone in place.[146]In January 2018, he expressed an interest in filming other productions solely with iPhones going forward.[147]He then filmed the entirety of 2019'sHigh Flying Birdon aniPhone 8.[148]
In addition to his directing, he is frequently a screenwriter for his films. Scott Tobias ofThe A. V. Clubhas noted his method ofexperimental filmmakingas "rigorously conceived, like a mathematician working out a byzantine equation". Starting in 2000 with his filmTraffic, when directing films Soderbergh has used various pseudonyms in order to hide the fact that he edits, writes, and arranges.[149]
When working with actors, Soderbergh prefers to pursue a non-intrusive directorial style. "I try and make sure they're OK, and when they're in the zone, I leave them alone. I don't get in their way".[150]This method has attracted repeat performances by many high-profile movie stars which has established a reoccurring collaboration between them and Soderbergh.[150]
Soderbergh's films often center the themes of shiftingpersonal identities,sexuality, and thehuman condition.[151]Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkerstated that Soderbergh is focused on the process of presenting ideas through film rather than their actual realization.[151]In line with this actual realization, he presents themes to critically evaluate political and corporate institutions such as money andcapitalism.[152]Film criticA. O. Scotthas noted that Soderbergh has a critical interest in exploring the impact capitalist economies have on living an ethical life and the detractions associated withmaterialism.[153]Money is central to many of his movies as Soderbergh believes that it serves as an obsession unrivaled by any other.[153]
Starting withOut of Sight(1998), Soderbergh's heist films explore themes of vengeance, characters on a mission, and the morality of crime.[154]He is generally said to have acinematic nichein these types of films. "I've always had an attraction to caper movies, and certainly there are analogies to making a film. You have to put the right crew together, and if you lose, you go to movie jail", the director noted in 2017.[155]
When asked about the top eleven films he regarded among the best, Soderbergh listed the following, in order:The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.(1953),All The President's Men(1976),Annie Hall(1977),Citizen Kane(1941),The Conversation(1974),The Godfather(1972),The Godfather Part II(1974),Jaws(1975),The Last Picture Show(1971),Sunset Boulevard(1950) andThe Third Man(1949).[156]His directorial debut,Sex, Lies, and Videotape(1989), was influenced byMike Nichols' 1971 American comedy-dramaCarnal Knowledge.[157]He has said thatPeter Yates' 1972 crime-comedyThe Hot Rockinspired the tone of theOcean'sfilms.[158]Soderbergh listedCosta-Gavras's film,Zas an inspiration on his filmTrafficand even stated that he: "wanted to make it like [Costa-Gavras]'sZ".[159][160][161][162]Soderbergh also cites the Swiss-French directorJean-Luc Godardas "...a constant source of inspiration. Before I do anything, I go back and look at as many of his films as I can, as a reminder of what's possible".[163]
In 2018, Soderbergh launched aBoliviangrape spirit brand called "Singani 63". In 2014, he had teamed up with adistillerybased inTarija, Casa Real and became the sole exporter of the spirit from the mountains of Bolivia.[164][165]Singaniis a traditional spirit of Bolivia, and Soderbergh doesn't like to label singani abrandy, because he says, "Millennials hate brandy." To demonstrate this, he created a very short iPhone/YouTube video, "Brandy VS Singani 63", that asks people to give their thoughts regarding brandy and Singani 63.[166]
Soderbergh has worked with various actors, composers, and screenwriters throughout his filmmaking career. His most prolific collaborators are considered to beGeorge Clooney(who startedSection Eight Productionswith him and has appeared in six of his films),Matt Damon(his most frequent collaborator, who has appeared in nine of his films),Brad Pitt,Julia Roberts,Don Cheadle, andChanning Tatum. Other actors who have appeared in numerous Soderbergh films includeLuis Guzmán,Jude Law,Ann Dowd,Joe Chrest,[167]Benicio Del Toro,Catherine Zeta-Jones,Michael DouglasandAlbert Finney.[168]Among those who have won awards for their work with Soderbergh, Roberts won anAcademy Award for Best Actressfor her lead inErin Brockovich;Benicio del Toroalso won an Academy Award for his work inTraffic, and later starred as the title role inChe.Catherine Zeta-Jonesreceived aGolden Globenomination for her portrayal of Helena inTrafficand reteamed with him forOcean's TwelveandSide Effects.[168]
Soderbergh has frequently relied onJerry Weintraubto produce many of his films.[169]ComposerCliff Martinezhas scored eleven Soderbergh films starting withSex, Lies, and Videotape(1989) and ending withKimi(2022). Northern Irish composerDavid Holmesjoined him in 1998 to scoreOut of Sightand rejoined him in scoring hisOcean'strilogy.[170]Soderbergh rejected Holmes' score for his 2006 filmThe Good German, but brought him back for subsequent movies, most recentlyLogan Lucky(2017).[170][171]Starting in 2000, composerThomas Newmanhas worked with four Soderbergh films, most recently in 2020 withLet Them All Talk.[172]Often editing the films himself, he also works with editorStephen Mirrioneand frequently collaborates with screenwritersScott Z. Burns,Lem DobbsandEd Solomon.[173]
Soderbergh is a vocal proponent of the preservation of artistic merit in the face of Hollywood corporatism. He believes that "cinemais under assault by the studios and, from what I can tell, with the full support of the audience".[151]He claims that he no longer reads reviews of his movies. "AfterTrafficI just stopped completely", said the director.[174]"After winning the LA and New York film critics awards, I really felt like, this can only get worse".[174]
Soderbergh is not a fan ofpossessory credits, and prefers not to have his name front and center at the start of a film. "The fact that I'm not an identifiable brand is very freeing," says Soderbergh, "because people get tired of brands and they switch brands. I've never had a desire to be out in front of anything, which is why I don't take a possessory credit."[174]He often takes cinematography credits on his feature films under the alias Peter Andrews, the given name of his father, and editing credits under Mary Ann Bernard, that of his mother.
In 2009, Soderbergh appeared before theU.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and "cited the French initiative in asking lawmakers to deputize the American film industry to pursue copyright pirates," indicating he supports anti-piracy laws and Internet regulation.[175]
Soderbergh married actressBetsy Brantleyin 1989; the couple had a daughter together before their 1994 divorce.[19]He has been married toJules Asnersince 2003, whom he often credits for influencing his female characters.[176]He has a daughter, born in 2010, with a woman in Australia, where he was working during a separation from Asner.[177]Soderbergh lives in New York City.[178]His 2023 web seriesCommand Zwas filmed inside his own home.[179]
In 2009, Soderbergh signed a petition in support of film directorRoman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his1977 sexual abuse case.[180]
Soderbergh's entire filmography isroutinely analyzed and debatedby fans, critics,film academics, and other film directors.[141][181]His early work—particularly his 1989 film,Sex, Lies, and Videotape—has been noted as foundational to theIndependent Cinemamovement.[25][182][183]After directing his first film, Soderbergh's relative youth and sudden rise to prominence in the film industry had him referred to as a "sensation", aprodigy, and aposter boyof the genre's generation.[13][14]In 2002, he was elected first Vice President of theDirectors Guild of America.[184]
After screeningSex, Lies, and Videotapeat the 1989Cannes Film Festival, Soderbergh was given the festival's top award, thePalme d'Or.[8]At 26, he was the youngest solo director to win the award and second-youngest director after French directorsLouis Malleand co-directorJacques Cousteau(Malle won it aged 23).[9]For his script, Soderbergh received a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplayat the62nd Academy Awards.[185]
Soderbergh was nominated twice forBest Directorfor two separate films at the73rd Academy Awards, the first occurrence of such an event since 1938. Apart from his first nomination (Erin Brockovich), he won the award forTraffic.[37]When the same thing happened at theDirectors Guild of AmericaAwards, theAssociated Presscalled the category a "Soderbergh vs. Soderbergh" contest.[36]
For his work ofErin BrockovichandTraffic, Soderbergh became one of the five directors (alongsideQuentin Tarantino,Curtis Hanson,David Fincher, andBarry Jenkins) to ever sweep "The Big Four" critics awards (LAFCA,NBR,NYFCC,NSFC).

José Antonio Domínguez Bandera[1][2]was born on 10 August 1960, inMálaga, Andalusia[3]toCivil Guardofficer José Domínguez Prieto (1920–2008) and schoolteacher Ana Bandera Gallego (1933–2017).[4]He has a younger brother named Francisco.[4]As a young boy, Banderas wanted to become a professionalfootballplayer until a broken foot sidelined his dreams at the age of 15. He showed a strong interest in the performing arts and formed part of the ARA Theatre School run by Ángeles Rubio-Argüelles y Alessandri (wife of diplomat and filmmakerEdgar Neville) and the College of Dramatic Art, both in Málaga. His work in the theater and his performances on the streets eventually landed him a spot with the Spanish National Theatre.[5]
Banderas began his acting studies at the School of Dramatic Art inMálagaand made his acting debut at a small theater in Málaga. He began working in small shops during Spain's post-dictatorial cultural movement known asLa Movida Madrileña.[6]
While performing with the theater, Banderas caught the attention of Spanish directorPedro Almodóvar, who gave the young actor his film debut in thescrewballsex comedyLabyrinth of Passion(1982). Five years later, he went on to appear in the director's comedic thrillerLaw of Desire(1987), making headlines with his performance as a gay man, which required him to engage in his first male-to-male onscreen kiss. Banderas appeared in Almodóvar'ssurrealistsex comedyMatador,withVincent CanbyofThe New York Timeswriting, "The movie looks terrific and is acted with absolute, straight-faced conviction by the excellent cast headed by Miss Serna, Mr. Martinez and Mr. Banderas."[7]
The director cast him in his internationally acclaimed 1988 film,Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. Rita Kemply ofThe Washington Postdescribed Banderas' performance as "warm" and described the film as a "glossy delight."[8]The recognition Banderas gained for his role increased years later, when he starred in Almodóvar's controversialTie Me Up! Tie Me Down!(1989) as amental patientwho kidnaps a porn star (Victoria Abril) and keeps her tied up until she returns his love.[5]The breakthrough role helped spur him on to Hollywood.[9]Almodóvar is credited with helping launch Banderas's international career, as he became a regular feature in his films throughout the 1980s.[10]
In 1991,Madonnaintroduced Banderas to Hollywood. (He was an object of her desires in her pseudodocumentary film of one of her concert tours,Madonna: Truth or Dare.)[11]The following year, still speaking minimal English, he began acting in American films. Despite having to learn all his lines phonetically, Banderas still managed to turn in a critically praised performance as a struggling musician in his first American drama film,The Mambo Kings(1992).[12]Kenneth TuranofThe Los Angeles Timesdescribed Banderas as giving a "quietly effective job".[13]David Nansen ofNewsweekdeclared, "Banderas had to learn English to play this role, but you wouldn't know it: he plumbs all the nuances of charm and self-pity in Nestor's melancholic soul".[14]Owen Gleiberman ofEntertainment Weeklyalso praised Banderas' performance writing, "he gives a surprisingly confident and subtle performance as the implosive Nestor".[15]
Banderas then broke through to mainstream American audiences in the 1993Jonathan DemmefilmPhiladelphiaas the life partner of lawyerTom HanksandDenzel Washington.  Also in 1993, he acted in theBille August-directedThe House of the Spirits,an adaptation of theIsabel Allendenovel of the same name.

The film was a financial success.[17]Owen Gleiberman ofEntertainment Weeklywrote, "The movie’s greatest visual coup... is Banderas himself. The camera loves this velvet stud as much as it did the youngClint Eastwood."[18]
That same year, Banderas portrayed the antagonist in theRichard Donner-directed action filmAssassins, co-starring oppositeSylvester StalloneandJulianne Moore.[19]In 1996, he starred alongsideMadonnain the musical filmEvita, an adaptation of the stage musical byAndrew Lloyd WebberandTim Ricein which he played the narrator, Che, a role played byDavid Essexin the original 1978 West End production.Janet MaslinofThe New York Timeswrote that "Banderas... does an unexpectedly splendid job as the film's conspiratorial singing narrator."[20]For his performance, he was nominated for theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.[21]He also had success with his role as the masked swordsmanZorroin the 1998 filmThe Mask of Zorro,starringAnthony HopkinsandCatherine Zeta-Jones.Roger Ebertpraised the onscreen chemistry between the two leads, writing, "The best scenes in the movie are between Banderas and Zeta-Jones, who share chemistry and, it turns out, a sense of justice."[22]His performance earned him anotherGolden Globe Awardnomination.[23]In 1999, he starred in the historical action filmThe 13th Warrior, a movie about aMuslimcaught up in a war between theNorthmanand human-eating beasts.[24]

He portrayed Gregorio Cortez, a retired OSS agent, alongsideCarla Gugino, who played his wife, Ingrid Cortez.Roger Ebertpraised the first film, describing it as "giddy with the joy of its invention. It's an exuberant, colorful extravaganza, wall-to-wall with wildly original sets and visual gimmicks, and smart enough to escape the kids film category and play in the mainstream."[25]He also starred inMichael Cristofer'sOriginal SinalongsideAngelina Joliethe same year.
In 2002, he portrayedsocial realistpainterDavid Alfaro SiqueirosinJulie Taymor's biographical dramaFrida,withSalma HayekplayingFrida Kahlo.[26]That same year, he starred inBrian De Palma'serotic thrillerFemme FataleoppositeRebecca Romijn, and in 2003, he starred in the last installment of the trilogyOnce Upon a Time in Mexico(in which he appeared withJohnny Deppand Hayek).

The film was directed byBruce Beresfordand written byLarry Gelbart.[32]Phil Gallo ofVarietywrote, "Villa was larger than life, and Banderas vibrantly captures his bravado. Everything in the telepic, though, is designed to make Villa a likable force, which pushes and pulls Banderas in a number of directions, only some of which play well. Eventually, 'Villa' exposes a dark side in the man, and Banderas forsakes crafting the image of a hero to allow the man’s ambiguity to shine."[33]Banderas was nominated for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movieand theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Filmfor his performance.[34]

ScottofThe New York Timeswrote, "Banderas... can be marvelously subtle and affecting as well as magnetic.

Banderas once described himself as anagnosticin an interview withPeoplemagazine in 2006: "I have to recognize that I am agnostic. I don’t believe in any kind of fundamentalism. I prefer to take life in a different way, with a sense of humor. I try to teach my kids to be open. Whatever they believe is fine with me."[70]He does describe himself close toCatholicspirituality, especially toHoly Week, which he considers a "metaphor for life".[71]He is an officer (mayordomo de trono) of a religious brotherhood in his hometown ofMálagaand travels during Holy Week to take part in theprocessions.[72]Banderas developed his relationship with Catholicism back in 1994 after a spiritual search.[73][74]
"There was a moment in my life in which I separated a bit from the Church. I was searching for a spiritual connection in other places, until in 1994, after my brother had a surgery we were very afraid of, in which we could lose him, I realized I should have not searched for so much, that I had had always that connection with the trascendental in front of my face. It also happened in a way which followed our own traditions, which we shouldn't look for inthe Buddha, as these characters were right there. In my own neighborhood was that way to connect myself to the trascendental through thePassion of the Christ, until concluding inResurrection."
In 2021, he described his religious beliefs and vision of the Holy Week toEl País:[75]
"I live comfortably in the mystery, I'm very doubting, I don't know if agnostic is exactly the word. But I think yes, there is something, although we don't know what is it. TheBig Bang, yes, and before the Big Bang, what? Holy Week has many colors, it's a very strange poliedrum. It is related to faith, popular religion and Andalusian idiosyncrasy. It's just the RomanIdes of March: winter dies and spring is born. The Andalusian version is so colourful and merry because everybody knows the guy will resurrect on Sunday. And there is a happy ending."
Banderas marriedAna Leza[es]in 1987 and divorced her in 1996. He met and began a relationship with American actressMelanie Griffithin 1995 while shootingTwo Much.[6][76]They married on May 14, 1996, in London.

In 2009, Banderas underwent surgery for a benign tumor in his back.[84]Speaking at theMálaga Film Festivalin March 2017, Banderas revealed he had suffered a heart attack on January 26, 2017, but said it "wasn't serious and hasn't caused any damages." Following that incident, he underwent heart surgery to insert three stents into his arteries.[85]In aFresh Airinterview in September 2019, he recalled it as being life-changing. He said, "It just gave me a perspective of who I was, and it just made the important things [go to] the surface. When I say this, people may just think that I'm crazy, but it's one of the best things that ever happened in my life."[86]
He has invested some of his film earnings inAndalusianproducts, which he promotes in Spain and the US. He owns 50% of a winery inVillalba de Duero, Burgos, Spain, called Anta Banderas, which produces red and rosé wines.[87]

Schwimmer admitted to feeling like an outsider during his time at the school, recalling, "When I was there I always felt: 'This is not me, I'm surrounded by people with a different value system. And I just wanted to get out of California.'"[10]His best subjects were science and math and he originally wanted to become a doctor.[10]Schwimmer enrolled in a drama class, where he appeared in stage productions.

Much of theFriendssuccess is attributed to the plotline between his character Ross and his on-again-off-again love interest Rachel, which has been described as one of the greatest TV couples of all time by various media outlets.[18][19]ThePittsburgh Post-Gazettewas complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him "terrific".[20]Variety's television reviewer said: "All six of the principals, especially (Courteney) Cox and Schwimmer, appear resourceful and display sharp sitcom skills".[21]For this performance, he earned aPrimetime Emmy Awardnomination forOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Seriesin 1995.[22]

He later regretted this decision. Ultimately,Will Smithgot the role.[27]

[...] Take it from someone who has never seenFriendsand comes at Schwimmer with no preconceptions: He does just fine. As a TV sports reporter inKissing a Fool, he oozes the command and self-satisfaction of a young, successful man."[28]The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.[29]InSix Days, Seven Nights, he played the boyfriend ofAnne Heche's character. InApt Pupil, adapted from anovella of the same namebyStephen King,[30]he had a supporting role as a school guidance counselor.

The only thing believable about Schwimmer's acting is when he cowers in the face of true battle. His puppy dog eyes make him appear even more pitiful."[35]Later that year he portrayedYitzhak Zuckermanin the war dramaUprising, based on the true events of theWarsaw Ghetto Uprisingin 1943.[36][37]

He takes to the stage with ... his endearing gaucheness seems designed to ensure our continued sympathy. Schwimmer mercilessly lays bare his character's opportunism, casual cruelties, and chronic self-deception."[54]
In 2006, he made hisBroadwaydebut inHerman Wouk's two-act playThe Caine Mutiny Court-Martial.[55]Schwimmer played the role of Lieutenant Barney Greenwald in the production, which was directed byJerry Zaks.[56]In an interview withNew Yorkmagazine, he revealed that he had wanted to try Broadway, however said "a couple of things came up that just never quite felt right.

The film starsSimon Peggas an out of shape man who signs up for a marathon to convince his former fiancée and five-year-old son that he has turned his life around.[39]When asked why he decided to direct the film, Schwimmer said: "As a director, I was struck by the challenge that I thought the script presented, which was that it was kind of three films in one. You had some great, big physical comedy, and I thought funny dialogue and characters. And then there was some real emotion to it with the relationship between the father and the son and the romance aspect."[59]Run Fatboy Rungarnered mixed reception, with theNew York Daily Newsrating it one-and-a-half out of five stars and writing, "Most disappointing is how Schwimmer—who spent 10 seasons on a sitcom filled with hyperverbal characters—manages to bumble 'Fatboy's' tender moments."[60]USA Today, however, was favorable towards Schwimmer, reporting he possesses filmmaking finesse "having wisely chosen strong comic material for his debut behind the camera".[61]For his directorial work, he was nominated for aBritish Independent Film Awardin the category of Best Debut Director.[62]

We're surprised he didn't try something more challenging for his debut. If not much else, Schwimmer has encouraged his actors to intense their energy levels and comic timing at all costs".[69]TheNew York Post, however, noted that Schwimmer "knows a thing or two about freewheeling banter ... and for a good while the play crackles with terrific dialogue, expertly delivered".[70]In February 2009, he returned to theater in a Chicago production ofThornton Wilder's three-act playOur Townas George Gibbs at theLookingglass Theatre.[71][72]"Schwimmer ... turns in a poignant, richly textured and demonstrably heartfelt performance as George Gibbs.

But being the bright spot in too many dull movies (He Said, She Said;Irreconcilable Differences) stalled her career. ThoughBasic Instinctestablishes Stone as abombshellfor the 1990s, it also shows she can nail a laugh or shade an emotion with equal aplomb."[30]Australian critic Shannon J. Harvey ofThe Sunday Timescalled the film "one of the best films of the early1990s, doing more for female empowerment than any feminist rally. Stone – in her star-making performance – is as hot and sexy as she is ice-pick cold."[31]For the part, Stone earned aGolden Globe Awardnomination forBest Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, fourMTV Movie Awardsnominations, and aGolden Raspberry Awardnomination forWorst New Starfor her "tribute toTheodore Cleaver".

Her turn as a street-wise, middle-aged moll inGloria(1999), a remake of the 1980film of the same name, proved to be a critical and commercial misfire.[45][46][47]A titular role followed in 1999 with the comedyThe Muse, playing the inspiration of an esteemed screenwriter. Wade Major, a critic forBoxoffice, found her portrayal of a "dizzy Muse" to be "the film's most delightful surprise",[48]but most reviews were ultimately lukewarm.

Club, who had been critical of Stone's previous films, wrote that "nothing she's done has been quite as shameless or appalling asBeautiful Joe, a toxic piece of whimsy that ranks among the worst films of 2000".[55]
Following her September 2001 hospitalization for asubarachnoid hemorrhage, Stone took a hiatus from screen acting. She faced professional challenges as she was in the process of recovery. She felt that she had "lost [her] place" in Hollywood, and during a 2015 interview withUSA Today, she remarked: "[When] you find yourself at the back of the line in your business, as I did, [you] have to figure yourself out all over again."[56]She returned to the screen in 2003, when she took on a three-episode arc as Sheila Carlisle, an attorney who believes she can communicate with God, in the eighth season ofThe Practice.

After years of litigation,Basic Instinct 2was released on March 31, 2006. A reason for a long delay in releasing the film was reportedly Stone's dispute with the filmmakers over the nudity in the film; she wanted more while they wanted less. Stone told an interviewer, "We are in a time of odd repression and if a popcorn movie allows us to create a platform for discussion, wouldn't that be great?".[67]Despite an estimated budget of US$70 million,Basic Instinct 2placed only tenth in gross on its opening weekend with a meager US$3.2 million and finished with a total domestic gross of under US$6 million.

The film was released onNetflix, to critical acclaim.Owen Gleibermandescribed her appearance as a "marketing hook" and further stated: "The presence of Sharon Stone embodies the spirit of [the Hollywood] machine. She has always been a good actress (probably better than many know; just watch her inCasino), but her fame will forever rest on a certain crudely riveting but debased high-budget exploitation thriller".[96]She reunited with Soderbergh forThe Laundromat(2019), in which she played a harried realtor, oppositeMeryl Streep.
InNetflix's psychological thriller seriesRatched(2020), a prequel toMiloš Forman's 1975 filmOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nestdeveloped byRyan Murphy, Stone portrayed a wealthy heiress who hires a hit man to kill a doctor for disfiguring her son. Intrigued by Murphy's pitch for her character, which he wrote for her, Stone described the part as "completely insane. And at the same time she thinks she's really a loving mother who has her shit together".[97][98]The series garnered a decent critical response and was viewed by 48 million people in its first four weeks of release.[99]In 2020 Stone appeared as herself in an introduction to the fifth episode ofThe New Pope, where she had an audience withJohn Malkovichas Pope John Paul III.[100]

I mean, I'm gonna be 56 years old. If people want to think I'm a sex symbol, it's, like, yeah. Think it up. You know. I mean, like, good for me".[118]She posed nude for the September 2015 issue ofHarper's Bazaar, in which she stated: "At a certain point you start asking yourself, 'What really is sexy?' It's not just the elevation of your boobs. It's being present and having fun and liking yourself enough to like the person that's with you".[119]
On January 28, 2005, Stone helped solicit pledges for $1 million in five minutes for mosquito nets inTanzania,[120]turning a panel onAfrican povertyinto an impromptufundraiserat theWorld Economic ForuminDavos, Switzerland. Many observers, includingUNICEF, criticized her actions by claiming that Stone had reacted instinctively to the words of Tanzanian PresidentBenjamin Mkapa, because she had not done her research on the causes, consequences, and methods of preventingmalaria.[121]Of the $1 million pledged, only $250,000 was actually raised. In order to fulfill the promise to send $1 million worth of bed nets to Tanzania, UNICEF contributed $750,000.[122]This diverted funds from other UNICEF projects.[122]According to prominent economistXavier Sala-i-Martin, officials are largely unaware of what happened with the bed nets.

Well you know it was very interesting because at first, you know, I'm not happy about the way the Chinese are treating theTibetansbecause I don't think anyone should be unkind to anyone else. And so I have been very concerned about how to think and what to do about that because I don't like that. And I had been this, you know, concerned about, oh how should we deal with theOlympicsbecause they are not being nice to theDalai Lama, who is a good friend of mine. And then this earthquake and all this stuff happened, and then I thought, is thatkarma? When you're not nice that the bad things happen to you?[123]

I'm certainly not going to apologize for something that isn't real and true – not for face creams," although she did admit that she had "sounded like an idiot."[127]However, after the interview, Stone released a statement entitled "In my own words by Sharon Stone" in which she said "I could not be more regretful of that mistake. It was unintentional. I apologize. Those words were never meant to be hurtful to anyone."[128]While Stone cited the Dalai Lama as her "good friend" when she made the remark at the Cannes film festival, the Dalai Lama has reportedly distanced himself by saying of her only, "yes, I've met that lady".[129]
