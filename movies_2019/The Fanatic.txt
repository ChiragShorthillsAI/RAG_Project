William Frederick Durst(bornFrederick Allen Mayne III; August 20, 1970)[1]is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, actor, and director. He is the frontman and lyricist of thenu metalbandLimp Bizkit, formed in 1994, with whom he has released six studio albums.
Since 2006, Durst has worked on a number ofindependent films. He co-starred inPopulation 436, and made his directorial debut in 2007 withThe Education of Charlie Banks. He followed withThe Longshotsin 2008. His latest film,The Fanatic, came out in 2019.
Durst was born Frederick Allen Mayne III inJacksonville, Florida, but soon moved toOrlandoand then a farm inCherryville, North Carolina, at one year old. His mother Anita had him rechristened as William Frederick Durst after remarrying Bill Durst, a local police officer. Shortly after, Durst's parents had another child, his half-brother Cory Durst. In the fifth grade, he moved toGastonia, North Carolina, where he graduated fromHunter Huss High School.[2][3][4][5][6]As a child, Durst was bullied, which he incorporated into his music. At the age of 12, Durst took an interest inbreakdancing,hip hop,punk rock, andheavy metal. He began torap,skate,beatbox, and DJ. Leaving the Navy after two years (1988–1990), Durst moved back to Jacksonville with his father where he worked as a landscaper and a tattoo artist while developing an idea for a band that combined elements of rock and hip-hop.[7][8]
In 1994, Durst, Malachi Sage bassistSam Rivers, and Rivers' highschool friendJohn Ottojammed together and wrote three songs. GuitaristWes Borlandlater joined. Durst named the band Limp Bizkit because he wanted a name that would repel listeners.[9]Limp Bizkit developed a cult following in the underground music scene when its covers ofGeorge Michael's "Faith" andPaula Abdul's "Straight Up" began to attract curious concertgoers.[9]
Later, whenKornperformed in town as the opening act forSick of It All, Durst invited Korn to his house. He was able to persuade bassistReginald Arvizuto listen to demos of the songs "Pollution", "Counterfeit", and "Stalemate". Korn added a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit to two tours, which gave the band a new audience.[9][10]DJ Lethal, formerly of the hip hop groupHouse of Pain, joined the band as aturntablist. During this time Durst's disagreements with Borland led the guitarist to briefly leave the band, but re-join soon after.[9]
In 1997, Limp Bizkit signed withFlip Records, a subsidiary ofInterscope Records, and released their debut album,Three Dollar Bill, Y'allto moderate response. On October 23, 1997, Durst met the bandStaind, but friction quickly emerged between the two over the cover art of Staind's album. Durst unsuccessfully attempted to remove Staind from a concert bill shortly before their performance, but after hearing the band play,[11]he was so impressed that he signed them to Flip/Elektra, recorded a demo with the band, and co-produced their next album,Dysfunction.[11]
After Limp Bizkit finished a tour with the bandDeftones, Durst and DJ Lethal were asked byMax Cavalera, formerly of the bandSepultura, to appear on "Bleed", a song from theself-titled debutof his new bandSoulfly. Cavalera stated that producer Ross Robinson recommended that he work with Durst.[12]Durst also made an appearance on Korn's albumFollow the Leader.Jonathan Davishad intended to write abattle rapwithB-RealofCypress Hill, but the latter's label wouldn't let him do it, and Durst was tapped instead.[12]Davis and Durst wrote the lyrics for "All in the Family", which featured the two vocalists trading insults. Davis and Durst would often offer suggestions for each other's lyrics; a lyric written by Durst as "tootin' on your bagpipe" was changed to "fagpipes" by Davis, who stated "I helped him bag on me better".[12]
Durst began to take an interest in filmmaking, directing the music video for Limp Bizkit's single "Faith" in promotion for its appearance in the filmVery Bad Things; he was unsatisfied with it and made a second video which paid tribute to tour matesPrimus, Deftones andMötley Crüe, who appeared in the video.[12]
Limp Bizkit achieved mainstream success with the albumsSignificant Other(1999) andChocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water(2000). In June 1999, Durst was appointed Senior Vice President of A&R at Interscope.[11][13]Durst utilized his connections through the label and scouted numerous bands; landing record deals forCold,Staind,Puddle of Mudd, andShe Wants Revenge. Durst would also aid in attracting other bands such as30 Seconds to MarsandTaproot,[14]though Durst would pass on 30 Seconds to Mars, and he later engaged in a minor feud with Taproot after they rejected his original offer to sign the group to interscope in 1999.[15]
In the summer of 1999, Limp Bizkit played at the highly anticipatedWoodstock '99festival in front of approximately 200,000 people. The concert was tarnished by violent behavior from the crowd, much of which occurred during and after their performance, including fans tearing plywood from the walls during the song "Break Stuff". Severalsexual assaultswere reported in the aftermath of the concert.[10][11][16]Durst stated during the concert, "People are getting hurt. Don't let anybody get hurt. But I don't think you should mellow out. That's whatAlanis Morissettehad you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick 'em up. We already let the negative energy out. Now we wanna let out the positive energy".[11]Durst later stated in an interview, "I didn't see anybody getting hurt. You don't see that. When you're looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you're performing, and you're feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?"[11]Les Claypooltold theSan Francisco Examiner, "Woodstock was just Durst being Durst. His attitude is 'no press is bad press', so he brings it on himself. He wallows in it. Still, he's a great guy."[11]"It's easy to point the finger and blame [us], but they hired us for what we do — and all we did is what we do. I would turn the finger and point it back to the people that hired us," said Durst, in reference to original Woodstock co-founder, Michael Lang.[17]
In June 2000, Limp Bizkit's tour was sponsored by the controversialfile sharingserviceNapster. Durst was an outspoken advocate of file sharing.[10]During the 2000MTV Video Music Awards, Durst performed Limp Bizkit's song "Livin' It Up", as a duet withChristina Aguilera. In response to the performance,FilterfrontmanRichard Patrickclaimed that "Fred getting onstage with Christina Aguilera embarrassed us all."[18]In response to the negative reactions to the performance, Durst remarked, "People always just wanna talk about Britney or Christina. What's the problem? Because they make a type of music we aren't allowed to like? Or you think they are the nemesis of what our music is about? Why segregate? Why be so musically fuckin' racist? What do you mean, I can't hang out with these types of people? Clearly I didn't give a fuck, which fed a lot of it, too. I mean, someone that's not going to give in and apologise... it's gonna make people carry on talking."[19]
During a 2001 tour of Australia at theBig Day Outfestival inSydney, fans rushed the stage in themosh pit, and teenagerJessica Michalikdied ofasphyxiation. InAuckland, New Zealand, on the same tour, Durst threw water over the head of a security personnel tasked with defusing a similar situation.[20]During the Big Day Out crush, Durst has been accused of taunting security guards intervening in the situation.[21]In court, Durst, represented by his long-time attorney, Ed McPherson, testified he had warned the concert's organizers Aaron Jackson, Will Pearce and Amar Tailor and promoter Vivian Lees of the potential dangers of such minimal security.[22]After viewing video and hearing witness testimony, the coroner said it was evident that the density of the crowd was dangerous at the time Limp Bizkit took the stage and Durst should have acted more responsibly when the problem became apparent.[23]Durst stated that he was "emotionally scarred" because of the teenager's death.[24]
In 2002, Durst was tapped to write songs forBritney Spears, and later said that he was in a relationship with her. Spears denied Durst's claims.[25]In a 2009 interview, he explained that "I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her."[25]In February 2005, a sex tape featuring Durst was released on the Internet. Durst filed a $70 million lawsuit against ten websites that posted the video.[26][27]
In May 2003, it was reported that Durst was working on aNew Waveside-project alongside Limp Bizkit'sResults May Varyalbum. The band, named Pacifica, was reportedly in its "very early stages" and had a sound reminiscent ofDuran DuranandSoft Cell.[28]News about the band stopped quickly and no releases ever surfaced.
In July 2003, Limp Bizkit participated on theSummer Sanitarium Tour, headlined byMetallica.[29]In the days preceding the tour's stop in Chicago, local radio personalityMancow Mullermocked Durst and suggested that listeners who were attending the concert should heckle the singer and throw debris.[30]With the crowd chanting "fuck Fred Durst" and pelting the stage with garbage, Durst erupted after six songs, threw the microphone down and walked off stage.[31]Durst was eventually sued for breach of contract (for not completing the show) by Chicago lawyer Michael Young in aclass-action suit.[32]
In May 2005,The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)was released.Sammy Sieglertook over drumming duties for the band for much of the album. At Durst's insistence, the album was released as an underground album, without any advertising or promotion.[33][34]The album sold over 2,000,000 copies worldwide, peaking at number 24 on theBillboard200.[35][36]Durst later announced that despite the album's title, no sequel toThe Unquestionable Truthwould be produced.[37]Later in the year, the band released aGreatest Hitzalbum.[38]
Having been bullied while growing up, Durst disliked seeing people "using my music as fuel to torture other people"; feeling that his music was being misinterpreted, he would later cite this as the reason for the band taking a hiatus.[39]
Durst also said that he created a character for his music, but that he was also misunderstood by the public: "I always knew the guy in the red cap was not me. I'm Dr Frankenstein and that's my creature. Being a breakdancer, a graffiti artist, a tattoo artist and liking rock and hip hop was too much; it was a conscious effort to create Fred Durst and eventually I had to bring that guy out more than I wanted to. It took on a life of its own. I had to check into that character – the gorilla, the thing, the red cap guy. It's a painful transformation, but I do it 'cos that's what I was taught to do when you have people pulling at you".[40]
While Limp Bizkit was on hiatus, Durst began working inindependent films. In 2006, Durst costarred in the filmPopulation 436. His directorial debut,The Education of Charlie Banks, was released the following year. The film, which starredJesse Eisenberg,Chris MarquetteandJason Ritter, received mixed reviews;Rotten Tomatoesgave the film a score of 48% based on reviews from 31 critics. The website's consensus stated, "Unevenness and earnestness mire this otherwise sweet, surprising coming of age drama."[41]A second directorial effort,The Longshots, starringIce CubeandKeke Palmer, was released in 2008. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 41% based on 71 reviews, with the site's consensus indicating that the film was "a largely formulaic affair, rarely deviating from the inspirational sports movie playbook."[42]The same year, Durst appeared as a bartender in two episodes of the television medical dramaHouse, M.D.[43]
In 2009, the original lineup of Limp Bizkit reunited and began touring. Durst announced that they had begun to record a new album,Gold Cobra.[44]The album was released on June 28, 2011, receiving mixed reviews.[45]It peaked at number 16 on theBillboard200.[36]

Durst is known for regularly wearing a redNew York Yankeesbaseball cap.[70][71][72]
FollowingSlipknotlead vocalistCorey Taylor's (also known as "#8") publicly displayed distaste forKorndrummerDavid Silveria's magazine photo campaign forCalvin Klein, Taylor burned copies of the magazine issues during multiple Slipknot live performances, culminating in Durst taking offense to the gestures. It was rumored that Durst would later make retaliatory comments towardsSlipknot'sfans in the spring of 1999, referring to them as "fat, ugly kids".[73]Durst has denied these comments.[74]Slipknot singer Corey Taylor responded during a February 2000 appearance in Sydney by claiming that the fans of Slipknot "for the most part, enjoy all kinds of music, like Limp Bizkit… maybe." Taylor went on to claim that insulting fans of Slipknot could also be insulting fans of Limp Bizkit.[75]During an interview withVH1in October 2000, Durst praised Slipknot's music, expressing his desire to quell the tension between both sides, telling interviewers, "Man this band is super phat, man; we don't even know them. That's their whole thing, that's their chant, that's their thing, that's cool. Maybe all this hate that's going around the world, that's why I said 'It's all the world has even seen lately'". However, while Taylor responded with praise for Durst's financial ventures, he also attacked Durst's artistic motives and ability, claiming "Fred Durst is a great businessman, but he is not an artist".[76]Despite the hostility between the two bands, they both shared numerous UK festival dates in 2000, with some reports of Durst supporting Slipknot's music.[77][78][79]
The two would find themselves on friendlier terms in 2010, while Limp Bizkit was recording their albumGold Cobra; Durst included lyrics on the album's song "90.2.10" as a shout-out to Taylor: "Corey Taylor got a harem chasin' him around / We ain't slippin' with his knot, then we goin' down".[80]Taylor stated in a live interview in 2011 that Durst's children were allegedly fans of Slipknot.[81]Limp Bizkit was later booked on the 2014 Japanese leg of Slipknot'sKnotfesttour, along with Korn.[82]
In 2021, after the death of ex-Slipknot drummerJoey Jordison, Limp Bizkit paid tribute to him at one of their shows.[83]On May 19, 2024, Limp Bizkit brought Slipknot turntablistSid Wilsonand a fan dressed as Slipknot lead vocalist Corey Taylor on stage during their live performance atSonic Temple Art & Music FestivalinColumbus, Ohio.[84][85]
Durst andBritney Spearswere linked to have written numerous songs for her then-upcoming 2003 albumIn the Zone. At the time Spears was making numerous headlines as reports surfaced of her fractured relationship with former boyfriendJustin Timberlake(with whom Spears had split from in 2002), later linking her with Durst as the two were spotted together on numerous occasions. In response to initial allegations that Spears had engaged in an affair with Durst, Timberlake released the trackCry Me a Riverin November 2002, aimed at Spears. In January 2003, Durst claimed he and Spears were in a relationship stemming from their collaborations on three upcoming tracks for the album. Spears denied the two were in a relationship and said "I'm confused about that whole thing. We worked together for three days and he's a really cool guy, but there's no relationship...He's really sweet."[86]Out of anger at Spears' denial of the affair; Durst scrapped his three songs for Spears' album and leaked the song "Just Drop Dead" on February 18, 2003, through Limp Bizkit's website. The song depicts Durst's vulgar recounting of their alleged relationship. Durst continued to expose numerous sexual encounters between the two during a later appearance onHoward Stern.[87]During a 2009 interview, Durst explained that "I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her."[88]In 2013, Durst later made another derogatory reference aimed at Spears on Limp Bizkit's songReady to Go.[89]
Taproothad been an up-and-coming band fromAnn Arbor,Michigan. In 1998, the band sent their demo to Durst who quickly befriended them, often invited them to various press releases in Los Angeles and occasionally bringing them to Limp Bizkit's concerts throughout the region.[90]During this time; Taproot were simultaneously receiving attention from other labels, notablyArista RecordsandAtlantic Records. Durst was impressed with the band's material and had initially lined up Taproot to land a record contract throughInterscope; however, executives from Interscope proved to be difficult to negotiate with as they wanted the rights to the 3 songs recorded by the band through their demo deal. The band eventually rejected the offer from Interscope and sought to sign with Atlantic Records through their new found friendship withSystem of a Down. Durst was enraged to eventually discover Taproot had defected to Atlantic, leading him to leave a threatening message on frontmanStephen Richards' mother's answering machine.[15]Durst was later alleged to have personally removed System of a Down from the 1999Family Values Touras a retaliatory action.[91][92]
In June 2000, Limp Bizkit performed at theWXRKDysfunctional Family Picnicin Holmdel, New Jersey, but arrived an hour late for their set.[93]An Interscope spokesman later stated that there was confusion over the band's set time.[93]During the band's performance, Durst criticizedCreedand their lead singerScott Stappin a lengthy diatribe before the performance of 'Break Stuff', calling him "an egomaniac".[93]Creed's representatives later presented Durst with an autographed anger management manual following the show, as described by Durst during an appearance onTotal Request Live.[93]
A feud between Limp Bizkit andPlacebobegan at a show Durst was hosting atIrving Plazain December 1998.[94]A side stage spat with Placebo singerBrian Molkoled to Durst asking the crowd to chant "Placebo sucks!" prior to Placebo's performance.[94]Molko later commented that nobody had told him that Durst would be hosting the show and that Placebo would have to follow opening actKid Rock.[95]Prior to introducingStaindas a part of K-Rock's Dysfunctional Family Picnic in Holmdel, New Jersey in 1999, Durst once again encouraged the crowd to chant "Fuck Placebo".[96]The feud was reignited duringBig Day Out2001, on which Placebo were billed below Limp Bizkit.[94]By 2004, the feud had supposedly ended.[97]
Trent ReznorofNine Inch Nailswas noted by Durst as an influence during several interviews. Displeased by Durst's statements, Reznor repeatedly attacked Durst and Limp Bizkit to several interviews in response.[98][99]In a profile forKerrang!, Reznor mocked Durst saying "It's one thing if you know your place; like, 'Hey, I'm an idiot who plays shitty music but people buy it – fuck it, I'm having fun. But it's another thing when you think you'reDavid Bowieafter you've stayed up all night to write a song called 'Break Stuff'. I mean, Fred Durst probably spelt the word 'break' wrong the first couple of times. Fred Durst might be a cool guy; I don't know him. But his 'art' – in the word's loosest sense – sucks."[100]Durst in turn made several references to Nine Inch Nails in the Limp Bizkit song "Hot Dog", leading to Reznor earning a co-writer credit. Reznor said there was no issue, jokingly stating that "When his record was going to print, [Durst] realised 'Fuck, I'd better ask permission first or I might get sued!' I let him do it – I wasn't gonna hold his record up.".[101]
In 1999,Marilyn Mansoninsulted Limp Bizkit and their fans, calling them "illiterate apes that beat your ass in high school for being a 'fag' and now sell you tuneless testosterone anthems of misogyny and pretend to be outsiders...".[102]
Reznor and Manson once again took aim at Durst and Limp Bizkit during a 2000 interview when Manson was asked about his opinion of Nine Inch Nails' recent video for the singleStarfuckers, Inc.in which the two take aim at multiple artists ranging fromBilly Corgan,Michael Stipe, and notably Durst. Manson later exclaimed: "With this video, we didn't wanna seem bitching like about somehow that Limp Bizkit's doing better than we are, in their mind." Reznor later exclaimed; "I don't have to say Limp Bizkit sucks, you know it, I know it, I shouldn't have to say it".[103]
Durst responded to Manson and Reznor's insults: "I understand that Marilyn Manson is very unhappy that his career has gone in a shambles and he's alienated his fans so if he has to say things like that because he's very mad at himself, I would forgive him. And Trent Reznor's in the fucking same boat. Trent Reznor is obviously unhappy with how he's alienated the world, how long he took to make a record, and how he thought he was immortal. We're just here doing what we do and we have nothing to say about anybody. I wish them both luck and I feel sorry that they're so jealous and mad at themselves that they have to talk shit."[102]
Durst's relationship with Manson had reportedly grown cordial as the two appeared on the cover of aRolling Stonemagazine issue in June 2003 alongsideJames HetfieldandOzzy Osbourne.[104]
Despite this, Limp Bizkit guitaristWes Borlandwould join Manson's touring band in 2008. During a show in Seoul, South Korea on August 15, 2008; Manson would introduce Borland onstage and attacked Limp Bizkit, claiming to the crowd "Here's our new guitarist, he used to play for a really bad band…".[105]Borland would depart Manson's touring band after less than nine months.
Due to the notoriety surroundingPuddle of Muddreceiving a record deal through Durst in 2000, the band was often asked in regards to their relationship with him. Wes Scantlin criticized Durst in an interview in 2004 with Canada'sChartmagazine:
"He doesn't write our songs, he doesn't produce our songs, he doesn't do anything for us. He doesn't do our videos anymore. He doesn't do anything for this band. I don't know what he's doing, I don't know what the guy's like. All I know is that he's like Mr Hollywood guy, Mr Celebrity. Like, 'I don't hang out with anybody except Hollywood celebrities'. Every single fucking interview I've ever fucking done, I get asked about that fucking guy... And for me to do interviews all the time and be asked about this certain individual...
