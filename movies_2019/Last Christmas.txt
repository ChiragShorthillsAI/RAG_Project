It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances and chemistry of Clarke and Golding, but criticised the screenplay and story. The film grossed $123 million worldwide.
Young aspiring singer Katarina "Kate" Andrich aimlessly bounces between her friends’ places. She works adead-end jobinCentral Londonas anelfat a year-roundChristmas shop, whose strict but good-hearted owner calls herself "Santa".
Whilst at work, she notices and strikes up a conversation with Tom Webster, a man standing outside the store. After an unsuccessful singing audition, Kate goes for a walk with Tom, who charms her with his unusual observations of London. Upon being evicted by her oldest friend, Kate reluctantly returns home to her parents, both Yugoslavian immigrants. Her mother Petra suffers fromdepression, and her father Ivan, a former lawyer, works as a minicab driver. Kate feels suffocated by her mother, who dotes on her while neglecting Kate's older sister, Marta, a successful lawyer who is alesbianbut hides her sexual orientation from their parents.
Kate spends more time with Tom, who makes deliveries on a bike and volunteers at ahomeless shelter, which she initially mocks. He often disappears for days and says he keeps his phone in a cupboard; looking for him, she begins helping at the shelter. Kate hopes to run into him, but finds that the staff have never met him.
At a celebration for Marta's promotion, Kate spitefullyoutsMarta as a lesbian to their parents. Storming out, she then runs into Tom, who takes her back to his apartment. Kate reveals that, a year earlier, she was seriously ill and had to have aheart transplant. She says she feels half-dead and questions whether she has the talent to make it as a performer. After opening up to Tom, Kate tries to initiatesex. He declines, but gives her a kiss.
Afterward, Kate begins taking small steps to improve her life: taking care of herself, setting up Santa with a Danish man who loves Christmas as much as she does, apologising to Marta and her girlfriend, and singing Christmas songs to busk for money for the shelter. She runs into Tom, who says he has something important to tell her, but she preemptively asserts he is fearful of commitment and walks away.
Kate continues to do good in her daily life. Finally, wanting to make amends with Tom, she returns to his apartment only to meet an estate agent who is holding open house viewings. He explains that the place has been vacant during theprobateprocess.
After some initial confusion, he reveals that the previous owner was killed in a bicycle accident last Christmas, and Kate realises that Tom was theorgan donorwhose heart she received. Going to the small garden, Tom's favourite place, Kate encounters him again and realises he is aghost. He says his heart "was always going to be yours one way or another" and asks her to look after it. The bench on which they sat on their visits to the garden is revealed to be his memorial bench.
On Christmas Eve, Kate organises a show utilising the talents of the people at the shelter and invites her friends and family, including Santa and her Danish admirer, along with the real estate agent she met at Tom’s apartment. Kate delicately performs a solo of theWham!song, "Last Christmas", and revelry ensues when the curtain rises, and she is joined by the band of shelter performers. The next day, Kate and her family celebrate Christmas, joined by Marta's girlfriend Alba for the first time.
The Christmas celebration transitions to summer, where a visibly healthier Kate is seen writing in her diary on Tom’s memorial bench in the garden. Smiling, Kate looks up, as Tom always encouraged her to do.
